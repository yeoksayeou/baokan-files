### Ways to Break the Current Stalemate: The Government Still Advocates Peaceful Negotiation - President Chiang's National Day Address to the Compatriots

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] President Chiang broadcast to the nation at 8 PM tonight via the Central Broadcasting Station for the 35th National Day anniversary. The original text is as follows:

Fellow countrymen,

Today marks the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. It is also the first National Day celebration since the end of the War of Resistance and the return of the government to the capital. Looking back at the hardships endured by the Founding Father and revolutionary martyrs in establishing the Republic, commemorating the heroic deeds of the military and civilians during the War of Resistance, and looking forward to the future of unified peace and construction, while reflecting on how hard-won yet easily lost national independence and ethnic freedom are, all of us compatriots should work diligently, encourage each other, continue to move forward, implement the teachings of the Founding Father, accomplish the aspirations of the martyrs, build a modern country based on the Three Principles of the People, and achieve the goals of a prosperous and happy Republic of China.

The Founding Father once said, "Building a house cannot be sloppy, and neither can building a nation. One must have an extremely firm spirit and carry it out with extremely patient strength." Thirty-five years have passed since the Xinhai Revolution. Compared to the past, our national revolutionary cause has been advancing. However, the distance to the final success of the national revolution is still very far. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, completed the Northern Expedition, and achieved the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance, we have defeated the aggressive power of Japan, wiped away the national humiliation of the past fifty years, recovered the territory of Taiwan, and regained sovereignty over the Northeast. We have also abolished the unequal treaties that had bound us for a century and established the foundation for friendly cooperation with countries around the world. These are all significant achievements of the national revolution, which are sufficient to comfort the spirits of the

Founding Father and revolutionary martyrs in heaven. The ability of our National Government to concentrate the will of all compatriots and combine their strength to overcome the national difficulties that were superimposed on each other, and to overcome the crisis of internal and external troubles, in order to achieve the final victory of the War of Resistance, proves that the National Government's policy of revolutionary nation-building conforms to the wishes of all compatriots. Today, as we review the achievements of the past, we must continue to strive together to safeguard the independence and freedom of the nation, and especially to consistently implement the teachings of the Founding Father's Three Principles of the People, so that our China can become an independent, unified, strong, and democratic country and a pillar of peace in the Far East. The Founding Father said, "The creator of the Republic of China has the goal of peace." Today, as we commemorate the Xinhai Revolution, we must repeat these words.

On this day last year, I explained that the work ahead is "Nation-Building First." On New Year's Day this year, I again explained to my compatriots the necessity of national unity and political democracy. Unfortunately, everything has not been realized as expected in the past ten months. Until now, turmoil and disturbances have not ceased. All of my compatriots are indirectly suffering from the pain of a country that cannot be peaceful, a society that cannot be stable, and a life that is not guaranteed. This is truly infinitely painful. How should we stabilize the foundation of our country? How should we bring the current abnormal state into the right track? I want to take this opportunity to sincerely inform my fellow countrymen.

### The Basic Conditions for Nation-Building Lie in the Unification of Military and Political Orders

The goal of our national revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People and establish an equal, independent, and free Republic of China. The basic conditions for nation-building are national unity and social stability. If social order cannot be stabilized, the lives and property of the people cannot be guaranteed, agricultural and industrial production will naturally have no way to develop, and the living standards of the people will have no way to improve. At the same time, if national unity cannot be consolidated, internal strife will inevitably occur frequently, the foundation of democracy will naturally be impossible to establish, and the cause of nation-building will have no way to begin. Therefore, the government's current policy towards the current situation is to ensure national unity first and to seek unity through peaceful means. We know that the minimum conditions for national unity are the unification of military and political orders. To achieve the unification of military orders, we must implement the nationalization of the military and establish a national army. To achieve the unification of political orders, the laws and regulations of the country must be able to be implemented throughout the country, eliminating local separatism. If there are two opposing armies in one country, and the local politics form a separatist situation, then it cannot be called a unified country. Therefore, today, to strive for peace, we must consolidate national unity. It can be said that without unity, there is no peace in China today, and unity is the only condition for peace. If this condition is denied or destroyed, it will not only prolong the suffering of the people, but also lead to the demise of the country. This is the key to the vital interests and lives of every person, and it is also the inescapable responsibility of the government. The government cannot turn a blind eye to rebellions that hinder unity and attempt to split the country, and all compatriots cannot stand idly by and watch the disasters that endanger the national lifeline and destroy the lives of the people, placing the country and nation in a situation from which it cannot recover.

The Government is Willing to Make Concessions and Show Restraint to Seek Unity

However, the government still insists on seeking a solution to the current domestic political problems through political means. This policy will never change, because we cannot bear to destroy the fruits of our victory in the War of Resistance with our own hands, we cannot allow the suffering of the people after the war to deepen, and we must not allow the opportunity for peaceful nation-building to be frustrated and delayed. Therefore, in the past year, the government has done its best, making any concessions and showing any restraint, always aiming to seek national unity, avoid conflict, and jointly discuss national affairs. The convocation of the Political Consultative Conference was aimed at this. The recent statements made by the government have also focused on this. No matter how severe the domestic turmoil and disputes are, as long as there is a glimmer of hope for a peaceful solution, the government will never abandon the path of peace. The peaceful path to achieving national unity today is to nationalize the military and democratize politics. How to achieve political democratization is to convene a National Assembly and expand the government organization, so that the government can fulfill its desire to return power to the people, and the people can have the opportunity to exercise political power. How to achieve the nationalization of the military is to follow the established plan for military reorganization and consolidation, divide military regions, stipulate schedules, and implement them within a time limit, so that no party or faction can use force for political struggle in the future. Only in this way can our China become a truly unified and democratic country.

Requesting all Parties and Factions to Participate in the National Assembly

What the government asks of all parties and factions today is to participate in the National Government and attend the National Assembly. What it asks of the Communist Party is only to abandon its attempts to seize territory by force and split the country, and to participate in the National Assembly with all parties and factions. The realization of this step is an established case agreed upon by all parties and factions, and it is also the unanimous demand of all compatriots. It is hoped that all parties and factions will submit the list of members of the National Government and representatives to the National Assembly as scheduled, so that the National Government can be reorganized as soon as possible, and the National Assembly can be completed as scheduled.

What I want to explain to my compatriots in particular now is the issue of ceasing military conflicts. This has always been the consistent goal of our government, and what the government hopes for is a comprehensive and permanent cessation of conflicts. The Military Tripartite Conference in June was originally aimed at discussing the restoration of transportation and the determination of troop positions, in order to realize the guarantee of ceasing conflicts. However, it was stalled due to the Communist Party's insistence on its own opinions. In order to achieve lasting peace, I have made several suggestions in the past three months, hoping that the Communist Party would accept them, but they were all rejected. Later, they asked to immediately convene a meeting of the Military Tripartite Group chaired by General Marshall, but due to the experience of past facts, if an agreement and understanding on several major basic issues are not reached first, the reopening of the Tripartite Conference will inevitably be of no avail. Therefore, I firmly support the convening of a Five-Person Conference centered on Ambassador Stuart first, so that the government and the Chinese Communist Party can reach an agreement on the issue of organizing the National Government Committee, to show their sincerity in jointly abiding by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and to use this as a basis for obtaining the implementation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. After this sincerity and basis are established, new mutual trust and mutual assistance can be obtained. I also advocate that at the same time as the cessation of conflicts is announced, the Chinese Communist Party should submit a list of its representatives to the National Assembly to be convened on November 12, to show its sincerity in cooperating with the government. If it could have proceeded in this way at that time, I believe that the cessation of conflicts would have been realized long ago.

### President's Broadcast Recorded

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] On the eve of National Day, President Chiang broadcast to the nation from his office at the Huangpu Road official residence. The broadcasting station installed recording equipment in advance. During the President's broadcast, he appeared very happy. After the sound recording was completed, the President listened to it once and expressed great satisfaction.

### Simultaneous Convocation of the Five-Person and Three-Person Conferences to Facilitate Agreement on Military and Political Affairs

Now, the Communist Party has neither accepted the two proposals put forward by the government on October 2 regarding the reorganization of the National Government and the implementation of the military reorganization plan, nor has it rejected the ceasefire proposal made by General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. However, the government does not give up the policy of peaceful resolution because of this. The government still hopes to seek a solution through mediation and negotiation. We cannot allow the current political and military situation in our country to continue to develop, deepening the suffering of the people. Furthermore, in view of the current tense situation and the general anxiety caused by the lack of understanding of government policies, I solemnly declare on this National Day that the way to break the current stalemate is still to use peaceful negotiation to seek a solution to several basic issues. Once the following issues are agreed upon, the government is prepared to issue an order to cease conflicts immediately. I advocate that the Five-Person Conference and the Three-Person Conference should be convened simultaneously. First, the Five-Person Group Conference should discuss the reorganization of the National Government. Second, the Three-Person Group Conference should resolve issues related to the implementation of the military reorganization and consolidation plan. Once an agreement is reached, as long as the Communist Party can cease its military actions and no longer attack the National Army, the government will immediately issue an order to cease conflicts. The above is the government's policy for handling the current situation. For the sake of the future of the country and for the sake of the people's interests, this is the only practical and feasible way to achieve peaceful unification. In short, the government never gives up the expectation of open and sincere negotiations with the Communist Party under any circumstances. As long as the Communist Party takes the national lifeline and the people's lives as its priority, eliminates prejudices, understands the government's difficulties, and implements the above methods, then not only can the cessation of conflicts be realized immediately, but the work of peaceful nation-building can also be achieved smoothly without any obstacles.

Fellow countrymen, our victory in the eight-year War of Resistance in the past was due to the unanimous unity and persevering struggle of all our compatriots from beginning to end. In the future, the great cause of nation-building will still require all our compatriots to uphold firm confidence, follow definite steps, practice diligently, never give up, promote the implementation of the Five-Power Constitution, ensure the completion of the Three Principles of the People, and especially to unite in one mind and take on our responsibilities together, consolidate national unity, stabilize social order, establish a foundation for peace, and complete the great cause of nation-building, so that we can carry out the will of the Founding Father and not be ashamed of the heroic souls of the revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians who sacrificed in the War of Resistance. (End)

### Minister Peng's Speech

The Government Still Hopes to Continue Negotiations

The Communist Party's Intentions Are Difficult to Fathom

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Foreign reporters' reception. Held at 3:30 PM on the 9th, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei. The following is a record of Minister Peng's answers to questions from reporters:

Q: It is heard that the Chinese Communist Party has rejected the proposal for a ten-day ceasefire. What is the government's attitude?

A: The government's position has been seen in Premier Soong's speech. The Communist Party's intentions are difficult to fathom. It has rejected negotiations on the reorganization of the National Government, and it has also rejected discussions on resolving military issues to permanently eliminate conflict. Now, it has rejected the proposal for a ten-day ceasefire. All of these were constantly requested by the Chinese Communist Party. When the government accepted them, the Chinese Communist Party rejected them instead. Observers say that it is adopting a policy of obstruction and does not sincerely want to resolve the issue to help create a unified situation. Its actions make it impossible for people not to doubt it. The government's policy, as stated by Premier Soong, is still to hope that negotiations will continue in order to seek a peaceful resolution.

Q: How many miles are the National Army from Zhangjiakou?

A: The National Army entered Bei on the 8th, about eighty Chinese miles from Zhangjiakou.

Q: Does the government still intend to convene the National Assembly on November 12 and reorganize the government?

A: The government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12. Because the postponement has been several times, if it is postponed again, it may be difficult for the people to bear it, which may cause them to doubt the government's determination to implement constitutional government. As for the reorganization of the government, it has been hindered by the Chinese Communist Party's rejection of negotiations.

Q: What is the military situation in Northern Jiangsu and the Northeast?

A: The National Army in Northern Jiangsu has entered Gao-. Baoying. In the Northeast, the Communist Army has taken some actions to coordinate with the Northern Army inside the Pass, but they are not worth mentioning. The Communist Army's base area between Dolun and Chengde has fallen into the hands of the National Army. Shandong has recovered Xian and Zaozhuang. Zaozhuang is a coal mining center, but the machinery has been dismantled, which is deeply regrettable. This kind of action only harms the people in the mining area and strikes at the industry in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.

### Marshall Made a Trip to Shanghai Yesterday to Visit Zhou Enlai, the Content of the Conversation is Unknown, the China Democratic League's Liang Shuming Proposed Another Compromise Plan

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Conner, a press officer at the US Embassy, announced on the 9th that Special Envoy Marshall flew to Shanghai by special plane at 9 AM on the 9th to meet with General Zhou Enlai and returned to Beijing at 6 PM that afternoon.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Special Envoy Ma went to Shanghai on the 9th specifically to invite Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing to participate in peace talks. It is learned that Zhou Enlai has refused to return to Beijing, and the government is studying the next step.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Peace negotiations have become a thread hanging by a thread. Special Envoy Ma made a trip to Shanghai on the 9th, and his efforts and painstaking efforts in mediation can be seen from this. On the morning of the 9th, Liang Shuming of the China Democratic League visited Special Envoy Stuart for a long talk. Liang then went to the Senate to visit Lei Zhen, and after leaving, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Wang Shijie. It is reported that Liang has proposed a compromise plan that both sides can accept, but the content is kept secret by all parties. According to Liang, this is a new path beyond the three-person and five-person conferences, but it is not yet time to publish it. In addition, Yu Dawei visited Special Envoy Stuart at 11:20 AM and talked for an hour. Fu Jingbo visited Premier Soong at 11:30 AM. At 6:30 PM, Premier Soong visited Special Envoy Stuart and talked for an hour, and then went to Special Envoy Ma's residence, leaving at 9 PM. Judging from the meetings of all parties, it is possible that there will be developments soon. It is rumored that Special Envoy Stuart will publish a document on the 10th, but the content has not been learned. When the reporter asked the Chinese Communist Party about its attitude towards Premier Soong's statement, it was said that the Chinese Communist Party had two points of view: (1) The Chinese Communist Party agreed in the past to participate in the informal Five-Person Conference to ensure that a ceasefire would be implemented after the discussion of the reorganization of the government was considered to have results. However, the US side and the government did not obtain this guarantee. Therefore, this caused the government to refuse the guarantee, not the Communist Party to refuse to participate. The Communist Party confirmed that it was impossible to talk about reorganizing the government while fighting a civil war. (2) No notification was received about the proposal to hold the Three-Person and Five-Person Conferences together, so there was no response, not a rejection. A spokesman for the Communist Party believed that Premier Zhu's statement had no basis in fact. The spokesman also reiterated his hope in response to Special Envoy Ma's statement on the 8th that the mediator would have a fair plan that could be accepted by both the government and the Communist Party, so that there would be major developments in the future of peace.

### Zhou Enlai Criticizes Marshall's Statement in a Reception for Reporters

[Associated Press, this city, 9th] Zhou Enlai hosted the press here tonight, criticizing the statement issued yesterday by Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, saying that some points were inconsistent with the facts, and disclosed that he had submitted eleven suggestions to President Chiang to implement the agreements negotiated in Chongqing in January and February. When asked to confirm the rumor that Special Envoy Ma flew to Shanghai today to persuade him to go to Beijing to reopen peace talks, but was rejected, causing Special Envoy Ma to return to Beijing alone, Zhou said, "No comment."

[Our newspaper] Chen Jiakang, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, issued the following statement on the joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si: (1) Before the joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si was issued yesterday (the 8th), the Chinese Communist Party was not notified. Even at 4 PM that afternoon, after the statement was issued, when Dong Biwu, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, was invited to meet with Special Envoys Ma and Si, the two Special Envoys did not inform him of the issuance of the statement. As for the three points of the Chinese Communist Party's reply conveyed orally by Wang Bingnan, they were not corrected before being published. (2) The original text of the suggestions delivered by Special Envoys Ma and Si to Wang Bingnan on October 6 clearly stated that the ten-day suspension of the attack on Zhangjiakou was conditional, that is, for the purpose of implementing (To Carry Out) Chairman Chiang's two requests on October 2. Therefore, the joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si avoided publishing the original text of the suggestions. (3) The joint statement of Special Envoys Ma and Si confirmed that the method of delaying the attack on Zhangjiakou for ten days was proposed by Special Envoys Ma and Si. This was nothing more than a delaying tactic for the government, forcing the Chinese Communist Party to surrender under the city.

Yesterday, it was widely rumored that Zhou Enlai was preparing to go to Beijing, but the Zhou Gongguan in Shanghai said that they knew nothing about it.

Over the past eight years, we have conscripted tens of millions of soldiers and finally achieved final victory, restoring our land and rejoicing the entire nation. On the day of the victory of the War of Resistance, in order to allow the people to rest, we issued an order to the entire country to suspend conscription for one year. However, in order to establish a nation today, we must consolidate our national defense to survive, and we must implement a conscription system to enrich our national strength. During this period of suspension, we have revised the original conscription laws and regulations and re-established the divisional and regimental districts, focusing on the needs of national defense, and determined the peacetime conscription system to continue handling conscription affairs. All our citizens must know that serving in the military is a duty that everyone should fulfill, and implementing a conscription system is the only way to build a strong nation. As the suspension period has expired, we will resume conscription starting from October 10th of this year. Those who are required to serve according to the law must strive hard, enthusiastically enlist, thereby establishing a military foundation and consolidating national defense. We have high hopes for this." This is the order.

### Mrs. Cripps Arrives in Nanjing - Pays Respects at the Mausoleum and Visits Various Scenic Spots Today - Attends Cocktail Party Hosted by the Chairman and His Wife in the Evening

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 9th] Mrs. Cripps and her daughter, at 3:35 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, arrived in Nanjing on the Meiling special plane that went to pick them up, landing at Ming Palace Airport. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs arranged the national flags of China and Britain at the airport, as well as a large banner welcoming Mrs. Cripps, which was solemn and eye-catching. Those who went to the airport to welcome her included British Ambassador Stevenson and his wife, British Prime Minister's representative to China Wyatt, our Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and his wife, Hang Liwu of the Sino-British Cultural Association, Director of Protocol of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Li Zhou, Secretary-General Shao and his wife, Mayor Ma and his wife, Li Ganghong of the Municipal Women's Association, President Wu Yifang of Ginling Women's College, and more than 200 student representatives. As soon as the plane door opened, the band played the British national anthem. Mrs. Cripps paused briefly and then got off the plane with a smile. Mrs. Cripps was wearing a blue-based white checkered dress, a silk scarf, black flat leather shoes, a small leather bag, a light gray hat, and silver-white short hair fluttering around the edge of the hat. She was very tall. After Mrs. Cripps got off the plane, she stood respectfully for a few minutes, listening to the music of the British national anthem and the Chinese national anthem. Mayor Ma and his wife were the first to step forward to deliver a welcome speech. Mrs. Cripps replied: "Nanjing is a world-famous city, and I am very honored to be here." She then shook hands with the people who came to greet her. Chen Yi, a student representative from Ginling Women's College, presented a bouquet of flowers. Mrs. Cripps was then surrounded by reporters and signed for our newspaper reporter, answering questions from reporters as follows:

Q: What are your impressions of this visit? A: Very pleasant! Q: How long will you be staying in China? A: Six weeks. Q: Do you plan to go to the Northeast? Mrs. Cripps replied sideways: "I will have a formal statement." Q: Will you be holding a press conference? A: "I may have a formal statement." Then Madame Chiang drove up, and Mrs. Cripps went to the front of the car. After the car door was opened, Mrs. Cripps got into the car and immediately left the airport. At 8:00 PM, she attended a banquet hosted by the British Ambassador and his wife, with Foreign Minister Wang and his wife, President Sun, General Wyatt, and others accompanying her. Mrs. Cripps is staying at the first dormitory of the Executive Yuan. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, she will pay respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and visit places such as the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and the Tan Cemetery. At noon, Mayor Ma and his wife will host a luncheon. From 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, she will visit Xuanwu Lake and other places. From 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM in the afternoon, she will attend a cocktail party hosted by the Chairman and his wife to entertain foreign guests.

Mrs. Cripps' Statement

[Central News Agency Nanjing dispatch of the 9th] Mrs. Cripps issued the following statement after arriving in Nanjing: "Today, on the occasion of your country's National Day, my staff and I join you in celebrating, and we are especially honored to have arrived safely in your country at this time to witness this grand event. We are grateful for the arrangements made by the Chinese government for our trip to China, and for the British government's kindness in sending a plane to take us to Hong Kong. Our journey has been very comfortable, and we are sure to have an even more enjoyable time during our stay in China. In the future, as we wish to broaden our knowledge, we will be visiting various places and will have no spare time, especially for various projects assisted by British aid to China, which we will pay special attention to. We are sincerely in awe of being able to celebrate this grand event with the people of your country today and commemorate the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and we have high hopes for the future of your country and dare to guarantee that the British people will do their best to help your country's bright future."

### A Brief Biography of Mrs. Cripps

"The journey is long and far,

But good intentions are hard to resist.

Hundreds of millions of people remember,

Eagerly awaiting with open arms."

—Poem presented by Ambassador Zheng to the UK

Mrs. Cripps has come to China. She is the president of the British United Aid to China Fund. This organization brings together many enthusiastic people who respect and sympathize with China, and under Mrs. Cripps' leadership, has given the Chinese people who suffered during the war much warm friendship and much material and spiritual encouragement.

Mrs. Cripps' husband, Sir Stafford Cripps, is a leading figure in the British Labour Party and the author of the famous "Cripps Plan" for India. In 1940, when the Labour Party was not yet in power, he visited China as a Member of Parliament and delivered several speeches in Chongqing. After returning home, he wrote down the suffering of the Chinese people in the long war, based on what he had seen and heard. These accounts greatly moved Mrs. Cripps, arousing her deep understanding and concern for the Chinese people.

At that time, many British non-governmental organizations that sympathized with China wanted to unite and concentrate their efforts to do some work that would benefit the Chinese people. In June 1942, the United Aid to China Fund was finally established under such demands. Mrs. Cripps was the most active person in promoting this organization, and under unanimous election, she became the president of the United Aid to China Fund. She made radio appeals on the wireless, urging everyone to tighten their belts and donate money to help the Chinese people. At the same time, she wrote to members of Congress and people's organizations in various countries, asking them to unite and help promote this work. The Labour Party also provided special assistance, contacting various trade unions and industrial cooperative organizations to support the progress of her cause.

Due to such widespread response, the United Aid to China Fund raised a considerable sum of money before the Double Tenth National Day that year and remitted it to Madame Chiang, mainly for the relief of Chinese war orphans and wounded soldiers. Since then, fundraising has continued to this day, and the funds remitted to China have reached more than 1.8 million British pounds. The donations received by the United Aid to China Fund came from all over the United Kingdom, as well as from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. The letters from those donors fully expressed their infinite admiration and sympathy for China. The office of the London United Aid to China Fund keeps many such letters.

Because of Mrs. Cripps' great achievements in presiding over the United Aid to China Fund, the British King specially awarded her a GBE medal this year on New Year's Day. This is the highest medal awarded by the British government to women who have made meritorious contributions to the country. Although Mrs. Cripps has always been an enthusiastic China lover, and she often likes to talk about the East with her friends, she has only been to the Soviet Union herself and has never been to China. This time, she is visiting the country she has always thought of for the first time. I wonder if what we can give her will be joy or disappointment?

Also accompanying Mrs. Cripps this time is Mrs. Miller, who is also one of the founders of the United Aid to China Fund, a well-known social worker. She is now the secretary of the United Aid to China Fund. She has presided over most of the administrative work of the United Aid to China Fund for several years and is also Mrs. Cripps' main assistant.

### Siamese Chinese Steel Rails Diverted to Southern Country - No Guarantee of Repayment from the South - Promise Not to Transfer Railway Accessories to Others

[United Press International Washington, 8th] Chen Zhimao, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, stated: Officials from the State Department assured the Chinese Embassy that all steel rails designated for China by UNRRA that are diverted to Yugoslavia will be fully repaid with steel rails designated for Yugoslavia. Counselor Chen said: "Diverting famine-relief steel rails to other countries will certainly affect our country's economic recovery efforts, but he also said that steel rails are not as important as accessories such as screw needles, screw sleeves, and spikes needed when laying rails, and the State Department has also promised that these difficult-to-obtain items will not be transferred to others, because without these accessories, the steel rails cannot be used. He hopes that the US government will immediately withdraw the order to stop the transportation of such items to China, because the Chinese Minister of Communications recently informed officials of the Chinese Embassy that there are currently many warehouses that can store steel rails, and a large number of steel rails have been stored in Shanghai, waiting for the transportation of laying rail accessories for application. He also said: "Our assumption is that restoring transportation is the key to solving China's recovery problem. The State Department has assured us that China will not suffer losses in this regard, and it is now time to re-consider the embargo order."

### Most of the Japanese Compensation is for Heavy Industry - We Will Carry Out Demolition and Relocation Soon - Remarks After the Return of the Delegation to Japan to Nanjing

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 9th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at the auditorium of the Central Daily News at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th and invited Wu Wenzao, Wu Bannong, Xu Yiqiao, and Xiang Zhexun, members of the delegation to Japan who had recently returned to China, to attend and answer questions for reporters. The details are as follows: (1) The delegation to Japan is divided into four groups: 1. Military, 2. Political, social and economic research, 3. Economic compensation for trade with Japan, 4. Education and culture. The amount of compensation is very large, mostly for heavy industry, military industry, arsenals, aircraft equipment, manufacturing plants, thermal power plants, machine tool bearing factories, shipyards, etc. We have fought the longest and suffered the most. Assuming that we can receive 30% of the total amount, then 4 million tons of equipment will be transported here. Our country will carry out demolition and relocation work, but it can only be moved to the Japanese coast. Negotiations are currently underway to move it to our country, but there are no results yet. (2) Regarding the situation of Japanese textile factories, their pre-war spindle count was very large, but after suspension and destruction, there were also many losses. Currently, 2.46 million spindles have been repaired, and 1.2 million spindles are being repaired. MacArthur has set this number as the maximum limit for the development of the Japanese textile industry (China currently has 4 million spindles). (3) Japanese political parties had parties but no power before the surrender. Only after the surrender were they able to obtain freedom of activity. By October last year, there were more than 200 large and small parties. Now, after elimination, there are only five or six major parties left. The Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the Socialist Party are relatively powerful, and the Communist Party is the weakest.

Editorial

### Forcing a Smile to Celebrate National Day

It has been more than a full year since the victory, and the second National Day after the victory has unexpectedly passed in a depressing atmosphere. Everyone who saw the national flags of the Republic of China flying all over the streets and cities was smiling on the surface, but sighing in their hearts! Perhaps we didn't understand the taste of "forcing a smile" before, but today, as we celebrate National Day, we are all carrying heavy hearts. We can still hear the sounds of fighting on the battlefield, and we originally hoped that there would be an order for a ceasefire in Zhangjiakou, and the comforting news of the reopening of peace talks, to decorate this Double Tenth National Day, but now they have all turned into dreams! Despite Chairman Chiang's earnest radio instructions, and the government's clear announcement that it still hopes to continue negotiations, the Chinese Communists have been fickle and still refuse to participate in peace talks, which ultimately prevents the people from having a peaceful National Day. We can only force a smile today, and we really owe it to the Chinese Communists!

On last year's National Day, not long after the victory, three or four million citizens of Shanghai celebrated to their hearts' content, with extreme enthusiasm, truly a scene of "everyone in the streets, as if drunk or in a dream." How time flies, and how many feelings arise! The joyous faces of last year have probably all turned into sad faces this year! Even if they are not all frowning, at least they all feel dull and lackluster! We fought hard for eight years and finally won, which was originally glorious, and should have been shining brightly; but this deserved glory has been burned black by the flames of "liberation" and "struggle" by troublemakers.

Originally, peace was the only way out for China's post-war nation-building, and the only way to achieve peace was for both the government and the Chinese Communists to be sincere and show each other their sincerity. Peace talks, peace talks, have been talked about for a year and still cannot achieve peace. The crux of the problem is the lack of this word "sincerity"; even if it is not that both sides are insincere, at least one side is not sincere. "Without sincerity, there is nothing," so what results can we hope for! But today, the Chinese Communists do not blame themselves for their insincerity, but instead blame the mediator for being biased. Nothing in the world is more bizarre than this. In fact, what does China's affairs have to do with the United States? The reason why American friends are so enthusiastic about acting as Lu Zhonglian is nothing more than hoping for a peaceful world, where humanity will no longer fight a third world war. But judging from the style of the Chinese Communists, it seems that they are determined to create a divided situation in China, in order to provide this continent as a battlefield in a future third world war. As we encounter our disaster-ridden National Day on the stage where the Chinese Communists are deliberately playing this kind of drama, how can we truly laugh from the bottom of our hearts?

National Day is a joyous occasion. "When people are happy, their spirits are refreshed," but this year, when we encounter National Day, we only feel depressed and may not be able to turn our tears into smiles. The government has allowed a ten-day ceasefire, but the Chinese Communists still refuse to negotiate. What is the reason for this? According to a United Press International dispatch from Nanjing, people now believe that the Chinese Communists are actually trying to promote a joint mediation by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and are especially focused on the Soviet Union. If this is the case, then the reason why the Chinese Communists have repeatedly changed their demands, and even made new demands after the previous demands have been met, but have always refused to participate in peace talks, is nothing more than to express their distrust of Marshall, force Marshall to return home, and replace the United States with the Soviet Union as they wish. This method of having no sincerity of one's own and hoping for a change of mediator is just a delaying tactic in the process of the Chinese Communists' attempt to divide China, and is not worth our surprise.

However, speaking of mediation, whether it can be successful still depends on whether both parties involved have the seeds of sincerity, and has nothing to do with the mediator. The greatest ability of the mediator is only to try to inspire the potential sincerity of both parties. If neither party, or one party, has any sincerity in reconciliation at all, then even if you change a hundred mediators, it will be of no avail. It is said that when Lu Longqi was the magistrate of Pinghu, there were two brothers who were in dispute over property and were involved in litigation. Lu Sheng堂, put the lawsuit aside, first pointed to the younger brother and asked the elder brother, "Who is he to you?" The elder brother said, "Is he my younger brother?" Lu said, "Why don't you try calling him!" The elder brother obeyed and called out "Brother." Lu again instructed the younger brother in the same way, and the younger brother also obeyed and called out "Older brother." Lu pretended to be nonchalant, but instructed them to call out again in the same way. The brothers in the dispute called out like this dozens of times, and suddenly hugged each other and cried bitterly, unanimously applying to give up the property and end the lawsuit. Lu then kindly persuaded them, closed the case, and left the court. A lawsuit was thus concluded. These two brothers were initially blinded by a selfish thought, and entered litigation because of the dispute. Once they discovered their conscience, they hugged each other and cried bitterly, and the violent atmosphere turned into auspicious harmony. From this, we can know that if the two sides in a dispute cannot be reconciled, there is no need to blame the mediator. They should first reflect on themselves and dig up their own conscience.

Although there are rumors that Marshall may return home, Marshall and Stuart both said that they will still do their best if there is room for it. This spirit of knowing that it cannot be done but doing it is truly admirable. We believe that these two old men of peace are qualified to be Lu Longqi, and we also believe that thousands of Chinese people are qualified to be Lu Longqi, and there is no need to bother with changing mediators. But I wonder if the Chinese Communists, after the government has called them "brother" a few times, are willing to call back a few times "older brother," and once they can also hug each other and cry bitterly, release their soldiers and make peace, so that after we have spent this depressed and worried National Day, we will actually receive happy news from the sky? We hope that the miracle of Lu Longqi in the Pinghu County hall can ultimately appear on the Chinese political stage at this time and in this place.

### Changshu Japanese Military Police Captain's Heinous Crimes Confirmed: Piles of White Bones Unearthed Beneath Mount Yu, Loyal Remains Sought Amidst Sun-Drenched Wasteland, Military Tribunal Comforts Loyal Souls

— By Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] On July 9, 1943, Taicang, a land of fish and rice in Jiangsu Province, suffered an unprecedented calamity under the iron heel of the Japanese invaders. A group of murderous devils, the Changshu Japanese Military Police and the Taicang Japanese Military Police, dispatched a large force and, under trumped-up charges, arrested more than fifty patriotic youths and innocent civilians within Taicang.

Roll of Twenty-Two Loyal Souls

These more than fifty people were all taken to the Changshu Japanese Military Police station, where they were subjected to all kinds of abuse, torture, and coercion. It was not until December of that year, after repeated requests from the puppet Taicang County Magistrate Tang Jianxun to the Military Police Captain Yonemura Haruki, that some thirty-odd people were released. The remaining twenty-two people, whose names are Wu Yucang, Hu Jiadong, Yu Zifan, Wen Xingwu, Ye Zhenxi, Wang Xueliang, Lu Xiaoyun, Shen Hongyi, Wang Zhaoyi, Yang Yuntian, Xu Renda, Xu Rongrang, Hu Zhengqing, Jin Zhongshan, Zheng Shushi, Huang Baoliang, Qian Xinyi, Dai Jiaxiang, Jin Jianyong, Wei Guangzhao, Chen Tianliang, and Gu Xixi, regrettably disappeared from this world, their whereabouts unknown. Undoubtedly, they had long been brutally murdered by those demons. However, the most appalling thing was that the demons even destroyed the bodies and refused to leave the ashes for their families. Whenever family members went to inquire about their whereabouts, they always gave vague answers, saying either that they had been transferred to Nanjing or Shanghai, or that they had fallen ill and been sent to the hospital. Sadly, under their clutches, they could only swallow their grievances and shed tears, and until now, the remains of their loved ones are still unknown.

Investigating Without Reservations

Victory came, and the Changshu Japanese Military Police Captain Yonemura Haruki, who had committed all kinds of evil deeds, was finally arrested by the authorities and tried by the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone. However, after several interrogations, the cunning Yonemura, apart from admitting that he had sent seventeen people, including Wang Xueliang, to the Military Tribunal of the Japanese 13th Army in Shanghai to be executed, insisted that Wu Yucang, Hu Jiadong, Yu Zifan, Wen Xingwu, and Ye Zhenxi died of illness in the county hospital at the time.

Did these five people actually go to the county hospital? If they did, what were their conditions? What was the treatment process like? If they recovered, how were they discharged? If they died, where are their bodies? These points are crucial and necessary for sentencing. Therefore, the Military Tribunal specially sent the Chief Clerk of the Tribunal, Li Ye, to Changshu to conduct a thorough on-the-spot investigation.

Mr. Li went to Suzhou last Thursday, but turned back halfway due to flooding on the highway. He went again the day before yesterday. Upon hearing this, the reporter obtained Mr. Li's consent to travel with him in the same car.

The "Victory" bus took us to Suzhou early in the morning. We transferred to a car and arrived in Changshu around ten o'clock. This is a quiet and peaceful city, with small bridges, flowing water, white walls, and black tiles, still retaining some ancient charm. The local leisure class still spends their time in tea houses listening to storytellers.

Finding Clues Through Circuitous Inquiries

After getting off the car, we immediately went to visit the County Magistrate. The location of the County Government was the former site of the Military Police Station. Unfortunately, as soon as we stepped into the gate, we saw a sign that read "County Magistrate on Official Business." It turned out that the County Magistrate had gone to Yangcheng Lake. A Secretary Ye received us. After Chief Li submitted the official documents and explained the purpose of our visit, Secretary Ye, because he was from Guangdong and had only recently taken office, was not very familiar with the local situation. He then asked Gao Caizuo, a supervisor in the County Government, to be our guide.

Supervisor Gao is truly a typical sincere and enthusiastic gentleman. He accompanied us throughout the day, searching for clues. Without his help, our work would have been much more difficult. Our main task was to investigate the county hospital during the enemy puppet period, but this hospital had long been disbanded. The only clue was the current public hospital.

Dr. Yu Jishi, the director of the public hospital, is a very thin man with severe nearsightedness. He strongly agreed with our purpose but expressed his inability to help. He hung up his own sign as a doctor during the occupation period, so he was not clear about the situation of the county hospital. He said that the last two directors of the county hospital were Zhang Xia and Jin Shaozhou. The former's whereabouts are currently unknown. The latter was once detained after the victory for selling public property of the hospital, but it is unknown how he was released and where he is now hiding. The atrocities committed by Yonemura in Changshu were indeed countless. He often killed people at midnight, tied them up and took them to the wilderness outside the North Gate, either stabbing them to death with bayonets or smearing them with beef and letting wolves and dogs devour them, so there was no way to find the remains. In disappointment, we still insisted on asking him for help, asking if there were any doctors, nurses, or even janitors or tea servers who had worked in the county hospital at that time who we could interview. He closed his eyes and thought for a while, finally telling us a name and an address, which was the wife of the former director Zhang Xia, the obstetrician Ye Zhen.

A Clerk's Episode

After leaving the public hospital, local reporters actually got the news and rushed to interview us. For the convenience of my work, I have always maintained the identity of the Military Tribunal Clerk. They also asked me for news. It can be said that it was "reporters interviewing reporters," which was also an interesting episode of this trip.

After winding and twisting, we finally found No. 5 Baoben Street. The sign of an obstetrician was hung outside. We pushed the door open and went in. Inside were an old woman with white hair and a middle-aged woman. They were quite surprised to see our three unexpected guests. We asked, "Is Dr. Ye in?" They said she was sick, but she finally came out from the inner room. Her face was indeed very pale, and she was about thirty years old, with two small braids. We explained the purpose of our visit and repeatedly explained that finding her would not be detrimental to her in any way. Our purpose was to investigate Yonemura's crimes. We only needed to know: whether Wu Yucang and the other five people were sent to the hospital at that time, and what happened after they were sent in. Dr. Ye and her family seemed somewhat guarded against us. Although she said she understood the situation very well and knew it would not be related to her, she said that Director Zhang Xia had left the county hospital at the end of 1942 and handed it over to the last director, Jin Shaozhou. She herself had also resigned at the beginning of 1943, so she naturally had no way of knowing what happened later. Finally, she introduced us to another female doctor, Pang Jiyun, who, according to her, had worked until the hospital was disbanded.

Although we suffered two disappointments, as long as there were other clues, we still cheered up and sought further development. Walking near County East Street, we saw from afar the sign of "Dr. Pang Jiyun" hanging at the door of a grocery store. A couple was eating in the store. We asked if Dr. Pang was in. The woman stood up and greeted us to go to a doctor's room inside. It turned out that she was Dr. Pang. Her attitude seemed very sincere, but she also could not be sure whether Wu Yucang and the other five people had been sent to the hospital. She said that there were many patients being sent in and out of the hospital at that time, and she herself lived outside the hospital, so she did not know the details. However, she told us some of the situation in the hospital. She said that the patients who were sent in were all very ill as a result of being abused and tortured. Moreover, regardless of whether the patients recovered or died, they were all returned to the Military Police for continued imprisonment or burial. In addition, she also heard that the Military Police often killed people outside the North Gate at midnight. Finally, she pointed us to another way, to visit Mr. Chen Yunzhou, an old man who had been the clerk in charge of affairs in the hospital from the beginning until it was disbanded.

Visiting The Graves Without a Clue

Mr. Chen's house is located in Luotuo Bay, Qixian River, in the city. After much searching, we finally found the number of his house. This can be said to be our last hope. The door opened, and a middle-aged woman insisted on asking the purpose of our visit. We claimed to be friends of Mr. Chen and came to visit him. Only then did she let us in. After waiting in the living room for a few minutes, Mr. Chen came out with a cane. His cheeks were sunken, he was wearing a melon-skin hat and thin cotton-padded clothes. It is said that he had just recovered from a serious illness, so his voice was low and his breathing was short. We explained the purpose of our visit to him and repeatedly told him that this matter would not be related to him in any way, hoping that he would tell us as much as he knew. However, what we got was still disappointment. He said that he really did not know the inside story. The reason was that the last director, Jin Shaozhou, was, according to him, "extremely shrewd," even to the point of personally receiving the toothbrushes and soaps left behind by the patients, and even changed his nephew's name to Wu Chuandong to handle everything in the hospital. Therefore, although Chen was a clerk, he actually could not manage anything. To find out the details of this matter, it seemed that we had to track down Jin Shaozhou, who was in hiding.

After leaving Mr. Chen Yunzhou's place, we felt the difficulty of finding clues, and it seemed that we would not be able to complete the task. However, because the results of inquiries from the above places all said that the patriotic youths who were brutally killed by the enemy military police at that time were buried at the foot of the mountain outside the North Gate, although we were already very tired, we still held the lucky psychology of hope and cheered up to set off towards the North Gate to make a final attempt. Along Luotuo Bay, after making several turns, relying on Supervisor Gao's familiarity with the city's paths, we passed through a farm at the foot of the city (the farm is now only a name, with only weeds and countless charity tombs). Soon, the North Gate appeared in front of us. Walking out of the city gate, we saw National Army soldiers and police wearing helmets standing on the bridge outside the city gate. The bridge was engraved with the words "August 7th Bridge." It is said that in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the 87th Division of the Army had been stationed there, and the bridge was built by the division in cooperation with the people.

This is Without Thinking

Turning left after crossing the bridge, we saw a teahouse at the foot of the mountain (later we learned that the teahouse was called Shanlouju). A table of villagers in short clothes were talking loudly and drinking tea happily. We went up and told them the meaning of inquiring about the Yonemura case, asking if they knew anything. Who knew that as soon as we said the words "Yonemura," everyone said in unison, "This guy is well-known in Changshu. He is a fierce devil who kills without blinking an eye." This aroused their interest, and everyone scrambled to ask, "Has Yonemura been caught?" We gave them a definite answer. Then Chief Li asked them if they knew anything about the killing of Wu Yucang, Hu Jiadong, Wen Xingwu, Ye Zhenfei, Yu Zifan, and the other five people. Unexpectedly, they actually satisfied our expectations. It turned out that they were all local "morticians." They sometimes secretly saw the enemy military police killing people. Therefore, one of them said without thinking, "There were many people killed. We know where they were buried. There are more than a dozen places"! This made us change from despair to hope, reminding us of the saying "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, you doubt there is no road, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village." So we asked them if they could lead us to find them. They all happily expressed their willingness to be guides. Everyone stood up from the table and accompanied us to set off towards the destination. After about five minutes, we arrived at Tiangegang. They pointed to a pile of raised soil and said, "This is it"! Two of them hurriedly went to get hoes and started digging vigorously. Several people standing beside said, "The enemy's vicious methods are so barbaric that they are simply unimaginable by humans. Now they are finally reaping what they sowed." Their words were filled with grief and indignation. There was even an old man who gesticulated and bitterly condemned the enemy's lack of conscience, showing a posture of anger.

No Head, Loyal Bones Dug Up

Suddenly, we heard the sound of the hoe colliding with something. One of them said, "Be careful, the bones have been dug up. Don't break them"! Before he finished speaking, we suddenly saw a few thick limb bones. Continuing to dig, we dug out more than a dozen large limb bones and ribs, shoulder bones, spine bones, etc., and a mass of decayed hair that had turned purple. Each person's face was imprinted with an indescribable color of grief, indignation, and fear. We asked why we couldn't see the head. Another old woman, about fifty years old, with a floral cloth on her head and a farm tool in her hand, said, "I heard that a total of two people were killed in this hole. One was beheaded, and the other was stabbed to death. The head that was cut off was taken by the military police to present to their superiors. The other head was eaten by wild dogs and other animals because it was exposed outside the soil. So there are only the bones of the body in this hole, and there is no skull." We were horrified to hear the woman's words. We took two photos of the bones that were dug out and asked the people next to us to use a bamboo dustpan to hold the bones of the two heroes who died for the country. According to them, the deaths of these two unknown heroes were three years ago. It was already four o'clock in the afternoon. We asked the diggers to go and dig up the burial place of Hu Jiadong's bones that they knew about. That place was at the foot of Mount Yu, not far from Tiangegang, densely covered with unmanaged mountain grass. People walking inside only showed their chest and above, making the situation even more desolate.

Next to a chestnut tree, we found the soil heap of Hu Jiadong's loyal soul. According to them, Hu Jiadong's mother had come here to dig up her son's remains in May this year. She dripped blood on the bones of the skull, but because it was not absorbed by the bones, she thought it was not her son's remains. She cried so hard here that she almost died! This made everyone feel as if a basin of cold water had been poured on them. This so-called dripping blood is the most unreasonable ancient testing method, and it can be said that there is absolutely no accurate grasp, because how can the bones dug out of the soil absorb wet blood? This method has added so many grievances to the world. Suddenly everyone stopped talking, and a blood-stained head was clearly presented in front of them, standing upright in the mud hole. Even with more than a dozen people in the field in broad daylight, everyone could not help but feel a little scared.

The Buried Alive Like Pulling Wood Piles

As usual, the head and feet of the corpse are on the same plane, and the head is always facing the sky, but this remains is very different, with the head up and the feet down in a standing state. It was tightly taken out of the soil, like pulling out a wooden stake. Looking closely at the appearance, it still seemed like a living person, but a few front teeth were missing. The teeth grow inside the jaw, and there is no reason to be missing alone. It must have been knocked down by the enemy military police. There were also a few old farmers, holding bamboo-stemmed pipes in their hands, and couldn't help but burst into tears, making everyone speechless. It is said that in the spring and summer of 1943, the enemy military police indiscriminately arrested patriotic youths and innocent civilians, and the number of deaths was in the hundreds. Hu Jiadong's death was like this: the enemy military police dug a hole, then pulled him over and told him to run down into the hole and stand there. The enemy military police put bayonets on the guns and stabbed him desperately. They only heard a "Ah" sound, and he fell straight into the hole. This is a report from a farmer who witnessed it from afar inside the wall. Then they went to a place called Zhangjiafen. The villagers said, "There is also a corpse here, who died around the same time as Hu Jiadong. The enemy tied it up with a cattail bag before burying it." We stopped and dug again. Less than a foot deep, we found another skull, also inserted straight into the mud.

Bringing Skulls On The Train

The scene was miserable enough, coupled with the wasteland, the setting sun, the dry trees, and the crows returning to their nests, we really couldn't bear to dig anymore. Therefore, we asked the villagers to carry these skeletons to the County Government first. The people who saw it along the way were blocked, which can be said to have caused a sensation throughout the county. That night, the pile of human bones was stored in Huiri Temple.

The next day, after consideration, we decided to return to Shanghai first. We would go back to excavate when necessary in the future. The two skulls and human bones that had been dug out were packed in cattail bags and carried all the way to Shanghai by car and train. If the people who were on the same train with us knew that we were carrying skulls and bones, they would not know what kind of shocking jokes would be made! Now, the skulls and human bones have been placed in the Military Tribunal, and will soon become powerful evidence in the retrial of Yonemura Haruki.

After the excavation, the villagers, Supervisor Gao of the County Government (standing behind the reporter), and the reporter took a group photo.

### Meteorological Observation: Recent Developments in Zhejiang Province's Work

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou] Zhejiang Province's meteorological observation work is being managed by the Water Conservancy Bureau's Meteorological Observatory this year. It is divided into seven meteorological stations in Songyang, Yongkang, Longyou, Pingyang, Qingyan, Tiantai, and Yuqian. Due to budget constraints, the two stations in Tianhe and Pingyang are temporarily suspended. The observation items include temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind force, cloud cover, cloud type, cloud direction, rainfall and rainfall time, evaporation, visibility, and weather conditions. The Hangzhou Headquarters also measures air pressure and sunshine hours, and all records are compiled and sent to the Central Meteorological Bureau for reference. As for rainfall stations, there are currently seventeen locations in Longyou, Shouchang, Qingtian, Jiangshan, Xianju, Jinyun, Huangyan, Ninghai, Ruian, Taishun, Yuhuan, Wenling, Yongjia, Yueqing, Yongkang, and Linhai, which are managed by the county governments of each county. Regarding water level measurements, they were previously handled very well, but during the Anti-Japanese War, all were suspended. After the restoration, the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan allocated funds to the Water Conservancy Bureau to handle them on their behalf in May of this year. First, five stations were established at Zha Kou, Gongchen Bridge, Haining, Linhai, and Yongjia. Preparations began on June 1st, and the three stations at Zha Kou, Gongchen Bridge, and Haining were officially established on July 1st and began observation. The remaining two stations will also begin work soon.

### Itemized Voting on the Italian Treaty: Molotov's Speech at the Peace Conference Yesterday; Firmly Advocating Comprehensive Understanding and Rejecting the Formation of Confrontational Blocs

[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 9th (Broadcast): The Paris Peace Conference continues to discuss the Italian Treaty today and is expected to be completed tonight or by the latest tomorrow night.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 9th (Urgent Broadcast): In today's plenary session of the Peace Conference, by a vote of 14 to 5, with 2 abstentions, Article 3 regarding the Italo-Yugoslav border in the American Treaty, and Articles 17, 18, and 19 regarding special provisions for determining the border between France and Italy were passed. The articles regarding the Italo-Austrian border were passed by a two-thirds majority of 10 to 6, with 1 abstention. The articles concerning the Italo-Yugoslav and Italo-Greek borders were also passed without opposition.

Further Report: The conference unanimously passed Article 4, Clause 11 of the Italian Treaty regarding special provisions for the Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as Clause 12 of the same article regarding the Greek island of Dodecanese, and Clause 13 regarding the nationality of people in ceded territories.

Further Report: The conference unanimously passed Article 5, declaring that the Italo-Yugoslav joint committee will determine the border line between the two countries. Furthermore, Yugoslavia's proposed amendment to Clause 16, which defines the boundaries of the Free Territory of Trieste, was rejected by a vote of 14 to 5, with 2 abstentions.

Further Report: Poland's proposed amendment to Articles 14 and 15, which prohibit the employment of Fascists in military institutions and government agencies, was rejected by a vote of 10 to 9, with 2 abstentions. Yugoslavia's proposed amendment to the draft for determining the boundary line of the Free Territory of Trieste was also rejected by the conference by a vote of 14 to 5, with 2 abstentions.

Further Report: The American proposal regarding the status of Trieste was passed by a vote of 14 to 6, with 1 abstention. The provision in the treaty placing the territory of Trieste under the control of the Security Council was passed without opposition.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The chairman of the plenary session of the conference, Soviet representative Molotov, delivered a speech today in a sparsely attended session, lasting 30 minutes. Molotov praised the cooperation of the Four Powers, reiterating the Soviet Union's firm commitment to comprehensive understanding and rejecting the policy of forming confrontational blocs. Molotov stated that cooperation among the Four Powers is more reliable than the United Nations organization, and this is the key to all difficulties. The divisions found at the conference are artificial in nature, and all representatives should act with understanding and sincerity to establish lasting world peace. The United Nations won the victory over Fascism at a great cost, so there is a need to establish a permanent organization. We have learned a lesson from the 1919 peace settlement (referring to the Treaty of Versailles after World War I), believing that this peace must be democratic and treat those who sacrificed for the common cause equally. If the peace settlement is democratic and lasting, it must ensure the elimination of Fascism and encourage the growth of democracy everywhere. Although Italy is the cradle of Fascism, the Italian Treaty is not harsh. The entire text of the treaty was approved by the Four Powers and unanimously passed by the conference, although criticism from various parties was unavoidable at times, but such criticism may not be justified. The passage of various amendments has not greatly changed the original draft, which shows that the cooperation of the Four Powers has been quite effective. However, where the Four Powers disagreed, the conference also failed to reach a unanimous solution. Nevertheless, the cooperation of the Four Powers should be maintained. It is said that the conference is divided into opposing blocs, but the Soviet Union opposes any division and insists on establishing comprehensive understanding. The so-called Slavic countries' desire to establish an anti-British and American front is not true. Such an attempt may have existed many years ago, but there is no such danger at this time. Currently, young democratic countries have risen from the land of Eastern Europe, and these countries only seek fair and legitimate treatment, with no ambition. Some diplomats are attempting to organize a Western bloc, and the invitation of India, China, and Abyssinia to participate in the bloc is surprising. The purpose is nothing more than to obtain more votes in the conference. In short, all countries should value understanding and sincerity to build a democratic peace. If some countries do not want to dominate others and can reach an agreement on some points, then a democratic peace can eventually be implemented.

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] Molotov, at the plenary session of the conference, opposed the French proposal for the Free Territory of Trieste, which had been passed by the Italian Political and Territorial Committee, arguing that the status of the Free Territory should be similar to that of the Free City of Danzig after World War I. Molotov pointed out that adopting the French proposal violates the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, as it places too many restrictions on the legislative assembly of the Free Territory and grants the governor too broad powers. Molotov also demanded that the conference determine the date for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Trieste.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The plenary session of the conference meets three times a day, and the representatives are exhausted. At the fifth meeting last night, only 30 people attended. The representatives seemed to have little interest in the progress of the meeting, and the general impression was that everything had already been decided, and continued discussion was futile. However, Yugoslav representative Benes continued to argue that the Italian Treaty was unfavorable to Yugoslavia and threatened that if the Italo-Yugoslav border line were divided according to the French proposal, Yugoslavia would refuse to sign the treaty. The representatives of the Slavic countries applauded enthusiastically, but the British and American representatives paid little attention. The head of the British delegation, Alexander, was fast asleep? The meeting continued this morning, chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The New Zealand representative spoke, urging all countries to be optimistic about the future of international relations and not to be unnecessarily apprehensive.

### The United States Will Provide Information on Overseas Troop Deployments at the Request of the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 9th (Broadcast): The US government today telegraphed Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, requesting his approval of a State Department plan. The Soviet Union had previously requested in the Security Council that the United Nations members explain their troop deployments in non-enemy countries. It is understood that the United States will support the Soviet proposal, but not in the Security Council, but in the United Nations General Assembly, as no country has veto power in the United Nations General Assembly. In addition, there is a condition that all countries must explain their troop deployments and locations in foreign countries, whether non-enemy or former enemy countries, and for how long they will be stationed. In this way, Moscow must declare the number of Soviet troops stationed in Korea, Central Europe, and the Balkan countries, and the length of their stay.

### Sovereignty of Ryukyu Islands Should Belong to China

Views of Senior US Officials

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] US diplomatic officials frankly expect the Soviet Union to demand the takeover of the strategically important Ryukyu Islands. According to senior officials who spoke privately to the Associated Press, the United States will oppose this Soviet action, arguing that if the sovereignty of the Ryukyu Islands is transferred, it should be handed over to China, or the islands should be placed under United Nations trusteeship with China solely in charge of administrative affairs, to which the United States would agree. The Ryukyu Islands divide the Pacific high seas and the Yellow Sea, and Dalian and Lushun, which are of great interest to the Soviet Union, are located at the end of the Yellow Sea. In some respects, the situation of the Ryukyu Islands may be compared to the situation of the Dardanelles Strait, as the Soviet Union has long sought to gain access to the Pacific Ocean.

### Japanese Propaganda Targeted Parts of the Soviet Far East

Soviet prosecutors continued to present evidence proving that Japan was promoting Pan-Asianism both domestically and abroad. The evidence included excerpts from books, magazines, and newspapers, and even the covers of certain books. The court-appointed defense attorney for the accused, Lu Gang, strongly objected. Presiding Judge Webb declared that the court had set a precedent for the presentation of such documents because they had evidentiary value, but they must be related to the accused, otherwise the court would naturally not consider them as evidence. Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Rosenblit stated that the Soviet Union believed that such propaganda was aimed at the Soviet Far East.

The Soviet Union only presented the cover of the book "Southern Advance" this time. The cover was a map with Tokyo at the center, drawn as a circumference.

Double Tenth National Day

### Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters' Sentiments on National Day

Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, issued an article entitled "Sentiments on National Day," consisting of two thousand words. It first described the causes and consequences of the Xinhai Revolution, then discussed the purpose of the National Revolution, which was to build a modern country internally and strive for independent status externally. It continued by describing the process by which Japanese imperialism obstructed China's independence movement, which ultimately led to the all-out War of Resistance. Although eight years of arduous struggle finally resulted in a glorious victory, the post-victory period was marked by widespread war, frequent internal strife, widespread disasters, blocked transportation, stalled production, soaring prices, public unrest, and declining social morality and order. He couldn't help but lament this situation. He hoped that all sectors of the municipal party and government, as well as people from all parties and factions and all citizens of the city, would embrace construction in stability and unity in solidarity, reverse the declining trends, uphold justice, stabilize order, stabilize the economy, and develop production. He particularly hoped that the Chinese Communists would leave a glimmer of hope for the nation's future and the people's lives, immediately cease their attempts to use force as political capital, abandon their policies of seizing cities and territories, and resolve all disputes through political means. Then, they could implement reorganization and unification to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army and democratizing politics, in order to complete the mission of national rejuvenation. Finally, he hoped that everyone would reflect on the decades of arduous struggle, learn from it, and gain a deeper understanding of the current responsibility of nation-building, so as to overcome difficulties with all their strength, strive forward, complete the great cause of nation-building, and achieve a strong and democratic new China.

After Xie was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau, his wife, Zhu, feared that the property would be confiscated, so in October of last year, she telephoned Wang Chaoliang, the manager of the Xinzha Inn, to relay instructions to her accomplices Li Laoqi (i.e., Li Yongrui), Shi Liangchun, Chen Xueyun, Qiu Youxin, Jiang Fengrong, and others to move the mahogany furniture and other movable property from Xie's residences on Weihaiwei Road and Changping Road to the home of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Da Zhonghua Hotel, who was related to her children by marriage, for safekeeping. The next day, Dai learned of the situation and, fearing accidents, immediately ordered them to be moved out. Zhu and others then moved the items to a rented house on Muirhead Road to conceal them. The authorities learned of this, sealed them up, and the High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted everyone on suspicion of concealing traitorous property. Zhu confessed that these were her private belongings, while the others claimed that they were moving the items on the orders of the owner and did not know that it was illegal. The case was concluded yesterday, and the sentence is scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th of this month. In addition, Xie's eldest son, Xie Wenyuan, who served as the captain of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, is also one of the defendants in the case and is currently on the run to avoid punishment.

### Zhang Hao, Tutor to the Traitor Chu Minyi's Children, to Be Sentenced on the 16th

Zhang Hao, a native of Nanjing, is 26 years old. He served as a tutor to the children of the traitor Chu Minyi and as a foreign affairs secretary in the puppet Political Security Bureau. When Chu served as the puppet ambassador to Japan, he followed him as an interpreter. He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. The High Court concluded the trial yesterday and also scheduled the sentence to be pronounced at 10:00 a.m. on the 16th.

Two more cases were concluded on the afternoon of the same day:

Guo Renjie is 52 years old and a native of Changzhou. The prosecutor's indictment stated that in the autumn of 1940, the traitor organized the "East Asia League China Comrades Association" in Nanjing to show that the East Asia League was one of the pseudo-government's national policies, and unveiled the three guidelines of political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication to respond to the "Greater East Asia Doctrine." On December 1, 1941, the "East Asia League China General Association" was established in Nanjing, followed by the establishment of branches in various regions. Guo then served as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai branch of the association, promoting this absurd doctrine. In the spring of 1944, he also served as the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Shanghai Citizens' Airplane Donation Movement Committee. All the promotion of the committee's affairs and the collection of donations were designed by him. He ordered various trade associations to apportion airplane donation funds, sent personnel to forcibly sell slogans to various merchants, and attached a donation of ten yuan to each fabric purchase certificate distributed to citizens. He also organized charity performances and ball games to solicit donations, and encouraged gambling dens and opium dens to donate funds, which fueled the arrogance of the enemy and puppets. After the victory, he finally went into hiding. He was detained and brought to justice by the Songhu Garrison Command. The defendant denied in court yesterday that he had served as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the "East Asia League China General Association Shanghai Branch," claiming that he had never heard of this association. He claimed that he only took the empty title of chief of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Airplane Donation Movement Committee in order to obtain an identity card for business travel, and that he was only responsible for general affairs such as receiving and dispatching documents. He claimed that the fundraising was handled by the Liaison Section, and the slogans were handled by the Propaganda Section.

Rong Jiajun once served as an investigator in the Fifth Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. He was accused of extorting 40,000 yuan in puppet currency from the Yichang Silk Shop on Shandong Road in this city, together with Luo Jinghe, the puppet section chief. After the victory, he was reported and arrested. The High Court sentenced him to five years in prison. Rong refused to accept the sentence and appealed. The Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. He claimed in court yesterday that the 40,000 yuan was not extorted, but was a gift voluntarily offered by the shop. He claimed that the accusation was due to personal grudges and that he was greatly wronged. He said that if it was true, he would be willing to accept the death penalty, and he wept bitterly. The sentences for both of the above cases are scheduled to be pronounced at 2:30 p.m. on the 16th.

Wu Jianchong was accused of serving as a secret agent for the enemy-puppet Hunan Gendarmerie. The High Court previously sentenced him to eight years in prison. After appealing, the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. After an investigation yesterday morning, the judge ordered a postponement for further questioning.

[Also reported] The High Court will be closed for one day today for National Day.

### Liquidation of Traitorous Assets

[Reported by this newspaper] The Traitorous Assets Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau believes that the verdicts of some traitors have been finalized, and traitorous assets need to be actively processed and sold through bidding.

Currently, it is actively carrying out various preparatory work, and it will be formally established as soon as the director of the bureau, Liu Gongyun, approves it.

### The Land Administration Bureau is Preparing to Return Land Illegally Seized by the Enemy and Puppets

The Municipal Land Administration Bureau has begun investigating and sorting out the land illegally seized by the enemy and puppets. Those that are needed by the government, such as the existing airfields, will be expropriated with compensation for the land price. For those that were valued during the enemy and puppet occupation, the compensation will be calculated and issued based on the land price index.

Fujii Masa二, 33 years old, from Okayama Prefecture, Japan, who is being held in the War Criminals Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense, served as a patrolman, guard, and judicial officer in the North Shanghai Gendarmerie before Japan's surrender. A Japanese resident, Izumi Shigeru, heard that the suspect had abused and massacred kind merchants and farmers during his work in Nanhui in 1942, and had also extorted large sums of money from merchants in the North Shanghai Gendarmerie. Out of indignation, he reported him to the office. After several investigations, the suspect stubbornly denied everything, but it was determined that the crime was serious. It is reported that the suspect was transferred to the military court of the First Pacification Area Command on the 9th of this month for investigation, and the office will continue to conduct investigations and collect evidence. The person in charge of the office told reporters that if any civilians have been poisoned or harmed by enemy gendarmes, they should submit evidence and detailed accounts of the facts to the office for verification and handling.

They have now been ordered to be escorted back to the Shanghai reception center for detention. It is reported that Tanaka and others were escorted back to Shanghai on the 4th of this month. It is understood that Tanaka and others are not actually war criminals, but were captured by the Communist army, and were recaptured by our army in the Battle of Sipingjie, so they were escorted to Shanghai.

China received a great deal of assistance from the United States during the eight years of hard fighting. The Lend-Lease Act was especially helpful to China's war of resistance. All true friends of China should support this kind of assistance. We have no intention of jealousy or competition. What Britain can be proud of is that during the transitional period of the past year, it has made every effort to produce to meet needs, which is enough to prove that Britain is very willing to help China develop its construction work.

Bowes also said: The trade mission is interested in all kinds of trade in China and is willing to study it. Britain will export production and consumer goods to help China, and Chinese goods exports are also needed by Britain.

Finally, Bowes said that the British people express great sympathy for the difficulties China has suffered.

### New UNRRA Director Huo Baoshu Elaborates on Future Work Guidelines, Willing to Work Hard to Improve Several Difficulties

[Reported by this newspaper] The new UNRRA Director Huo Baoshu held his first press conference after taking office at the Capital Hotel on the afternoon of the 　th. First, Tian Boli, the acting director of the UNRRA Translation Department, gave a brief introduction.

Huo then delivered a speech, saying: UNRRA is an organization that serves the people, and it is also an organization that seeks relief and reconstruction for the country. It needs a lot of assistance from all sectors of society. I am willing to have more contact with all parties. UNRRA is open to everything. I hope to use your power to make the society know the work of our people. UNRRA has laid a good foundation in the past under the leadership of Mr. Jiang Tingfu. Mr. Jiang is a transcendent talent and a great scholar. He is not only the creator of China's first national post-war relief plan, but also through his efforts in the United Nations Conference, made China an important member in creating the UNRRA. I only hope to continue to complete the task on the foundation he has laid.

In the past, there have been criticisms of UNRRA at home and abroad. Some of them are reasonable and should be remedied, and some misunderstandings should be explained. Some people think that UNRRA is not efficient enough and cannot transport materials quickly. In fact, after eight years of war, China's transportation has been greatly damaged. Even the transportation capacity of the Huangpu River is not as good as before, so it is difficult to give full play to efficiency. Moreover, the materials that China has obtained are not much more than those obtained by Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia and other countries. Given the size of China and the size of its population, the proportion obtained is actually very small. It is very difficult to satisfy all parties under this kind of situation.

The living standard of the Chinese people has always been quite low, and they have suffered a lot during the war, but UNRRA can only help the most urgently needed refugees. It cannot be like Santa Claus, sending gifts everywhere!

I cannot make any guarantees at the moment, but I hope to deal with this limited amount of material fairly. My colleagues in this office have been earnestly retained by me, and I sincerely hope that they can use the heart of a Bodhisattva to benefit the victims. However, I am determined to strengthen its organization within UNRRA, so that everyone can do their best and fulfill their responsibilities.

Only one point can be announced today: From now on, I will definitely distribute materials under the principles of impartiality and great fairness, and speed up the work. We will always strive to reduce costs, because saving a penny will provide a penny more relief to the victims.

Huo finally said with confidence and a pleasant tone: I study economics, and I have studied transportation issues carefully in the United States and in China. Therefore, I am determined to improve transportation with my knowledge and experience, so that efficiency can be increased, and I have recently worked in the Bank of China and have had a lot of contact with all parties, so finance must also be improved.

### Everyone Can Perform Magic Tricks, But Each Has Different Skills: Mr. Huo Smiles as Reporters Ask About Finances

Mr. Huo then answered questions raised by reporters in a very harmonious atmosphere. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Question: Does UNRRA still intend to sell materials? Answer: UNRRA's sale of relief materials is based on the basic agreement signed with the UN. Compared with other countries, the proportion sold is very small. But there are many ways to remedy the financial situation. In fact, selling materials is not the only one. Details will be announced in the near future. (2) Question: Will you consider asking for foreign assistance with transportation in the future? Answer: The use of ships should be decided by the government. I cannot answer this question about other government agencies today. But it is naturally best to use more Chinese things. (3) Question: In the current situation where the domestic situation is not completely stable, does UNRRA intend to consider revising the original relief procedures? Answer: Relief is universal. If the car cannot actually drive there, it should change its route. The current UNRRA is trying its best to make the routes smooth and negotiate with the parties concerned. (4) Question: General Chennault previously suggested cooperating with UNRRA to establish an airlift team. What is the progress of this matter? Answer: There are three principles of transportation: fast; cheap; safe. In addition, it should meet the needs. The Chennault airlift team matter is currently under consideration by the competent authority. As of today, I have not heard of any decision. I believe the government will have instructions on this matter. (5) Question: Does Director Huo think the airlift team is necessary? Answer: UNRRA feels the need for various means of transportation. (6) Question: It is said that UNRRA has paid Mr. Chen one million US dollars in advance. Is this true? Answer: I have not seen this document. (7) Question: UNRRA has established many offices in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists. Do you intend to continue to add more in the future? Answer: The offices in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists continue to work. Whether to set up new offices will depend on the needs.

After the meeting, reporters inquired with Director Huo about the specific measures to solve UNRRA's financial problems. Director Huo replied with a smile: "Everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has different skills!" His expression was free and easy, which showed that he had a plan in mind; and the fate of tens of millions of starving victims lies in Director Huo's "magic trick."

### Chennault Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday; Establishment of Air Route Still Pending

[Also reported] General Chennault, the Flying Tiger General, flew to Beijing the day before yesterday to meet with Chairman Chiang and the relevant parties, and returned to this place last night with his secretary, Schobert.

### Adding Buoys and Repairing Docks: Port Affairs Meeting Sets a Deadline for Implementation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee held its second meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 9th) in the City Hall conference room. The following resolutions were made: (1) The English name of the Port Reorganization Committee was decided to be "The Port of Shanghai Readjustment Commission." (2) The proposal to add buoys was approved. Because the original eighteen Class C buoys were unsuitable for ocean-going vessels to moor, ten Class A buoys will be exchanged for them in the original area. Ten Class C buoys will also be laid in shallower waters to prepare for coastal and river vessels. (3) In order to solve the problem of congested berths, the committee will separately notify the responsible persons of each unit to repair the docks within a limited time to facilitate the berthing, loading, and unloading of merchant ships. (4) According to committee member Ding Guitang: during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the docks had long been neglected from dredging. Foreign ships can only dock and depart after waiting. Dredging should be carried out urgently to facilitate navigation. As a result, it was resolved to hand this issue over to the Dredging Bureau to conduct a detailed survey of the water level of each dock and submit it to the next meeting for a decision.

Finally, Zhao Zengjue, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, proposed that the city's wharves and nearby warehouses be managed by area and group to achieve unified command and rational utilization. It is proposed to divide them into: (1) Shallow water group: based on the wharves and warehouses in the Nanshi district. (2) Deep water group: provisionally divided into three areas: Puxi Outer Ocean area, Puxi Near Sea area, and Pudong area. In the future, it can be expanded from Jiangwan to Wusong River and connected to the Jinghu Railway to facilitate the transfer of domestic and foreign materials. (3) Professional group: such as coal, fuel, military, etc., will be divided into groups according to their professional needs. As for how to manage and how to divide, it is proposed that the committee members study in detail and submit their opinions to the group for collation and then submit them for formal discussion at the next meeting.

### Same Name, Entangled Affairs: Old Man Pan Injures a European; Old Man Cai Takes the Blame for Another

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Third Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday heard a case of assault. The defendant, Old Man Cai, was acquitted in court because he was mistaken for someone with the same name and took the blame for another. It turned out that in Maodeli, Xikang Road, No. 25, there lived two people named Old Man Pan and Old Man Cai. Old Man Cai lived in the front building, while Old Man Pan lived in the back building. The residences of the two old men were very close. On July 26th of this year at a certain time, Old Man Pan quarreled and fought with a ten-year-old girl named Meigendi in the same alley over using tap water. Although Old Man Pan was old, he was still strong and injured Jiang Gendi's head. Old Man Cai, because of his neighborly friendship, came forward to mediate, but to no avail. After being questioned by the Xinchengzhi Branch Bureau, he was transferred to the District Procuratorate, which sent him to the court for prosecution. However, when Jiang Gendi gave her statement, Old Man Pan and Old Man Cai were entangled and unclear. The Procuratorate did not listen carefully and mistakenly filled in Cai Laobiao instead of Pan Laobiao. Yesterday afternoon, the court opened, and Cai Laobiao was unjustly tried, shouting grievances. The plaintiff also stated in court that this Old Man was not that Old Man. Since the court knew that the defendant was mistaken and could not start the trial, it declared Cai Laobiao not guilty. If Jiang Gendi still wants to sue Pan Laobiao, she needs to follow the legal procedures and file a new statement.

### Social Bureau Shelters Beggar Children; Establishment of Vocational Training Center Planned

[Report from Our Newspaper] In view of the large number of beggar children wandering the streets of this city, which is detrimental to public appearance and affects social security, the Social Bureau plans to establish a vocational training center near Yangshupu to shelter beggar children, concentrate them for training, and teach them livelihood skills.

### Ticket Scalpers Active Again at the Station; Black Market Tickets Inflated Twofold

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, passenger transport on the Jinghu and Huhu railway lines has become crowded again, and it is even more difficult to buy tickets. The long queues of ticket buyers at the North Station, Qiujiang Road Business Office, and China Travel Service have reappeared. Ticket scalpers selling black market tickets are also active again. It is estimated that about one-tenth of the tickets on the Jinghu and Huhu lines are in the hands of scalpers every day. In particular, reserved seat tickets are mostly purchased by scalpers. Reserved seat tickets are sold the day before, so they have more time to resell them, and passengers prefer to take reserved seats, so they are easier to sell. Scalpers often linger near the North Station and, when passengers enter the station, they rush forward and ask in a low voice: "Want tickets? Want tickets?" The price they sell is about one to two times the ticket price. Ticket sales at the North Station begin two or three hours before the train departs. The China Travel Service sells tickets for the next day. The railway authorities have worked hard to crack down on scalpers, but with little success. They are now actively discussing effective measures with relevant parties.

### Zhou Zhiqiang Falsely Claims to Be Unmarried; Tao Yumei Deceived and Loses Her Virginity

[Report from Our Newspaper] Tao Yumei, a local woman, 22 years old, was engaged to Zhou Zhiqiang, the son of Zhou Mengxian, the manager of the Chishaoduo Auto Shop on Xikang Road, in Shanghai on November 26, 1945, and the lawyer Pan Renxi was the witness. At that time, it was agreed that the wedding must be held before the end of May this year. Zhou also agreed. Since the two were engaged, they did not avoid suspicion. In January this year, when they traveled to Suzhou together, they had physical relations. Afterwards, Tao was anxious to get married, but Zhou kept perfunctorily procrastinating, claiming that he was setting up a silk company and that the wedding could be held as soon as the business developed slightly. Tao Wangmei initially believed it to be true, but later discovered that there was no such thing as organizing a company, and began to suspect. Later, she found out that Zhou Zhiqiang already had a wife and children before she knew she had been deceived. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to sue Zhou Zhiqiang under Article 229 of the Criminal Law for using deception to make a woman mistakenly believe that he was her spouse and obey his adultery. Two civil lawsuits were filed, demanding compensation for losses of 20 million yuan. Yesterday, the District Court opened, and Miss Tao came to court in a black cheongsam with her lawyer and another female friend. The court slightly questioned her because the defendant was not present, and then decided to postpone the trial.

### Gauze and Cloth Transportation to Southern China to Begin Tomorrow: Textile Management Committee and Customs Administration Have Received Government Orders; Items Include City Cloth, Colored Cloth, Fine and Coarse Twill; Total Amount is More Than 5,000 Red Pieces

[Our Dispatch] The six regulations on the management of gauze and cloth transportation to Southern China and the eight regulations on the application and review procedures were first seen in this newspaper on October 8. It is now known that the Textile Industry Management Committee and the Customs Administration did indeed receive instructions from the Executive Yuan a few days ago, ordering them to be implemented on a trial basis. It is reported that all gauze and cloth transported to Southern China from various places are subject to these British regulations and procedures. The Textile Management Committee and the Customs Administration will jointly announce them for two days starting tomorrow and will implement them starting tomorrow. As for the handling procedures after implementation, according to inquiries made by reporters, they are recorded as follows: (1) The Textile Management Committee will first handle the registration of gauze and cloth manufacturers. The committee will obtain a registration form, which focuses on the date of establishment, financial status, organizational situation, average monthly production and sales volume, and monthly purchase and sales volume of gauze and cloth, and machine equipment. (2) The Textile Management Committee will approve the qualifications of each registered manufacturer. Once approved, a gauze and cloth factory registration card for transportation to Southern China will be issued. (3) Each manufacturer holding a registration card, if they want to transport gauze and cloth to Southern China, must first fill out an application form for an export permit for gauze and cloth transportation to Southern China. The application form must indicate the destination of transportation to Southern China, the name of the product, the name of the producing factory, the trademark, the number of pieces, the packaging, the length of each piece, the net weight, the total value, the name of the shipping vessel, and the date of export. After receiving the application form, the Textile Management Committee will issue a receipt. (4) After the application form is approved, the Textile Management Committee will issue an export permit for gauze and cloth transportation to Southern China. The permit is in four parts. The contents of each part are roughly the same as the items listed on the application form. The first part is the reporting and verification part. The gauze and cloth that the manufacturer transports to Southern China will be approved for release after being inspected by the customs based on this part. After the goods arrive at the destination, this part will be handed over to the commissioner of the local Textile Management Committee for registration. The second part is the type A notification part. After the Textile Management Committee issues the first part, it will send the second part to the exporting customs at the same time, so that the customs can hold it for verification. The third part is the type B notification part. The Textile Management Committee will send it to the commissioner of the Textile Management Committee in the gauze and cloth importing area for collection, so that it can be verified when the gauze and cloth arrive at the destination. The fourth part is the file keeping part, which is collected and stored by the Textile Management Committee.

Monthly Export Quota

Regarding the monthly quota of gauze and cloth allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai, the Textile Management Committee will base it on the domestic sales and import figures of gauze and cloth in various places in Southern China (including Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou) in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, and calculate and stipulate it according to the ratio of the current total domestic gauze and cloth production to the total domestic gauze and cloth production before the war. (1) In terms of total production, there were 5 million spindles in operation in China in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China. Currently, there are less than 2.5 million spindles in operation in China. Currently, there are less than 1.7 million spindles in operation in the Shanghai area (i.e., the various member factories affiliated to the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association). (2) In terms of the quantity of cotton yarn transported to Southern China from the Shanghai area in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, the average annual quantity was 104,736 pieces, and the average monthly quantity was 8,728 pieces. Therefore, the current monthly quantity of cotton yarn that should be allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai should be 8728×250/500×170/250=2987 pieces. (3) In terms of the quantity of cotton cloth transported to Southern China from the Shanghai area in the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, the average annual quantity was 2,669,885 pieces, and the average monthly quantity was 222,490 pieces. Therefore, the current monthly quantity of cotton cloth that should be allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai should be 222490×250/500×170/250=75647 pieces. This amount of cloth is calculated based on an average of 12 pounds of fine cloth, which is equivalent to 2,269 pieces of cotton yarn. (4) From the above calculation, it can be seen that the total monthly amount of cotton yarn allowed to be transported to Southern China from Shanghai is 5,236 pieces, accounting for about 7% of Shanghai's cotton yarn production. It can be seen that the quantity is very small and will not affect the supply in this city.

Bond Market Stability

The bond market situation is stable and consistent, with transactions of approximately 5 million yuan in face value. The "Tong Bing" bonds opened at 2,400 yuan this morning. Most of the sellers were still retail investors. The high price was 2,480 yuan. A major investor took advantage of the high price to sell, and the price fell to 2,250 yuan in the middle of the day. Before closing, the price stabilized above 2,300 yuan. As a result, it rose 80 yuan compared to the previous close. The A, B, and D bonds each rose 50 yuan, and the "Tong Wu" bonds only rose 20 yuan.

### Banking and Money Industries Closed to Celebrate Double Ten Day

Today (the 10th) is the second Double Ten Day since the victory. All sectors of the city are celebrating enthusiastically. All government agencies are closed for one day. All banks and money houses in the city are also closed for transactions. All money transfers and exchanges will be moved to tomorrow (the 11th).

### Gold Prices Continue to Rise: US Dollars Are Difficult to Develop: Hong Kong Notes Have Been Leveled with Hong Kong Exchange Rate

Because the price of gold in Guangdong and Hong Kong was higher than that in Shanghai, the buying interest was quite strong yesterday. It opened at 2.23 million in the morning. After opening, it was still peaceful, and the price hovered around 2.22 million for a long time. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 180 bars at a price of 2.225 million. After that, it gradually became stable. The Chaoshan gang had a lot of arbitrage buying, and people's hearts were more firm. Demand exceeded supply, and then it rose. Near noon, it rose to 2.238 million, and then there was some pressure. At noon, it stood at about 2.23 million. In the afternoon, only spot transactions were made, and it was still firm. As a result, it was 18,000 yuan better than the previous close. Jewelry was listed at 36,000 yuan. Silver was flat, and silver dollars were slightly more expensive. The informal short-term lending market was loose, and the interest rate ranged from 1.5% to 1.8%.

The foreign currency market is trending well. The US dollar is still quoted at 3,500 yuan to 3,550 yuan, but there are no transactions. The informal market transaction price is slightly better, at about 4,200 yuan to 4,300 yuan. However, transactions are extremely difficult to develop because of the strict investigation in the Sichuan Road area. As a result, compared with the previous close, they have all recovered. Hong Kong notes replaced them. Demand exceeded supply, and it rose another 30 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate and Hong Kong notes have already been leveled. It was passively raised to 940 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,140 yuan. The British exchange rate rose from 14,700 yuan to 15,000 yuan for sale. The official exchange rate of the US dollar has not changed, and there are no transactions.

### Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee Established: Evaluation Methods Drafted by Three Trade Associations

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that cotton cloth is a major commodity for people's livelihood. The market price has recently skyrocketed, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people. Therefore, it established an organization to set the price of cotton cloth in Shanghai. The first committee meeting was held at 4:00 PM yesterday. The attendees were Committee Members Gu Bingyuan (Social Affairs Bureau), Pan Shihao (Municipal Commerce Bureau), Wu Weijing (Textile Construction Company), Liu Piji (Sixth District Mechanical Textile Industry Association), Zhang Zunshi (Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association), and Dong Jiufeng (Cotton Cloth Industry Association). Director Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau chaired the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the significance of reviewing and setting cotton cloth prices. Then, the committee's charter was amended and approved. The Sixth District Mechanical Textile Industry Association, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association were entrusted to draft (1) cotton standards, (2) cotton cloth costs, (3) wholesale profits, and (4) punishment methods for discussion at the next meeting.

The cloth market was calm yesterday. The price stabilized as short-term lending rates eased. However, sales to merchants were slow, and the purchase of goods that Textile Construction Company had lowered the price of for sale the day before was not enthusiastic. The transaction price of hand-made goods was similar to yesterday. The leading fine cloth was still 84,000 yuan, the Wufu cloth fell to 77,500 yuan, and the white printed Biji was 88,000 yuan.

### Large Batch of Indian Cotton Shipped to Japan

[Central News Agency, Bombay, 8th] The Indian government is currently trying to promote the import of Indian cotton to Japan. It is planned to export 300,000 bales this year, and it is expected to be shipped in November. It is hoped that the quantity allowed for export next year will be even larger.

### Rice Market Digests Stagnation: Japonica and Indica Rice Both Decline

The supply of rice in the market is abundant, and the registered amount of goods from merchants totaled more than 11,000 shi. Digestion is stagnant. Japonica rice fell by 2,300 yuan, and the price of Japonica rice in the central region also fell by 2,300 yuan. However, Baiyuan rice is still firm. There is no market for wheat flour. Oil prices fluctuate. Vegetable oil is stagnant, and the price is down by a small 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil is stable. Raw oil digestion has become active, and stores are taking the opportunity to buy in, and the price has rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose slightly by 100-200 yuan. There is no trading in wheat bran. Because another 9,000 packages of soybeans from the Northeast will be imported tomorrow, people's hearts have softened. It is also heard that the Northeast is also shipping directly to Southeast Asia, so the sales in other ports are not moving, and the price has risen by 1,200 yuan.

### South African Woolen Cloth and Serge Arrive in Shanghai for the First Time After the War: Totaling More Than 9,000 Tons

[Our Dispatch] The James Swinton, managed by the Burma Line Shipping Company, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with more than 9,000 tons of woolen cloth, serge, wool yarn, and woolen products loaded from South Africa. It is currently docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong for unloading. This huge amount of woolen products is the first import after the war.

### Yarn Prices Rise by 100,000: Official Yarn Allocation Prices Remain Unchanged

[Our Dispatch] The yarn market saw a surge again yesterday. Because short-term lending rates eased, and a Cantonese ship was departing on Friday, the Cantonese merchants came to purchase again, and the Hankou merchants also had a buying appetite. At the opening of the market in the morning, prices rose sharply. 20-count yarn rose by approximately 60,000 to 110,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 42-count and 32-count fine yarn were not willing to fall behind. With weaving factories searching for allocated raw materials, they jumped by as much as 135,000 yuan. However, if sales to merchants cannot be active, then the market price can still stabilize. The official allocation price of cotton yarn remains unchanged. 20-count yarn is still 1.55 million yuan, and 42-count yarn is still 1.89 million yuan. Dyeing and weaving factories registered from numbers 1 to 400 and received allocations, including 503 pieces for private enterprises (sold at half of the requested amount) and 962.5 pieces for Textile Construction Company. The date for the next yarn opening has been changed to the 13th due to the National Day holiday today.

### Tea Market Gradually Becomes Quiet: Exported Aged Tea Has Too Much Mold; Foreign Firms' Inspection is More Stringent Than Before

The tea market situation is extremely narrow for both local and merchant sales. However, the earthen tea factories are still interested in Qimen fragrant tea. According to overseas telegrams received in recent days, the foreign firms' tea market has received all the varieties that were shipped. However, the quality is not good, and there is too much mold, so they have instructed to pay more attention in the future. Overall, the current situation is that Chinese tea is in a very dangerous situation, and if flash goods are dumped overseas again, the future will be even more dire. The tea merchants in this city, in view of this, are more cautious in their selection. Therefore, the results of yesterday's market inspection mostly failed to meet the requirements. The number of transactions has decreased, but the price of 34-year-old aged top-quality Qimen tea is still firm at 220,000 yuan per dan.

### Stock Market Has a Surprise: China Cement Reaches Limit Up

The Chinese stock market was highly anticipated by all parties yesterday, but the major investors remained inactive. Therefore, it was unable to support the recovery before closing. Short-term lending rates gradually eased, and the off-market price was already high. Therefore, each stock opened high in the morning, and the market weakened after opening and gradually returned. Half an hour later, the situation was the most tired. Subsequently, retail buyers continued to maintain it, and the price was pulled up in the middle of the day. Yongsha rose to 825 yuan, and Maya was 4,560 yuan. Among the small stocks, except for Qinxing, the rest, such as Xinguang and Jingfu, failed to exceed the opening price. China Cement quietly rose from 198 to the limit up. China Feng had its own buying interest and strived to move upward. The two major hot stocks stopped rising from high prices after 11:20 AM. Soon, they gradually declined. Before noon, there was a lot of competition to sell, and the off-market supply was active. Hot stocks fell to low prices, and the market turned around before closing. As a result, Yongsha rose by 3/10 compared to the previous close, Maya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Xinho each rose by 1/10. Tongyi, Zhongfang, Datong, Innerwear, and Jinglun rose slightly. New Asia Company, Lian'an Match, were flat. Rongfeng, Zhongsih, Wuhe, and Huafeng each rose by 3/10 to 5/10. China Cement rose by 10%. The total transaction volume was 11.17 million shares. The off-market prices of each stock were more tired than rising.

The foreign stock market, except for the two major hot stocks that could still be supported, the rest all retreated. Small stocks were even worse. As a result, Yisha and British Union rose slightly, and Jardine Matheson, Yeguang, and Yipi fell slightly. Paper, shipping, and steel fell by 5/10.

### Overdue Business Tax: Direct Tax Bureau Stipulates Payment to Treasury by the 20th of This Month

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce forwarded a notice from the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, stipulating the location and deadline for the payment of business tax due before the end of June this year, and sent a circular to the various trade associations to be forwarded to their affiliated businesses for compliance. The two regulations are recorded as follows: (1) All businesses that have business tax due and unpaid before the end of June this year, whether investigated by this bureau or continued to be assessed by the Finance Bureau, should hold the payment slip together with the tax payment and pay to the city's treasury. If the business tax payment slip was issued by the Finance Bureau, a stamp with the words "This payment is for the national treasury" should be affixed to identify it. This is the tax payment before June, which should be paid to the national treasury. For those whose business time is after July this year, the business tax payment should be changed to the city treasury for collection. (2) Furthermore, the overdue business tax payments for the last winter and this spring and summer seasons that were limited to be paid to the treasury before September 25 have not yet been paid by many units. Or because the deadline was too tight, the merchants were unable to raise the funds in time. Now, the deadline has been extended to October 20. If it is overdue again, a penalty will be imposed according to law, and no leniency will be granted.

### Rayon Rises Sharply Again: Factory-Processed Silk Goods Also Rise Prominently

Rayon prices rose again yesterday. In the morning, the price of 120-count rayon on Tianqiao Road was quoted from 3.95 million to 4 million yuan. In the afternoon, because tomorrow is a National Day holiday and the payment must be made the day after tomorrow, the price was quoted at another 100,000 yuan higher, with the middle price being 4.05 million yuan. It is necessary to wait for the China Textile Corporation to increase the allocation of rayon before there is hope of suppressing the price. Otherwise, the number of each manufacturer's shortage will inevitably be purchased in the black market, creating an opportunity for those who hold the goods to raise the price. The price of factory-processed goods in each store yesterday was about 50,000 yuan higher, but the transaction volume was quite small. Silk goods were tight yesterday. Huajin silk was traded in the market for 3,000 yuan for the medium quality and 3,100 yuan for the heavy quality in the morning. In the afternoon, because the raw materials were slightly better, the former was traded for 3,050 yuan and the latter was traded for 3,200 yuan.

### Sugar Market Transactions Decrease

Because today is Double Ten Day, transactions in the sugar market were lighter yesterday. The trend was slightly soft. The association's listed spot price for 20-count medium sugar was 141,000 yuan at first, and then 138,000 yuan. Raw sugar was 122,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan. Numbered goods included more than 200 baskets of Guangbang-opened two thin sheets of Shimen sheets in green, with prices ranging from 90,000 yuan to 88,000 or 9,000 yuan. Lingxing transactions of Jianbang green tea were made at a price of 108,000 yuan. The oil gang's input and output were limited, and the price lacked ups and downs.

### Longan Gradually Rises

Large miscellaneous-grade longan are rare and the sales volume is very strong, so the price is gradually rising. The market rose by more than 10,000 yuan again yesterday. There is no hope of easing for the time being.

### Thoughts on Reading Newspapers

— A Critical Voice

I remember that a certain newspaper supplement once published a special issue, inviting several "well-known people" to write articles to guide readers on how to read a newspaper well. They told us what conditions a good newspaper should have. But we know that the main material in a newspaper should be news, and this news should be objective reporting.

Objective reporting is not an easy thing to do. The same thing will cause different reactions in people with different standpoints, and their reports cannot escape the shadow of this reaction. So we can frankly say that all reports have a bit of subjectivity. So it is not unforgivable that the news recorded in a newspaper cannot be completely objective. However, some people deliberately use certain things as an excuse to boast and exaggerate, so as to distort the facts and confuse the public. This is a conscienceless act and is absolutely not desirable! As for the editors' selection of materials, although they have their own objective standards, they cannot avoid a subjective attitude. Different people have different opinions, and it is not possible to force them to agree. However, some gentlemen deliberately choose to publish some confusing news as their main task, which is a loss of the reporter's duty.

All of this can be ignored, but at least we should be able to find some news and read some news in a newspaper. But recently, we often see that most of some newspapers are "editorials," "reader opinions," "special reprints," and even the speech drafts of certain "experts"! Although we do not necessarily require it to be a "good newspaper," at least we can require it to be a "newspaper"!

This reminds us of two questions: the skill of propaganda and the identity of reporters. Those who are skilled in propaganda do not care about opening their mouths to scold. We must know that although ordinary people like to hear others scolding people, they will also feel annoyed if they hear too much scolding. As for those engaged in journalism, they are not spokespersons for political propagandists. They should maintain a sense of justice and a detached attitude, otherwise, they will lose the identity of a reporter.

### On Mr. Gu Chunfan's "China Industrialization Plan"

— Pingfan

Mr. Gu Chunfan's "China Industrialization Plan" proposes a five-year plan for our country, referencing the planned economy of the Soviet Union, the controlled economy of Germany, and the guided economy of the United States and Britain. It advocates implementing a mixed economy, with meticulous detail and unique ingenuity. Among recent works on China's industrialization, it is arguably unmatched since Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan." If we want to see Mr. Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood realized, this book is certainly the best reference, especially in today's era of rampant bureaucratic politics and bureaucratic capitalism. To vigorously promote economic construction, he advocates minimizing the portion of industries directly operated by the state; the executing mechanism should adopt the publicly-owned company system common in Europe and the United States; and in terms of management, the government should guide more than control. We find his intentions very thoughtful.

Unfortunately, the set of policies he advocates to be coordinated, such as slightly taxing the land of large landowners or their excess land rent, balancing ordinary income and expenditure, stabilizing the internal and external value of legal tender, stabilizing prices, strictly controlling issuance policies, reducing imports while increasing exports in trade policy, and stabilizing wages in line with prices, etc., are unlikely to be implemented as long as peaceful unification cannot be achieved. However, these are all political aspects, which the government can readily implement with determination. Only the conditions for successful industrialization mentioned by Mr. Gu in the end are the most awkward problem, and are most relevant to the future of China's industrialization. We would like to discuss them briefly as a critical friend.

Regarding the conditions of the industry itself, we will leave it to the international economy to supplement and will not mention it for now. We believe that the most important issue that cannot be left to natural selection is the problem of "the choice and preservation of traditional culture." What exactly should be chosen? What should be preserved? According to Mr. Gu: "Western industrial civilization and our traditional civilization are absolutely incompatible. The Western spirit of courage, diligence, and striving for high and great achievements is contrary to our stagnant civilization of contentment, humility, and yielding. If we want to industrialize, we must adopt this industrial spirit." He also said: "If we want to industrialize, we must reform the entire society, the entire culture. In terms of morality and thought, we must adopt the Western attitude of courage, diligence, earnestness in everything, emphasis on rights, and public morality. We must not stubbornly adhere to the traditional attitude of self-preservation, ambiguity, muddling through, and carelessness... Our inherent philosophy and inherent morality are precisely the philosophy and morality of an agricultural society. There are indeed many aspects that are valuable and worth preserving, and will be preserved. However, it is impossible to manage industrialized production with the spirit of an agricultural society and agricultural production, as Mr. Fu Sinian said, 'dragging four thousand years of garbage to catch up head-on'... Because society is a whole set, it must be completely changed. To industrialize, to plan, we must eliminate all hereditary constraints of agricultural society." There are three points in these paragraphs: First, society is a whole, and if it is to be changed, it must be completely changed; second, China's traditional civilization is a civilization produced by agricultural society and is not suitable for managing industrial production; third, there are also many things worth preserving, "If we cannot correctly understand the choice... then the process of industrialization will naturally cleanse away the unsuitable stains in the civilization and retain other harmless traditional ways of life."

Regarding the first point, it is true that modern sociologists mostly recognize that society is a whole organic body, but the universal principle that "all changes are gradual and not sudden" is still a valid principle. Any change in an organic body is slow, changing part by part. As long as it is on the road to improvement, it will always move forward. Looking at the industrial countries of Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Russia, each has its own style; we can see that the situation of social reform is not consistent and cannot be rigidly said to be completely changed. If it is handled too hastily and one speaks of being thorough at every turn, it is indeed pleasant, but if the conditions for reform are not coordinated, the result is destruction without construction. This is a common phenomenon in societies ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, which is undeniable. So-called sudden changes and creations are only occasional exceptions and cannot be forced.

The second point is also true from the perspective of people with a materialist conception of history. They apply Marx and Engels' method of explaining Western social history to explain China's social history. But is China's social history the same as Western history? Is this method of explanation correct? We agree with the "unity of mind and body." We do not think that the idealist view of "all phenomena are created by the mind" is in line with the truth, and we dare not agree with the materialist view that all spiritual civilization is built on an economic foundation. Without talking about philosophy or citing extensive sources, just from the perspective of materialism: societies of the same nature should produce civilizations of the same nature. Why, from a historical perspective, are the civilizations produced by agricultural societies in various countries not the same? Isn't it obvious that the emergence of a civilization must contain other factors and not entirely rely on the economy? Our country's "Zhou Li" and "Guanzi" are the oldest books in the world on controlled economy, and most of what they say is about the policies and systems of the industrial and commercial sectors. Could this also be an agricultural civilization produced by an agricultural society? To take a step back, agricultural civilization does not necessarily hinder the liberation of industrial productivity. Was not the British industrial revolution developed from an agricultural society? If it is said that agricultural civilization tends to be conservative, England is the most conservative nation in the world, and it is also the most rapidly progressing nation in the world. Which of the new tricks in politics, economics, and society today was not initiated by it? Western civilization since the eighteenth century can be said to have been led entirely by it. If it is said that modern industrial production is related to the French Revolution of Human Rights and the American Revolution of Independence, then Germany has never had any Revolution of Human Rights or Revolution of Independence. Its politics, economics, and society all have their own set of theories. How did it also industrialize, and even surpass others? There is no other reason than the development of science education. With the development of science education, an agricultural society can also be transformed into an industrial society; otherwise, no matter how much reform is carried out, it will not help economic construction.

Then, are there any things in Chinese society that hinder the development of science education? If so, what are they? In other words, what are the traditional civilizations of [missing word]? Mr. Gu originally wrote another book, "Industrialization and Chinese Civilization," which is said to be unpublished. We cannot guess what he said. Judging from the traditional civilizations pointed out in this book, it is probably the moral thoughts of the Buddhist and Taoist schools. Taoism advocates non-action, does not value the worthy, avoids wisdom, and does not value rare goods. It also advocates knowing the white and guarding the black, knowing the male and guarding the female, and not being the first in the world. This kind of thinking is purely negative. Therefore, it regards knowing when to stop, knowing contentment, yielding, and humility as virtues. It regards self-preservation, ambiguity, muddling through, and carelessness as the secrets of life. When applied to politics, it becomes a policy of fooling the people. When applied to economics, it becomes a small-scale, self-sufficient policy of not interacting with each other until old age and death. Although Confucianism also speaks of humility, it values the worthy. Therefore, its humility is to respect and yield to the worthy, and "when it comes to benevolence, one does not yield." Therefore, it still has a positive and constructive significance for society. It is not like Taoism, which uses retreat as a way to advance and takes giving as a way to take, all out of hypocritical and insidious calculations. Confucianism also speaks of self-preservation, but not entering dangerous countries and not living in chaotic countries refers to not being in a position of power. If one is in a position of power, one should act bravely for what is right, even sacrificing oneself for righteousness. It cannot be confused with the Taoist's single-minded "harmonizing with the light and assimilating to the dust" and "floating and sinking with the world." In short, Chinese society has been dominated by the negative thoughts of Buddhism and Taoism for more than two thousand years, which is very common and very deep-rooted. Therefore, traditional culture stagnated very early and changed its nature. Confucianism is just placed aside as a show. Since the Qin Dynasty, the true Confucian doctrines have never been applied once. The Thirteen Classics are just tools for scholars to seek fame and wealth. Some superficial people still insist that Confucianism is the orthodoxy of Chinese social thought, unwittingly acting as a shield for Buddhism and Taoism. Some enthusiastic reformers believe that old culture is all created by Confucianism, and that to reform old culture, they must overthrow Confucius and overthrow Confucianism. This is extremely unfair. What I want to say today is to clearly point out the Buddhist and Taoist theories that have been hiding behind and dominating my country's social, economic, and political affairs for thousands of years, so that everyone knows that if we want to talk about reform, we must first reform the negative spirit of Buddhism and Taoism. This spirit not only holds back my country from evolving, but also unconsciously makes us go backwards. If we do not get rid of it, how can we think of developing productive forces?

Spring and Autumn

### Memories of the Double Tenth

— Juefei

A northern autumn morning, the crystal clear and warm sunlight shines on the Western Hills. The side that receives the sunlight shows a reddish-brown color, while the side that the sunlight does not reach is a dark purple; it reminds people of the light ochre landscape in Chinese paintings, and the subtlety of the brushwork can truly capture the charm of nature. "The grass in Jiangnan does not wither at the end of autumn," and it can also be seen in the wilderness of Youyan. The leaves of the willows are a little withered and yellow, and the sorrowful wind of the night has scattered some on the ground, but in the morning light, they have regained their graceful dancing waists. As for the thick and strong locust trees, they are not easily moved by the wind, and still maintain their lush and verdant appearance. The autumn scenery around the Double Ninth Festival is always like this. It makes people feel the passage of time and evokes endless past events.

This year's Double Tenth Festival was embellished in such scenery. It was clearly the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and Li Yuanhong had just been reinstated. On this morning, a military parade was held in the barracks of the West Garden. Since the victory of the First World War in the seventh year of the Republic of China, a celebration military parade was held under the presidency of Xu Shichang, but years of internal strife had long prevented such a formal gathering with international etiquette. Moreover, since the Hongxian Imperial Restoration Movement, the legitimate status of the Beijing government had been shaken, and there had been no opportunity to formally invite foreign guests to commemorate the National Day. Presumably, the uniforms of the military police were worn and old, the carriages and horses of the officials were not complete, and it was necessary to find a special way to issue a sum of money for the ceremony from the salt surplus. Li was supported by Wu Peifu and reinstated. Before taking office, he sent a telegram with the condition of abolishing military governors and disbanding troops. Li's reinstatement could symbolize the end of the previous National Protection Movement and the opposition to Yuan Shikai, and for a time, people felt that he was coming later and getting better. His first cabinet, headed by Wang Chonghui, once co-signed the article "Our Political Propositions" with Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shi in "Endeavour Weekly," which was greatly praised by good people. This time, the National Day was especially struggling to embellish it, which was a comfort to everyone. However, while embellishing, a political storm had already occurred, and the Wang cabinet was shaken by the Cao faction, and Li's political destiny had been determined. His formal attendance was the first and the last time; not only him, but the National Day military parade of the Beijing government never appeared again.

The past is still clearly before my eyes. Li's stalwart and solid body, his humble and dignified attitude, were even more suitable for appearing in this kind of scene. When he stepped into the parade ground, he must have been recalling the old dream of Wuchang eleven years ago. The commander-in-chief this time was Wang Huaiqing, who was old. Li rode on a white steed and set out for the inspection. The President's pennant led the way in front, galloping freely, raising his hand to salute from time to time, and the black feather crown on his head turned up layers of snow waves in the breeze. This kind of black feather is soft and drooping, and is very precious. Among the other attendants, only the feather crowns of diplomats and Mongolian nobles were pure white curly hair, and the senior military and police officers only had silk tassels. This group of people's military uniforms were probably only worn once again when Zhang Zuolin took the position of Grand Marshal.

This was the barracks of the Qing Dynasty's Imperial Guards. The Cloud-Dispelling Hall of Longevity Hill and Wangquan's Pagoda stood tall on the right, and the ruins of the Old Summer Palace stretched across the left. The stone slabs on the driveway had been trodden by countless horses' hooves, and the branches of the trees waving in the wind had seen off countless crowns, robes, swords, and pendants. I often silently pondered this in the shadow of the setting sun.

### Wuchang Uprising Anecdote: Was Li Yuanhong Dragged Out from Under the Bed?

— Lu Danlin

In the year before the founding of the Republic of China, on October 10th, the revolutionary patriots launched an uprising in Wuchang. At that time, it was very much like a leaderless group. For the position of governor, according to the status of the revolutionary party at that time, Liu Gong, as the general manager of the Progressive Association, was more suitable, followed by Sun Wu and Jiang Yiwu, but they were either injured and stayed in the hospital, or could not take office due to traffic obstruction. At that time, some people focused on Li Yuanhong because the party members who launched the uprising at that time were from the grassroots, and they were afraid that it would be difficult to call on the people. Li was a Qing army general and was well-liked by the soldiers. Supporting him as the leader seemed to be the choice of the moment. Therefore, the situation creates heroes (?), and Li Yuanhong took advantage of the opportunity, so he was supported as the governor. Li also had a smooth sailing because of this, from governor to vice president to president.

Why do we say that Li Yuanhong's appointment as governor was taking advantage of the opportunity? Because Li was not a revolutionary party at all, and had absolutely no understanding of revolutionary doctrines. He was only forced out and relied on the opportunity to muddle through in the politics of the Republic of China for more than ten years, earning the nickname "Li Bodhisattva." Obviously, we can see what kind of person Li was.

Speaking of Li's origin, it can also be a laugh. What exactly was it like? In many historical events, he was dragged out from under the bed in his house. As Wen Gongzhi's "Revolutionary History of the Republic of China" (reprinted in March of the 17th year of the Republic of China) says:

"At that time, the revolutionary army still had no leader (Sun Wu was injured and had not recovered due to manufacturing bombs in Hankou. The leaders who stayed in Shanghai could not reach Hubei for a while). It was proposed that Li Yuanhong, the commander of the new army, should be the leader. Zhang Zhenwu and Fang Wei went to Li Yuanhong's residence. Li was under the bed. Zhang Zhenwu found him and forced him to come out as the governor, otherwise he would be shot to avoid disturbing the hearts of the new army. Li Yuanhong had no choice but to reluctantly agree..."

This clearly says that Li was under the bed and was forced out by the party members. Zou Lu's "Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang" (first edition in the 27th year of the Republic of China, reprinted in the 33rd year of the Republic of China) says the same thing as Wen Gongzhi, with minor differences, such as: "After the three towns of Wuhan all fell into the hands of our army, a plan was made to organize a military government.

"...Liu Gong was in Hankou and could not cross the river in a hurry. The Huang Yu, etc. who were invited had not arrived yet, and a candidate could not be found urgently. Liu Gengzao said: 'Commander Li Yuanhong is now in the city. If it is suitable to choose him, we should guide him.' Everyone agreed. Cai Jimin led a few comrades to go with Liu. Li heard the noise and hid under the bed in the room. Cai and others took him out and supported him to the Consultation Bureau." Just looking at these two paragraphs, they are already different. Wen Gongzhi said that Zhang Zhenwu and Fang Wei went to Li's residence, while Zou Lu said that Cai Jimin led several comrades and went with Liu Gengzao. Although the people who went were different, Li hiding under the bed was the same. In the past twenty or thirty years, whether in books or in oral transmission, almost everyone said that Li Yuanhong was hiding under the bed in his own residence and was dragged out by the party members. This kind of writing or oral transmission is mostly hearsay and not a writing by someone who personally participated in this battle. It is inevitable that there are other effects, or that it is passed on by mistake, and it becomes a joke in the founding history. Now let's excerpt the writings of the party members from Hubei who are also veteran comrades who participated in the revolution in the two lakes, which is naturally more credible. Cao Yabo's "True History of the Wuchang Revolution" (published in the 19th year of the Republic of China) says:

"...After a while, Ma Rong and Cheng Zhengying reported that Li Yuanhong, the commander of the 21st Mixed Brigade, was still in Wuchang City, and they had a bodyguard of Li Yuanhong who came as proof. Wu Zhaolin then ordered Ma Rong, Cheng Zhengying, etc. to lead a platoon of soldiers, guided by the captured bodyguard of Li Yuanhong... Ma Rong, Cheng Zhengying, etc. led the team to Liu Wenji's house in Huangtupo, first surrounding the house before and after, and then breaking into the door. The momentum was turbulent. Liu's bodyguard asked what they were here for. The crowd said they were here to invite Commander Li. The bodyguard did not dare to point the way and did not answer. So the crowd went straight to the bedroom to search. At this time, Li Yuanhong had lost his mind, and his anxious state was revealed in his expression..."

This says that the party members who went were Ma Rong and Cheng Zhengying, guided by Li's bodyguard to Liu Wenji's house, not Li's residence, and Li was not hiding under the bed, only saying that he was searched in the bedroom. Hu Zushun, a party member who participated in the Wuhan Uprising, wrote "Sixty Talks About the Past" (published in June of the 33rd year of the Republic of China) saying:

"At that time, it was almost dawn. First, Xiong Bingkun sent Tang Qifa to lead a detachment to patrol the area around Zhonghe Gate. He caught sight of someone carrying a leather suitcase coming out of the residence of Li Yuanhong, the commander of the Mixed Brigade. Qifa and others suspected that he was a robber and stopped him. They asked where he came from and where he was going. They learned that he was Li's cook. Li ordered him to take it out and move it elsewhere to hide it secretly. After repeated questioning, they learned that Li had fled to the house of his staff officer Liu Wenji in Huangtupo. Qifa and others had visited Li but could not find him, so they followed him. Li happened to be sitting and talking with his executive officer Wang Anlan, etc. Seeing Qifa and others suddenly arrived, he was caught off guard and, without asking the reason, he was startled and said: 'I, Li, have always been kind to the army. Why do you come to plot against me!' The crowd said: 'No, we are not here to harm the commander, but to invite the commander to come out and preside over the overall plan.'" According to this, those who went to Liu Wenji's house were not Zhang Zhenwu and Fang Wei, nor Cai Jimin and Liu Gengzao, nor Ma Rong and Cheng Zhengying, but Tang Qifa. The location was not Li's residence, but the home of Li's staff officer Liu Wenji. Tang Qifa went after getting a clue from patrolling. He did not report to other fellow comrades, and invited Li out. When he met Li, Li was talking with Wang Anlan and was not hiding under the bed in his own residence. Among the narratives, Hu Zushun's writings are more detailed. Hu was a cadre who participated in this battle, and this statement is more reliable. Zhang Nanxian's "Record of Knowledge of the Hubei Revolution" (published in November of the 34th year of the Republic of China) was published last among the party histories, and Zhang was a comrade who participated in the Wuhan Uprising. The book says:

"...Provincial Councilor Liu Gengzao (zi Xiaochen, from Baokang) said: 'Commander Li Yuanhong is now in the city. If it is suitable to choose him, we should guide him.' Everyone agreed. Cai Jimin led a few comrades to go with Liu. First, Ma Rong and Tang Qifa patrolled the streets and saw a servant carrying three leather suitcases out of Li's residence. They suspected that he was a bandit and questioned him. The servant claimed to have been ordered by Commander Li to come and fetch them. They asked where the commander was, but he did not dare to answer. After being forced to ask, he agreed to guide them to Liu's house in Huangtupo, pointing out where Li was. Li heard the noise and hid in the room. Ma Tang urged him to come out. Li shouted and came out, saying: 'I have led troops for more than ten years, and I ask myself that I have treated you well. Why are you making things difficult for me!' The crowd said: 'We have no malice, we are asking the commander to come out and preside over the overall plan.' Li said: 'There are many talented people in the revolutionary party. What do you need me for?'..."

Zhang's narrative is roughly the same as Hu Zushun's. The only difference is the number of suitcases carried by the servant, one and three. Hu said that Li was talking with Wang Anlan when Tang Qifa and others suddenly arrived. Zhang said that when Tang Qifa and others arrived at Liu's house, Li hid in the room. Whether he hid under the bed was not mentioned, only saying that Ma Tang and others urged him to come out.

From the above statements, it seems that the reason why the revolutionary party members looked for Li Yuanhong to take office as governor was to use Li's prestige in the new army at that time to facilitate calling on and commanding the troops. As for Li being forced out, it was not in his own residence, but in the home of his staff officer Liu Wenji, which is credible. Who went to find him, it is more credible to compare Ma Rong, Tang Qifa, and Cheng Zhengying. When Tang and others arrived at Liu's house, Li heard the noise and hid in the room in a panic, which is also reasonable. Because Li refused to come out of the room, Ma Tang and others urged him to come out. The meaning of "urged" is very subtle.

In short, Li Yuanhong was not a revolutionary party member. When he encountered the revolutionary party members' uprising, he thought of escaping and hiding. Even when he was supported to Chu Wangtai, he said: "You are making things too noisy. How can this be!" (See "Record of Knowledge of the Hubei Revolution") When the crowd asked Li to issue an order to fight, Li said: "Although the Governor's Office has fallen, Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao are on the run. Once the land and water forces attack, there will be no reinforcements and no food and salaries. Are you prepared? I once studied the navy. If warships such as the Haiqi are used, Wuchang can be completely destroyed with just three cannons. You don't know the pros and cons. I advise you to go back to the camp and rest, and discuss it again." (See "Sixty Talks About the Past") These are all counter-revolutionary arguments. Later, Li Yidong took a pre-written proclamation to the people and asked Li to write the word "Li" under the title of Governor, but Li refused. Li immediately threatened with a gun, but Li still refused. Finally, Li wrote it on his behalf in anger and handed it over to the secretary to copy and post throughout the city. Zhang Binglin's "Li Gong Stele" said "...There was no suitable candidate for the commander, and because the public was good at appeasement, they all intended to support the public. It was decided three months ago, and the text was secretly written and signed, calling the Grand Governor Li, but he did not know it." These words were spoken by Zhang Binglin to please him. Although the Wuhan revolutionary party members had a saying about recommending Li Yuanhong as governor in advance, they did not pre-print the text in the name of Li Yuanhong three months ago. Moreover, the word "Grand" was not on top of the Governor. These were all words of praise and flattery in Zhang's tomb for Li.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 58

— Ye Jingfeng

"Let me first read you a few sentences from a letter; listen," Mr. W pulled out a stack of stationery, flipping through several pages. I had seen this stack of stationery in Changxindian, so as soon as it caught my eye, I knew it was the long letter Yaoqun wrote to Tsurumi: "—Dear Tsurumi, the teacher you introduced to me, although he is a foreigner, seems to know more about our country's customs, military affairs, and politics than the average military and political figure in our own country. He has constantly provided me with insights into the world situation and the current state of our country. Having received his instruction, I believe I now understand where my post is and what my duties are! Dear Tsurumi, humans are certainly emotional beings, but human emotions don't necessarily have to be placed on romance between men and women. There is a lot of work that requires our full enthusiasm. I dare not say this is my new discovery, but I am writing it out now to give you a guarantee; a guarantee that I will never let my emotions hinder your career..."

Mr. W, fearing that I would be impatient to listen further, quickly said, "Listen to these important words below," and emphasized again as he read the letter, "...Dear Tsurumi, I repeat again and again that since you have created me, you must have a use for me. I am now requesting you to give me a task that is not too burdensome. In the Northeast, north of the Yellow River, even Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, I am willing to go. No matter what the job is, even if it's guerrilla warfare, being a spy, enlisting in the army, I am willing to do it, just not willing to be idle with nothing to do..." Mr. W paused here, as if to catch his breath, and then said, "Listen..."

"Dear Tsurumi—if this letter still receives no response, I must first apologize to you—I am preparing to act on my own... In the village, I often heard that Gu Ruzhen in Tong County wants to turn the Hebei area into a second Northeast to please his Japanese masters. I really want to get rid of him. It's just a pity that I've never met him before, and I don't know what he looks like; it will take some time to figure that out... I'm telling you this to let you know how determined I am!"

Mr. W finished reading here, and then carefully and neatly put down that large stack of stationery. He then took out a piece of Japanese-style paper, smiled at me, "The person who wrote this letter probably guessed that. I'll read out the things related to Yaoqun, and you'll probably understand how important her and Hucheng's mission in Tong County is." Saying this, he unfolded Tsurumi's letter, silently read a few lines, and then said to me, "Listen..."

### A Wish

— Shao Fu

The cross is the most sacred and solemn symbol; the Christian cross represents greatness, salvation, and sacrifice; the Crusades represent glory and liberation; our National Day, Mr. Wu Zhihui discovered that the date was October 10th in the Gregorian calendar and named it Double Tenth Festival. It is indeed a coincidence, and the two crosses, thinking about it today, do have a double meaning of suffering.

However, "ten" also represents "complete," hence the common saying "ten out of ten, perfect." If we could seize the opportunity during the past thirty-four festivals, work diligently and without fault, and not abandon ourselves to despair, our days would not be so difficult, and the country would certainly be able to achieve prosperity, strength, health, and happiness.

May the days of double suffering from internal and external troubles end from now on, and may we happily celebrate the 36th National Day next year.

### Thirty-Five Years Ago Today, Memories Stir

— S.S.

Beijing held a national celebration meeting at Liulichang this afternoon.

One hundred thousand people attended. After performing a new revolutionary drama, some young people gathered outside the city gate, holding scissors in wait. Anyone with a queue (braid) had to have it cut off before entering the city, otherwise they would be beaten to death. Therefore, the crowd remained silent, allowing their queues to be cut off. In an instant, the queues piled up into a small mountain, and cheers thundered.

The Shanghai YMCA held a Restoration Commemoration Meeting today. Sun Yat-sen was invited to give a speech, accompanied by the hosts Wu Tingfang, Li Denghui, and Wang Zhengting. After the speech, everyone shouted three times, "Long live the Republic of China, Sun, Sun, Sun!" Then they shouted three times, "Long live the Republic of China, Wu, Wu, Wu!" (referring to Wu Tingfang).

During the lantern parade held by various circles in Shanghai in the evening, in order to reclaim rights, there was a "No Cigarette Smoking Parade" float, with a platform erected on it, illuminated by electric lights. On it, an actor played the scene of someone being arrested by Indian police for "smoking," which was very realistic and shocking.

Military and Civilians Rejoice Together

Today, 16,000 infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers were lined up on both sides of Hadamen Street in Beiping, standing solemnly and majestically all day long. During the military review ceremony, the former Qing Kharachin Prince and Mongolian-Tibetan Lama Bishops were invited to attend. The Inner Mongolian Living Buddha, wearing a yellow robe, slowly rode towards the stage in a large, two-wheeled yellow carriage. The wheels were large and the body was extremely high, resplendent and magnificent, attracting everyone's attention.

Li Yingshi, the "Commander of the Shanghai Defense Army," and Commander Liu Chuanqi of the "Fu Zi Camp" rewarded each soldier under their command with one small ocean coin and suspended drills for one day to commemorate the occasion. At the same time, Mr. Kikurimon, the general manager of the Shanghai French Tramway Company, personally went to the Western District Municipal Hall and said that in commemoration of the National Day, his company expressed its "sympathy" and, considering the congestion of pedestrians, agreed to change the "express trams" to "slow trams" during the day.

The Suzhou Revitalization Company planned to pilot rickshaws in the city starting on National Day, but it was strongly opposed by the citizens' communes of Shangxia Tang in the central city. They all believed that the streets were narrow, and if rickshaws were allowed, each store would have to demolish three feet of their frontage, which was impossible to agree to. They had jointly petitioned the Civil Affairs Director and the Police Bureau to prohibit the operation of rickshaws, and planned to use force as a last resort.

Learning from the Past

On the Double Tenth Festival of the first year of the Republic of China, the "Shen Bao" Free Talk published a short article that is still worth reading despite the passage of time: "What day is today? It is the first National Day of the Republic of China. Colorful flags are raised high, and the whole country is jubilant, but a careful examination of national affairs is truly touching; in terms of domestic affairs, opinions are divided, and people fight among themselves; in terms of diplomacy, the great powers are watching, and recognition is uncertain; in terms of finance, the Agricultural Minister looks up to the roof, and resources are exhausted; in terms of military affairs, there is no way to disarm, and rumors of war are frequent; the people have no sense of patriotism, and there are many rebellious elements in the border areas. The land is scarred, and how can one bear to look back? The road ahead is full of thorns, and how can one not be heartbroken? On this commemorative occasion, there is even more endless sighing. How can one force oneself to follow the crowd and engage in idle entertainment?"

Today, the Shanghai Dan Gui First Stage is performing Liu Hongsheng's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," the China Grand Theater Wang Youchen, Yu Zhenting, is performing "Losing the Empty City," "Chopping Ma Su," and "Yan Yang Lou," the Great Stage Mai Biyun, Lu Yueqiao, are performing "Cui Ping Mountain," the New New Stage Li Jirui is performing "The Great Guanyin Temple." Not only are there no movies or dramas, no traces of "de di," but also no unsightly gimmicks such as "splitting cotton" and "opera fan families." Everything is hard work; people and customs are declining, and I miss these people with their primitive characters!

### People Should Not Fear Conscription; The Government Should Do a Good Job

— Li Cun

The revised Conscription Law has been passed in the 308th session of the Legislative Yuan. It stipulates that all men of the Republic of China from the age of eighteen to forty-five have the obligation to perform military service. This matter has already caused fear and unease among many people. The news that "conscription is about to begin" is being spread around! As if a great disaster is about to befall them. In fact, this is not surprising, our compatriots' level of knowledge is too low. Most people have not been able to understand the meaning of the conscription system. On the one hand, because conscription is a system that was established only after the Anti-Japanese War, the time is too short. On the other hand, because the southeastern coastal areas fell very early, conscription has never been implemented at all, and its current implementation is a pioneering effort. It is inevitable that some people will misunderstand. What's more, the worst thing during the Anti-Japanese War was the "eight-year conscription system," so "conscription" seems to be a terrifying topic for most people.

Why Conscript?

First, serving in the military is an obligation that every citizen should fulfill, especially in democratic countries. Since the country belongs to all citizens, then the responsibility of defending the country should naturally be borne by all citizens. The meaning of conscription is to call on every citizen to have a preparation for defending their own territory. Every citizen must first receive military training in order to have the ability to defend their own country.

Second, in terms of the current international situation: Although victory has been more than a year, the permanent peace between nations has not been established. On the contrary, the struggle between nations is becoming more and more obvious and widespread. We certainly absolutely hope for permanent world peace, but the facts tell us that this lofty ideal is not easy to realize. It is possible that in the near future, there will be another inevitable bloodshed in the world. Countries without the ability to defend themselves cannot exist in the current situation. We are now conscripting not because we want to invade others, but to defend ourselves. Therefore, it is said that the current implementation of the conscription system is extremely meaningful in this era.

Third, modern warfare is scientific warfare, and all weapons apply the principles of science. Therefore, modern soldiers must have rich scientific knowledge and healthy physiques to be qualified. Our country has always implemented the recruitment system, and only those who have no other living skills are willing to become soldiers. The low level is inevitable. The current implementation of the conscription system is aimed at this drawback. All those who are qualified for conscription must be relatively outstanding citizens. In this way, serving in the military is not only the obligation of a citizen, but can even be said to be the right of an outstanding citizen.

If every citizen can understand the meaning of conscription, they probably will no longer feel fear towards it, but will feel interested in it and enthusiastically respond to the call.

However, having said that, the conscription that starts now must never be as terrible as it was during the Anti-Japanese War!

### Cruel and Vicious: The Terrifying Germ Warfare

— Zheng Fan

In this extremely dangerous international situation, when everyone is worried about the inevitability of a third world war, some people have predicted that the future war will definitely be a "biological war." Sensitive American writers are frantically imagining biological warfare in the Third World War in their articles.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington reported on the 6th of this month, Fan Weite of the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Corps claimed: "The United States has invented several poisons that are a thousand times more powerful than the poison gas of the First World War to prepare for future biological warfare." Mr. Fan also issued a warning: "If biological warfare does occur in the future, we must not only make defensive preparations, but also make offensive preparations." Although this unsettling news has been mentioned in newspapers from time to time not long ago, it does not feel sudden. But if you close your eyes and think about it, when the Third World War begins, the belligerent countries will use countless cruel and poisonous bacteria to create "artificial infections." One ounce of "germ powder" can poison 180 million people weighing 165 pounds (report to Congress by the U.S. Naval Bureau of Biological Warfare). Such a terrifying number truly makes people sigh, "If the war starts again, humanity will be destroyed."

Legal or Illegal?

However, the interpreters of biological warfare believe that this kind of war is not "illegal," because "infectious diseases are very "natural" and "ordinary" things." Moreover, they loudly proclaim: "Biological warfare is no more "barbaric" than bayonet fighting." That Mr. Fan Weite also said: "I completely disagree with the humaneness of raising weapons. What is truly inhumane is war. If you can make a weapon illegal, you can make war illegal." Whether it is "legal" or not? Whether it is "barbaric" or not? Let's not talk about it. First, let's describe some of the invention history of bacterial weapons:

Everyone knows that both Germany and Japan attempted to use bacteria in warfare during World War II. According to the captured German scientist Schleber at the Nuremberg Tribunal, Hitler once ordered General Goering to prepare for bacterial warfare. The Lange Research Institute was established in Posnan, Poland. Later, due to the continuous advance of the Soviet army, which was close to the German border, the research work could not continue. In the winter of 1944, the US Office of Strategic Services received a report that the country wanted to use rockets infected with bacteria to attack, but it was not realized. Japan also attempted to put a large number of bacteria in paper balloons and "gift" them to the United States, but the result was useless.

Three Years Ago, Research Began

In the spring of 1943, the United States established a special laboratory in Maryland to engage in research on biological warfare. The Navy Department also implemented the "Biological Warfare Program." In the winter of that year, in order to prevent Germany from using bacterial warfare, a mutual factory was established in Indiana to cultivate a large number of bacterial intermediaries. In Berkeley, California, a hidden research laboratory was also established. In June 1944, the Chemical Warfare Department, with the support of the Army Medical Department, presided over the matter, and there was close cooperation from the Navy and Interior personnel. The United States had prepared to use these "well-nourished" bacterial warriors for the final general attack after the atomic bombs were dropped, if Japan still refused to surrender.

According to news currently revealed by the United States: The United States currently has five "germ factories" that can use germs for warfare at any time, with power far exceeding that of atomic bombs. The manufacturing of bacterial weapons is not as troublesome as atomic bombs. Any brewery or university laboratory can engage in it. The cost is quite "economical." The funding for researching bacterial weapons during this war was only below 50 million US dollars in total, compared to the 2 trillion of the atomic bomb budget - it can truly be said to be "cheap and good."

What is the strategic importance of using biological warfare as an offensive weapon? American authorities say it is "unlimited." When this place is attacked, you cannot see them, smell them, or taste them. By the time you slowly begin to suspect, half of the residents of this place have died. Everything from the five grains to living things is of course needless to say.

There are Limits to Use

But in fact, its effectiveness is also limited, because biological warfare weapons are uncontrollable things. They are dangerous to both the aggressor and the invaded. They can only be used as a "last resort" weapon. Moreover, the enemy will not use biological warfare in his own country to deal with an aggressor, because this would endanger his own country with an epidemic.

The progress of science has taken human warfare from primitive warfare using stone tools, knives, guns, cannons, bombs, tanks, atomic bombs, all the way to "biological warfare." Is the great massacre of mankind really unavoidable? We are eagerly seeking peace, seeking that these advanced weapons have "no use for them"!

### "Tough General" Wang Yaowu

— Sheng Jie

Someone once said: "The two military leaders of Shandong, one is Wang Yaowu, who sits in Jinan, and the other is Chen Yi, who occupies Linyi. They are tough generals against tough generals."

At present, in Shandong Province, only the two most complete territories, Jinan and Qingdao, are under the control of the National Army. Although the rest of the places have National Army stationed there, they cannot be completely controlled. Under this environment, Wang Yaowu sits calmly in Jinan, maintaining Shandong's security, which is truly a thankless task. And the fact that Jinan is still under the protection of the National Army, and the people are spared liquidation, cannot but be attributed to General Wang Yaowu and his heroic brothers.

Regarding the background of the tough general: Tai'an, Shandong, is his hometown. From an early age, he was naturally combative and often took pride in victory. Therefore, he stepped into Whampoa. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, he fought from Shanggao to Changde, from Hunan to Jiangxi. He won unprecedented victories in both battles. Before the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he created another "Hunan-Western Victory." Therefore, everyone calls him an indestructible and unbreakable tough general. Recently, among China's young generals, he is a remarkable figure. Now, he is the commander of the Second Pacification Zone.

Nine years ago, he was the commander of the 51st Division. After this long Anti-Japanese War, he went from division commander, army commander, deputy commander of the group army, commander of the group army, commander of the front army, all the way to today's commander of the pacification zone. Among the many battles, his most significant achievements were the Shanggao Battle, the Changde Defense Battle, and the Hunan-Western Victory. The success of these three battles fully demonstrated his command ability. All of his superiors and subordinates have such comments: "Bold and meticulous, decisive and composed" is his only specialty.

I remember that after he took over as the commander of the 74th Army, he still respected and revered the former army commander Yu Jishi as he had in the past, and even consulted the old army commander on some important issues.

There is an important condition for winning battles: winning the assistance of friendly forces and close connection. General Wang understands this point very well. In the Hunan-Western campaign, Wang Yaowu benefited from the support and coordination of his friendly forces (Tang Enbo's army) behind him, thus creating a great victory. After each battle began, General Wang paid special attention to reporting the military information he obtained to the friendly forces, and in the telegrams or telephone conversations, he was very sincere and humble, thus gaining the favor of the friendly forces. These are all small details, but they are also his secrets to success.

Today, his position is not small, but he is not arrogant at all. He is very humble in dealing with people. He will not easily use military secrets as an excuse to sell "news secrets" to show off his superior position. Moreover, he will also sincerely ask for advice from general scholars, celebrities, and social elites. It is precisely because of this that makes people have a more profound understanding of him politically, and people call him an all-round military and political general. His life is quite strict. It is said that in his life, no romance can be found.

### "To Establish the Republic, To Advance to the Great Harmony!"

— Sun Ke

Congratulating the Double Tenth Festival of the 35th Year of the Republic of China

Last year, today, being just the second month after the victory, I once stated the following belief in a National Day commemorative article: The first major event after the victory of the War of Resistance is peaceful nation-building. This is our responsibility to the country and the world, and it is also the most urgent hope of the people of the whole country. Our nation-building undertaking is allowed to succeed, not to fail. It is expected that many unexpected difficulties will be encountered in the process of nation-building, but any difficulty must be overcome, any deadlock must be broken, and any problem must be solved. In the end, only the Three Principles of the People are the basic principles for solving national affairs, and only the interests of the people are the biggest factor in determining national policy. This is my consistent belief that I have always maintained.

Today, the National Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China has arrived again. Under the current turbulent internal and external situation of the country, we are welcoming this annual National Day with heavy hearts. Thinking back, since the founding of the Republic of China by the Founding Father, it has been more than a third of a century. However, the past work of the National Revolution has obviously remained at the stage of nationalism; as for the two major principles of democracy and people's livelihood, they have not been thoroughly implemented to this day. At present, our country, which has suffered so much, is still walking on a rugged and dangerous road. While we are heartbroken, we cannot help but hope that the work of "revolutionary destruction" should come to an end in the future! What the people of the whole country are praying for day and night is to follow the nation-building plan left by the Founding Father internally, and all parties and factions should work together to build a new democratic and unified country. Externally, we should adhere to the principles of the "United Nations," get along with all federal states in a friendly manner, cooperate equally, and ensure lasting peace in East Asia and even the world. This is also the realization of the "Great Harmony World" ideal of the Three Principles of the People.

Based on the above two hopes, I deeply feel that today's China is very similar to the United States after the War of Independence. At that time, the United States had just gotten rid of the oppression of foreign forces, and the home foundation was still very fragile, and the relationship between the thirteen states was even more chaotic. Later, the US government and the people were able to adopt peaceful means, and the constitutional conference achieved the goal of unified nation-building. Of course, the political systems and political ideals of China and the United States are not necessarily exactly the same, but their spirit of peaceful nation-building is indeed worthy of our emulation.

Look around, now there are fires everywhere within the borders, and the whole country is full of devastation. The people of the whole country are in deep water and suffering. Not only have they not enjoyed the fruits of victory at all, but the sacrifices and losses suffered by the people now are even greater than during the war. What is even more serious is that the failure to resolve domestic political problems has caused China's international status to plummet; at the same time, due to the crisis in the social economy and the corruption of the political atmosphere, it has led to the current phenomenon of the people's livelihood being declining and prices soaring. To solve the current dangerous situation, we can only rely on everyone to wake up and introspect, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, and build a modern country based on the Three Principles of the People. This is the only way out for China in the future. If we want the nation-building cause to be completed smoothly, we must first complete democracy and unity. To go a step further: In order to achieve unity, the army must be nationalized and the nationwide war must be stopped. We should follow President Chiang's declaration: "Politics must be resolved by political means" to solve the people's suffering and save the country's crisis. In order to achieve democracy, we must start constitutional government on the one hand, implement the principle of democracy, and embark on the road of a modern democratic country; on the other hand, we must reform politics, implement the principle of people's livelihood, and thoroughly eliminate the forces of bureaucratic capital, comprador class, and local bullies and evil gentry. From today onwards, all parties should concentrate their efforts and strive for peaceful nation-building under the leadership of President Chiang. This is the first point I dare to sincerely hope for. Secondly, from the perspective of the international situation, since the victory of the war, due to the lack of mutual trust and the differences in concepts between the major allied countries, they have lost the spirit of cooperation they had during the war, and have caused the current situation of tension. In particular, the formation of the two major camps of the United States and the Soviet Union is an undeniable fact, so the horror of the Third World War is attacking everyone's heart again. Some people even believe that the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is on the verge of breaking out and there is no possibility of avoiding it. There are even a small number of troublemakers or blind people who are advocating and expecting another war to break out. Gradually, everyone has a pessimistic attitude towards the future of world peace. I think this mentality and this view are harmful and useless to the clarification of the international and domestic situation.

It should be known that any allied country after the war yearns for peace and hates war. Taking the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as an example, the United States' policy has always been to fight against aggression. Britain, after the trauma of the war, is really unable to protect itself, and has no power to launch a war. The Soviet Union was also exhausted after the war and needed a chance to recuperate. At the same time, there are no irreconcilable contradictions between the major allied countries. Although many differences have arisen in the handling of the defeated countries and territorial issues, and although the future of the United Nations still has to go through many difficult and tortuous roads, I firmly believe that with the wisdom and tolerant spirit of the politicians of the allied countries, they will definitely be able to gradually overcome them. As for those who are looking forward to and advocating the Third World War, they may think that the war can help us solve domestic problems. However, if the next war breaks out, it will be destined to destroy the lives of more than half of mankind and the collapse of culture. No country has any reason to take risks and seek luck. Therefore, we will never hope that the Third World War will happen, especially not in China or the Far East. Moreover, as a weak country, it is simply a fool's dream to want to gain an advantage in international conflicts. There is also a wrong idea that it seems that China's foreign policy has no other way to think of except being pro-American or pro-Soviet. This is an even more terrible prejudice. It should be known that we are between two major friendly countries and can only take an independent and autonomous diplomatic stance as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, and never let ourselves become the fuse of the next war, so as to plunge the entire nation into an irrecoverable situation. We are willing to sincerely cooperate equally with all allied countries to lay the cornerstone of world peace. At the same time, we also hope that our friendly countries can be open and honest, abandon their suspicions and reconcile with each other, restore the spirit of cooperation during the war, and eliminate the psychology of suspicion and infighting, so as to thoroughly realize the ideal of the United Nations. This is the second point that I sincerely hope for.

### Historical Anecdotes of the Double Tenth

— Information Office of this Newspaper

The special name "Double Tenth Festival" was first created by Wu Zhihui

The National Day of the Republic of China was set on October 10th by the Senate on September 28th of the first year of the Republic of China, because the day of the Wuchang Uprising was the 19th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in the year of Xinhai, which happened to be October 10th according to the new calendar. Before this, when mentioning the Xinhai Revolution, it was still calculated according to the lunar calendar. After the success of the revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China, the most popular song in schools was "The Revolutionary Army Song," the first two sentences of which said, "On the 19th day of the eighth month, the city of Wuchang, the Revolutionary Army rose up..." which still refers to the lunar calendar. As for the special name "Double Tenth Festival," it was first created by Mr. Wu Zhihui.

Li Yuanhong's appearance on the stage was due to being forcibly dragged out

In the Xinhai Wuchang Uprising, the Revolutionary Army elected Li Yuanhong as the Governor. Later, in order to seek unified appeals in the revolutionary armies of Hubei and Shanghai, Li was also elected as the Grand Marshal, with Huang Xing as his deputy. Afterwards, Li Yuanhong always occupied an extremely important position in the political situation in the early years of the Republic of China. In fact, Li's appearance on the stage was not voluntary, but was forcibly dragged out. He had a confession in a letter to his former superior Sa Zhenbing on October 18th of that year, which roughly stated:

"When the Wuchang Uprising occurred, all the troops under Hong's command had already been deployed for defense, and they were guarding the empty camp alone, at a loss. After the Party Army drove Governor Rui out of the city, they immediately led the team to Hong's camp, surrounded and searched. Hong changed into plain clothes and hid in the room (Editor's note: It is said that he hid under the bed). He was often found and charged with righteousness. At that time, guns and cannons were all around. If he didn't follow, his head would be in a different place. Hong had no choice but to agree temporarily. My teacher has always known that Hong is the most prudent and honest. How dare he do this rashly..." and so on.

The first shot in Wuchang was fired by Xiong Bingkun of the Engineering Battalion

Who fired the first shot in the Wuchang Uprising is also a very interesting question. According to the collection of lectures on the Three Principles of the People by the Premier, it was Xiong Bingkun of the Engineering Battalion. However, at that time, there were many people from Wuhan who participated in the revolutionary uprising and boasted that they were the "uprising people" who fired the first shot, such as Su Chengzhang, Mei Baoqi, Chen Honggao, Mu Hongxun, and Xie Shiqin. These people also added the three words "uprising people" to their signatures when sending telegrams and issuing declarations, in order to appeal to others. There were too many such people, which inevitably aroused suspicion, so someone changed the name of Zhen Qiemin to a short comment to ridicule them, signing himself as "non-climbing uprising person." Later, the "uprising people" actually sued the "non-uprising person" in court for defamation, but it ended without any results. This can also be regarded as an interesting story in revolutionary history.

When the Premier was in the United States, he was worried about the Wuchang Uprising

When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the Premier was in the United States, traveling around to promote the revolution to overseas Chinese, raise donations, and win the sympathy and assistance of foreign governments. On the second day of the uprising, the Premier happened to arrive in Denver, Colorado. More than ten days ago, he had received a telegram from Huang Xing from Hong Kong on the way, but because the luggage had been sent to this place in advance, and the secret telegram book was placed in it, he could not translate it on the way. After arriving in Denver, he took out the secret telegram book from the luggage and translated the telegram. The original telegram said: "Ju Zheng came to Hong Kong from Wuchang and reported that the new army must move. Please remit funds quickly." It was late at night at that time. The Premier was very tired from the journey in the car, so he went to bed and prepared to find a way the next morning. After getting up the next day, he went to the restaurant for dinner, passed the newspaper stand in the corridor, and bought a newspaper and took it into the restaurant to read. After sitting down and spreading out the newspaper, he saw a telegram that said: "Wuchang has been occupied by the Revolutionary Army." Then he knew that the revolution had already broken out.

The people's hearts were trending towards revolution, and there were many extra editions on Wangping Street

When the news of the Wuchang Uprising spread to Shanghai, people's hearts were extremely excited. All newspapers (especially those that were inclined to the revolution) greatly exaggerated and overstated the facts. For example, Hunan only announced its independence on September 1st (lunar calendar), but on August 25th, the Shanghai newspapers had already published in large letters that the Revolutionary Army had occupied Hunan. Although the readers knew that it was unreliable, the people's hearts were trending towards revolution, so as soon as the newspaper came out, it was immediately sold out. At that time, some speculators took advantage of this psychology and issued a kind of tofu-like extra edition on Wangping Street, with only a few dozen words, and the price was the same as the newspaper. Most of the news was fabricated behind closed doors, but once printed, it was immediately sold out. At most, there were more than a dozen kinds of extra editions. In front of the gates of the major newspapers on Wangping Street, it was often seen that many people were guarding and waiting to buy extra editions all day long.

The recovery of Shanghai was on September 14th (lunar calendar) of the Xinhai year. On that day, Chen Ying's army occupied the Manufacturing Bureau. In the afternoon, the military government issued a notice to appease the people. The organization of the military government included Chen Ying as the Governor, Wu Tingfang as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chu Qia Xiang as the Foreign Merchant Minister of Foreign Affairs, Li Pingshu as the Minister of Civil Affairs, Shen Jiuyun as the Minister of Finance, Wang Yiting as the Minister of Commerce, and Li Jianhe as the temporary commander of the military government.

After the recovery of Shanghai, a six-character rhyming announcement was issued

After the recovery of Shanghai, the announcement issued by the military government to appease the people was printed in Song font, with six-character popular rhyming sentences, saying:

It is known that the uprising in Wuchang, the compatriots are united. Wherever our righteous banner points, all will enthusiastically welcome. The recovery of famous cities in various provinces has never hindered peace. Shanghai, a giant port in the southeast, is famous for its trade with the world. Once a large army gathers, the damage will inevitably be not light. Now, according to the order of the military government, we only ask all sectors to show their sincerity. Now, they have all surrendered one after another, which shows that they are united against the enemy. I hope that all dear compatriots will still live in peace and be self-sufficient. Do not take this opportunity to infringe upon the lives and property of foreigners. In a blink of an eye, the Republic of China will be established, and everyone will share peace.

At the same time, there was also a notice posted by "Huang, the judicial chief of Shanghai County," which was Huang Yuanzhi. The date at the end of the notice was "The 4609th year of the Huang Emperor's reign, September 18th."

The celebration meeting in the first year of the Republic of China was unprecedented in the Liulichang, Beijing

On the Double Tenth Festival in the first year of the Republic of China, the celebration meeting in Beijing was held in Liulichang, with more than 300,000 people attending. There were pine flower arches at the east and west entrances of the venue. There were four big characters on the east arch that said "Universal Celebration," and four big characters on the west arch that said "Harmony Among All Nations." The Liulichang kiln was the venue for the meeting. A sacrificial altar was set up in the center, with a spiritual tablet on it, which read: "Spiritual tablets of all gentlemen who died for the Republic of China." There were four large pine flower arches inside and outside the front gate. The arch in the middle outside the gate had the words "For Ten Thousand Years," the arch on the east side had the words "Respect for Humanity," and the arch on the west side had the words "Promote National Glory." The arch inside the gate had the abdication edict of the Qing Empress Dowager Longyu written on it in front, followed by four big characters, which said "Celebration of the Five Races." The National Day Preparatory Committee had previously invited the abdicated Qing royal family to send representatives to attend the meeting twice. The original letter said:

"Respectfully informing you that our association will hold a National Day celebration ceremony on the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth days of October. We have already invited the personnel stationed in Beijing from various countries to attend and observe. Our association is extremely honored. Now we will respectfully send a letter to ask your Majesty the Empress Dowager and your Majesty the Emperor to send representatives to attend the meeting and share the grand event. Not only will the association be greatly honored, but the people of the five races will also receive endless happiness..." and so on.

On the Double Tenth Festival of the first year of the Republic of China, the Premier was in Shanghai. In the afternoon of that day, the Chinese Student Association held a grand National Day memorial meeting, with more than 2,000 guests attending. Dr. Wu Tingfang presided over the meeting and delivered an opening speech, which was followed by a speech by the Premier, who said:

"Last year today was the day of the Wuchang Uprising, which was the first day of the Republic of China. At that time, I was in the United States. Comrade Ju Zheng sent a telegram to Mr. Huang Keqiang in Hong Kong, asking me to raise funds to help the army. After reading the telegram, I knew that the Revolutionary Army had captured Wuchang, and I was overjoyed... But although the Republic of China has been established, it is still in a dangerous era, with internal unrest and frequent external troubles. It is like building a mansion, the foundation has been laid, and it still needs to be built. I hope that our compatriots will have an adventurous spirit, perseverance, and work together to support the government from now on, so as to create a first-class power on earth. This is what I deeply hope from you..." This passage, even to this day, thirty-four years later, is still worthy of our vigilance and deep thought.

The Shanghai Fire Brigade Association initiated the Lantern Festival in Shanghai

On the Double Tenth Festival in the fifth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai had died, and the whole country was filled with the joy of the revival of the republic again, so the celebration situation in Shanghai that year was also extremely enthusiastic, especially the Lantern Festival, which was large in scale, full of dazzling things, and beautiful. The Lantern Festival that day was initiated by the Shanghai Fire Brigade Association, and all members from the first to the seventh districts participated. At 7 pm, the Lantern Festival set off, with the cavalry patrol team and security police officers of the Songhu Police Department as the vanguard, followed by the horse team, fire trucks, and platform lanterns. Wherever they passed, firecrackers were set off to welcome them, and the sound of explosions was deafening. When they reached Zhonghua Road, students from various schools also temporarily joined the team with lanterns, and tens of thousands of people turned out into the streets, creating an unprecedented grand occasion.

### The Historical Trajectory of the Double Tenth Festival Over the Past Thirty-Five Years

— Data Room of This Newspaper

From division to unity, from bondage to autonomy, from revolution to nation-building, it has traversed a long preparatory journey, and everything begins today.

Thirty-five years is not considered a very long time in the founding history of a nation. However, the Republic of China over the past thirty-five years has experienced an extremely long and arduous journey. In the late years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, domestic affairs were corrupt, powerful neighbors were all around, and revolutionary movements seeking internal reform and external independence surged. The Manchu Qing government, with its memories of thousands of years of feudal autocracy, suddenly collapsed. However, the remaining poison of feudal thought still clung to those warlords and politicians. The newly born revolutionary forces did not thoroughly cleanse them, so the Republic, which had not been established for long, was still a mess. The Xinhai Revolution cannot be said to have been thorough in any aspect. It mistakenly believed that its only enemy was the seven-year-old emperor, not knowing that the truly formidable enemy was the remaining poison cultivated by thousands of years of autocracy. Therefore, after the Qing dynasty fell and the Republic was newly established, it compromised with those feudal forces. This first major mistake laid the groundwork for the two subsequent imperial restoration dreams and the more than ten years of regional warlordism. The great task of overthrowing autocratic feudalism hoped for by the Xinhai Revolution was not actually accomplished in the first year of the Republic but in the seventeenth year of the Republic. The completion of the Northern Expedition truly freed China from the chains of feudal forces and gradually moved from a fragmented situation towards stability and unity. The success of the Northern Expedition marked the Chinese nation overcoming its first severe trial.

However, the great cause of the National Revolution was aimed at domestic unity and reform on the one hand, and at external freedom and independence on the other. The Northern Expedition only completed the former, and the Japanese imperialists, alarmed by the powerful force of a unified China, immediately obstructed it in every possible way and constantly provoked incidents. From the Jinan Massacre to the September 18th Incident, the January 28th Incident, the Yuguan and Rehe incidents, and finally the July 7th Incident in the twenty-sixth year, China could no longer tolerate it and had to risk the life and death of the Chinese nation with its not fully prepared national strength. In the eight years that followed, after enduring countless hardships, the Chinese nation finally defeated the enemy and stood up from the ruins. Now, the unequal treaties imposed on it for a hundred years have been abolished, and the Republic of China has, for the first time in the world, an independent personality. The success of the War of Resistance was the Chinese nation overcoming its second severe trial.

But what a huge price we paid! If we briefly review the above historical facts, it is not difficult to see that in the thirty-five years since the founding of the Republic, it struggled against domestic feudal forces for seventeen years and against foreign imperialism for another seventeen years. And now, although the dual shackles have been removed, the country is still on the verge of war internally and subjected to contempt externally. How can such a situation not deserve our reflection and vigilance? On the occasion of the thirty-fifth Double Tenth Festival, we can take this opportunity to revisit the thirty-four Double Tenth Festivals that the Chinese nation has already gone through, and also trace a historical arc along this path, following its traces, so that we can understand what kind of juncture we are standing at today and what kind of road we are facing.

(I) A Fragile Starting Point

The Xinhai Revolution was originally exchanged for ten failed and painful experiences. However, after the Qing court abdicated and the Republic was established, the revolutionary forces, in their eagerness for success, ignored the Premier's repeated instructions not to compromise with counter-revolutionary forces. They mistakenly believed that those remnants of feudalism, the warlords and politicians, had truly reformed and joined the revolution. So they joined hands with them. The representative of these feudal remnants was naturally Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai was a powerful minister in the late Qing Dynasty and a major figure representing the Qing court in negotiating peace with the revolutionary army. Naturally, he did not understand the true meaning of the revolution at all. However, he was by nature cunning and sly. Seeing that the Qing court's situation was over, he pretended to advocate overthrowing autocracy and establishing a republic to create a world for himself. At that time, everyone, hoping for the success of the peace talks, did not hesitate to hand over the Republic, which they had painstakingly created, to Yuan Shikai. We know that the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution was on October 10, 1911. By February 12 of the following year, the peace talks were successful. Those with shallow vision believed that the Qing court's downfall was so rapid that it was a fortunate thing, but they did not know that it was a great misfortune for the revolution because the corrupt forces of feudalism in the north were still untouched, and the revolution had not yet established a deep and broad foundation among the vast people (this was only truly achieved around the time of the Northern Expedition). Therefore, the counter-revolutionary old forces soon raised their heads again. Although Yuan Shikai was elected as the provisional Grand President, how could he be willing to leave his own feudal lair in the north and place himself in the revolutionary atmosphere of the south? Therefore, he made all sorts of excuses. First, he said that the order was not yet stable and it was difficult to divide himself; then, he created a mutiny, claiming that only by sitting in Beijing could stability be ensured. At that time, the Senate also fell for Yuan's trick and actually agreed to him taking office in the north. It must be known that a revolutionary capital must be established in a revolutionary environment. Given the smoky atmosphere in the north at that time, it would be extremely difficult to promote revolutionary politics, which is very clear. Therefore, the Premier at that time firmly insisted that Nanjing must be the capital. In his letter of resignation, he attached three measures, the first of which was: "The location of the provisional government shall be in Nanjing, as agreed upon by the representatives of the provinces, and cannot be changed." However, most of the party members at that time did not realize this and only sought immediate success, which led to the strange drama of imperial restoration in the following four years.

In short, the scene after the birth of the Republic did not resemble the new atmosphere when a revolution had just succeeded. On the contrary, the revolutionary forces lacked unified leadership and were in turmoil, while the counter-revolutionary feudal forces took advantage of this complex situation to seize control of most of the country. The Xinhai Revolution started an unprecedented beginning in Chinese history, but it did not make good use of this beginning and carry it through to the end, inheriting the spirit of the ten revolutions. Therefore, when the first Double Tenth Festival of the Republic of China was celebrated in the first year of the Republic, looking around at the domestic and foreign situation, it seemed to be no different from the situation in the late Qing Dynasty. Domestically, the power issues between the presidential system and the responsible cabinet system were constantly disputed. The State Council was moved to the Presidential Palace, making the State Council exist in name only, and the great power was concentrated in Yuan Shikai's body. Economically, financial resources were exhausted, and the people's livelihood was declining. The only way was to borrow money from Britain and Japan. At the same time, mutinies occurred successively in Wuhu, Luoyang, Pukou, Shashi, and other places, and the order was unstable. And in terms of diplomacy, Britain was formally notifying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Tibet should not be reorganized into a province. Imperial Russia also notified the government with the Russo-Mongolian Agreement, prohibiting Chinese convoys from stationing in Mongolia. - It was under this situation of internal and external pressure that the Republic of China spent its precarious first year.

(II) The Imperial Dream

If we connect the four Double Tenth Festivals from the second to the fifth year of the Republic into a line, then we can draw the beginning and end of the first ugly drama in the history of the Republic. Yuan Shikai, after becoming the Grand President in his own nest, was always thinking about becoming an emperor. Especially after Song Jiaoren was assassinated, and the punitive expeditions against Yuan by the various superintendents of Jiangnan, such as Chen Qimei, Huang Xing, and Li Liejun (i.e., the so-called Second Revolution in history), all ended in failure, Yuan's arrogance increased. The Yangtze River area was also completely within the sphere of influence of the Beiyang warlords. On October 6th in the second year of the Republic, the Congress elected the formal Grand President. Yuan Shikai secretly instigated his followers, under the guise of public opinion, to surround the Parliament, and was thus elected.

In the Double Tenth Festival of that year, Yuan formally took office in the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City of Beijing. After the ceremony, the officials even "shouted ten thousand years three times." Afterwards, he met with the representatives of the Qing Imperial Family in the Hall of Military Glory and made a speech saying, "I am very grateful for the sincerity of the Qing Emperor's congratulations," which really made people wonder whether it was the Republic or the Qing Dynasty at this time. Yuan Shikai's assumption of the office of Grand President already represented the frustration of the revolutionary forces and the arrogance of the reactionary forces, so soon, he dissolved the Parliament, destroyed the Provisional Constitution, and the brewing of the imperial system became increasingly obvious. Those sycophantic followers under him did their best to welcome and encourage him, while people like Yang Du and Liu Shipei chanted the so-called "Monarchical Salvation Theory," touting the strange theory that "republicanism is not suitable for national conditions." At that time, the European War had broken out, and the Japanese army occupied Jinan Station and the Jiaoji Railway line. On the Double Tenth Festival of the third year of the Republic, the newspapers were filled with protests from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the occupation of the Japanese army, which made the atmosphere of National Day very bleak.

In August of the fourth year of the Republic, Yang Du and others established the Preparatory Society for National Security, and Yuan Shikai's conspiracy was now known to everyone. Before and after the Double Tenth Festival, rumors of "national system changes" spread everywhere. Yuan also created public opinion and secretly instigated Liang Shiyi and others to organize the so-called "National Petition Federation," and even so-called beggar petition groups and prostitute petition groups, were varied and strange. Fearing that the Double Tenth National Day might arouse people's thoughts of republicanism, he used the excuse that the current situation was unstable and ordered the whole country to "avoid extravagance at the time" and suspend the celebrations. Thus, the fourth National Day of the Republic of China was quietly spent in sorrow and silence.

In October, the so-called "Organization Law of the National Assembly" was promulgated. Under the control of Yang Du, Liang Shiyi, and others, 1,993 representatives were elected. Naturally, they all unanimously advocated a constitutional monarchy and elected Yuan Shikai as emperor. Yuan also ordered to formally recognize and accept the throne, changed the era name to Hongxian, and formally prepared to ascend the throne.

However, the old forces of feudalism could not resist the revolutionary upsurge after all. When the Premier saw that Yuan's ambition had been revealed, he ordered Hu Hanmin, Xu Chongzhi, and others to go to Southeast Asia to raise funds and launch an uprising, while Chen Qimei presided over it in Shanghai. The Zhaohua warship first raised the flag of punitive expedition. Although the result was unfortunately a failure, the National Protection Army led by Cai E, Tang Jiyao, and others soon launched an uprising in Yunnan and advanced towards the border between Sichuan and Guangxi. Guangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces also responded successively and declared independence. Seeing that the situation was over, Yuan still wanted to abolish the imperial system and retain his own presidential territory, but he was sternly rejected by the National Protection Army. Yuan died of illness in Xinhua Palace on June 6, in the fifth year of the Republic, amid shame and anger. The provinces then successively canceled their independence, which was fortunate because it did not cause a major war and the people were spared further suffering.

Yuan Shikai wasted five years of the history of the Republic of China. He only did one good thing in his life, which was: he died at the right time.

(III) Light in the Darkness

But Yuan Shikai's death did not mean the demise of all feudal remnants. From Yuan Shikai's death in June of the fifth year of the Republic to the Guangzhou oath-taking ceremony for the Northern Expedition in July of the fifteenth year, the history of the Republic went through a very dark period. We can use a few words to briefly describe a picture of the time: politicians, in order to compete for power and profit, formed their own groups and factions, and squabbled with each other. Politics became their own private property. Warlords occupied territory and were constantly declaring "independence." During this period, there were restoration attempts, bribery, and a complete mess. Under this situation, the only remaining bit of righteousness was the revolutionary force in the south led by the Premier.

The rise and fall of the political situation in the north during this period, as well as the chaotic wars between the Zhili, Anhui, and Zhilu warlords, are no longer important today and need not be discussed in detail. But one point must be pointed out, namely, that in the midst of these ten years of chaotic wars between politicians and warlords, the revolutionary forces have also been forged more firmly and powerfully. Here, we only need to look back at the direction of the Premier's efforts during these ten years to understand the background of the political situation at that time and the preparation process of the revolutionary forces from the side. This had a great impact on the success of the Northern Expedition later.

Since Zhang Xun's restoration in the sixth year of the Republic and the dissolution of the Parliament, the members of parliament went south one after another, gathered in Guangzhou, convened an extraordinary parliament, elected the Premier as the Grand Marshal, and established the Southern Military Government to confront the evil forces in the north. The Premier's original intention was to unite the forces in the south to form a revolutionary force to save the country. Unfortunately, some local generals still had corrupt territorial concepts and went against the Premier's plan, even changing their minds from morning to evening and creating obstacles in various ways. Seeing this situation, the Premier deeply felt that the success of the revolution could not be achieved overnight. It was necessary to deepen the revolutionary theory and establish a broad foundation on the one hand, and to establish specific strategies for nation-building on the other hand, as a guideline for national construction. In this way, the revolution could be thoroughly successful. At that time, the military government had been controlled by Cen Chunxuan, Lu Rongting, and others. In view of this, the Premier resolutely resigned and left Guangzhou for Shanghai to engage in writing, and wrote "Sun Wen's Theory" and "The Strategy of Nation Building," which became the guiding ideology of the National Revolution.

In the tenth year, the Premier returned to Guangzhou and assumed the post of Extraordinary President, actively preparing for the Northern Expedition. However, due to Chen Jiongming's sudden rebellion, the Premier's plan failed again. In the twelfth year, Cao Kun bribed to become president, and Wu Jinglian and others contracted to buy off members of parliament with huge sums of money, 5,000 yuan per vote. On the day of the election on October 5th, the members of parliament who came to vote and get money were extremely enthusiastic. According to the newspapers at that time, even those who were bedridden were carried in to vote. Thus, Cao Kun was elected as the President of the Republic of China under the support of that batch of "5,000 yuan members of parliament."

The Double Tenth Festival of the twelfth year was truly a shame in the history of the Republic. Because on this day, Cao Kun, who was elected with 5,000 yuan a vote, formally took office as President in Beijing. The Premier immediately sent a telegram to the whole country from Guangzhou, denouncing Cao Yin. At the same time, in order to cultivate the military strength of the revolution, he ordered the President to prepare the Army Military Academy in Huangpu; and in order to strengthen the organization of the revolution, he reorganized the Kuomintang in January of the thirteenth year and convened the First National Congress in Guangzhou. In his opening remarks, the Premier elaborated his hope: "The reorganization of the Kuomintang this time is firstly to organize a powerful and concrete political party; and secondly, to use the power of the political party to transform the country." After the meeting, a declaration was issued, explaining the internal and external policies of the Three Principles of the People. Later, the success of the Northern Expedition mostly benefited from the military strength of Huangpu; and the reason why the success of the Northern Expedition was so rapid was entirely due to the party's strong leadership and the deep understanding of the principles. The Premier planted the seeds of success, but before he could see them bloom and bear fruit, he passed away. However, this glimmer of dawn in the darkness was bringing the glory of dawn.

(IV) From Division to Unity

The Republic had been established for fifteen years, but everything was still a mess. In the fifteenth year, the year after the Premier's death, in July, the military situation in the south was largely stabilized. The current President then decided to inherit the Premier's will, lead his troops on the Northern Expedition, overthrow the warlords, and implement the National Revolution's advocacy for establishing a China based on the Three Principles of the People. At that time, except for a corner of Guangdong, the Central Plains and especially the North were completely under the control of warlords. The people suffered and the situation was worsening. The Northern Expeditionary Army knew that the warlords had four or five times more troops than they did, and that their weapons and financial resources were even more superior, but for the true success of the revolution, they resolutely took an oath in Guangzhou on July 9 of the fifteenth year and set off.

After the Northern Expeditionary Army set off, it was unstoppable. On the one hand, it was because the revolutionary forces after all had goals and ideals, and their morale was high, which was incomparable to the soldiers who were enslaved and driven by the warlords; and on the other hand, revolutionary ideas had already penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people at that time, and the people everywhere the Northern Expeditionary Army went really brought food and drinks to welcome them. Therefore, the country was unified in less than two years. We can use the situation before and after the three Double Tenth Festivals from the fifteenth to the seventeenth year as a basis to respectively review the progress of the Northern Expeditionary Army during this period.

Double Tenth Festival of the fifteenth year: After the Northern Expeditionary Army set off from Guangdong, it soon attacked Hunan. Wu Peifu led his troops south, and the three major battles of Tingsiqiao, Jinkou, and Zifang occurred. Wu's army retreated steadily and defended Wuchang. The Northern Expeditionary Army launched three general offensives, risking great sacrifices, and finally captured Wuchang on the Double Tenth Festival, and the central region was stabilized, and its momentum greatly increased.

Double Tenth Festival of the sixteenth year: After the two lakes were captured, Sun Chuanfang and Wu Peifu retreated to Jiangxi. The Northern Expeditionary Army gradually advanced, occupying Jiujiang and Nanchang. At the same time, He Yingqin's First Army advanced eastward from Chaozhou and Meizhou and pacified Fujian. Bai Chongxi also led his troops into Zhejiang, attacked Hangzhou, captured Shanghai, and advanced towards Nanjing. In the Battle of Yuhuatai, the battle situation was unprecedentedly fierce, the Northern Expeditionary Army bravely attacked, and Nanjing was also captured. The Jiangnan battle was over at this point. In June, the current President personally led his troops to attack Xuzhou. Yan Xishan of Shanxi also took an oath to punish Feng. At the time of the Double Tenth Festival of the sixteenth year, Shijiazhuang was occupied by the Feng army, and the northward advance was slightly frustrated.

Double Tenth Festival of the seventeenth year: In mid-April, the current President issued a general offensive order against the Zhilu army on the entire front. The Northern Expeditionary Army won victory after victory along the Jinpu line and attacked Jinan. The current President personally went to Shijiazhuang to supervise the army. Soon, Zhangjiakou and Baoding were successively recovered. Zhang Zuolin, the commander of the Feng army, saw that the situation was over and left the customs on June 3, but he was assassinated by the Japanese in Huanggu Village the next day. The Northeast automatically changed the flag, the country was unified, and the Northern Expedition was successful. Only the Double Tenth Festival of this year, the seventeenth year since the founding of the Republic, saw for the first time the prototype of a unified China, showing a light that had never been seen in the past seventeen years.

(V) Nine Years of Bearing Humiliation and Heavy Burdens

After the Northern Expedition was successfully completed, the warlords disappeared, and the country was unified, the first stage of nation-building work was completed at this point. The National Government believed that since the country had been unified from division, it could then move from destruction to construction, and begin the nation-building work that had been repeatedly obstructed since the Xinhai Revolution and had not yet begun. In the seventeenth year, after the success of the Northern Expedition, in the month that the current President made an offering at the tomb of the late Premier in Xishan, he made eight oaths to himself, the first of which was:

"After destruction, construction is urgently needed. My Premier's posthumous works, the Outline of National Construction and the Strategy of National Construction, have clear provisions on the procedures and programs. As long as all comrades firmly believe in and practice them, it will not be difficult to build a new country based on the Three Principles of the People and complete the entire task of the National Revolution."

Therefore, during the nine years from the seventeenth year to the start of the full-scale War of Resistance in the twenty-sixth year, the goal of the National Government was to sort out the mess of a country that had been plagued by wars and then bury itself in construction, enrich its national strength, and ensure that the country really had the strength to achieve internal unity and reform, and to seek freedom and independence externally. Under this goal, from the seventeenth year onwards, national education, economic, financial, transportation, drug control, and other conferences, as well as the Supreme Military Council, were held one after another, and active preparations were made for the reorganization of the army and all nation-building plans. In the Double Tenth Festival of that year, the current President took office as the Chairman of the National Government, and the newly established presidents of the five courts also took the oath of office at the same time. The government also issued a policy declaration, announcing the reduction of troops and expenses, the reorganization of finances, engaging in production, training the people to exercise their civil rights, promoting local autonomy, improving tax collection, unifying currency, developing education, and building the country. Although the plans for nation-building were numerous and complex, they had all taken shape by this point. The Double Tenth Festival of the seventeenth year was filled with a new atmosphere of hope across the country.

However, an internal problem that had been lurking for several years was also becoming increasingly apparent at this time. As early as when the late Premier was alive, in order to concentrate the country's forces and fight to eliminate the forces of the warlords, he announced the opening of the Party to the Communists, allowing Communist Party members to join the Chinese Kuomintang in their individual capacities. At that time, the joint declaration between the Premier and Joffe also stated that communism was not suitable for China, but before and after the success of the Northern Expedition, the Communist Party members in the Kuomintang gradually left the camp of the Three Principles of the People and returned to their old policies of class dictatorship and land confiscation. They also established their own independent regime and military system in Ruijin, Jiangxi, creating another government in a country that had just begun to take the form of unity. As a result, the unfortunate wars of the next few years were brewed, damaging the country's vitality. Finally, this occupied force had to leave Jiangxi, where there was a chorus of complaints, and "march 25,000 miles" to northern Shaanxi, a barren land, to establish another independent regime. However, this unresolved issue remained a hidden concern in national politics and national defense until the start of the full-scale War of Resistance.

On the other hand, the Japanese imperialists, seeing that a strong China was about to take shape, tried every means to obstruct and destroy it. After the "May 3rd Massacre," there was the "Wanbaoshan Incident" and the "Nakamura Incident," which became the excuses for the September 18th Incident. Japan wanted to encompass the Northeast and seize the resources of this vast plain as a foundation for annexing China and annexing the entire Asia. This conspiracy had been around for a long time. In the summer of the twentieth year, the Japanese first instigated Korean farmers to forcibly occupy the rice fields of Chinese farmers in Wanbaoshan Village near Changchun and dug ditches to flood many fields. The Chinese farmers rose up in resistance, and the Japanese army used machine guns to strafe them. After the incident, the Japanese incited Koreans to kill overseas Chinese. In mid-August, they used the pretext of the disappearance of Captain Nakamura to create an atmosphere of tension. On the night of September 18th, they officially sent troops to occupy Shenyang. The Northeast military authorities did not resist because the incident occurred suddenly, so that they could conduct negotiations in a conversational manner, but the Japanese army advanced steadily, and by the 21st, they had occupied the entire province of Jilin. Because the government's military preparations were not sufficient, and the country was experiencing an unprecedented flood in the Yangtze River, and the economy was very exhausted, it had to bear humiliation and heavy burdens and only engaged in localized resistance. In the Double Tenth Festival of the twentieth year, the shadow of "national crisis" was on everyone's eyebrows. In the National Day commemoration meeting on that day, most of the students in the schools wore black gauze with the words "National Crisis" written on them, containing solemn vigilance in the commemoration. In November, the entire province of Heilongjiang also fell.

But the Japanese obstruction to our construction was not enough. Its goal was to ensure that we would never have a chance to breathe and prepare. Therefore, after the "September 18th Incident," there was also the "January 28th" battle, the Yuguan battle, the Rehe battle, and the Great Wall battle, and finally the July 7th Incident occurred, forcing China to temporarily abandon the nation-building work and engage in a decisive battle for national survival.

At this point, the Republic of China entered the second stage of its founding. The work in this stage was as difficult as the first, but the result was as bright.

(VI) From the War of Resistance to Victory

The history of these eight years. Everyone has suffered from it and has fresh memories. There is no need to repeat it. If this process of arduous struggle is divided by three Double Tenth Festivals, then it can be divided into three stages of evolution. The first stage was from the start of the full-scale War of Resistance on July 7th to the retreat from Wuhan around the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-seventh year. During this period, our army fought alone with extremely inferior forces. Although it gave up Nanjing, gave up Xuzhou, and gave up Wuhan, it consumed the enemy along the way, step by step, and broke the enemy's dream of a quick victory. The second stage was from the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-seventh year to the retreat from Yichang around the Double Tenth Festival of the thirtieth year. During this period, our War of Resistance became even more difficult. Most of the resource-rich provinces had fallen, the seaports were blockaded, and transportation was obstructed. But we were still unyielding and followed the Supreme Commander's strategy, using space to gain time, and launched large-scale enemy-held battles, pinning down the enemy's forces. At the end of this stage, around the Double Tenth Festival of the thirtieth year, Yichang also fell, but soon, the world war in the Pacific broke out. Our War of Resistance became a united front with the anti-aggression forces of the whole world. The third stage was from the thirtieth year onwards to the first Double Tenth Festival after the victory of the War of Resistance in the thirty-fourth year, when the whole country rejoiced. During this period, the enemy's strength was weakened day by day. China, in coordination with the forces of the Allied countries, launched counter-offensives one after another, and finally forced the enemy to surrender.

During these eight years, the soldiers and civilians in the rear, under the enemy's crazy bombing and extremely difficult material conditions, gritted their teeth and struggled hard, remembering the famous saying of the great military strategist Jiang Baili before his death: "Whether we win or lose, just don't negotiate peace with him." And the compatriots in the occupied areas, under the enemy's oppression and humiliation, endured hardship and always remembered the suffering motherland, truly "looking west for the royal army for another year." Under their joint efforts, the enemy finally surrendered. The Chinese nation wiped away the shame of its history and, for the first time in three hundred years, gained true freedom and independence.

But this is not the end of everything. On the contrary, this is just the beginning of everything. The goal of a country's founding should be stability and construction, but the internal warlords obstructed us for seventeen years, and the external imperialists obstructed us for another seventeen years. Thanks to thirty-four years of hard struggle, today, all obstacles have been cleared. We should no longer wait and delay. On this thirty-fifth Double Tenth Festival, we should recognize this historical fact and be deeply vigilant. The country demands unity, stability, peace, and construction. All turmoil and destruction that goes against this goal will not be tolerated or forgiven by the 450 million people.

Over the past thirty-five years, from division to unity, from bondage to autonomy, from revolution to nation-building, it has traversed a long preparatory journey, and everything begins today.

Yellow Crane Tower Today

### Interview with Two Founding Figures

— Special Correspondent Zhou Han from Hankou

——Mr. Yu Yuzhi and Mr. Li Chunxuan——

"Autumn winds," it seems, are not without reason. Over the past two days, Wuhan has been hit by violent storms, with flying dust filling the sky and boats capsizing in the river, with six or seven incidents reported one after another. The reporter, carrying out the mission of the newspaper, wanted to go to Wuchang to find some historical materials related to the Xinhai Uprising or to interview several well-known figures of the uprising; however, the ferries were suspended all day, and several times the reporter went to the riverbank, only to be turned back by the storm, and had to "sigh at the river without crossing"!

In order to accomplish the task, I thought of using the method of gathering materials locally, and according to the list of founding comrades, braved the threat of wind and dust to "prospect" to the relevant parties. As a result, with the help of several friends, I actually found gold in the sand. In the hasty interviews, I saw Mr. Yu Yuzhi and Mr. Li Chunxuan, whom I wanted to interview, which was truly a pleasant surprise!

Mr. Yu once served as the Director of the Finance Department of Hubei Province and the Chairman of the Provincial Party Department (currently a Councillor). His life is very simple. After the reporter presented his card and explained his purpose, he began to talk about the motives, process, and feelings of the founding of the republic in a calm and firm tone.

"The revolution of Tang and Wu conformed to Heaven and responded to the people; this is a very reasonable saying, just like a theorem in geometry, there must be a straight line between two points." Mr. Yu first pointed out the principles and philosophy of the revolution, and explained it to the reporter repeatedly in detail.

"Because revolution is not a general 'rebellion,' but an inevitable product of the times. This was the case in the monarchical era, and it is the same in the republican era. If one hangs up a sheep's head and sells dog meat, even if it is called a democratic republic, someone will surely come to revolt and overthrow it. Thousands of years ago, our country had the idea of 'cherish me, I follow; mistreat me, I hate,' let alone today when the people are highly enlightened? The late Premier rose up to lead the revolution not only because of his noble character, great courage, and far-sighted vision, but also because the Manchu Qing had reached the end of its rope in losing power and humiliating the country, so with a call from on high, the whole country followed like the wind, and everyone sang the anti-Manchu revolution very simply. This is the revolutionary manifestation of conforming to Heaven and responding to the people. If the Manchu Qing were not overthrown at that time, there would be no way to save the nation, no way to talk about civil rights, let alone people's livelihood."

Speaking of his own motives and experiences in participating in the revolution, Mr. Yu said: "At that time, I lived in the Army Surveying School in Wuchang, deeply moved by the revolutionary ideas of the time and inspired by the spirit of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs. I also opposed empty talk of constitutionalism and the royalists who sought skins from tigers, so I resolutely devoted myself to the revolution in order to find a thorough way to regenerate."

The Hair-Cutting Movement - Unable to Find Out Who Was the Leader

"I remember that in the first month of the Xinhai year, at the beginning of our semester, we launched a hair-cutting movement. First, I drew a circle and asked everyone to sign around it. As we signed, we cut, and in one night, we turned the braids of more than a hundred classmates into monk's heads. The school authorities could not find out who was the 'ringleader.' The next day, Superintendent Liu came to the school and was furious, saying: 'You eat the rice of the Great Qing and read the books of the Great Qing, but you want to listen to heresies and do these reactionary things, you really fail the imperial grace!' As a result, everyone was given a major demerit. It can be seen the confusion and ignorance of those in power at that time. And the progress of this movement was indeed shocking at that time. But this is only one side of the shock. In fact, 'the mountains are about to be hit by rain, and the wind is filling the building.' From that time on, the latent power of the revolution had gradually filled the entire Wuhan. Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the revolutionary tide reached its peak, and there was a possibility of riots at any time. In order to prepare for the action, I secretly told my family on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, please do not worry about my personal whereabouts. My family was surprised and delighted, and tears streamed down my face for a while. It is inevitable to feel reluctant!" (Reporter's note: The Superintendent Liu here refers to the principal of the Army Surveying School at that time. According to Mr. Yu, the reason why his name is not written directly is to show kindness.)

Scholars Rebel - Hitting Stone Slabs to Make Gunfire

Memorial Stele for Martyr Chen Dingyi's Sacrifice in the First Uprising Park

When Mr. Yu talked about this, his expression became particularly tense. Then he said:

"Coincidentally, two days after the Mid-Autumn Festival, our revolutionary party's secret agency in Baoshan Lane in the French Concession of Hankou had an explosion due to carelessness in making bombs. Comrade Sun Wu was injured on the spot, and the plot was leaked. Three martyrs, Peng Chufan (from Echeng), Liu Fuqing (from Hunan), and Yang Hongsheng (from Gucheng), were arrested, and the three towns of Wuchang, Yangxia, and Hanyang became a scene of terror."

"On the 19th, the weather changed suddenly. The surveying students had all changed into green serge uniforms. At that time, people mostly called us the real revolutionaries sent by the Premier. On the morning of that day, the gates of Wuchang were closed, and the school was suspended in disguise. A few students secretly contacted outside. In the evening, they pretended to be studying on their own and gathered in the study room to support the work. At that time, because I was impatient, I used stones to hit the stone slabs to make the sound of gunfire, and I wrote revolutionary military banners and displayed them in the classroom. Some students blamed me for being rash. In retrospect, it was indeed a bit ridiculous; but the hot blood was impulsive and naturally revealed, and there was no way to restrain myself. Before long, there was indeed a loud noise of gunfire and the sound of horses' hooves, and it was inevitable to feel frightened. In the midst of this chaos and commotion (around 8 p.m.), student representatives Li Yidong and others brought a large number of guns. Just as they arrived at the school gate, they first fired a volley of shots and then lined up and fired, preparing to set off. At this time, the 'scholars' rebellion' was a bit flustered after all, so I secretly drank two bowls of cold water in an attempt to strengthen my courage."

"After setting off, in order to support the engineering battalion that launched the first attack, we concentrated on Chuwangtai and replenished our guns with live ammunition on the spot. Subsequently, we were ordered to guard the Tonghu and Dadong gates. That night, the banner soldiers Du Chenxiang led his troops to fight like trapped beasts in the city. When Du's troops came to attack our Tonghu gate garrison, student Liu Runsheng hurriedly dragged me to the ground to fight back. 'A blind man riding a blind horse, coming to a deep pond in the middle of the night.' Recalling it afterwards, I still feel terrified!"

Inviting Li Yuanhong to be Responsible for Commanding Military Affairs

"The next day, we occupied the Consultative Bureau. At this time, we only met Yan Shanqian, who handed over a tael of silver yuan treasures stored in the bureau and expressed his warm welcome. I took this silver yuan treasure and went with my classmate Fu Jinshan to buy paper to write notices. When we arrived at the Consultative Bureau, the students tore down the window curtains and tore them into pieces to tie on their left arms as temporary symbols of the revolutionary party. It can be seen the excitement and sincerity of the emotions at this time."

"Later, the students and military comrades invited Li Yuanhong to the government to command the military affairs, and organized the Hubei Military Governor's Office, and promoted Li to be the Military Governor of the Hubei Army. Our students were divided into the General Staff, the Documents Department, the General Affairs Department, the Internal Affairs Department, and the Inspection Department to serve. When the northern army went south and the situation was tense, a Surveying Department was established, and some students were sent to the vicinity of Wuhan to conduct armed mapping, and they often encountered battles with the northern army, so many people died in battle. Later, the war in Wuhan became more and more urgent, and we were driven by righteous indignation to volunteer to join the dare-to-die team, holding broadswords, carrying long spears, and wearing red belts around our waists, and went to the Dazhimen Liujiamiao area to fight to the death with the enemy. Recalling the scene of that year, even I myself feel refreshed." Mr. Yu gestured with his hands as he narrated, seeming to feel particularly excited and energetic. (Reporter's note: According to Mr. Yu, before the first uprising, there was a so-called three-army commander in the military at that time, one commanded by Li Yuanhong, stationed in Wuhan; one commanded by Lan Tianwei, stationed in Yantai; and one commanded by Ying Yuncong (i.e., Long Xiang), stationed in Henan. And the one commanded by Li was a mixed association, with a larger organization than the current brigade, so the strength was quite strong.)

Republic Completed - Ordered Students to Freely Choose Careers

"After several large and small fierce battles, the North and South soon ceased fighting, and the Republic was completed. Li ordered the students to go to the government to freely choose careers, to show his reward and gratitude. At that time, I felt that revolution was an act of righteousness. Although the overall situation had been settled, if I rushed to seek a position and recklessly dreamed of wealth, it would still be the behavior of a despicable man, which a revolutionary party member should not have. At the same time, I deeply felt that my own knowledge needed to be enriched urgently, so I decided to take a low-level position in the Surveying Bureau and use the space to study lectures on law and politics. Unexpectedly, as the current situation evolved, Yuan planned to claim the title of emperor and exclude party members. When the Hukou Battle started, someone was unfavorable to me, so I resolutely resigned and went east to Japan to study at Nihon University, burying myself in the study of politics and law in order to fulfill my original intention of seeking knowledge." Speaking of this, Mr. Yu recalled the past and seemed to be a little sad. He declared that he himself had already fulfilled his long-cherished wish and did not need to express any emotion! But he saw that many old comrades were not provided for, and there were quite a few revolutionary orphans who became starving people. Especially in the past eight years, our compatriots have suffered terribly from the turmoil. Although we have won victory for many years, there are still many people who cannot return home. Therefore, he finally felt deeply that his responsibility had not been fulfilled, and he solemnly put forward such a request and hope: "We are the ruling party, and we are the people who shoulder the responsibility of building a new China with the Three Principles of the People. If others kill, set fires, and destroy national unity, the people of the country should condemn them and demand punishment. But if we cannot stabilize society and the people's livelihood, so that tigers and rhinos come out of their cages and fuel the disaster, we cannot but be deeply vigilant! In order to comfort the souls of the martyrs in heaven, we have to work hard again!" Yes, Mr. Yu is an advanced revolutionary, and at the same time, he is now a National Councillor, so his words focus on the national economy and the people's livelihood everywhere, fully demonstrating the identity of a people's representative.

Visiting Li Chunxuan - The Youngest Comrade of the First Uprising

After saying goodbye to Mr. Yu, the reporter went to visit Mr. Li Chunxuan (i.e., Zuodong). He was the youngest of the founding comrades that year, and now he is also a 54-year-old veteran.

Walking into Li's house, Mr. Li was busy preparing for the expanded celebration of the Double Tenth Festival. Thanks to the introduction of his younger brother, Bingwei, he seemed particularly kind and humble in talking to the reporter.

"Regarding the process of the first uprising, I think someone has already talked about it, so I don't need to repeat it. Now I would like to explain a little more about the relationship between the Hubei Army Special Primary School and the Xinhai Revolution."

Mr. Li opened this topic and first emphasized the achievements of Duke Zhang Wenxiang (Zhidong) in Hubei. He said: "Duke Wenxiang spared no effort in revitalizing education and cultivating talents in Hubei; most of the later revolutionary volunteers came from his school, such as Mr. Huang Keqiang, Mr. Zhang Guoen, Mr. Wang Shijie, and my wife, all of whom were students of the Lianghu Normal School. People like Mr. Song Jiaoren and Mr. Tian Tong were ordinary students of the Literary Academy. And the Army Special Primary School was founded by Duke Zhang Wenxiang himself. Most of the students joined the Kuomintang, and the school's students contributed a lot to the Xinhai Revolution."

Mr. Li pointed out that the characteristic of this primary school was that the treatment was generous, and graduates could be assigned to platoon leaders and other battles, and the admission standards were very high. All of them were selected from the excellent soldiers of each iron association camp (military system name) to participate in the examination, and they could only be admitted after passing the examination. At the same time, the imperial examination was abolished that year, and it was difficult for the reading people to find a way out, so most of them gave up their pens and joined the army in order to obtain the qualifications to enter the Lu Primary School. Because of this, it was common for scholars to become soldiers at that time, and the so-called combination of civil and military had already started the trend.

The Students of Lu Primary School Were Implicitly the Backbone of the Revolution

"What is particularly worth mentioning is that the students of Lu Primary School were not expelled from the original army in the registration, and their salaries were still paid as usual. They went to school early in the morning and returned to the camp in the evening to spread revolutionary ideas! People like Cai Jimin, Xiao Guobao, Du Wuku, and Li Jiguang were all students of the school, and they were implicitly the backbone of the revolution, and their appeal was very strong!" Mr. Li said. He and Deng Yulin were close friends with people like Xiao Guobao and Li Jiguang, so they were able to participate in all the consultations and knew the situation at that time.

"There is one more point that can prove that the students of Lu Primary School were jealous! That is, Zhang Biao, the commander of the Eighth Town, has always disliked the graduates of Lu Primary School and never hired them. Later, Zhang heard that the students of Lu Primary School participated in the revolution and retreated to Hankou, so he offered a reward, stating that whoever arrested a student of Lu Primary School would be rewarded with 10,000 strings of cash, which shows their fear of the students of Lu Primary School."

On the other hand, Mr. Li explained that the students of Lu Primary School were not subject to any inspection when entering and leaving. At that time, books that promoted revolution, such as The Ten Days of Yangzhou and A Fierce Awakening, were secretly sent from Shanghai to Hubei, and then spread to every revolutionary youth through the distribution of the students of Lu Primary School. The reason why Li Yuanhong was appointed as the governor was not only because Li himself gained the hearts of the military with his loyalty and honesty, but also because of the enthusiastic support of the students of Lu Primary School.

Therefore, Mr. Li concluded: "Education is the source of spreading the seeds of revolution. After the revolution was successful, all the ancestral halls of Zeng Wenzheng and Hu Wenzhong in Hubei were destroyed one after another, and only the buildings such as Baobing Hall and Aolue Building, which commemorate Duke Zhang Wenxiang, were not destroyed at all! This is because the merits of Duke Wenxiang's education and cultivation of talents cannot be erased!"

At this point, Mr. Li handed the reporter two precious photos, one was the Governor's Office of the Wuchang Consultative Bureau at the time of the uprising, and the other was the scene of all walks of life welcoming the Premier when he came to Wuhan in the first year of the Republic. Mr. Li firmly said: "The success of the Xinhai Revolution was not accidental, and this reason must be sought from real historical materials!"

### "Anecdotes" of Founding Comrades Staying in Hankou

The reporter interviewed many founding comrades staying in Hankou, and when they talked about the situation of the uprising that year, they were all moving and worthy of weeping, which can be used as a reference for the uprising materials.

### The Celebration Thirty-Five Years Ago - Digging Up Past Events (Part 1)

— This Newspaper Archives

(Beijing) This morning, the weather was clear and sunny, and at 8:00 a.m., Zhao Bingjun, representing the President, presided over the ceremony of commemorating the martyrs, and changed the Gate of Great Qing to the Gate of China. At the same time, the unveiling ceremony of the gate plaque was held. Various organs and groups in Liulichang held a Republican Commemorative Meeting. There were 16,000 soldiers on Hadamen Street, standing upright on the street in left and right formations all day long. The former Qing nobles and school drill grounds held a drill inspection ceremony. Prince Karaqin and the Living Buddha of Inner Mongolia were present, and the Living Buddha of Inner Mongolia came to the meeting in a two-wheeled yellow car, which was far away from the car body, indicating that the rider was highly respected. For a time, the yellow robes were brilliant, and the whole field was amazed.

(Shanghai) Today, the business and academic circles of Shanghai, together with the members of the Chamber of Commerce and various industry business groups, set out from the office of the Chamber of Commerce in Lujiabang for a parade to celebrate. They passed through the Manufacturing Bureau to West Bridge, and then to the Poor Children's Home, where they lined up, sang the national anthem, and fired thirteen volleys of rifles. At 8:00 p.m., the Zhabei Police Station, the Cavalry Patrol Team, and the Infantry Team of the Restoration Army jointly held a lantern festival. Nanyang University, St. John's University, Wusang School, the Universal Chinese Students' Association, the Sino-Western School, McKillen College, and Mingqiang Elementary School all participated. They passed through Hengfeng Road, Datong Road, and Nanchuanhong Road, etc. The procession was three miles long. The lanterns included trains, airships, Wuchang City, Western beauties, etc. The cheers along the way were thunderous.

(Suzhou) The Governor's Office held a Restoration Commemorative Banquet today. The whole city was decorated with lanterns and streamers. In the evening, fireworks were set off at the Xin Kaihe Bridge drill ground outside the Jianmen Gate. Liuyuan Garden was open, and only half the fee was charged. At 8:00 p.m., the lantern celebration began. Soochow University had a giant lantern in the shape of the Yellow Crane Tower to commemorate the Wuchang Uprising. All members of the Chamber of Commerce used white crepe to tie small and large colored balls and hung them on their bodies, singing and marching in the procession.

(Wuchang) Today, a sacrifice venue was set up in the former Qing Wanshou Palace, and the spirit tablets of the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution were placed everywhere. Representatives of the governors of various provinces paid tribute, and ordered all organs and groups to set up spirit tablets of the martyrs at each office location and worship them themselves. At the same time, a commemorative meeting was convened by the Governor's Office. Because it was just after the mutiny of the cavalry, the security was very strict. Police were densely stationed near Baobing Hall, and traffic was restricted. The people of Wuhan generally called "National Day is really an unlucky day."

(Nanjing) Among the Restoration Commemorative Meetings, the emotions of the military were the most intense. The officers and soldiers of the 3rd, 7th, and 8th Divisions stationed in Nanjing all voluntarily donated one-tenth of their salaries as commemorative expenses. Each street was decorated with archways and lanterns, with a riot of color. The roads were crowded with pedestrians. In the morning, the Governor's Office entertained consuls from various countries. Cheng Dequan and Huang Keqiang both gave impassioned speeches. Western food was used for the banquet. At noon, the Chengzheng Office paid tribute to the martyrs who died for the Republic at the Wanshou Palace. In the evening, fireworks were set off everywhere. The lantern festival had a huge "Iron and Blood Founding Anniversary" lighthouse participating in the parade. Military songs were overflowing, and the scene was unprecedented.

(Guangzhou) and Shantou held Restoration Commemorative Meetings today. There were many female representatives at the meeting. The Kun Gang Girls' School presided over the Shantou celebration, leading the people to sing and bow three times to the national flag. Then, female representatives from all walks of life, Liang Dezhen, Liang Shuyan, and others delivered speeches, expounding the meaning of "civil rights" and "republic." Then, music was played, photos were taken, and the team marched on the street in the festival of drums and trumpets.

(Zhenjiang) In addition to various commemorative ceremonies held today, the Xiangshan and Jiaoshan Forts and the warships moored in the river all hoisted colorful flags, fluttering in the wind. At noon, cannons were fired in celebration, and the rumbling sound shook the river bank.

(Songjiang) Today, the Tongmenghui branch held a meeting in the Chen-Xia Ergong Temple to pay tribute to the martyrs who died. All the groups in the city convened a commemorative meeting in Drunken Bai Pond. Ms. Ding Yuexin gave a speech, urging women to "not be ignorant, and then be stained with the bad habits of Yan and Zhang, and only be a burden to men." In the evening, Tongmenghui members rode horses with lanterns, and jointly held a grand parade with the business groups and the various camps of the Navy. At the same time, Civil Administrator Xie specially allocated 200,000 texts of public funds to personally comfort and relieve the orphans and the poor.

### My Opinion on National Affairs

— Situ Meitang

The Republic of China was founded. From the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 to the Double Tenth Festival this year, it has been exactly thirty-five years. If we count from the enemy's surrender and the restoration of our land, this is the second Double Tenth Festival. Last year's Double Tenth Festival, I was in America; this year's Double Tenth Festival, I am in the motherland. Today's publication is my first since returning home.

Tracing back to before the founding of the Republic of China, we engaged in revolutionary movements overseas, based on the Hongmen overseas Chinese organization, upholding the spirit of national revolution for more than two hundred years, striving arduously, and never yielding. Before the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, there was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, namely the historically famous Battle of Huanghuagang. In this battle, the responsibility for raising funds almost entirely fell on our American Hongmen. The Zhigongtang buildings in three ports of British Canada were mortgaged and sold to provide for revolutionary patriots. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen often said, "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution," which actually referred to the Hongmen overseas Chinese. Even Mr. Sun Yat-sen's travel expenses from America back to China to assume the post of Provisional President in Nanjing were personally collected and subsidized by me and my comrades before he could make the journey. Therefore, today, on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Double Tenth Festival, recalling the facts of the 1911 Revolution, I am truly overwhelmed with emotion!

After the founding of the Republic of China, we, far away overseas, cherished fervent hopes, believing that the national revolution had been successfully concluded, that the Republic of China would achieve the five ethnicities united as one, and implement democracy, making our country a new nation governed by the people, of the people, and for the people, with prosperity and strength to be expected without any doubt. Therefore, at that time, the Hongmen overseas Chinese, with chivalry and righteousness, and loyalty to the country, all held the ideal of retiring after success, and were unwilling to interfere in the politics of the motherland. Who knew that later there would be the Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the monarchy, Zhang Xun's restoration, the tyranny of the Northern Warlords, fighting for cities and land, frequent civil wars, and the country was on the verge of collapse. We abroad felt extremely disappointed. Therefore, for every national salvation movement, we still contributed money and effort. For the final Northern Expedition led by the Kuomintang, we held even more boundless hopes, believing that national unification was within reach. Who knew that later there would be even more internal party struggles, brothers fighting each other, turning weapons against each other, year after year of civil war, eventually leading to foreign aggression and the "September 18th" Incident in Shenyang. We, living overseas, felt deeply for the motherland and our pain was indescribable. Therefore, we unanimously rose up to save the nation, advocated unity against aggression, and strongly advocated resistance, establishing anti-Japanese national salvation associations everywhere, as a backing for the motherland's resistance. The Hongmen overseas Chinese, known for their revolutionary spirit, made the greatest contribution to the war of resistance. Therefore, after the July 7th Incident and the opening of the full-scale war, we rallied and appealed even more vigorously. Taking myself as an example, in addition to advocating for donations, I also intensified the Hongmen unity, unifying the Hongmen effort agencies in the Americas, strengthening the organization, and contributing all our strength to the war of resistance. In 1941, I was also ordered to return to China to pay respects to the highest authorities of the war of resistance and to comfort the wounded and those in distress. On this trip, as soon as I returned to the country, just as Hong Kong was about to fall, I stepped forward and gathered the Hongmen brothers in Hong Kong to help the defending troops. Therefore, when the enemy entered Hong Kong, I was arrested and almost sacrificed my old life in this battle. Who knew that I would still be able to witness the restoration of the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, and still be able to meet with my compatriots across the country in writing today.

Now that our land has been restored, I am fulfilling the mission of the overseas Hongmen revolutionary organization in the Americas, returning to China to form a party, just as the call for returning power to the people and implementing democratic politics is rising. All my fellow overseas Chinese believe that our motherland is already one of the four major powers, and we should strive for strength and contribute to the motherland in a timely manner. This is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. I, in my old age and foolishness, also believe so. Who knew that in the five months since returning home, all I have seen is corruption, people struggling to survive, foreign goods flooding the market, no hope for industrial revival, commercial depression, economic bankruptcy, and financial collapse. I truly do not know how to save the country. Moreover, the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is still ongoing. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have all been broken. Our great land, not destroyed by foreign enemies, is now on the verge of ruin due to internal decay. An eighty-year-old man, having experienced revolution and resistance, almost sacrificing his life, originally believed that the motherland was bound to become strong. How could I have expected to witness the motherland on the verge of ruin today? With a heart full of worry, I cannot help but speak earnestly to my compatriots. You may call it my foolish opinion, or you may call it my opinion on national affairs. I will now list the key points as follows:

(1) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party should immediately cease the civil war. When the two parties united to resist the war, all overseas Chinese celebrated. When the New Fourth Army Incident occurred due to the friction between the two parties, all overseas Chinese were extremely anxious. During the New Fourth Army Incident, I already represented the overseas Hongmen Chinese in strongly advising both sides. Unfortunately, my voice was too weak to prevent the disaster from happening, and after the enemy surrendered, civil war broke out. We still need friendly countries to mediate. For months, there have been no results. "Boiling beans to make broth, the stalks crackle in the pot," it is painful to speak of. I believe that today's national affairs should make the cessation of civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party the first condition.

(2) Convene a National Assembly and enact a constitution. Regarding the government's promise to convene a National Assembly and return power to the people, it has been announced to the world countless times. When will this promise be fulfilled? This is what the world is watching. Originally, since the founding of the Republic of China, it has been thirty-five years, and the national law has not yet been determined. There is no guiding principle above, and no law to abide by below. The chaos in national politics is rooted in this. Now, in order to reverse the chaos and restore order, the only way is to quickly convene a National Assembly meeting, determine the political system, and lay a foundation for the future. However, national laws cannot be monopolized by one party, one faction, or one person. There must be a government representing the entire people to preside over it. Therefore, before convening the National Assembly meeting for discussion, it is especially important to obtain the genuine representatives of all parties and factions and the entire people. Therefore, I believe that today's national affairs should make the convening of a National Assembly meeting to enact a democratic constitution the second condition.

(3) Implement democracy and promote world peace. Regarding the current post-war world, Britain and the United States are confronting the Soviet Union, and their ideologies and systems are different. International conflicts are not only sufficient to cause a third world war, but can also lead to the division of our country. Therefore, for the sake of China's current situation, there is no way to unite and unify the country without implementing democratic politics, and world peace cannot be promoted without China's unification. We have been living overseas for a long time and are familiar with the international situation. Now, seeing the situation in our country, we know even more that this is the only way to save China, which is on the verge of division. Therefore, I believe that today's national affairs should make the implementation of democracy and the promotion of world peace the third condition.

The above three points are just the main points. As for the national salvation program, there is also the declaration of the China Hongmen Democratic Party, which I recently initiated, with detailed analysis. Whether it is right or wrong, I hope that all the wise men of the country will openly discuss it and study it together. An eighty-year-old man can only silently pray for the peaceful unification of the Republic of China, the realization of democratic politics, and the daily progress towards strength, without betraying the original intention of revolution and resistance. That is all, what else can I say!

### Special Work of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works in the Past Year

— Zhao Zukang

The tasks of the Bureau of Public Works can be roughly divided into eight categories: roads, bridges, ditches, waterways, docks, embankments, buildings, and gardens. In the past year, considerable construction has been carried out in these eight categories of projects, and there are three items that are special in nature and worthy of record: (1) Developing flood prevention projects; (2) Repairing the Pudong seawall; (3) Constructing citizen residences. Now, I will briefly record these three special tasks to inform readers.

1. Development of Flood Prevention Projects

The causes of floods in this city are: (1) The ditch system is disordered, and the size of the ditches is too small; (2) In most areas of the city, the height of the flat land is below the highest tide level, and there is a phenomenon of tidal backflow; (3) The river channels at the outlets of rainwater pipes have been silted up for a long time, and the riverbed has risen. Rainwater cannot be discharged as soon as dredging begins; (4) "Gullies" or riverbanks are filled with garbage, causing silting. Because of these four reasons, the Bureau has adopted the following principles for flood prevention work in recent years: (1) Dredge riverbanks to facilitate drainage; (2) Dredge sewers, remove "Gullies" to prevent accumulation; (3) Reconstruct and enlarge bottleneck-type ditches to smooth water flow; (4) Build tide gates and pumping stations to prevent tidal backflow. After a year of active work, most low-lying areas have less water accumulation or shorter water accumulation periods during heavy rain and high tides recently, which can be said to be a partial achievement of flood prevention work.

2. Emergency Repair of the Pudong Seawall

The city's seawall in Pudong is the Dongtang, starting from the mouth of the Huangpu River to Huangjiawan in Chuansha County, with a total length of 15 kilometers. It has not been repaired for many years, resulting in many gaps and extreme danger. Last winter, the Bureau organized a seawall engineering team to conduct on-site surveys and formulated a repair plan. First, the breaches in Zhangjiazai, Daijiazai, Zouzai, and Yinlujiazai south of the seaside bathing beach were urgently repaired, with a total length of 1,352 meters. The main design is to use concrete retaining walls as the main part of the embankment, with a rubble revetment outside the wall and a row of piles at the foot of the slope, with a slight pile of stone blocks outside the piles. A revetment sloping upwards is also set inside the wall, and the top of the slope is an earthen embankment. This seawall project started purchasing materials in mid-May, started construction in mid-July, and the retaining wall was completed ten days ago, and the entire project was completed in September. Recently, on the third day of the ninth lunar month, a hurricane and high tide hit the seawall at the same time, and the embankment project was unharmed, celebrating peace together. To the north of the seaside bathing beach, there were no original breaches, but the sections destroyed in the past eight years are longer than those south of the seaside bathing beach, and preparations for repair have now begun.

3. Construction of Civil Residences

The housing shortage in this city is extremely serious. At the beginning of the Bureau's takeover, it paid attention to the restoration of the original civilian villages and the preparation for the construction of new citizen residences. Originally, it was planned to build 3,000 houses as a promotion, but due to the shortage of municipal treasury funds, it was forced to change the plan and planned to build 160 citizen residences in Nanshi and Zhabei respectively. Later, due to the limitation of not being able to raise funds at one time, it had to be reduced again, and a citizen village was first built on Damuqiao Road in Nanshi, with 154 residential buildings and affiliated public facilities, etc. Construction started in June, the main building was completed in August, and water and electricity facilities are being added, and it can be completed this month. It is sold by the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company, following the previous method of renting land to build houses, with the goal of officially announcing and registering the sale in twenty years, which will be held soon. Many citizens have sent letters requesting it. It is rumored that "the rich don't want it, and the poor can't afford it," which is not true. As far as civil servants and teachers are concerned, they may have this feeling, but other people with better economic conditions seem to be more inclined to buy it. In any case, it can help alleviate the housing shortage. Furthermore, it was recently heard that the central government plans to allocate special funds for civil servants and teachers in Beijing and Shanghai to build housing separately to help them. This is also good news amidst the housing shortage in this city.

### Three Major Events in Education

— Hang Liwu

After the end of the war of victory, Chairman Jiang emphasized and put forward the slogan of education first. Indeed, education is the foundation of national construction, and the laying of this foundation is extremely complicated. Now, when everything is waiting to be rebuilt and everything is waiting to be done, there are three major events that are urgent tasks for us in the next three to five years, and we must strive to promote them as soon as possible.

First, is to enrich the equipment of instruments and books in schools and research institutions at all levels.

I often say that the ten years from the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing to the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 was a golden age for our country to engage in new education, but unfortunately Japan did not allow us to continue building like this. During the war, the level of schools at all levels decreased due to the impact of equipment, economy, and war disturbances. Now that education has resumed, the goal is naturally to improve the quality of education at all levels. The most important basic condition to achieve this goal is equipment. If schools do not have sufficient equipment such as instruments and books, how can they improve their teaching level and understanding ability? If research institutions do not have sufficient equipment, how can they promote research and promote scientific progress? Therefore, the first thing to do when education resumes is to enrich the equipment.

Second, is to eliminate illiteracy and promote compulsory education.

Countries with developed education, such as the United States, are now promoting the so-called movement of education for democracy. In our country with backward education and political democratization, this movement is even more urgently needed. The so-called education for democracy is to use education to train and cultivate citizens of democratic countries to ensure political democracy and fully develop the spirit of democracy. This is indeed the basic work of democratic politics. However, this kind of education is not only to make people recognize a few words, but also to give them the skills for production and the training for autonomous economy.

Third, is the scientific movement.

That is to popularize scientific interest and knowledge. If we want to develop industry and improve agriculture, the most basic work is to instill scientific interest and knowledge into the countryside, so that it deeply penetrates the general public. Although I am not a researcher of natural science, I am very willing to work hard to promote this movement, and I hope that the domestic scientific community will jointly shoulder this arduous responsibility, using words and languages, using movies and broadcasts, using pictures and active models, using various methods and tools to promote the scientific movement. This requires the efforts of the masses.

Finally, I have a small opinion, that is, everyone has a responsibility for education. We should mobilize the strength of the masses, use the wisdom of the masses, and use the mental and physical strength of the masses to strengthen the effectiveness of education and promote the consequences of education. For several years, a unhealthy atmosphere has developed in society, almost everything is hoped or asked the government to do. We must know that the government cannot do everything, and it really cannot do so many things, not to mention that it is more limited by human, financial, and time constraints. The cause of education is beneficial to the country and the people, beneficial to others and beneficial to oneself. I hope that society can exert its greatest strength and shoulder part of the responsibility, suggesting that the government improve education and assist the government in promoting education. In this way, the above three major events can have a great impact and effect.

### Activating Land Finance Requires Registration First

— Zhu Ping

Since the opening of Shanghai in the Qing Dynasty, Chinese and foreign people have gathered here, the population has increased, industry and commerce have flourished, and land prices have become expensive. The largest amount of capital is not gold dollars, but real estate. If such a large amount of real estate value is used for production and construction, it will undoubtedly help the development of industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market. However, the important prerequisite is to complete land registration first, so that the property rights are certain and the credit is solid, so as to facilitate the transfer of rights or the establishment of burdens. Therefore, land registration is closely related to the development of industry and commerce in this city. Land registration in this city began in 1927, and a small part was completed by 1937, but it was suspended due to the full-scale war of resistance. After the occupation, the enemy and puppets seized it, causing the land registration to become more chaotic. Until the enemy surrendered last autumn, we returned to our homeland. At the beginning of the recovery, everything was waiting to be rebuilt, and cleaning up land rights was the most urgent task. Therefore, we first handled the general registration according to law in the six most important areas of this city: Huangpu, Hunam, Zhabei, Yixiang, Fahua, and Caojing. Since the opening in November last year, it has been ten months. At first, the owners felt that the procedures were too complicated. Later, after improvement based on the four principles of (1) simplifying procedures, (2) shortening processing time, (3) saving business labor costs, and (4) strictly prohibiting demands, the business began to develop. Now that the registration period is not convenient to extend for a long time, it is scheduled to officially end at the end of October, so as to come to a conclusion. At that time, if the owner does not perform the registration again without stating a legitimate reason, it will be regarded as ownerless land and dealt with according to law. This is a necessary procedure in accordance with the law.

In the former concession period of this city, most people were happy to trade because they believed that the deed was a sure title. It was really a psychological illusion due to excessive trust in foreigners. How can it be said that the property right is certain if the deed does not match the land? Moreover, if the power is in the hands of foreigners, the property rights lack guarantee, and the outflow of rights and interests is an immeasurable loss to the country. Therefore, this city's land registration also cleans up the deed land. Anyone who has actually transferred property to the Chinese people will be considered the owner of the actual right, so as to avoid being controlled by foreigners and harming the rights and interests of the Chinese people. However, the chaos of the land registration in this city after a hundred years of special status of the concession and eight years of occupation can be imagined. It is indescribable how difficult it is to carry out a general cleanup at this time. It is hoped that all citizens will work together to achieve success. Then, the active land finance and the rapid progress of construction projects in this city can be expected from this.

### Baoding Dynamics

— A special correspondent Yang Bingsen, this newspaper, September 4th.

Starting from Beiping and boarding the Pinghan train, you can reach Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province, in four hours. This ancient city, with a radius of only five kilometers and a population of less than 120,000, is probably the smallest provincial capital in the country.

The Pinghan Railway, which runs diagonally, and the Daqing River, which runs between Tianjin and Baoding, are its two major arteries, controlling the province's political, cultural, and military hub.

At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, this place was the first to be occupied. After struggling under the iron hooves of the enemy for eight years, Baoyang after the catastrophe showed signs of depression, fear, paralysis, and tension. It was like an insect that had just escaped from the darkness and was slowly moving towards the light.

Paralyzed Education

Baoding is the educational center of Hebei Province. In terms of provincial units across the country, its educational development is second only to Jiangsu. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were two provincial colleges, Hebei Agricultural and Medical College. There were also Yucheng, Tongren, Peide, Minsheng, Zhicun, Baozhong, vocational schools, men's and women's normal schools, etc. In addition, there were more than 50 public and private primary schools. However, during the occupation, after the enemy's devastation, it suffered unprecedented misfortune. Some schools were transformed by the enemy into barracks, wounded soldier hospitals, and residences, or even demolished and used as firewood. It was unbearable to hear and see the damage. After the victory, all schools actively resumed classes. Currently, in addition to taking over the pseudo-normal college and continuing to run it, Baozhong, men's and women's normal schools, Yucheng, and Tongren have all resumed classes one after another. The Agricultural and Medical College is also scheduled to start classes after the summer vacation this year.

However, the re-established schools are barely operating due to funding reasons, and equipment is extremely lacking, especially the general science instruments that require experiments. Some schools do not even have one piece. Teachers can only talk and draw, and students can only watch and listen. The terms molecular formula and carbon dioxide often cause confusion.

The poverty of civil servants and teachers is a common phenomenon across the country, especially in Baoding, which is even more bitter. The old masters in private schools only have 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per month, which is not enough to maintain one person's life, let alone have the energy to diligently teach students. Low prices will naturally not buy good goods, so it is difficult to hire good teachers in Baoding. Due to the meager treatment, the teachers who taught here also staged a tragedy of striking in May, accompanied by Shenyang, Pingjin, and other places.

After the Provincial Government Moved

After the news that the Jisu Provincial Government would move from Pingjin to Baoding spread to Baoding, every corner of the city was filled with vitality, as if giving these 100,000 people living under tension an injection of stimulants. From May, the slogan "Move to Baoding" was shouted for two months, but because the office buildings and staff dormitories were not enough to apply, it was delayed. Therefore, the first batch of personnel who came to Baoding only spent a month surveying the site and investigating official and private reverse properties before they were completely moved to Baoding in mid-July.

Most changes in everything are unpredictable. The citizens of Baoding looked forward to the provincial government's move to Baoding, imagining that the city would flourish due to the increase in population and consumption; however, the income of civil servants was limited, and both public and private were generally poor. Where was there any extra energy to squander and consume, so the market was still lifeless, and it was a waste of joy.

Even more unexpected, bad air blew on these provincial government officials, arousing a wave of injustice:

The treatment of provincial government officials in Beiping was paid according to the central government's regulations for the Pingjin area. After moving to Baoding, not only was the environment lower, but the salary was also changed to the Jisu provincial area treatment, which was 180 times different from the Pingjin treatment. An ordinary official earned 70,000 to 80,000 yuan less. In fact, prices in Baoding are not lower than in Pingjin. Except for food, which is slightly cheaper, the general necessities of life are more than one-third higher. Officials are naturally dissatisfied, so the entire federation elected representatives to send a telegram to the central government, hoping that the treatment would be reasonably adjusted, and they also planned to send representatives to the capital.

The citizens of Baoding are now indifferent to the provincial government's move to Baoding, but the only comfort is that due to the provincial government's move, security has been strengthened, reducing a layer of threat!

The security in Baoding has always been fluctuating until today. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. Outside the city of Baoding, twenty or thirty miles away, it is still a "liberated area." The only trick of the Communist army against Baoding is, of course, the blockade of materials, so the residents of the city often feel the lack of food and the pressure of food prices.

### Tianjin's Autumn

—

Tianjin Navigation News, September 14th, a special reporter Li Shaolin

Autumn comes silently and leaves silently. The bright, white moonlight still shines quietly into this city, but the people who live in this city have long lost the sentiment of the past. Those who are displaced, whose families are broken, and who are breathing under the heavy pressure of life are naturally more emotional, and even those who are leisurely and affluent feel that this autumn is very different from before the Anti-Japanese War.

The fresh goods store is piled with red pomegranates, purple grapes, golden-yellow American oranges, and pears that look crisp, all of which highlight the existence of autumn.

Difficult to do business, high interest rates

The day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the mooncakes were sold out, and the patrons in the fresh goods store were also coming and going, handing over large amounts of banknotes. Of course, few of these patrons are poor civil servants. There are certainly many merchants who make money, but how can there be no merchants who lose money? When it comes to festivals, merchants are accustomed to settling accounts, and there is a need for more cash, so the secret interest rate rises with the wind. The highest even reaches 90 yuan per day, which is equal to 27% per month. How can small merchants stand under this situation? It is precisely because of the tight money supply. In the past few days, except for things that should be in season, other prices have not changed much, but how many people are anxious about the situation after the festival? Prices are difficult to stabilize. Listen to the merchants' complaints, they all have a belly full of grievances. They all say that the things they sell do not increase in price first, but rather chase after other prices. What exactly is leading the price increase? The merchants also know that it is the overall situation. A well-behaved merchant does not want prices to rise.

Some are happy, some are sad

These days, after several autumn rains, the golden wind is rising, and the cold is coming in gusts, bringing Tianjin into late autumn. During the Anti-Japanese War, people who were drifting away from their hometowns could not go back. After the victory, thousands and thousands of people were forced out of their hometowns by the riots, but kind people are not necessarily weak. A few days ago, the people of the various counties south of Tianjin who were displaced in Tianjin established a return home association. Thousands of people from various counties who were displaced in Tianjin actively participated in this group. They want to return to their hometowns armed. In central Hebei and eastern Hebei, the movement of people returning to their hometowns has also developed vigorously. They want to return to their native land, cultivate their fields, and live in their houses. Although there are people trying to stop them? They are kind people who only hope to restore their past peaceful lives.

The autumn wind blows across the fields, into the city, and into people's hearts. Last autumn, the 1.5 million citizens of Tianjin completely jumped into the joy of victory. This autumn, the people have fallen into the threat of war again. "Some are happy, some are sad"? Really, there are too few people who can be happy, and there are too many people who are sad!

### Founding Documents

— From our newspaper's archives

The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the feudal autocracy that had lasted for thousands of years and established a democratic republic. This was an unprecedented and important turning point in the history of the Chinese nation. Here, we excerpt some important documents from the founding era. They do not lose their value due to the passage of time because they are eternal milestones on the road to nation-building.

President Sun's Inaugural Declaration

[At the beginning of the creation of the Republic of China, I, with my lack of virtue, assumed the responsibility of Provisional Grand President, being fearful day and night that I would not live up to the expectations of the people. The poison of autocratic politics in China has grown worse over the past two hundred years. Once removed by the power of the people, it took only a few dozen days for the uprising to restore more than ten provinces. Since the beginning of history, there has never been such a rapid success. The people entrusted me with the responsibility of organizing the government. From the perspective of pushing merit and yielding ability, I dare not take on this task. From the perspective of serving and fulfilling my responsibilities, I dare not refuse. The foundation of a country lies in its people. Uniting the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan lands into one country is the unification of the nation. The Wuchang Uprising caused more than ten provinces to declare independence successively. The so-called independence is separation from the Qing court and unity with the provinces. This is the unification of territory. The sound of the bell of blood rang out, and the flags of righteousness rose in all directions. Soldiers armed with armor and weapons were everywhere in more than ten provinces. Although the organization may not be uniform, and the commands may not be consistent, the objectives are the same. This is the unification of military administration. The country is vast, and each province has its own customs. In the future, the administration should aim to properly regulate the relationship between the central government and the provinces. Once the outline is established, the details will follow. This is the unification of internal governance. The country's finances are derived from the people. It is essential to conform to the principles of public finance, and especially to improve the social and economic organization, so that the people can know the joy of life. This is the unification of finance. The above are the policy guidelines. Proceeding with these, there will be no major mistakes. As for revolutionary doctrine, it is what we advocate and what the United States understands. Although it has been repeatedly frustrated in the past, foreigners have always appreciated its intention. Since August, the flags of righteousness have been flying, and the friendly nations have held peaceful hopes and maintained a neutral stance towards it, while newspapers and public opinion have often expressed their sympathy. The virtue of neighborly friendship is deeply appreciated. After the establishment of the provisional government, we should maintain a peaceful doctrine and further increase friendly relations with our friendly nations, so that China will be respected in the international community, and the world will gradually move towards great harmony. Progress should be made in an orderly manner, not by seeking quick gains. This is the true external policy. Now, on the day of our first meeting with the people, I lay out my heart. I hope that our four hundred million compatriots will learn from it.]

Provisional Grand President's Letter to Friendly Nations

"Since the Manchus seized power, they have used supreme authority to impose unreasonable oppression, restricting civil rights and violating public opinion, thus delaying the intellectual, moral, and economic progress of our Republic of China. Those with insight believe that only revolution can sweep away the old filth and revitalize the new opportunity. Now, fortunately, the righteous flag has been raised high and the general situation has been determined. We, the entire Republic of China, dare to proclaim to our friendly nations that we have overthrown the autocratic government of the Manchu Qing and established a republican nation.

Replacing the monarchical system with a republic is not merely a momentary whim of our people. The idea of freedom bestowed by heaven has long been cherished. Seeking lasting happiness and sweeping away obstacles in the future, we have cherished this humble desire for a long time without achieving it. Today's events are a natural outcome, and also the formal expression of the public will of our Republic.

The Chinese nation is inherently peaceful and law-abiding. Only when compelled by self-defense will we lightly initiate war. Therefore, since the Manchu Qing stole China, for 268 years, their administration has been unspeakable. Our nation could only endure it, and did not initially want to see the tragedy of bloodshed. We have risen up and fallen repeatedly, and have ultimately failed to achieve our goal. As of today, we can no longer endure it, so we resort to force, hoping to free ourselves and our descendants from myriad fetters, and to allow freedom and happiness to illuminate the universe. This is a rare opportunity that may not come again in a thousand years.

The policy of the Manchu Qing government, in a word, is one of jealousy towards other races, selfishness, and unchanging misgovernment. We have endured it for too long, and are forced to revolt, which is only natural. Demolishing the old system and establishing a new nation is something we cannot help but do, and we ask the free nations of the world to clearly understand this.

Before the Manchu Qing usurped the divine regalia, the civilized nation of the Xia allowed all countries of the world freedom of communication, travel, and the propagation of doctrines. When the Ming Dynasty lost power, the Manchu barbarians seized control. Based on their narrow-mindedness and selfish prejudices, they enacted various decrees to isolate themselves, preventing the civilization of China from contacting the nations of the world. This caused the descendants of the divine race to become increasingly vulgar, making it difficult to develop their natural talents. Stupefying the people is not only a barrier to humanity, but also a public enemy of civilized nations.

Moreover, the Manchu Qing government, in order to keep the majority of Han people forever subjugated under their autocracy, so that they could possess wealth and multiply among them, did not hesitate to harm our people for their own benefit. Close relatives of the clan often possessed special privileges, and the majority of common people were subject to their control. They also levied exorbitant and illegal taxes, arbitrarily extorting and plundering. Obstructing the development of domestic commerce and hindering the flourishing of industry and manufacturing, the Manchu Qing government did not know how to reward and protect real industries.

As for employing people and administering government, there were no impartial and unchanging norms. Harsh punishments and cruel systems were inhumane. Offices and titles were sold, and politics was achieved through bribery. Imperial edicts were issued in the morning and violated in the evening, making fools of our people time and time again, causing our country and people to be despised by the world, to which they were indifferent.

We now want to eliminate all the aforementioned crimes, so that our Republic of China can establish equal and friendly relations with all nations of the world. Therefore, we do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to fight against the evil government and establish a better one to replace it. We therefore lay this bare before all nations. May our friendly nations take note. Signed, Sun Wen, Provisional Grand President of the Republic of China."

Military Governor of Hubei's Letter to the Manchu Government

"To all officials of the Manchu Government: Due to the haste of military affairs, I have been unable to send a letter of greeting. Thinking of you in the wind, I am ashamed beyond words. The land of the Central Plains belongs to our Han people. They braved frost and dew, cut through thorns and brambles, to possess this Divine Land. When the rebels usurped power, the Qing dynasty falsely claimed to be providing aid, proclaiming the great cause of suppressing the rebels, broke and routed the rebels, and stole and occupied Yanjing. Thus, the land of refined attire and civilization was ruined from within, and the descendants of the Chinese gods were plunged into barbarism. Whenever I read history to this point, I have never failed to close the book and sigh, my heart aching and blood flowing. When I secretly read the letter from Dorgon to Shi Kefa, it still said that our dynasty possessed Yanjing, which it obtained from the rebels, not taken from the Ming Dynasty. Alas! Who are you trying to deceive with these words? Are you trying to deceive Heaven? The false dynasty used barbarians to disrupt the Xia, stole the divine regalia, falsely adopted their politics and education, changed their attire, and disrupted their rituals, artifacts, and systems. They pre-established garrisons in key locations in each province, used writing to create prisons, and implicated the innocent. In their appointments, Manchus occupied eight or nine out of ten positions in the inner cabinet, while Han Chinese occupied only two or three out of ten positions in the outer provincial governor positions. In their collection of taxes, they extracted every ounce of tax and grain from the Han Chinese, while the Manchus sat and ate public funds, spending it like mud and sand. In their establishment of systems, they clearly demarcated the boundaries between Manchus and Han Chinese, with no intermarriage. In their promulgation of laws, a Manchu who killed a Han Chinese was fined twenty-four taels of silver, while a Han Chinese who injured a Manchu would have to pay with his life and affect his wife and children. Such inequalities are too numerous to count. This is why benevolent people and people with ambition are increasingly indignant and dissatisfied. Thirty people opposed the nationalization of roads, which was a foolish loyalty to the country. The officials were unaware and said, 'Kill them without question,' and 'Public sentiment is rampant.' What is even more strange is that the muddleheaded, greedy and wolfish Rui Cheng even declared that the Hubei army was not reliable and ordered the confiscation of guns and ammunition, which were then given to the banner troops, who defended day and night as if facing a formidable enemy. There was no trouble, but he deliberately created alarm to shock the public. This caused great anger among the people. In addition, they arrested the innocent and executed them. Our compatriots, who had long cherished the ambition of restoration, seized this opportunity of cruelty and inhumanity to raise their arms and rain down bullets. The flag of righteousness was raised, and the Manchu slaves fled, and the traitorous ringleaders escaped. This was due to the bravery and courage of our Han people, but it also showed that the fate of the false dynasty was exhausted. Now, the military spirit is angry and brave, and they are preparing for war with all their might, repeatedly requesting to cross the Yellow River north and strike directly at Yanjing. If the officials truly cherish the race and love their unrighteousness, they should advise them to cut off their title, return to their fief, and pay tribute. I will not seek a reputation for repeated massacres. If they are attached to their isolated city and hesitate, the great army will gather in an instant, and the ugly race will have no survivors. There is no need to count the number of those who will be defeated. Consider the advantages and disadvantages, gentlemen. The clouds and sky are vast, and it is tiring to wait. The letter does not fully express my meaning."

Shanghai Military Government Circular Telegram

"Recently, the North-South Military Unification Association sent the following telegram: 'This time, the people's demand for a republic relies on the power of the military everywhere. From an autocratic era, it has changed to a republican era. This is a great event unprecedented in thousands of years, and the happiness of hundreds of millions of compatriots. Moreover, the republic will be promulgated soon, and the North and South will jointly elect a provisional Grand President to organize a provisional new government. Domestic and foreign affairs are in a state of flux, and our military colleagues should invigorate their spirits, take the lead in advocating, eliminate private prejudices, and assist the unified Grand President in organizing a strong and complete new government, to stand on the globe as the most powerful and influential Republic of China. What is concerning is that if the North and South military factions establish their own parties and kill each other, it will not only provide an excuse for the monarchist party, but also cause the situation to deteriorate and affect foreign affairs, which will inevitably lead to disaster, which will be more powerful than that caused by the monarch. Is this the original intention of our military to hope for a republic? Thinking in anger and fearing, I am uneasy day and night, and I believe that in this transitional era of overthrow and construction, our North and South soldiers must cooperate and unite, organize a group, and first use the three major principles as the scope, which are listed as follows:

(1) After the Qing court announces the republic, when the central unified new government is established, it must obey the orders of the unified government.

(2) Restore peace and order in all localities.

Protect the lives and property of foreigners.

The above three principles are the obligations that our North and South soldiers should fulfill and should be uniformly observed. All procedures are planned to be discussed in detail by the officers of both sides after the establishment of the Military Unification Association, and then submitted to the unified government for approval. Those who do not comply will be considered public enemies of the civilized army, which is of great benefit to the future of the Chinese republic. If you express sympathy, please inform all military compatriots and inform us of the names and titles of the gentlemen who support this. In addition to telegraphing to the northern armies, we hope for a prompt reply. 'Etc. The reasons for relaying it are in line, and we hope that you will check it without limit. Military Governor of Shanghai Chen Qimei, respectfully.'

### Reconstruction Service in Chongqing

— Chongqing air mail report, September 17, by San Zhen

"Social service" is a common and ordinary work in Europe and the United States, but it is rare in China. In the past, there were some sporadic performances of work, but they did not give a deep impression to the vast number of people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, its development was hindered due to the limitations of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Although the government tried its best to promote it and established several social service agencies, it ultimately did not attract the attention of the general public and failed to achieve its intended purpose due to the neglect of various sectors of society.

Constant Civil Strife Torments the Souls Returning Home

The Chongqing Social Service Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs was one of the first organizations established in the country to serve the people. Thanks to five years of continuous efforts and continuous improvements, it has laid a good foundation. Social apartments, job placement, standard meals, movie theaters, etc., provide people in the temporary capital with a new impression at low prices and with enthusiastic service. At the same time, it has also become a source of praise and memories for every visitor to Chongqing.

"Victory Reconstruction" and "Returning Home" delighted the wanderers who had been away from home for eight years, but also tormented the millions of souls who urgently needed to return home. Transportation, whether by water, land, or air, was like suffering from severe suffocation due to the painful sacrifices of the past eight years and the constant civil strife of the past year, hindering the return of those returning home and shattering the distant dream of reconstruction. Hundreds of thousands of wanderers in Chongqing were anxious all day long, wandering all day long, looking at the rolling river and the blue sky, only with melancholy, only with sighs!

Fortunately, they bought boat tickets and were assigned to flight seats. However, problems still lined up in front of people. The handling of luggage, the solution of food and lodging, etc., were all brain-racking and heart-wrenching.

Octagonal Red Pavilion Arouses Interest of Returning People

Thus, "Reconstruction Service Stations" were established under the planning of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the promotion of the Chongqing Social Service Office. They were found in airports, bus stations, and ferry terminals. The octagonal red kiosks were eye-catching and appeared in front of every returning person.

Let's talk about the service station at the airport first. Chongqing was originally a mountain city with no flat ground. In addition to a small airport on the sand of the Yangtze River, the other two were still in the countryside twenty or thirty kilometers away from the city. Baishiyi has become the only airport for those returning to the capital. Therefore, the "Baishiyi Reconstruction Reception Center of the Social Service Office" also serves the millions of people returning to the capital with a grand scale and scientific management.

Because the airport is too far from the city, and most of the planes returning to Beijing take off at dawn, the Reconstruction Reception Center has specially contracted a car company in the city to pick up and drop off passengers four times a day. Inside the airport, it has built a dormitory that can accommodate 300 people, which is divided into group dormitories for dozens of people, small dormitories for seven or eight people, single dormitories for one or two people, and women's dormitories specially set up for women.

In addition to free dormitories, the use of hot and cold water and the handling of luggage do not cost passengers a penny. In addition, it also provides books, newspapers, and magazines, and holds lawn evening parties to relieve passengers of the loneliness of the journey.

In terms of food, there is the "standard meal" that the Social Service Office has enjoyed a long-standing reputation in Chongqing for five years. One rice, one dish, and one soup are enough for one person and enough for one person's nutrition. The cost is only 400 yuan in national currency per meal. This amount is not enough for half a movie ticket in Chongqing?

Even if You Spent Money, You Wouldn't Receive Such Hospitality

Perhaps, we would think of its simple equipment and poor hospitality because of the free accommodation. Here, it will not only exceed our imagination, but also surprise us! As long as people returning to Beijing from Baishiyi will recall the white bedding, neat furniture, and dignified and generous layout in the dormitory, and the polite waiters. Even if you spent money, you wouldn't be able to find such a hotel in Chongqing!

Service stations were set up in every reconstruction route in the city, such as stations and docks. The main task of each service station is to pick up and drop off luggage for guests. The original plan included long-distance and short-distance, but due to the difficulty of transportation, only short-distance transportation is currently handled. Take Chaotianmen as an example: Because Chaotianmen is the meeting place for those who take ferries east to return home, hundreds of thousands of pieces of luggage and public goods flow here from all over the world every day. The service station transports this batch of luggage to the ships taken by each passenger.

As for the registration of reconstruction vehicle tickets and the management of the sale of reconstruction wooden boats, it provides great assistance to those returning home. Those returning home from Sichuan and Shaanxi, Sichuan and Hunan, the southwest, and those taking wooden boats to the east will never forget this enthusiastic service.

Service stations of the same nature have also been set up in Yichang, Hankou, and Nanjing, and more service stations will gradually appear before our eyes in coordination with the return home by Yonglu.

I wish there were thousands of service stations widely set up, so that all returning people would be happy!

### A Brief Account of the Wuchang Uprising

— Our Newspaper Archives

As early as 1885 (the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), the Sino-French War occurred, and our country was defeated. Mr. Sun Yat-sen deeply felt the corruption of the internal affairs and the invasion of imperialism, so he cherished the ambition to overthrow the Qing court and establish the Republic of China. In 1894 (the twentieth year of Guangxu), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Mr. Sun established the Revive China Society in Honolulu. The following year, he launched the first uprising in Guangzhou, which failed. In 1905 (the thirty-first year of Guangxu), the Revolutionary Alliance was established in Tokyo. Subsequently, there were ten uprisings, including the Pingli Uprising, the Chaozhou Uprising, the Second Huizhou Uprising, the Qinlian Uprising, the Zhennanguan Uprising, the Second Qinlian Uprising, the Hekou Uprising, the Anqing Uprising, the Second Guangzhou Uprising, and the Huanghuagang Uprising on March 29, 1911 (the third year of the Xuantong reign). Only after ten failures was the Wuchang Uprising successful.

At that time, in order to ease the development of the revolutionary movement, the Qing court declared its intention to prepare for constitutionalism in 1906 (the thirty-second year of Guangxu), and promulgated the Outline of the Constitution in 1908. However, the power of legislation and justice still remained with the royal family, and the people had no freedom to speak of. In 1911 (the third year of the Xuantong reign), the Qing court promulgated the so-called "Nationalization of Railways" policy, which was tantamount to handing over national interests to foreigners, causing resistance from people across the country. The provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong successively organized railway protection associations. Overseas Chinese students in the United States and students studying in Japan also sent telegrams in response. The Qing court not only rejected the people's demands but also used force to suppress them, appointing Zhao Erfeng as the Governor-General of Sichuan, slaughtering the people, and arousing popular outrage. Members of the Revolutionary Alliance then contacted the new army in Wuchang and agreed to launch an uprising on the fifteenth day of the eighth month of that year. Unexpectedly, Rui Cheng, the Governor-General of Huguang, received a secret report beforehand, saying that the revolutionaries would take action during the Mid-Autumn Festival, so he ordered martial law. For a time, the wind howled and every plant seemed to be a soldier. On the twentieth day of the eighth month of the Xinhai year (October 11, 1911, Gregorian calendar), this newspaper recorded the situation in Hubei at that time, saying: "The province of Hubei is closely guarding against revolutionary parties who are instigating soldiers to rebel. Martial law is extremely strict. Yesterday, it was heard that the Commissioner of Police had received a secret edict from the Governor of Hubei, saying: 'The revolutionaries are generally carrying umbrellas (with sharp blades hidden in the handles) and leather bags (with bombs stored inside). Their clothing is no different from ordinary people, but they wear short garments underneath, in two colors, blue and white. Most of these people have cut their hair and are wearing fake queues.' Immediately, secret orders were issued to police at all places and city gates to be vigilant. If there are suspicious persons, search them immediately. Therefore, those carrying umbrellas and leather bags have been frequently questioned and searched by the police in recent days, causing great disturbance to the people. The day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Governor's Office was even more heavily guarded. In addition to deploying the military police隊, special police隊, fire brigade隊, patrol police軍, and security隊 inside and outside the Governor's compound, a team of infantry and a team of cavalry from the Eighth Division were also stationed outside the compound. Rui Cheng originally suspected that the army was in alliance with the revolutionaries and did not want to use them, but Zhang Biao strongly requested, saying: 'Even if other types of troops are dispatched to guard the Governor's compound instead of using the army, the soldiers are of mixed quality, and not everyone has joined the revolutionary party. If suspicion and doubt are openly shown, the morale of the army will be even more confused, and it will be easier for villains to instigate them. It is better to choose the most reliable ones and send them to guard, in order to reassure the public.' Rui Cheng agreed. Therefore, three teams were selected from these three types of troops to be stationed in the compound. The newly selected soldiers were all recommended by the squad officer and platoon leader. If there were any other changes, only those squad officers, etc., would be held responsible. The government officially stated that this martial law was due to telegrams from the Governor of Guangdong, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, saying: Huang Xing, the ringleader of the revolutionaries, has led his party to Hubei, and they are scheduled to launch an uprising on the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was based on a note from the British Minister in Beijing and a secret telegram from the Minister Plenipotentiary stationed in Japan, stating that the revolutionaries in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and other places have disguised themselves and crossed the border, and it is heard that they will take action in Wuchang."

The revolutionaries and the new army, seeing that the opportunity had been leaked and the defenses were strict, originally planned to postpone the uprising until the twenty-fifth day. Unexpectedly, party members Ding Hutang, Liu Rukui, Chen Hualong, Peng Chufan, Yang Hongsheng, and others were suddenly arrested in Hankou on the seventeenth day. The list of party members, with the names of soldiers from various battalions, was also seized. Ding and others were executed on the spot. It was also heard that Rui Cheng would investigate them one by one according to the list, and everyone was in danger. Therefore, at 9:00 p.m. on the eighteenth day, the artillery and engineering teams in the new army, who sympathized with the revolution, opened fire and launched the uprising. This newspaper also had a daily account of the situation on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month of the Xinhai year (i.e., October 19, 1911, Gregorian calendar): "The revolutionaries originally planned to launch the uprising at 3:00 a.m. on the nineteenth day, using cannons as a signal. They would first kill the Manchu soldiers of a certain battalion of the 30th Regiment (Manchus occupied the majority of that battalion), and then attack the Governor's Office and the Provincial Administration Office. Unexpectedly, before the time arrived, a civilian's house on Sima Road outside the Wusheng Gate suddenly suffered an accident. The artillery, cavalry, and transport battalions outside the city suspected it was a signal fire. First, the transport team shot and killed their team officer and marched out in formation. The artillery and cavalry teams followed them, broke through the city and entered. The battalions inside the city immediately occupied the gunpowder depot and the arsenal. The Han Chinese of the 29th Regiment and the Manchu soldiers of the 30th Regiment exchanged fire, causing casualties on both sides. Later, the artillery team entered the city and attacked together, causing the Manchu soldiers to collapse completely, with corpses lying everywhere. They then besieged the Governor's Office, with the artillery team using seven heavy artillery pieces to bombard directly from Snake Mountain, turning the surrounding area into ruins. All the soldiers wore white cloth on their left arms, and their slogan was 'Working together with one heart'."

On the night of the 19th (October 10, 1911, Gregorian calendar), the revolutionary army captured the Governor's Office, drove away Rui Cheng, the Governor-General of Huguang. Rui Cheng fled into the "Chu Yu" warship and escaped to Hankou, begging the consuls of various countries to use warships to bombard the revolutionary army, but to no avail. So he simply ran away and later sneaked into Shanghai, where he was arrested by Zhang Renjun, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, and sent to Beijing for punishment.

On the morning of the 20th day of the eighth month of the Xinhai year, representatives of the National Army gathered at the Consultative Bureau, with no less than tens of thousands of people attending. They elected Li Yuanhong (Songqing) as the Military Governor of Hubei and issued a proclamation to reassure the people. The original text is as follows: "Proclamation by Li, Military Governor of the Hubei Army of the Republic of China: This Military Governor has expelled the Manchus and restored the Han people. All my compatriots should strictly observe order and not violate military law. All articles of punishment and reward are listed below: Those who harbor Manchus will be beheaded; those who harbor spies will be beheaded; those who engage in unfair trade will be beheaded; those who harm foreigners will be beheaded; those who disrupt commerce will be beheaded; those who rape, kidnap, burn, and kill will be beheaded; those who incite strikes will be beheaded; those who disobey the righteous army will be beheaded; those who willingly contribute grain and pay will be rewarded; those who protect concessions will be rewarded; those who guard churches will be rewarded; those who lead the masses to surrender will be rewarded; those who persuade villagers will be rewarded; those who report enemy intelligence will be rewarded; those who maintain commerce will be rewarded. August, the 4609th year of the Yellow Emperor's Era."

The people's army took advantage of the victory to attack, and the Qing soldiers retreated without fighting. The three towns of Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou were all occupied by the people's army. At the same time, revolutionary party members in various provinces, upon hearing the news, rose up in response. Within only one month, more than ten provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, and Fujian, successively declared independence. The allied forces of the people's armies of various provinces captured Nanjing, and then organized a provisional government in Nanjing. Representatives from seventeen provinces elected Mr. Sun Yat-sen as the Provisional President, designating it as the first year of the Republic of China.

Seeing that the situation was dire, the Qing court reappointed Yuan Shikai to form a cabinet and negotiate peace with the people's army, sending Tang Shaoyi as the peace negotiator. The representative of the people's army was Wu Tingfang. The two sides held a meeting in Shanghai. Later, Tang resigned, and Yuan directly negotiated with the representatives of the people's army via telegram. On February 12 of that year, the peace treaty was concluded, the Qing Emperor abdicated, and the Xinhai Revolution was successfully concluded.
