### Report on Administrative Measures by the Executive Yuan; Political Review Conference Held; Government Reorganization Still Under Negotiation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Jiang Menglin, and heads of various departments are scheduled to report on administrative measures and exchange opinions to the National Assembly representatives of the Kuomintang at the Ministry of National Defense at 4 p.m. on the 30th, conducting a review of political work.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] With the completion of the new constitution and the closing of the National Assembly, all eyes are focused on the reorganization of the government, and rumors abound, most of which are premature. It is reported that the government, through Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun, has contacted various parties to solicit opinions. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party will go to Shanghai one after another in the coming days, planning to meet separately before the New Year, and a broader meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month. Attendees will include more than just members of the party's central committee. The scope of discussion will include not only internal party issues but also negotiations on participating in the government. At the same time, the Youth Party will also hold a gathering, with the location yet to be determined in Nanjing or Shanghai. The meeting will also decide on the opinion of participating in the government. After the two parties make decisions, they will exchange opinions once again before making a concrete proposal to the government. Generally speaking, the issue of government reorganization may take some time to materialize.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Xu Fulin, Yang Junming, Hong Shaozhi, and others of the Democratic Socialist Party left Nanjing for Shanghai at 8 a.m. on the 29th. Xu told reporters before his departure that the completion of the new constitution represents a major step forward in China's democratic politics. Going forward, with gradual progress, if the government achieves transparency and incorruptibility, then the warlord-style separatism will naturally disappear. He has exchanged opinions with government officials on the reorganization of the government many times and has also spoken with Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun. The Democratic Socialist Party suggested that the government first draft a reorganization plan and then solicit opinions from various parties and social elites. Wu and Zhang have expressed their agreement with this and will relay it to the government for consideration and proposal.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Lei Zhen is scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th.

[Our Dispatch] Various leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party in Nanjing have come to Shanghai one after another. Xu Fulin arrived on the evening of the 29th and went to the party headquarters on Yuyuan Road to rest. Yang Junming came with him. Jiang Yuntian arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 28th and went to Fan Garden on the morning of the 29th to meet with Zhang Junmai to report on the process of participating in the National Assembly. That night, he took the night train to Nanjing and then to his hometown in Anhui Province, where he will rest for about a week. It has not been decided whether he will stay in Nanjing to expedite matters or return to Shanghai immediately.

After Lei Zhen returned to Shanghai, he met with Zhang Junmai again on the morning of the 29th and decided to return to Nanjing that evening. There are widespread rumors in the city that Zhang Junmai has agreed to Lei's request and will go to Nanjing in the coming days, but Sun Xianyi, a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, has denied this. Sun told reporters, "Whether Mr. Junmai goes to Nanjing or whether the Democratic Socialist Party is preparing to participate in the government has not yet been decided." The Democratic Socialist Party will hold an important meeting in Shanghai in the near future to discuss its attitude towards the current political situation.

Jiang Yuntian then told reporters: "Now that the constitution has been passed, how to formulate the relevant laws and regulations such as the presidential election law to be formulated later is indeed an important issue. Participating in the drafting of the constitution in the National Assembly is quite different in nature from participating in the government to formulate such laws and regulations. The formulation of such relevant laws and regulations is inherently closely related to the implementation of the constitution, but if opposition parties participate in the legislative completion because the relevant laws and regulations are formulated by the Legislative Yuan, then the constraints they are subjected to will be different from those in the National Assembly." The reporter then asked whether it was possible for opposition parties to maintain their opposition status while participating in the formulation of these laws and regulations. Jiang replied, "This is the current crux of the matter."

Jiang avoided answering directly about the current situation, only saying, "There is no way to talk about the constitution without a ceasefire." However, regarding the prospect of peace talks, Jiang believes that "it is no longer a matter of contacting the Communist Party again for peace talks. If peace talks or running around were useful, then a solution should have been reached long ago during the previous peace talks."

[Our Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 29th. In the morning, he visited Zhang Junli at his residence, but because the 29th was the anniversary of Zhang's wife's death, Zhang had to go to Zhenru to bury his wife, so they did not talk much. Zhang then returned to visit Zuo in the evening to exchange views on state affairs. Zuo is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 31st.

Regarding the rumors of government reorganization, Zuo said that it is still in the negotiation stage. The government is indeed determined to do this, but whether opposition parties participate in the government is different from individual participation, and there are many issues to consider. Zuo said that after the constitution is passed, how opposition parties participate in the formulation of various "subsidiary laws" derived from the constitution is an important issue that should be resolved as soon as possible. Although there is still a year before the date of implementation of the constitution, next year is actually a very busy year, and the government should schedule in advance and complete various preparations on schedule: for example, building an auditorium that can accommodate more than four thousand representatives for meetings is also one of these preparations.

[Our Dispatch] The leaders of the Youth Party in Nanjing, such as Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, etc., will come to Shanghai in the coming days. Also, Zhang Qun will also come to Shanghai.

### The CCP Holds a Cadre Meeting; Decides to Abandon Peace Talks and Establish a Separate Government; Instructs Party Members to Continue Armed Struggle

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] According to reliable sources, the CCP Central Committee held a high-level military, political, and party cadre meeting chaired by Mao Zedong starting on November 12th. Attendees included Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Liao Chengzhi, Ren Bishi, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, etc. The important resolutions included: (1) unanimously supporting Mao Zedong's leadership for the CCP to fight to the end; (2) abandoning peace negotiations with the Kuomintang and establishing a separate government; (3) strengthening air force power; (4) enhancing propaganda efforts internationally and secretly organizing CCP branches in countries such as Britain, the United States, and France; (5) blockading various cities and collecting materials, concentrating them in its occupied areas; (6) implementing a comprehensive militia policy to strengthen guerrilla and counter-movement combat capabilities.

[Central News Agency, Xulin, 29th] In order to rectify the increasingly fierce factional struggles within the party, the CCP Central Bureau recently issued an order, the content of which is to lavishly talk about military victories to prove the correctness of Mao Zedong's line. Regarding peace negotiations, it emphasized their hopelessness and instructed its party members that "the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference can never achieve peace, and armed struggle cannot be stopped for a moment." "We must negotiate during fighting and find excuses to fight during negotiations." Stopping armed struggle now is equivalent to surrendering to the "enemy" and "selling out the proletariat," thus proving that "only Mao Zedong's thought and line" is the way to implement the "goals of the Marxist-Leninist line." After propagating Mao Zedong's thought to strengthen the faith of its party members, the order also instructed its subordinates to "strictly guard against and eliminate the activities and deception of a small number of counter-revolutionaries within the party to consolidate the foundation of the Communist Party." This order proves that not only can we deeply understand that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace, but we can also know the brutal style of Mao Zedong's faction in eliminating dissidents.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] Tomorrow, students from six universities in Beiping—Peking University, Yenching University, Normal College, Sino-French University, and Tsinghua University—will strike for one day to protest the rape of Shen Chong, a female student in the pre-medical program at Peking University, by American soldiers. A poetry recitation meeting is scheduled to be held at the Peking University Theater at 9 a.m. to read relevant documents. Today, when representatives from various universities met at Peking University at 6 p.m. to discuss the strike issue, the two sides, those who advocated the strike and those who opposed it, got into a fight due to disagreements, and the meeting ended without results. The two factions are currently engaged in a fierce struggle in the university. It is said that an intelligence network at Peking University claims that the raped student was sent by Yan'an to provoke American soldiers to create an incident. Among the professors, Yan Shutang believed that students were making a big deal out of a small matter and that it was narrow-minded nationalism. Mao Zishui said that this was a personal legal issue and should not be amplified. Chen Xueping also strongly advised students to be cautious. Other professors, such as Xu Deheng, Qian Duansheng, Zhang Xiruo, and Zhu Guangqian, expressed extreme indignation. Xu Deheng cried bitterly over this. The raped student, Shen Chong, is the granddaughter of Shen Baozhen, a famous general in the late Qing Dynasty, and is from Minhou, Fujian Province. She is 19 years old, and her father works in the Ministry of Communications. Shen was a newly admitted student from the Beijing-Shanghai area of Peking University and came to Beiping with the returning students of the school, staying at her cousin's house.

The Seventh Branch of the Police Bureau of this government and the patrol team of the Sino-American Police-Military Liaison Office arrested one of the offending American soldiers, William Bierseon, on the spot.

(3) The U.S. military authorities stationed in Beiping should strictly supervise their troops, attach importance to military discipline and military law, to prevent any behavior related to harm to Chinese civilians and the occurrence of Sino-American incidents, and guarantee that similar incidents will never occur again in the future. (4) The local U.S. military authorities should maintain close contact with the Chinese authorities to seek closer cooperation in order to maintain the traditional friendship between China and the United States. The aforementioned notification and memorandum were sent to the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters stationed in Beiping by personnel sent by this government, and a verbal protest was also lodged. According to the verbal response from the U.S. military authorities, all clauses in the notification can be accepted after the trial is completed and the crime is established, and deep apologies were expressed. However, procedurally, it must be submitted to the U.S. Army Headquarters in Tianjin for approval before it can be implemented. Your school's teachers and students are concerned about this incident, and this letter is sent for your review.

### British Newspaper Comments on China's New Constitution; Praises the Fair Attitude of the Chairman; The Democratic Spirit of the National Assembly is Especially Noteworthy

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] "The Scotsman," a major newspaper in Scotland, is the only British newspaper to comment on China's constitution-making. The newspaper stated that the content of the new constitution is more democratic than previous constitutional reforms. The unanimous passage of the constitution by the National Assembly shows President Chiang's own aspirations are increasingly realized. Since the defeat of Japan, the leadership of Asia has been handed over, and the leadership of Asia seems to be a victory for China, which can quickly put its country on track. Judging from China's constitution-making, it has been able to guide India, because democracy can begin to build a country of Kang and Zhang.

[Another Dispatch] The London Times wrote a review today, welcoming the completion of China's new constitution, and praised the National Assembly for completing the constitution-making work in a short period of six weeks with the word "noteworthy," because it is not easy to reach a consensus with such a large number of representatives. The newspaper also stated: "Although the Communist Party did not participate, the National Assembly is still an impressive meeting. Representatives from Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Northeast attended, which is a manifestation of the Chinese people deciding their own destiny, and the process of constitution-making has shown the democracy recognized by the Chinese people." The newspaper then praised President Chiang's fair attitude in constitution-making, and stated that the Kuomintang's role as caretaker will eventually end. China now needs expanded political life, and only through mutual competition between new and old parties can there be expanded political life. The newspaper then compared Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution with the current new constitution, stating that the former's proposed government organization is a "balanced and meticulous organization," while the latter is "simpler and more feasible." In any case, in terms of wording, the system established by the new constitution allows all free-minded people to participate without feeling dissatisfied or difficult. The newspaper also pointed out the advantages of the new constitution, such as the fact that all political parties have equal status in law, that all ethnic groups have equal status, and that personal freedom and other aspects are particularly noteworthy. Finally, it stated that the government will now redouble its efforts to reach an agreement with the Communist Party.

### Car Attacked at Gubeikou; UNRRA Protests to the CCP; Dong Biwu Cables Yan'an for Instructions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Following the attack on an UNRRA gasoline truck near Gubeikou by the Communist army, UNRRA has again filed a serious protest with the CCP office in Nanjing. The original text of the protest is as follows: "We have just received an urgent telegram from our UNRRA office in Peiping stating that at eight o'clock on the morning of November 23rd, two trucks of the Highway Transportation Administration, carrying gasoline donated by UNRRA, were attacked by CCP soldiers eight miles east of Gubeikou.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Representatives from thirteen dancing establishments in Nanjing, including Jinggu, Fenghuang, and Jinfen, held a flag with the words "Dancing Industry Petition" and went to the White Lower Road Municipal Council meeting hall at around 8 a.m. on the 29th, requesting a review of the ban on setting up social dance halls. They argued that Shanghai and other places have not banned the opening of dance halls, and requested that the Nanjing public opinion institutions encourage noble entertainment and allow the establishment of social dance halls. Council Speaker Wang Lu received them and instructed them to wait until the formal proposal was reviewed. However, the general assembly this morning had no time to discuss or review the proposal. The dance industry petition representatives waited for a long time before leaving.

### Less Than Half of the Railways in Jilin Have Been Taken Over

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 29th] Gao Bukun, Director of the Jilin Railway Bureau, recently told reporters that the total length of the railways under the jurisdiction of the Jilin Railway Bureau is 1,400 kilometers. So far, only 530 kilometers have been taken over. Currently, there are trains running daily on the Jilin to Hailong, Lade to Binjiang, Jilin to [blank space], and Changchun to Xian lines. Although the railway tracks and bridge equipment have been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army, they have been repaired as soon as they were damaged due to the active efforts of the repair teams. The biggest difficulty at present is the shortage of vehicles, and it is hoped that there will be supplements next year.

### Self-Made Penicillin; The Peiping Laboratory Completed

The dedication ceremony is scheduled for New Year's Day

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 29th] The huge buildings of the Penicillin Laboratory and the General Experimental Building of the Central Epidemic Prevention Experimental Institute in Peiping will hold a dedication ceremony for the new building on New Year's Day of the 36th year of the Republic. According to Director Tang Feifan, the Penicillin manufacturing equipment of the institute was donated by the American Red Cross and the American Medical Aid to China Association. Due to the American sailors' strike, some important parts have not yet arrived, so they had to be manufactured locally and partially put into operation. It is reported that the test results are very good, and its quality is almost the same as that of imported products. After all the machines are installed, the daily production can reach 100,000 units. The required raw materials are currently being researched to replace them with domestic materials. The institute plans to use penicillin manufacturing equipment to conduct other research and cultivate specialized talents.

### Liu Kai, Returning from Attending the United Nations General Assembly, Arrives in Shanghai, Talking Lightly of Impressions

[Our City News] Dr. Liu Kai, the special representative of China who attended the United Nations General Assembly, arrived in Shanghai on a Pacific Airlines flight from San Francisco at 4:45 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by Deputy Representative Zhu Xinmin. After getting off the plane, Liu met with reporters from the Central News Agency and expressed his impressions of the trip, saying: "After eight weeks of discussion, the United Nations General Assembly has adjourned. What makes us most gratified and worth noting is that the member states' confidence in the future of world peace is increasing day by day. The achievements of this General Assembly include three important points: (1) The establishment of a disarmament plan, (2) The diligent work of the Trusteeship Committee, and (3) Finding a solution to the veto problem. In short, during the eight weeks of the session, the atmosphere of friendship among the countries has been improving day by day." Finally, Liu also said: "He will stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then go to Nanjing to report to the Standing Committee on his attendance at the General Assembly."

### CCP Uses River Dams for Construction, Obstructs Closing the Breach in Every Possible Way; The Shandong Provincial Associations in Jinan Pathetically Plead

[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 29th] The Shandong Provincial Associations in Jinan reported that the Yellow River Inspection Team and the Huayuankou Closing Bureau were shot at by the Communist army while inspecting the river downstream from the Bian River, forcing them to turn back. The reason the CCP did this was because the dykes they built were all war projects, and they were afraid that the inside story would be revealed, so they obstructed the team's mission in every possible way. However, the provincial associations believed that if the downstream dykes were not restored, and the breach at Huayuankou was not closed before the next month, then eastern Shandong would inevitably be submerged, and millions of people would be buried in the bellies of fish. Therefore, they again represented the downstream residents and sent a telegram to Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Liu Bocheng, asking them not to use the river dams in order to facilitate closing the breach. The telegram was moving, and among it there was the phrase "The Yellow River is dangerous, please do not use it lightly, otherwise the land of joy will be submerged, and it will be difficult to make it a liberated area, and the people of Shandong will be fed to the fish, and there will be no source of labor." It was unbearable to read.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] Since the stone quarrying machine, car, and gasoline of the Lue Wangfen Stone Factory were destroyed and burned by the Communist army on December 9, and many employees were captured, the Henan Provincial Council believed that if the CCP did not stop obstructing the closing work, the breach would be difficult to close before the ice jam, and even after the closing, it would be difficult to prevent further destruction and create several new flooded areas. Therefore, they telegraphed CCP representatives in Nanjing, Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan, requesting them to forward the telegram to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, asking them to remember the suffering of the people in the flooded areas, order their subordinates to provide assistance, and immediately release the captured employees.

### More Than Eighty Habitual Thieves in Shenyang Station Arrested; The Theft Wind in the Station Swept Away

### The Labor-Management Dispute Was Resolved Last Night; Nanjing Newspapers Will Resume Publication Today; The Increase Multiple is Still Under Final Negotiation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, December 9th] The labor-management dispute of the 14 private newspapers in Nanjing was resolved between the two parties at midnight on the 29th, and each newspaper decided to resume publication. The solution is as follows: (1) Salary increase: increase by 40% from December, and 50% from January (it is said that this point is still under final negotiation). (2) Year-end bonus issue: For large newspapers, 2 million yuan will be distributed to workers, and for small newspapers, the amount will be reduced by half.

### Yesterday's Negotiations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The 14 private newspapers in Nanjing failed to resume publication on the 29th after the labor strike on the 28th. The Nanjing Daily, which did not join the Newspaper Union, was also not published. Therefore, the Central Daily News, the Peace Daily, and the small Social Daily were selling quickly. Newspapers from Shanghai also rushed to Nanjing and were bought out. The relevant parties were deeply anxious about this and eagerly hoped for a solution. At 1 p.m. on the 28th, Zhang You [blank space], the director of the Nanjing People's Daily and representative of the management, and Zhou Yidong, the director of the Guidance Section of the Central Propaganda Department, the mediator, went to the Jixian Inn in the small lane of Zhuangyuanjing in Fuzimiao and negotiated with the labor representatives until late at night. The labor side initially requested to adjust the treatment, increasing by 62% from December and issuing double salaries at the end of the year. The management stated that the salary increase would increase by 40% from January next year, and that the year-end double salary could not be paid because the newspapers were losing money. Later, the mediator proposed a compromise: the salary increase could start from December, and the increase multiple hoped that both parties would not insist and seek another compromise number. As for the year-end allowance, it was not necessary to issue it in the name of double salary, but each newspaper could issue some according to its ability. The labor side stated that they would consider it, but required an average of 200,000 yuan per person for the year-end allowance. The management representatives failed to agree immediately because the newspapers' ability to bear the burden was different. It was already the morning of the 29th, even if a solution could be found, it would be impossible to publish the newspaper on the 29th, so they dispersed without result. On the morning of the 29th, the labor side distributed leaflets on the main roads, explaining their demands and calling for social support. At 10 a.m., the responsible persons of the management newspapers gathered again at the Shanghai Hotel on Zhongshan East Road to discuss countermeasures and decided to solve them separately. At 4 p.m., a notice saying "This newspaper is expected to resume publication tomorrow" was posted on the closed door of the Dagang Newspaper. Other newspapers were also working hard to seek a compromise in the negotiations between labor and management. Until the evening, there was no consensus.

[Another Telegram] The responsible persons of the private newspapers in Nanjing that were suspended and the mediators from the relevant agencies continued to meet at the Shanghai Hotel at 7 p.m. on the 29th to discuss how to deal with the labor strike. First, the responsible persons of each newspaper reported the results of seeking individual solutions, and most of them had little success. The labor side had agreed to make concessions on the salary increase, increasing by 50%, but the year-end allowance issue was still the crux of the matter. The meeting lasted until 11:30 p.m. without result.

### Northern Fujian Prepares to Form a Company to Transport and Sell Local Products to Nanyang

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th] The counties in northern Fujian have recently initiated the preparation to form a local product transportation and sales company, specializing in transporting and selling northern Fujian's tea, timber, paper bamboo shoots and other local products to Nanyang. The capital is 2 billion yuan. In addition to raising private shares, they have also sent people to Xiamen to negotiate with the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company to participate in the investment.

### An Aircraft of the Capital Air Transport Team Crashes; Nine People Injured in a Rice Field

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] An aircraft accident occurred in the capital on the 29th. A C-47 type 302 aircraft of the Green Air Transport Brigade took off from the Da Jiaochang Airport at 7:37 a.m., bound for northern Jiangsu. Less than 20 minutes later, the aircraft engine overheated, and the pilot immediately turned back, intending to return to Da Jiaochang, but it was impossible. It was forced to land in a rice field outside Cangbo Gate. The aircraft caught fire and burned down immediately. All nine people on board were injured, two of them seriously. They were all personnel from the Air Transport Brigade Headquarters.

### The Yellow River Before the Ice Jam

— Special Correspondent Fan Shiqin

It is really not easy to manage the Yellow River. It is like a person with chronic illness for many years, whose internal organs are relaxed and whose limbs are stiff. If you use light medicine, it will be ineffective, and if you use heavy medicine, it is a concern. Many "famous doctors" are helpless for it, and many "good medicines" are ineffective for it. Not to mention curing it at the root, even curing it at the surface is not a simple matter.

Like the current closing of the breach at Huayuankou, it only leads the downstream back to the old course, which cannot be said to cure the root cause. Whether Huayuankou can be blocked by the end of January next year is still a mystery. In addition, recently, the stone-opening machine at Lu Wangfen was blown to pieces by the Communist army. The stones at the construction site are just like the troops fighting need bullets, and suddenly there is a "ran out of bullets" panic. How can the construction team with bare hands do it? In the past two days, the upper reaches of Shanzhou have been frozen, and the ice is about to come down. I am afraid that no matter how big or dense the wooden stakes are, it is difficult to resist the sharp edge of the ice knife. These days, the project of adding wooden stakes at Huayuankou is indeed going smoothly, perhaps someone has invited the ghost of Mr. Kong Ming, suddenly, in this season of strong northwest winds, there are two or three days of southeast winds, which kill the water in the breach, and the wooden stakes are added one by one. We can now assume that the stone materials can still be solved, and the Communist Party's sabotage is nothing; of course, we also assume that the project can be completed successfully and on schedule, and the ice knife and ice mountain will not damage this project of more than 2.2 million yuan. Under such an assumption, we can naturally rest assured about the new Yellow River flooded area. That is, we don't have to worry about the Jia Luhe and Shahe rivers in the new Yellow River flooded area. In the past, the water depth was only seven or eight meters, and even the bottom of the river could be seen, but now it has reached fourteen or five meters; naturally, we don't have to worry about such water depth will submerge the dykes on both sides; the seven-kilometer-long area north of Zhoujiakou that is about to be dangerous does not need to be considered; as for the ice floods in January in the future, the ice will rush over and climb up the dyke, and suddenly kill the workers who are rushing to rescue the disaster, it is also a dream; there is no need to rescue the dykes in the new Yellow River flooded area, saving the trouble of digging ice and soil to build dykes, and saving the trouble of building huge wooden structures to protect the dykes. In short, everything can be ignored, and everything can be avoided, because the water has returned to its old home.

However, the Yellow River is like a drunkard, who can be helped to the east and fall to the west, or helped to the west and fall to the east. If the breach at Huayuankou is blocked, the water level in the upper reaches will suddenly rise by two meters. Then Wen County and Meng County will bear the brunt. The dyke in Wen County has not been properly repaired since the great flood in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. There are 27 kilometers of dykes there that need to be repaired immediately, otherwise the river water is already one foot higher than the ground, and once the dyke breaks, Wen County will be submerged immediately. The dyke in Meng County is relatively solid, but if it is not repaired, it will not be able to withstand the impact of high water levels. Some people worry that if something goes wrong in the Wen County and Meng County area, the water will flow to the Qin River, and from the Qin River to the Wei River, and it can even sweep to Tianjin. This disaster will not be small.

Living on the Yellow River and eating Yellow River carp makes people drool, but unfortunately, being buried in the belly of the carp is also unforgivable. It is quite difficult to conscript labor for other things, but if you want to repair the Yellow River dykes, the people will be happy to volunteer. They know the great harm of the Yellow River better than any Yellow River expert. This year, the cost of managing the lower reaches of the Yellow River, including the Huayuankou closing project, is 6 million yuan. This number seems very large, but after more than 2 million yuan has been spent on the closing of the breach, the remaining amount given to the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan is only more than 1 million yuan per province. In this way, the number is not very large. At the same time, because the price changes are too large, the budget is not up to the actual needs, so there are cases of cutting corners. For example, the dykes built in the Lankao area are only built with sand and soil. It is inevitable that there will be danger when the water passes by in the future. This problem is not very serious, because as long as you spend a lot of money again, it will be solved. The most regrettable thing is that in the Wen and Meng area, the Communist army is erratic. Recently, the Huayuankou Closing Bureau sent an engineering team to work, and it was abandoned three times in ten days. How can this make the work progress freely? Under the CCP's large-scale destruction policy, it can also be said that under the lack of political stability, it is always difficult to manage the Yellow River everywhere. Xia Yu's success in water management was closely related to the peace of the country. Before he managed the water, Shun had already released the four evil tribes, and there was peace within five thousand miles to the deserted areas. But now the Yellow River has become a man-made natural disaster, which requires engineering experts with political and scientific minds to overcome.

In short, there are many problems gathered on the Yellow River: if the breach is not closed, the ice flood in the new Yellow River flooded area this year will be a difficult hurdle; if it is closed, there is a risk of problems in the Wen and Meng area; and we must take care of all aspects, and the CCP is in the middle to make it difficult. I heard that the Yellow River iron bridge will be rebuilt next year, then the water level will be raised by one or two feet, which is also a point that those who care about the Yellow River should care about.

Editorial

### A New Page in Sino-Siamese Relations

The first Siamese Ambassador to China, Shengku Anturalerek, met with Chairman Chiang yesterday, presented his credentials, and said: "The friendship between China and Siam has a long history, because there are various close relationships between the two countries. For example, many of your people live in my country, living and working in peace and contentment, and passing on from generation to generation, which is enough to show the harmony between the Chinese and Siamese people. This friendly relationship has been further consolidated by the recent signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship." After accepting the credentials presented by the Siamese Ambassador, our Chairman replied, saying: "During the Second World War, the poisonous forces of the Japanese aggressors caused the people of the book country to suffer immensely. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with this, because, as Your Excellency said just now, the friendship between China and Siam has a long history, and there are indeed various close relationships between the two countries. We are very pleased that so many of our people live in Siam, living and working in peace and contentment, and passing on from generation to generation. And we firmly believe that due to the signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, the formal diplomatic relationship between your country and ours has been established, and the friendship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples must be strengthened accordingly." The arrival of the Siamese Ambassador to take office this time has indeed opened a new page in Sino-Siamese relations. As the Siamese Ambassador takes office, I would like to look forward to the Sino-Siamese opening.

China and Siam are brotherly countries, and have had frequent prostitutes since ancient times. There are a large number of Chinese compatriots living in Siam, accounting for almost one-third of the total population of Siam, so the relationship between China and Siam has always been very close and intimate. Since the Japanese invaders attempted to create the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere", Japan has sent fifth columnists to carry out activities in Siam on a large scale. Some Siamese people consciously or unconsciously fell for the poison of Japanese propaganda. The trend of the times has stirred up the rise of narrow nationalism, re-establishing its national name as "Thailand", imitating Hitler's style of "recovering lost land", and constantly instigating the Burmese people living in our southwestern border region, especially the "Yi" people in the southern border of Siam, to return to the fold. Since Thailand advocated the so-called "Greater Thai Nation" movement, there have been reefs everywhere in Sino-Siamese relations. Because of the advocacy of narrow nationalism, when the Pearl Harbor Incident broke out, the likes of Pan Phibun seized the central hub and went against the tide. We know very well that all this is contrary to the true direction of the people of Thailand. As our Chairman said in his reply, during the Second World War, the poisonous forces of the Japanese aggressors caused the people of Siam to suffer immensely, and the Chinese people deeply sympathize with them.

Siam began its rebirth after the Second World War. At this time, China and Siam began to establish normal diplomatic relations, which is really a gratifying thing. I remember that at the beginning of this year, our country sent a delegation to visit Siam, led by Minister Li Tiezheng, to visit Siam; later, the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship was signed, establishing the foundation for normal diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Now the Siamese Ambassador to China has arrived, all of which are manifestations of Sino-Siamese friendly relations. Our country's attitude towards the various ethnic groups in Asia has been repeatedly announced to the world by our Chairman. We not only have no ambitions for aggression, but also want to regard ourselves as elder brothers, and work with the various ethnic groups in Asia to seek human welfare, especially the improvement of the welfare of the people of Asia. Since China and Siam have had very close relations in the past, and now that we are in the value of national rejuvenation and rebirth, and Sino-Siamese relations are opening a new page with the arrival of the first Siamese Ambassador to China, how to promote and carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples that existed in the past should be the goal of those who are concerned about enhancing Sino-Siamese relations. We hope that due to the arrival of the first Siamese Ambassador to China, the relations between China and Siam, whether cultural, economic, or commercial, can be more closely linked. This is not only related to the friendship between China and Siam, but also to the prosperity and peace of the East.

Finally, we would like to wish the Siamese Ambassador to China success in his mission, and a healthy and happy journey!

### The Future Implementation of the Constitution

After fifteen years of twists and turns, the National Assembly was finally convened. After forty days of meetings, it completed the Constitution of the Republic of China and decided that the government would formally announce its promulgation on January 1, 1947, and its implementation on December 25, 1947. This is the most important step forward in China's democratic politics and the greatest price paid for the countless martyrs and patriots who shed their blood and gave their lives since the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system.

Judging from the Constitution itself, it is certainly not perfect. For example, the wording of Article 1, "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, governed by the people, owned by the people, and enjoyed by the people," is redundant and cumbersome. Since the general preamble states, "Based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China… this Constitution is enacted," it goes without saying that it is based on the Three Principles of the People. Since it is clearly stated as "Three Principles of the People," it is naturally a democratic republic. Since it is stated as a "democratic republic," why is it necessary to add "governed by the people, owned by the people, and enjoyed by the people"? However, during the discussion of this article in the Comprehensive Review Committee, representatives of various parties and factions argued fiercely. Later, a majority vote passed an amendment to change the article to "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party expressed strong dissatisfaction, almost causing the Constitutional Assembly to fall into a stalemate. Finally, the Kuomintang representatives, in order to consider the overall situation, reconsidered and cancelled the amendment, maintaining the original proposal, and the atmosphere at the meeting became harmonious again.

Also, issues such as the national capital, the duties of the president and the Executive Yuan, the powers of the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly, and the issues of the Manchu, Hui, Tibetan, and other minority ethnic groups, all underwent lengthy debates. The final amended articles that were passed were all the result of mutual concessions and compromises. Originally, the number of Kuomintang representatives in this National Assembly increased because the Chinese Communist Party and some members of the Democratic League refused to join. However, they did not rely on their majority to act arbitrarily, but everywhere displayed a spirit of impartiality and a cooperative attitude, fully respecting and accommodating the opinions of minority parties and representatives of minority ethnic groups. The success of this National Assembly in enacting the Constitution is at least largely due to the ability of the Kuomintang representatives, under the guidance of Chairman Chiang, to make concessions and create a harmonious atmosphere.

This Constitution of the Republic of China inevitably has many shortcomings, but these shortcomings are precisely the manifestation of the spirit of cooperation among the various parties and factions in China. The key to a constitution lies in its implementation. Without a foundation of national cooperation, even a perfect constitution is just a piece of paper. From the perspective of basic democratic principles, this constitution is already full of the spirit of democracy. From the perspective of the realities of various aspects of China, this constitution is even more a manifestation of the unity of the Chinese nation.

Therefore, we cannot engage in textual criticism to search for the shortcomings of the Constitution. Our greatest responsibility in the future is to promote the unity and cooperation of all parties and factions in the country, so that the Constitution can be truly implemented, lay the foundation for China's democratic politics, launch the work of national construction, and relieve the people from their suffering. Since the Xinhai Revolution, internal troubles and external threats have come one after another. In particular, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the suffering of the Chinese people has reached its final stage. They hate internal strife and are tired of war. If the leaders of the various parties and factions in China still have a conscience, they should abandon their arms as soon as possible, and, based on this Constitution, make a fresh start with the people. When their selfish desires disappear, it will be the day when the people of the whole country understand them.

The work of drafting the Constitution has been successfully completed, and the period of political tutelage has come to an end. The Kuomintang's sincere intention to return power to the people and put the country first has been demonstrated to the world. Now, what reason do the leaders of the various parties and factions in China have to continue to maintain their armed forces and divide the country, causing suffering to the people and pushing China's national economy to bankruptcy? Now, all enlightened people and newspapers across the country attribute all of China's misfortunes to war. This is naturally an undeniable truth. However, if some people refuse to participate in the National Assembly and refuse to cooperate in implementing the Constitution, who should ultimately bear the responsibility for the war? The eyes of the people are sharp, and right and wrong have long been clear. From now on, they can no longer support any activities that cause division and separation.

The completion of the Constitution should have been a cause for national celebration. However, today, a shadow hangs over the joy of the Chinese people. In the past, the United States experienced the North-South reconciliation, which led to peace and prosperity that lasts to this day. Recently, in Vietnam, the Independence League and the Kuomintang also put aside their suspicions and formed a coalition government in the face of a common enemy. These are all excellent examples worthy of our emulation. Now, the Central Government is still making concessions and attempting to achieve peace again. We sincerely hope that the various parties and factions that did not participate in the work of drafting the Constitution will promptly change their attitude, reduce the difficulties in implementing the Constitution, and fulfill the hopes of the people of the country.

### Suzhou Re-discusses Commercial Loan Measures, Relaxing Restrictions to Suit Actual Circumstances; Total Demand Estimated at Over 4 Billion Yuan Across All Sectors

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 29th dispatch] The county government had previously reached an agreement with state-owned commercial banks within the county to provide commercial loans totaling 5 billion yuan. However, the method was determined to be separate mortgage loans by each bank. This would result in industries that cannot provide collateral, such as hotels, restaurants, and businesses that sell goods that cannot be mortgaged, such as fruits and fresh produce, being unable to obtain loans. Furthermore, the costs of transportation and storage would increase the burden on borrowers. This is far removed from the actual situation and needs of businesses in the county. Moreover, providing mortgage loans separately is a regular business of banks and has nothing to do with the urgent need to assist businesses in the county. Therefore, the calls for loans have subsided in recent days, leaving many in a desperate situation. However, after the news that Provincial Chairman Wang telegraphed the Central Government and the four major banks to request the allocation of 50 billion yuan in emergency industrial and commercial loans for Jiangsu Province was revealed, the business community in the county was greatly encouraged. Furthermore, the Provincial Business Federation forwarded a telegram from the Provincial Bank on the 28th, approving relaxed loan measures. This is like a glimmer of dawn in the midst of heavy clouds for the commercial economy of the county. The banking sector in the county has also agreed to change the previous approach and form a banking consortium, similar to a joint treasury, to coordinate lending and collateral matters. Zhang Shoupeng [張壽鵬], Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, convened a meeting of various industry associations on the 29th to re-discuss the amount of loans needed and the specifications of collateral. It was estimated that the total amount of goods needed across all sectors was over 4 billion yuan, with goods and real estate each accounting for half of the collateral. The principle of these loans is to benefit all industries in the county. A letter was immediately sent to the Banking Association. Implementation will begin after the interest rate and collateral measures are decided.

[Our newspaper, Suzhou dispatch] In light of the recent surge in commodity prices, which has affected people's livelihoods, the Suzhou County Government convened an emergency meeting to suppress prices and formed a Price Review and Protection Committee.

### Meng River Continues to be Dredged; Ship Lock to be Established at the River Mouth

[Our newspaper, Wujin dispatch] The county is located in the center of the Jinghu Railway Line, bordering the Yangtze River to the north and Taihu Lake to the south. The land is fertile, making it an important area in the Jiangnan region. There are three major rivers connecting to the Yangtze River: the Meng River, the Zao River, and the Desheng River. The Meng River is the largest, with a wide and straight riverbed. Its northern end connects to the Yangtze River at Mengcheng, and its southern end connects to the Grand Canal at Benniu. It has always been a convenient route for transportation between the north and south of the Yangtze River, with merchants and travelers coming and going in an endless stream. However, the riverbed is often silted up due to the intrusion of Yangtze River water, which carries sand and mud. Although efforts have been made to dredge it frequently, the dredging is easily undone. This has a significant impact on farmland irrigation, industrial and commercial transportation. After the establishment of the County Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Association, Chairman Zhuang Zhongxi [莊中希] carefully planned this matter. He also joined forces with Zhenjiang and Danyang counties to request assistance from the Suning Branch in dredging the Zhenwu Canal, renovating the Danyang Zhuanhu embankment, and dredging the Meng River. It was also proposed to establish a ship lock at the mouth of the river connecting to the Yangtze River, which would be opened and closed at regular intervals to ensure a certain water level. Regarding the Meng River dredging project, the section from Benniu to Suishiwan was completed this spring. It is reported that the entire project from Suishiwan to the river mouth, as well as the establishment of a ship lock at the mouth of the Meng River, were approved at the Zhenjiang Labor Relief Conference a few days ago. The County Government will utilize the dry season in winter to resume the dredging project, and the location for the lock will be determined by personnel sent by the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau. The lock project will be completed before the opening of the silkworm season. Once this project is completed, the river will no longer flow directly into the river, and the sand and mud that flow in can be accumulated in the lock. Subsequently, the scope of dredging will be reduced, and the construction will be easier. The water level of the entire county can be controlled artificially. Vessels of 100 tons can pass through the county seat and travel smoothly without hindrance. The cultivation of farmland can be protected from the disaster of flood and drought. This matter concerns the major welfare of all counties in the Jiangnan region. People in the area were overjoyed upon hearing this news and expressed their hope for its early success.

### Good News for Unemployed and Out-of-School Youth in Northern Jiangsu: Recruiting Youth into the Youth Army

— Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan from Yangzhou

Recruitment Methods

This is good news for unemployed and out-of-school youth in northern Jiangsu. Chairman Chiang, recognizing that northern Jiangsu has suffered greatly from enemy occupation and Communist forces' ravages over the past decade, with severe disaster conditions and a considerable number of unemployed and out-of-school youth, has ordered the 202nd Division of the Youth Army to establish "Youth Recruitment Stations" in Xuzhou, Nantong, Yangzhou, and Bengbu to recruit a large number of unemployed and out-of-school youth. The recruitment method still resembles the "examination" style, but those with a higher elementary education level are eligible to apply. The age requirement is 18 to 30 years old. The "Yangzhou Recruitment Station" has been established for more than a week, and the person in charge is Major Tang Qihan, the battalion commander of the engineer battalion of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army. The station is located within the Jiangdu branch of the Youth League on Weihai Street. According to Tang, the higher authorities have stipulated that his unit is to recruit 100 youth, which is expected to be completed within a month.

Purpose of Recruitment According to the reporter's observation, the purpose of the recruitment can be considered purely to help and cultivate youth. If we focus on the unemployment and out-of-school situation of youth, then it is clearly providing a path to employment for unemployed and out-of-school youth. Moreover, this path is a "good way out" that is not easily obtained by ordinary youth. Tang Qihan said at a press conference yesterday (the 24th): After receiving a certain period of military and vocational training, the youth who pass the examination and are admitted can be demobilized according to the past treatment of veterans of the Youth Army – either to continue their education or to find employment, and will no longer be required to serve in the military.

Social Misunderstandings

However, their work has only just begun here. The society here has a misunderstanding about their work, misunderstanding that their work is a disguised form of conscription. I wonder if this situation also exists in the other three places—Xuzhou, Nantong, and Bengbu? The reporter thinks: Serving in the military is an obligation that every citizen must fulfill, but the fact that the general public has a sense of fear and avoidance towards military service cannot be denied. However, if the public misunderstands this recruitment of youth into the Youth Army, it is a loss for the unemployed and out-of-school youth themselves because, according to the reporter's understanding, this is an opportunity that unemployed and out-of-school youth may not have again to be helped and cultivated. The authorities have taken this measure purely out of love for the youth. If anyone thinks that this measure by the authorities is a disguised form of conscription, the reporter believes that it is still probably a preferential treatment specially devised by the authorities for unemployed and out-of-school educated youth. Because, we know: sooner or later, everyone has to serve in the military. Therefore, the reporter would like to introduce the history of the Youth Army to concerned readers.

History of the Youth Army

In October of the 33rd year of the Republic, the Central Plains War broke out. The fierce flames of the enemy's hooves penetrated deeply. When Hunan and Guangxi fell, Chairman Chiang, for the sake of final victory and the needs of future nation-building, raised his arms and called on 100,000 educated youth to join the army. At that time, energetic and enthusiastic youth from all corners of the country ran out, signed up for enlistment one after another, and crowded into the military camps like rivers flowing into the sea. In less than two months, the number of 100,000 had already been exceeded. The Youth Army was established in the spring of the following year (the 34th year of the Republic). There were nine divisions at that time, and their designations and locations were: the 201st Division in Bishan, Sichuan; the 202nd Division in Tongjiang, Sichuan; the 203rd Division in Luxian, Sichuan; the 204th Division in Wanxian, Sichuan; the 205th Division in Guiyang, Guizhou; the 206th Division in Hanzhong, Shaanxi; the 207th Division in Kunming, Yunnan; the 208th Division in Jiangxi; and the 209th Division in Fujian. Training began in February of that year.

Composition

Needless to say, the composition of these 100,000 Youth Army soldiers was quite complex. There were elementary school students; there were also university professors; there were elementary school teachers; there were also students of private schools. There were factory technicians; there were also government officials. There were people from the financial and transportation sectors, and there were also rural self-government workers. There were also children of high officials and wealthy merchants, and so on. However, after entering the camp, the Youth Army, under the "benevolent appeasement," "strict discipline," and "active education" of officers at all levels, established discipline and settled down. In less than half a year, it had become a fairly elite army.

Life in the Army

Regarding their lives, they ate three meals a day, and the food was all nutritious. For example, breakfast was soybeans and peanuts, lunch was fish and meat and vegetables, and dinner was the same as lunch. In terms of education, at the beginning of enlistment, there was recruit education, then non-commissioned officer education, and then officer education. In terms of spiritual education and political training, special attention was paid to cultivating the awareness of the nationalization of the army. In terms of management, efforts were made to promote self-government as much as possible, to improve their motivation for self-study, and to abolish corporal punishment. In terms of training subjects, there were drill grounds and lecture halls. In terms of entertainment, there were many types: drama, Peking opera, Sichuan opera, popular music, dance, horse opera, and variety shows. In addition, there was a party every week.

Demobilization Situation

In mid-August of the 34th year of the Republic, the Japanese pirates surrendered unconditionally. In order to take into account the studies of the majority of students in the army, the government decided that the Youth Army would complete the preparatory officer education from December of the 34th year of the Republic to the end of May of the 35th year of the Republic, and would begin demobilization in June.

At the end of May of the 35th year of the Republic, the government prepared all the transportation for the demobilization of the Youth Army. Thus, on June 1st, the demobilization of the Youth Army was carried out. Cars, trains, and ships transported the demobilized youth to every central area, and then legal travel expenses were issued according to the distance that each youth still had to travel. At the same time, the government guaranteed the studies and careers of the demobilized youth. For example: in the field of science, high school graduates could be exempted from examinations and sent by the Ministry of Education to national universities for advanced studies. Those who entered high school from junior high school and those who entered junior high school from higher elementary school received the same preferential treatment as those who entered university from high school. In addition, three university preparatory classes and eight youth middle schools were established. In terms of re-employment, in addition to guaranteeing that those who were already employed would return to their original jobs, six vocational training classes were also established, including telecommunications, transportation, agriculture and forestry, accounting, and teacher training.

Current Situation

After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, in order to facilitate management, a Reserve Cadre Training Office was specially set up in the Ministry of National Defense, responsible for this matter. Chiang Ching-kuo was in charge of the office. Branch offices and communication stations have now been established in various places. At the same time, the Youth Army was reorganized from nine divisions into six divisions, namely the 202nd Division, the 203rd Division, the 205th Division, the 206th Division, the 207th Division, and the 208th Division. They are currently stationed in Wuxian, Chongqing, Hengyang, Luoyang, Shenyang, and Beiping, preparing for the collective training of high school students next year.

Leclerc's residence issued a communique stating that he had come to Vietnam on government orders for a short-term inspection. Leclerc commanded the French army in the Far East during the war and was known for his expertise in mobile warfare. [Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to an army official, the French army will launch an offensive in Vietnam in three to four weeks. The reinforcements have been urgently dispatched there. Two large troop carriers are already en route. The 43,500-ton "Île de France" is scheduled to leave Cherbourg today with 9,000 new soldiers for Toulon, and will then load a large number of troops for Vietnam. According to the Air Force, the French Air Force in Vietnam has a squadron of Spitfire fighters and a squadron of Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, based in Saigon, under the command of General Anteriou. The aircraft are brand new and have resumed bombing, strafing, and reconnaissance activities. Army personnel also stated that based on various reports, there are indeed Japanese individuals within the Viet Minh army.

[United Press, Paris, 28th] France appears to be preparing to send a powerful fleet to the Vietnamese coast today, while also planning to use diplomatic means and aircraft and artillery to prevent the disintegration of the empire, the signs of which are becoming increasingly evident. Viet Minh escort teams are reportedly moving towards Hanoi, where French forces are working to clear the overseas Chinese district, which appears to be developing into a long-term and intense street battle. Conflicting reports are coming from Saigon. One report says that the Viet Minh has completed military preparations and is under orders to take action as soon as they are ready in Cochinchina. A French press agency report contradicts this, claiming that the Viet Minh has been ordered to refrain from taking any obvious action for the time being. Saigon appears to be under siege, and the situation is tense. Fighter pilots on the French aircraft carriers "Béarn" and "Colosse" have had all leave canceled, and similar emergency orders have been issued to personnel on the destroyers "Fantastique," "Terrible," and "Dixmude." As the new year approaches, it is generally believed that these are the harbingers of the imminent dispatch of these ships to the Far East.

Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Hanoi; French-Controlled Areas Surrounded

[United Press, Paris, 28th] Reports state that French patrol aircraft have strafed Viet Minh escort teams with machine guns near Hanoi. Viet Minh forces are fiercely attacking French forces around Hanoi, with fierce fighting in the suburbs. The French-controlled part of Hanoi remains surrounded by locals and cut off from the outside world. According to a communique from the French General Staff in Saigon: French forces are working to clear the Hanoi area and maintain transportation, and have encountered strong resistance. The Viet Minh has launched two fierce attacks on the Hanoi Botanical Garden, but were repelled. The dyke has been completely occupied by French forces, and the Viet Minh has ceased its attacks in Lang Son. At the same time, Viet Minh broadcasts monitored in Bangkok stated that French forces near Nam Dinh, 40 miles southeast of Hanoi, have been cut off. French forces attempted to approach the vicinity of the Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh's headquarters, but were repelled by Viet Minh forces using hand grenades. The radio station also stated that there was fierce fighting for five days north of Hanoi and near Hue, with 100 French soldiers killed. The French side stated that it is not true that Japanese individuals were found among the Viet Minh corpses.

### Merger of US Army and Navy Reaches Decision Stage

Proponents and Opponents Use Their Tactics

[Special Correspondent in New York, 29th] Regarding the issue of the merger of the US Army and Navy, there have been fierce debates between the proponents and opponents in the Senate, and it has now reached the stage of preparing for a vote in Congress. Some senators have begun drafting a bill to unify the command of the US Army and Navy, but another group of senators intends to make a final effort to prevent the merger bill from being submitted to Congress. Both sides believe that Senator Gurney, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is the key to resolving this case. Proponents intend to urge Gurney to support the new bill, while opponents intend to ask Gurney to postpone the submission of the merger bill for a vote. It is also learned that Secretary of the Navy Forrestal may be transferred to become the ambassador to the United Kingdom. If so, Washington will lose a powerful opponent of the unified command of the Army and Navy.

### Another New Soviet Initiative, Advocating that a General Disarmament Plan Be Drafted Within Three Months; This Move Is Aimed at Seizing the Initiative

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 28th] The Soviet Union has put forward a new proposal advocating that a complete disarmament plan be drafted within three months, including detailed plans for international control of atomic bombs and other terrible weapons. The Soviet representative to the Security Council, Gromyko, has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie, submitting the proposal to the Security Council for discussion at its meeting next Tuesday. The proposal stipulates that the Security Council should immediately establish a special committee to implement the practical measures in the disarmament plan recently adopted by the General Assembly, and to submit recommendations on the plan within one to two months, or at the latest within three months. Related parties believe that this new Soviet initiative is intended to take the initiative and promote early disarmament. Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, first proposed the disarmament plan at the United Nations General Assembly. After a long discussion, the General Assembly finally adopted a historic disarmament resolution on December 14, tasking the Security Council with drafting an international disarmament convention and establishing a special body to control atomic energy, rockets, and all other weapons of mass destruction. Gromyko's new resolution strongly argues that, in addition to implementing the General Assembly's plan, the Security Council should also establish international controls to ensure the reduction of armaments and armed forces. The United States' international atomic energy control plan is scheduled to be discussed by the Security Council on Monday. Some informal observers believe that this new Soviet resolution is intended to divert the Security Council's attention from the US atomic energy proposal. It is also expected that when the Atomic Energy Commission meets on Monday to discuss the report submitted to the Security Council next week, Gromyko may announce the Soviet Union's acceptance of the report, but at the same time will attach certain reservations in order to quickly enter the stage of universal disarmament negotiations.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] Senator Vandenberg, a Republican, recently expressed his full agreement with the American Chief Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, Baruch, who argued that the plan to control atomic energy should not involve the veto power. Vandenberg issued a written statement to the press today, stating that if the atomic energy control treaty inevitably involves the use of the veto power, the United States Senate will not approve it.

### De Gaulle Statement: Will Not Participate in Election

[United Press Paris, 28th] The French presidential election is scheduled for January 16th. General De Gaulle today issued a lengthy 200-word statement to the press, announcing his unwillingness to be a candidate for the presidency of the Fourth Republic of France. He stated that he did not wish to be the chairman of an incompetent government with an incapable person, and therefore his political career would at least temporarily come to an end. De Gaulle was the leader of Free France during the war and is one of the most respected, feared, and hated figures since Napoleon. The Popular Republican Movement had promised De Gaulle its support if he were to be a presidential candidate. However, many French people, especially the communists, have accused De Gaulle of seeking strong executive power in the constitution, harboring dictatorial ambitions. Another group of French people fear that he still has influence in the senior ranks of the French military. There are also those who regard De Gaulle as the greatest figure in France since Joan of Arc. With De Gaulle's withdrawal from the competition, the only remaining presidential candidate is the Socialist leader, Auriol.

### New Posture in British-Soviet Relations: Marshal Montgomery Scheduled to Visit Soviet Union Early Next Month; Rumors Suggest Discussions on a 20-Year British-Soviet Peace Plan

[Reuters London, 28th] The "Daily Worker" diplomatic correspondent claims: British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery will visit Moscow early next month to discuss a twenty-year peace plan. Stalin will suggest to Marshal Montgomery that periodic British-Soviet military staff conferences be held, and a joint British-Soviet intelligence chief committee be established in Moscow. This is the outline of the twenty-year treaty of friendship agreed upon by Britain and the Soviet Union during the war. The correspondent further stated that Stalin hopes that this British-Soviet staff committee will be similar in nature to the British-American staff committee in Washington.

[United Press Moscow, 28th] Although British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow is of a goodwill nature, it will allow Marshal Montgomery to reunite with the Soviet generals with whom he worked during the war, and it will enhance the military ties between the peoples of Britain and the Soviet Union. Marshal Montgomery is expected to arrive in the New Year and will be hosted by Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Vasilevsky. According to British military attaché in Moscow, Major General Garthorse, Marshal Montgomery's stay will be brief, but he will visit several major Soviet military institutions. Marshal Vasilevsky will host a banquet at the Red Army House on Marshal Montgomery's second night in the Soviet Union, followed by a performance at the Bolshoi Theatre. The British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union will also welcome Marshal Montgomery. This is Marshal Montgomery's first visit to the Soviet Union, and it is also the culmination of his post-war world tour, as Marshal Montgomery has already visited the United States, Canada, and the Middle East. Since U.S. Chief of Staff Eisenhower's short visit to the Soviet Union in August 1945, Marshal Montgomery's visit is the biggest event. Marshal Montgomery will be accompanied by two staff members.

[Agence France-Presse London, 28th] The newspapers here have mostly welcomed Marshal Montgomery's planned visit to Moscow, believing that it could ease tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources also said that Marshal Montgomery's trip may involve discussions with Soviet leaders on universal disarmament, military occupation of Germany, and accelerating the withdrawal of Allied forces from enemy territory. However, British War Office officials have refused to comment on this.

### Paris Believes: Britain and the United States Will Sign a Secret Pact; Reveals Contents Including Eight Key Points

[Reuters Paris, 29th] The French Socialist Party's "L'Aurore" reported today: A spokesman for Moscow Radio recently said that he had good reason to believe that Britain and the United States had already signed a secret pact. This statement is fundamentally true, but it is a little premature. The newspaper stated that this secret pact would be signed in March 1947, and disclosed its contents as follows: (1) Britain and the United States should implement mutual assistance when a state of conflict is declared in a third country. (2) The military countries of Britain and the United States will combine all their financial, economic, and military resources. (3) In the event of a state of conflict, military activities will be directed by the Supreme Command, and the resources of the two countries will be controlled by the Economic Command to make the most favorable use for both parties. (4) Britain and the United States agree never to provoke any foreign country. This agreement shall only be effective when one of the two signatory countries is attacked by a third country. (5) This agreement does not contain any imperialistic nature. Its main purpose is to protect the interests of both countries throughout the world. (6) The staff departments of the two countries will hold periodic meetings. (7) This secret agreement is not aimed at any country. It is only for self-defense, so any country that can prove that it has no imperialistic goals can participate in this agreement. (8) The full text of this agreement will be released to the press only after it is signed.

### Situation in East Indies Remains Unstable: Armistice Agreement Shaken; Rumors Suggest Dutch Plan to Overthrow Indonesian Government

[United Press Batavia, 28th] East Indies Republican Army Commander Soetomo issued a broadcast address after meeting with President Sukarno today, accusing the Dutch military of endangering the sovereignty and independence of the East Indies, making the people of Indonesia unbearable. He said that the time to express power has arrived. The recent armistice agreed with the Dutch military in order to discuss the recognition of the republic does not mean stopping the fight for independence. He asked the people of Indonesia to restore their fighting spirit to resist the Dutch military and transport military equipment and food to the front lines. According to a Dutch military spokesperson, since the armistice on October 15th, the Dutch military has only taken defensive actions. The recent conflict was caused by Indonesian troops crossing the border. On the 26th of this month, there were no fewer than ten shooting incidents in Bandung and Surabaya alone.

[Agence France-Presse Batavia, 28th] The Indonesian News Agency recently published a message stating that the Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch military in the Dutch East Indies, General Spoor, intends to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia by force. It is said that this plan has been supported by some ministers of the Dutch government and will soon be implemented. The Indonesian government is investigating this matter.

### Churchill Attempts to Make a Comeback

According to Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th, former British Prime Minister Churchill published an article in "Collier's" magazine today entitled "The Road to the Future," reiterating the necessity of "organizing the United States of Europe." The main points of the article have been seen in yesterday's newspapers and need not be repeated. However, one point is worth mentioning: although Churchill is no longer the ruling figure in Britain and has retreated to the position of opposition leader, his words and deeds are still attracting worldwide attention due to his prestige as a wartime leader, and he still appears to be a major force in the world of political thought.

It is still remembered that when Britain held a general election more than a year ago, the Labor Party, with an overwhelming advantage, defeated Churchill and the Conservative Party he led, British politicians thought that Churchill's political life would come to an end.

However, that is not the case. Churchill is still the leader of the Conservative Party and still has considerable power in British politics. When he travels between the continents of Europe and the Americas, delivering speeches everywhere, the public greets him with warm welcomes. He does not show any signs of dejection because of setbacks in the political arena.

Three Major Topics

Since resigning as Prime Minister, Churchill has continued to pay close attention to international politics. From his many speeches, it can be seen that he attaches great importance to three major topics: (1) The goals pursued by the Soviet Union and communism are dangerous; (2) The United States of Europe must be organized to revive the Old World; (3) The continued close cooperation between Britain and the United States is important.

In March of this year, Churchill's "Iron Curtain" speech in Fulton caused a great uproar internationally. The Soviet criticism was very sharp, and Stalin even said he was a "warmonger," believing that his purpose was to promote the idea of English-speaking nations dominating the world. Churchill's speech put Britain and the United States in an awkward position, and they had to try their best to state that Churchill's speech was only his personal opinion and not the position of the authorities. But Churchill insisted on his own views, saying, "In a few years, I think you will agree that what I said should be said."

As for the proposal to "organize the United States of Europe," the reaction it aroused was not as strong as the former. This year, he traveled to France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and used his eloquent tongue to deliver speeches to the public, but the result did not cause a warm response. But although the response was small, Churchill himself insisted on his views without the slightest change.

Domestic Problems

Churchill also spared no effort in attacking British domestic problems. In his position as leader of the Conservative Party, he tried his best to criticize the policies of the Labor government, believing that the nationalization plan being implemented by the current government would lead to serious consequences. At the same time, he expressed deep alarm at the Labor Party's attitude towards handling the major problems facing the British Empire, believing that the imperial structure would undergo serious shake-ups.

Generally, people believe that Churchill's speeches on domestic problems are relatively mediocre and not as brilliant and moving as the speeches he gave when he was the wartime Prime Minister. Some younger people in the Conservative Party may think that Churchill is too conservative and that his re-seizing of power by the party is likely to lead to obstacles. But when the Conservative Party convened a conference in Blackpool in early October, Churchill's leadership position within the party did not waver but became more consolidated.

Since Churchill's defeat in the election, there have been many criticisms of him from all sides. Most of these criticisms come from the Kremlin and the left-wing elements of the Conservative Party. Some say that he adopted short-sighted strategies in the Asian theater to seek gains without labor; others say that he opposed the allied strategy that achieved great success in the European theater. A committee of parliament said that the reduction in the production of British tanks and artillery during the war once caused a critical situation, and Churchill should be held accountable. As for Elliot Roosevelt, he directly called Churchill a reactionary stubborn element in one of his recent books.

Popular Sentiment

In Britain, the public has a good sentiment towards him, but they opposed his policies and the party he led when voting. For example, the people of Margate voted for the Labor Party in the general election, but later suggested building a statue of Churchill on the cliffs of Dover, with a huge cigar in his mouth. Ships passing by the area at night can look up and see the faint red light on the cigar head. The cigar butts that Churchill smoked have been regarded as treasures by collectors. This summer, when Churchill went to Norway, the cigar butts he dropped sold very well in the markets of The Hague and Amsterdam, with prices as high as ninety-five guilders, equivalent to thirty-five U.S. dollars.

Ups and Downs in Politics

The ups and downs in politics, as well as the praise or criticism from all sides, are extremely ordinary things for Churchill. He has experienced too much in his seventy-two years of life. He first participated in the election in 1899 and suffered a disastrous defeat. During World War I, he held an important position as First Lord of the Admiralty, but he had to submit his resignation in 1915 due to the disastrous defeat in the Dardanelles campaign. After the war, he wanted to rejoin the House of Commons, but failed twice, but finally succeeded. After the outbreak of World War II, he once again took office as First Lord of the Admiralty, and in 1940, he was ordered by the British monarch to assume the position of Prime Minister, finally saving Britain from the brink of failure. These are all well known and have become part of history.

The end of World War II and the arrival of victory, Churchill participated in the election with the prestige of a wartime leader, and the result was defeated by the Labor Party, which was really unexpected by the world, but Churchill's spirit was not weakened by the failure. What will happen in the future, we may as well wait and see.

### Spanish Government in Exile: Mission Accomplished, Will Dissolve; Authority Transferred to Non-Governmental Party Committees

[Reuters Paris, 28th] It is reported that the Spanish Republican government in exile led by Giral will reconsider dissolving the government at the beginning of the new year, and will transfer its powers to a non-governmental committee representing various Spanish political parties. The government held a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss the dissolution, and most of the cabinet members strongly advocated for the dissolution. It is also understood that most of the 80,000 Spaniards in France also agree to the dissolution, believing that after the United Nations passed a resolution unfavorable to the Franco regime, the mission of the Giral government has been accomplished. At the same time, the non-governmental party committees can take consistent steps with the democratic alliance in Spain, which is convenient for contact.

### U.S. Policy Toward Korea Aims to Make Korea

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 28th] Two State Department officials gave a radio address today entitled "Our Country's Foreign Policy." The two were Martin, Director of the Japan and Korea Economic Division of the Department, and Bouton, Director of the Japan Division. The purpose of the speech was to clarify the policy adopted by the United States toward Korea, which is to make Korea independent and completely unified. Bouton said: "We have not yet been able to achieve any progress with the Soviet Union in following the path laid down by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference a year ago. For this reason, we are now acting alone in accordance with the plan for the U.S. occupation zone." Both believe that the reconstruction of Korea faces many difficulties, because Korea's main industries are in the Soviet occupation zone. This year's autumn harvest was also poor. Martin said: "China may become a major customer of Korea, but the quantity of Korean exports may not be too large." Bouton said: "The United States should assist Korea for its own sake and for the sake of Korea, because a democratic, prosperous, and friendly Korea will be an important stabilizing factor in the Far East, and a peaceful Far East is the most important goal of U.S. foreign policy. The United States has assisted Korea in education programs, political development, and self-sufficiency in the south. Once the barrier dividing the north and south occupation zones of Korea is eliminated, the work carried out by the U.S. occupation zone in accordance with the current plan will not prevent the rapid unification of Korean social, economic, and political life. The United States and the Soviet Union held a meeting a year ago to formulate various ways to establish Korea's independence, but the plan completely failed, and the fault is not entirely on our side, nor is it entirely on the Soviet side. We are prepared to resume the meeting with the Soviet Union at any time to formulate an acceptable way to return Korea to the Koreans in accordance with the Moscow Agreement."

Someone asked why China and Britain, which jointly signed the Cairo Declaration, are not undertaking the occupation task in Korea? On this point, Bouton strongly stated that the various measures regarding the independence and unification of Korea are being drafted by the United States and the Soviet Union, and will be submitted to other countries for approval when the time is right.

Soviet Newspaper Commentary

[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 29th] Soviet journalist Smolensky wrote an article in the "Stalinsk Gazette," criticizing the U.S. occupation policy toward Korea. He roughly stated: The 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference decided to establish a temporary democratic government in Korea. The Koreans heard about it. However, the U.S. authorities did not take any action in this direction. The Americans merely took the place of the Japanese and replaced them, and did not change the fate of the Korean agricultural disaster. Agricultural reorganization is a major problem for Korea. 60% of the arable land still belongs to a small number of large landlords and newly established U.S.-Korean joint ventures. Japanese laws are still in effect, and the fate of the masses is getting worse day by day. A series of serious strikes between September and October 1945 showed dissatisfaction with the Americans. In some cases, these strikes turned into armed rebellions. The Korean people are eager to establish a true democratic government to serve their interests. This kind of government can only be established when the Moscow Conference decisions are correctly and fully implemented.

### New Contribution to Meteorological Measurement: Balloons Ascend into Clouds; Radio Transmission Using Electric Sound; Shanghai Meteorological Station of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense Adapts to Aviation Needs and Provides Meteorological Reports

The Second Meteorological Station of the Ministry of National Defense has decided to supply meteorological reports to various parts of the country from now on in order to meet the needs of civil aviation. The reporter made a special visit to the station yesterday (on Dashilu). According to the station director Cheng Jun, the units under the jurisdiction of the station include more than 40 meteorological branch stations in major towns and cities across the country, which regularly collect and rebroadcast the climate of each branch station four times a day. At present, the station maintains meteorological links with the Soviet Union, Guam, Japan, Manila, the Spratly Islands, the Nanyang Islands, Singapore, Annam, Burma, India, and other places.

Weather forecasting work is divided into three parts: (1) ordinary meteorological observation (i.e., ground meteorological observation), (2) high-altitude airflow observation. This prediction of high-altitude clouds has recently achieved special and remarkable results. The station is now using a "thunder sound" ultra-shortwave radio transmitter, attached to a fire-shaped light balloon, to ascend into the cloud layer 20 kilometers above the ground. After that, the "thunder sound" ultra-shortwave radio transmission is used, which is exceptionally accurate. The application of this "thunder sound" marks a new stage in meteorological forecasting in our country, which will greatly benefit the development of civil aviation. It has now been decided to regularly provide weather forecast reports for reference when aircraft take off.

### Adjustment of Civil Servant Salaries: Expected Implementation in this City After One Week; Mayor's Monthly Salary to Increase to 918,000 Yuan

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The central government has formally announced the adjustment of civil servant salaries. Yesterday, our reporter visited the Personnel Department of the City Government to inquire whether the salary adjustment for civil servants in this city would be implemented immediately. According to Zheng Tianmu, Director of the Personnel Department, the City Government has not yet received official documents from the central government. News from newspapers cannot yet serve as a basis for implementation. He estimated that official documents from the central government would arrive here in about a week. This city will implement the adjustment immediately upon receipt of the order. Director Zheng also exchanged views with Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, who believes that there will be no problem with salary disbursement.

According to the central government's newly revised adjustment method, the cost-of-living multiplier has been raised from 720 to 1100, and the basic subsidy has been increased from 110,000 to 170,000. As a result, civil servant salaries will increase by slightly less than 60% on average after the adjustment. However, this is a general average; strictly speaking, the higher the base salary, the smaller the percentage increase, and the lower the base salary, the larger the percentage increase.

According to our reporter's inquiries, the average salary amounts receivable by civil servants at all levels in various bureaus and departments under the City Government after the adjustment are as follows:

Mayor Wu's base salary is 680 yuan, and his original salary was approximately 600,000 yuan. After the adjustment, he will receive 918,000 yuan per month.

The base salaries of bureau chiefs and department heads vary slightly depending on their seniority, averaging approximately 500 yuan. Their original salaries were 470,000 yuan. After the adjustment, they will receive 720,000 yuan per month.

The base salaries of section chiefs also vary, averaging approximately 200 yuan. Their original salaries were 254,000 yuan. After the adjustment, they will receive 390,000 yuan per month.

Among staff members, the lowest base salary is 75 yuan, and their original salary was only 164,000 yuan. After the adjustment, they will receive 252,500 yuan per month.

Regarding police officers' salaries, according to the central government's regulations, the basic subsidy of 170,000 must be calculated at 60%, which is 100,200 yuan. Before the adjustment, the average salary of police officers was approximately 100,000 yuan. After the adjustment, it will be approximately 140,000 to 150,000 yuan.

As for the half-month's salary that Mayor Wu promised to advance before the adjustment order was announced, it will be deducted in installments after the salary adjustment. The specific installment plan will be determined by the City Government authorities.

### Shanghai-Taicang Motor Company: All Routes Resume Service

The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Motor Company will resume service on all routes that operated before the war, including Shanghai to Luodian, Liuhe, and Zhai Ding, as well as Wu Song to Binshan, Yangxing, Yuepu, and Luodian Qian, starting from January 1, 1947. The headquarters and Shanghai station will simultaneously relocate to their original address at No. 235 Wuzhen Road, Guangfu Road, Zhabei, to sell passenger tickets. Currently, because the Wuzhen Road Bridge was demolished during the war, passengers must travel east from the northern end of the Xinzha Bridge or west from the northern end of the New Garbage Bridge to reach the destination directly.

### New Year's Celebration Assembly: Name Changed

The New Year's Celebration Assembly of All Circles in this City will be renamed "Shanghai Municipal Celebration Assembly of the Promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the 36th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic" in accordance with the formal instructions of the central government. A meeting of the leaders and deputy leaders will be held at the City Industry Department at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss speeding up preparations. The leading party and government officials of this city will personally attend and provide guidance.

### Total Year-End Bonuses in All Industries: Expected to Exceed 50 Billion Yuan

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Well-placed business figures indicate that this year's year-end bonuses will be less contentious because the local authorities were able to establish standards in advance. Although some manufacturers may pay bonuses far exceeding those stipulated by the City Government due to high profits, this is voluntary and limited to a small number of employees. It is generally estimated that the total amount of year-end bonuses issued by all industries in this city will exceed 50 billion yuan.

### Establishment of the Manufacturers' Association: The National Goods Market Reopened Yesterday

The Manufacturers' Association of the National Goods Exhibition Market was established to promote mutual exchange and common development. The inaugural meeting was held in the auditorium of the market yesterday morning. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce, Mao Qingxiang, Chairman of the General Assembly of the China Production Promotion Association, and over 200 manufacturers attended the meeting. Hu Boxiang chaired the meeting, approved the articles of association, and elected committee members. A group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned.

[Another Report] The National Goods Exhibition Market was closed after a dispute arose on the afternoon of the 27th when a police officer from the new precinct requested goods from the Shanghai Wool Company in the market. At a meeting of all the manufacturers in the market yesterday morning, Hu Boxiang was elected as chairman. They also welcomed Mao Qingxiang, Chairman of the China Production Promotion Association, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce. After Chairman Hu, Mao Qingxiang, Wang Xiaolai, and Zhang Zilian, Mao Shengdong, Jiang Zhonghe, Ni Hanru, and Sheng Gongshu, the responsible persons of the market, repeatedly explained and persuaded the manufacturers, they decided to reopen the market immediately and elected representatives to handle negotiations.

[Another Report] Wang Jingzhi and Ye Zhen, the deputy managers of the Shanghai Wool Company, purchased more than 3,700 pounds of wool from Hongda and eleven other wool shops ten days ago, valued at more than 150 million yuan. All transactions were settled with bank drafts, but they were all returned due to insufficient funds. The company has declared liquidation. The victims jointly reported the matter to the new precinct. Police officers went to the National Goods Market to identify the defrauded goods, resulting in the dispute. Yesterday afternoon, the defrauded merchants hosted reporters at the Atlantic Western Restaurant to report the incident.

### China National Aviation Corporation: Memorial Service for Deceased Personnel

Yesterday, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) held a memorial service for deceased employees at the Central Funeral Home. In the center of the hall were the coffins of Captain Chen Ruirong, Co-pilot Nong Linxu, Trainee Pilot Qian Dingwu, and Telegraph Operator Lin Dahua. In front of the coffins was an altar surrounded by dozens of wreaths arranged in a semi-circle. The orchestra of the Poor Children's Education Center played mourning music. The memorial service began at 4:00 PM. General Manager Chen presided over the ceremony, with Director Chen and Deputy Director Deng assisting. After offering incense and paying respects, General Manager Chen delivered a eulogy, expressing deep condolences for the deceased employees and offering comfort to the colleagues who worked hard due to the accident. After the meeting, reporters asked General Manager Chen about the District Attorney's office's plan to prosecute the case according to the law. He stated that the company had reported everything to the competent authorities within 24 hours of the plane crash and had not dared to conceal anything. If the District Attorney's office believes that the company has failed to report something or must be held accountable or prosecuted for this reason, the company will appear in court according to the law and will not shirk responsibility. Currently, they have only seen reports in the newspapers, and the District Attorney's office has not yet sent official documents.

### Reviewing and Improving Facilities Based on the Three Plane Crashes: Weather is Closely Related to Flight; Blind Landing Equipment is Indispensable

[Special Report by Our Newspaper] There are many examples of plane crashes in aviation history, but the tragedy of three passenger planes crashing and being destroyed in one day—or rather, within a few hours—in the same airspace, resulting in more than 80 deaths and injuries, is unprecedented. In addition, the day of the crashes was Christmas Day, the day of the Savior's birth. It is no wonder that the news caused shock in society and uproar in public opinion. From the central government to foreign countries, everyone is paying close attention to this matter and unanimously believes that the future of civil aviation should undergo a thorough review and improvement.

Based on available data, our reporter made a brief statistic of all aircraft accidents since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, as shown in the table below:

Date of Accident	Aircraft Name	Location of Accident	Number of Casualties

March 17	Dai Li's Special Plane	Near Nanjing

March 19	China Airlines Flight 139, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Jinzhen, Hankou	30

April 8	CCP's Ye Ting, Wang Ruofei, etc.'s Special Plane	Near Xi'an	12

July 12	CNAC Flight 15, Shanghai-Ping Route	Near Jinan	55

September 20	China Airlines Flight 81, Kangding-Chongqing Route	Near Xichang	20

December 14	CNAC Flight 31, Ping-Shanghai Route	Changxing, Zhejiang	6

December 14	China Airlines Flight 67, Beijing-Shanghai Route	Longhua Airport	0

December 25	China Airlines Flight 140, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Longhua Airport	30

December 25	China Airlines Flight 115, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Suburbs of This City	40

December 25	CNAC Flight 48, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Near Jiangwan	11

The causes of the accidents listed above are actually not that simple, and it is not easy to determine them absolutely, because the conclusions drawn solely based on the results of post-accident investigation and reconnaissance will always be somewhat different from the actual facts. However, just as historians often use the three factors of timing, location, and human factors to measure the success or failure of all worldly affairs, our research into the causes of aircraft accidents also falls within the scope of (1) changes in weather, (2) inadequate airport equipment, (3) errors by aviation personnel, and (4) aircraft malfunctions. Our reporter interviewed several experts on these issues, and the conclusion was that all of these difficulties can be overcome.

If the Secrets of Heaven Can Be Predicted, Victory Can Be Assured. First of all, from the perspective of climate, the so-called "unexpected changes in the weather" often cause aircraft accidents in an era when science has not yet fully developed to the point of "man conquering nature." Obstacles caused by these natural phenomena, such as dense fog, high-altitude icing, heavy rain, and storms, seem difficult to overcome. But at least, why can't we try to make efforts in the passive prediction and avoidance? After the last CNAC plane crashed in Changxing, Director Chen of the Central Meteorological Observatory in this city happened to talk to our reporter and said that if the losses from plane crashes were used to strengthen meteorological forecasting work, the possibility of accidents could be reduced to a very low level. His words are quite reasonable, and the aviation and meteorological communities urgently need to establish close ties. As far as current domestic flights are concerned, most only use radio to inquire about the weather conditions at the destination station when taking off. It can be said that they are completely ignorant of the possible changes that may occur several hours later, as well as the weather conditions over other places along the way. How can this kind of nearly blind flight not be dangerous? If meteorological work can be done well, in addition to establishing meteorological stations at both the departure and arrival locations, meteorological observation stations should be set up every certain distance along each route. These large and small meteorological stations and meteorological observation stations should report local weather conditions every certain period of time and coordinate with other parts of the country to predict possible changes in weather conditions at any time. Then, those that can fly will fly, and those that cannot fly will be grounded. If the secrets of heaven are revealed in advance, victory can be assured. Coupled with the improvement of other factors, the news of aircraft accidents may disappear from our ears.

Small Airports in Various Places Need to Be Opened. Secondly, when it comes to airport equipment, it can be divided into two aspects: one is the location, size, and quality of the airport itself. Taking Longhua Airport in Shanghai as an example, the Huangpu River is close by, and there is a lot of fog in winter, especially near the water, which is very suitable for aircraft landing, but the runway is too narrow, and the road surface is uneven. Water accumulates in puddles on rainy days. All of these are not up to the standards of a modern airport. Moreover, there is only one civil airport in Shanghai, which is an unreasonable phenomenon due to the heavy burden. At the same time, several small airports are needed in the middle of each route so that there can be a place to help in case of sudden changes or obstacles in the middle of the route. The second is the mechanical equipment for airport landing and communication, especially the blind landing equipment using radar, which is indispensable. These have been proposed many times and are considered to be an urgent matter.

The Lives of Flight Personnel Must Absolutely Not Be Deviant. As for the obstacles of the aircraft itself, in addition to some old planes that are too old and should never be used for business reasons, it is closely related to the skills of the flight personnel. Good driving skills certainly cannot be achieved overnight, but pre-inspection preparations must be absolutely precise and careful. Our reporter especially believes that all staff responsible for public safety cannot have deviant private lives during each flight. Our reporter encountered an overturned car in Qianxi, and the reason was that the driver had spent the night with a prostitute the night before, so he was distracted the next day. The task of an aircraft pilot is more difficult than that of a car driver. Can we imagine the danger that a pilot who is drunk or eager to rush to the destination for revelry might cause?

The Aviation Management of the United States is Sufficient for Reference. The management of civil aviation is also very important. Taking the United States, which is advanced in aviation, as an example, the government has two institutions under the Ministry of Commerce that specifically manage civil aviation. One is the Civil Aeronautics Board, which is almost a decision-making body and is not subject to the constraints of the Ministry of Commerce. Its tasks are to formulate safety standards and aviation rules, issue and revoke various licenses, collect aviation taxes, stipulate passenger and freight and airmail rates, and handle competition and cooperation between private airlines. In addition, it is responsible for formulating regulations on accidents, investigating and publishing information on accidents, and preventing them from happening again to reduce the number of accidents. Another implementing agency is the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and the director is under the command of the Secretary of Commerce and is responsible for developing domestic airlines, airports, and other facilities, including design, construction, command, protection, etc. In addition, it is responsible for the research and improvement of various aviation technologies and can take emergency measures to revoke safety licenses in accordance with the regulations set by the Civil Aeronautics Board. It has the power to impose fines on those who violate aviation regulations. The organization and tasks of the above-mentioned two management agencies can be a good reference for the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, which will soon be established in China.

The unfortunate incident has passed. The dead are dead, and the injured are injured. What we can hope for is that while handling the aftermath, the authorities will earnestly engage in reform so that this painful lesson can promote a new era in China's civil aviation industry. Then, the dead will also be able to rest in peace.

### Several Severely Injured in the Plane Crash: No Danger to Life

The Coffins of Yi Xingzheng and Fu Huang Were Taken Away Yesterday; Yu Yimin Was Claimed by Relatives

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Among the bodies of the victims of the plane crash, the body of Yu Yimin was still unclaimed in the Wanguo Funeral Home a few days ago. Until yesterday, a relative went to claim it. There are currently six victims who have not yet been placed in coffins in the funeral home. As for Tan Xingzheng and Fu Huang, who were placed in coffins in the China Funeral Home a few days ago, their closest relatives arrived yesterday and had them placed in coffins. Of the eleven injured people still being treated at Zhongshan Hospital, it is said that the injuries of several of the severely injured have improved and there is no danger to life.

### Zheng Pingru's Grievance Has Not Been Redressed; Her Mother's Life is Difficult; She Submits a Petition Requesting Rain and Dew; Severely Punish Ding Mocun; Grant Compensation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] During the eight years of occupation in this city, the heroic and tragic history created by our underground workers is too numerous to write. In 1939, Miss Zheng Pingru, a graduate of the College of Political Science and Law, sacrificed her appearance to assassinate the puppet secret agent demon king Ding Mocun, but unfortunately, she failed and was killed instead. The grievance has not been redressed for seven years. Now that Ding Mocun is being tried by the High Court in the capital, Zheng's mother entrusted lawyers Han Xuezhang and Gu Weixiong to submit a petition to the High Court a month ago, requesting that Ding be severely punished to comfort the spirits of the underground workers. Recently, she also submitted a document to the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, requesting that compensation be granted. The text of her submission is as follows: "Submission regarding the request to severely punish Ding Mocun, avenge my daughter, and grant compensation. My daughter, Zheng Pingru, has been engaged in underground work in Shanghai since 1937 under the command of multiple bureaus. On December 16, 1939, she designed to lure Ding Mocun to the Siberian Fur Store on Jing'an Temple Road to buy a fur coat, in order to assassinate Ding. Unfortunately, the assassination failed, and she was arrested and detained in a house on Yidingpan Road (confirmed by Pan Sansheng). She was murdered on the afternoon of December 26. It has been seven years since then, and the grievance has not been redressed. Ding is currently being tried, and according to the Central News Agency's news on the 5th of this month, the Bureau has investigated and confirmed the fact that my daughter was murdered. I implore your Bureau to uphold justice and transfer the matter to the court to severely punish Ding and avenge my daughter. My husband, Zheng Yingbo, was the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court and passed away in 1943. I am alone and without support, and my life is difficult. I respectfully request that compensation be granted to me so that I can live out my days. This would be a great kindness. Submitted to the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. Submitted by Zheng Huajun."

### Property Confiscation of Han Jians During Probation: Temporary Suspension of Enforcement

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Regarding the property of Han Jians who have already been sentenced, according to law, after deducting the necessary living expenses for their families, the remainder shall be confiscated. However, there are also cases of Han Jians who have been given suspended sentences. There is some doubt as to whether the property confiscation should be enforced in the same way, or whether the detained and sealed property should be returned due to the suspended sentence. The judicial organs of this city submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice for transfer to the Legal Interpretation Committee of the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation of the law. It is now known that the committee has convened a meeting on the matter. It was decided that the property confiscation in cases of suspended sentences will be temporarily suspended during the probation period.

### Qian Huafo, Shi Zhichao, and Others Will Hold a Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting

Calligraphers and painters Qian Huafo and Shi Zhichao, in response to the invitation of the Shanghai Charity Burial Association, have jointly organized an exhibition and charity sale of works by nine friends, including Zhou Lianxia, Zhao Junmin, Xiong Songquan, Shen Duchi, Zong Ligu, Xie Zhiguang, and Li Xiyun, to subsidize the association's expenses. It is said that it is scheduled to be held from January 4th to 6th at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. Visitors will also receive a copy of "Key Tips for Learning Calligraphy" compiled by Shi Zhichao.

### Retrial of the "Wolf of Changshu": All Witnesses Will Be Summoned for Confrontation

The Shanghai Military Court will hold a joint collegial hearing for the Japanese war criminal "Wolf of Changshu," Michimura Haruki, at 1:00 PM today. All relevant witnesses in the case will be summoned for confrontation to facilitate the conclusion of the trial and set a date for sentencing.

### Li Fangjing, One of the Passengers on CNAC Flight 140, Carried a Large Sum of Money; Unsuccessful Search After the Plane Crash; Fellow Townsman Shen Yumin Came to Shanghai to Collect the Body; Expressed Extreme Grief and Anger at the Loss of Luggage

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Shen Yumin, Director of the Compilation Department of the Committee for the Compilation of Historical Materials of the Kuomintang Party History, told our newspaper that Li Fangjing, from Guangdong, who was on the ill-fated CNAC Flight 140, graduated from the Department of Education of Southwest Associated University and taught at Tsinghua High School, Nankai High School, and the Sichuan Institute of Education. This year, he passed the examination for self-funded study abroad and had already reached an agreement with the Graduate School of Cornell University in the United States to study there. However, Li came from a poor family and had difficulty with funding. His relatives and classmates helped him raise funds. Director Shen was from the same hometown as Li and helped Li borrow money from Representative Feng, a overseas Chinese representative who was attending the National Assembly in the capital. Representative Feng generously agreed because Li was only short 2 million yuan and expressed his willingness to meet with Li before leaving Beijing. Therefore, Li packed his bags and happily flew to Beijing, but unexpectedly suffered this tragedy and died! After hearing the bad news, Director Shen rushed to Shanghai to collect Li's body. However, when he arrived at Longhua Airport yesterday, most of the staff members were not there, and there was very little luggage left. After many inquiries, he learned that even in the midst of this shocking event, the China National Aviation Corporation still took its usual day off on Sunday, so there was no one to contact about claiming the belongings. Shen believes that the plane crashed within the airport, and the passengers' luggage should not have been lost. Li had a large sum of money with him entrusted by friends, but now it cannot be found. He is particularly grief-stricken and angry. He also said that the relatives of all the deceased passengers should jointly pursue responsibility and that the District Court should strictly prosecute to comfort the dead and ensure future safety.

### Ivory Opium Pipes Inlaid with White Jade; Two Opium Dens with Luxurious Equipment; 18 People Arrested After One Week of Investigation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] A week ago, the Old Gate Police Station received a report that someone had privately set up an opium den at No. 4 Cide Lane, Zhejiang North Road, to provide opium for people to smoke. Branch Director Quan Jiang sent staff members led by Section Chief Jiang to investigate. After a week, it was learned that the number of entrances and exits to the building was four, making it difficult to raid. The police then sent undercover officers disguised as fruit vendors to the lane to determine the route. At 10:30 PM on the 28th, Section Chief Zhang Guodong led Police Chief Chen Jun'gan, Wang Congzhou, officers Li Junkun, Cui Ziliang, Weng Yao, Bai Haishan, Yang Zhongming, Du Guozhen, and others disguised to the location. Several officers were ordered to climb over the roof from neighboring houses and guard the windows. The remaining officers entered simultaneously from each door. At that time, there were fifteen customers smoking opium in the attic on the third floor and the roof. When they saw the police officers arrive, some tried to escape through the windows, but it was too late, and all were captured.

The opium den owner and opium customers were identified as Jin Zairong (33 years old, from Taicang), Yang Chen A'xiao (47 years old, from Baoshan, both residents of No. 4 Cide Lane), Jia Ruxi (46 years old, from Yangzhou, resident of No. 250 Fujian Road), Han Jingpo (34 years old, from Yangzhou, resident of the same address), Fu Tongkang (43 years old, from Suzhou, resident of Yuelai Nanhua Store on Guangdong Road), Wu Fengchi (37 years old, from Hebei, resident of No. 13 Chengji Lane on Guangdong Road), Zhuang Yonggao (50 years old, from Nanjing, resident of No. 4 Cide Lane, Zhejiang North Road), Xue Jianqiu (45 years old, from Anhui, resident of No. 155 Gubba Road), Lu Linbai (38 years old, from Shanghai, resident of No. 156 Renshou Lane, Huimin Road), Wang Shouhong (30 years old, resident of No. 2 Yongde Lane, Ximen Road), Yang Chenshi (53 years old, from Zhishan), Han Chenshi (32 years old, from Yangzhou), Xu Yuanchang (37 years old, from Ningbo), Sun Guangtao (31 years old, from Changzhou), and Huang Deming (44 years old, the above five all residents of No. 4 Cide Lane). Three ivory opium pipes inlaid with white jade and two opium lamps were seized on the spot, as well as two copper pots in which opium paste was being cooked. A Mauser chrome-plated pistol, number 75010, without a license, was found in the partition wall. All the people and evidence were taken back to the branch station. After a thorough investigation, the main criminal, Jin Zairong, confessed that all the opium was purchased from Han Yuming on the third floor of No. 7 Baoyu Lane, Zhejiang South Road. Starting from February this year, each transaction involved ten or twenty taels of opium. An examination of his checkbook revealed transactions totaling 12,178,000 yuan, but the total amount cannot be determined at this time. Jin was then escorted to the aforementioned location. Section Chief Zhang first deployed officers around the building and then sent two officers to climb over the roof from a neighboring building. Zhang knocked on the back door, but there was no response for a long time. At that time, Han knew that he had been discovered and was destroying evidence inside. About half an hour later, he opened the door, and the police officers rushed in. The house had ten or more rooms, all with suites, and three people were smoking opium inside. Han was arrested, and a piece of opium was found in his leather shoes. His wife, Han Shi Xiuru (32 years old, from Tianjin), admitted to selling drugs but denied that there was any other opium in the house. Finally, a secret side door was found next to the bed on the third floor. Pushing open the door, it was a four-story attic filled with household appliances. After a long search, another large piece of opium weighing more than ten taels was found, as well as opium pipes and lamps. Han, along with his nephew Han Jiling (18 years old, from Tianjin) and three opium customers, were taken to the station. The District Prosecutor's Office applied for their detention for ten days for further investigation.

From right to left, Jin Zairong, Han Yuming, Han Shi Xiuru, and Yang Chen A'xiao.

### District Chief Li Boqing Says His Detention is Untrue

[Our Report] Yesterday, it was reported that Gao Paolian, the wife of Li Boqing, the district chief of the 16th district of this city, was accused of printing seals in the name of the "Youth Training Corps" and sealing up the Qinghua Elementary School in Nanhua New Village. Yesterday, this reporter met with Mr. Li in person at the residence of a certain important person. When asked about this news, he said that there was no such thing as Nanhua New Village in the 16th district, nor did his wife cover the district seal to seal up the elementary school. As for the saying of being taken into custody again, it is especially untrue. Since the reporter met him in person, it is sufficient to prove that there was no such thing as being taken into custody again. It must be a mistake in the transmission.

### French Trading Firm Loses U.S. Dollars in Theft; Difficulty in Investigation Due to No Fingerprints Left

[Our Report] The French-owned Xindeng Foreign Firm at No. 147, No. 47, Huqiu Road, this city, was visited by a thief yesterday morning, losing 2,200 U.S. dollars. At that time, the office door and drawers were pried open, but the thief did not leave any fingerprints. The earliest person to discover the case was Xu Dong, the legal person and manager of the firm (26 years old). It was already 10:00 am yesterday, so when the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau received the report and sent officers to investigate, it was very difficult to find clues, and no progress has been made so far.

### Snakes as Objects of Worship, No Need for Fishing Nets; Bizarre Customs of the Gaoshan People; Cutting Off Heads and Placing Them on Soil Platforms for Show; Drinking Blood Wine from Linked Cups Considered Intimate Friends

[Special Report by Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Gaoshan Ethnic Group Customs Exhibition is being held on the second floor of the Daxin Company. The reporter once made a hurried visit.

From these many exhibited photos and exhibits, we can see the general outline of the life of the Gaoshan ethnic group. It is really a life close to the original, somewhat similar to the life of the natives in American movies. In religion, the Gaoshan ethnic group belongs to a monotheistic religion and is also an animistic religion. Snakes are their "totem" and objects of worship. Among the exhibits, there is a pair of 500-year-old snakes. In addition, there are many pictographic carvings, all based on snakes. The chief of the indigenous people has his own authority, but his authority is still under the authority of the gods. When the chief and his tribesmen gather, they often only wear a short skirt, but he has a "shell chain" full of jewels to show his identity. He sometimes wears a small shell garment to show solemnity and grandeur during major ceremonies such as weddings and battles. The small shells are only the size of a tender pearl rice. After they are strung together, they look like a thick, loose white velvet thread. They also nail foreign buttons with patterns on their clothes, which is really a wonderful use of buttons.

Their houses are all simple thatched huts supported by short pieces of wood. They also have looms and granaries. After the agricultural work is completed every year, a grand ceremony is held. In addition to crops, their main foods include fish and wild animals. They do not use fishing nets to catch fish, but use wooden and iron forks. This type of fish fork is only three lengths long and relies entirely on skilled and accurate techniques. They also use various long spears and bows and arrows to hunt animals. In fact, the weapons they use in war are nothing more than these, but they are made more sophisticated. Sharp spears, curved swords, and barbed spears fully demonstrate the Gaoshan ethnic group's spirit of killing and martial arts. After the fight, the cut-off head is placed on the head platform, which is considered a glorious show of force.

Here is a strange thing called Lianbei (linked cups). Two pairs of long cups are connected together, and it has three uses: (1) When beheading, use Lianbei to hold blood and wine for drinking, which is regarded as an intimate friend of the beheaded person. (2) When the chief mediates disputes for people, both parties drink together with Lianbei to release their suspicions. (3) Used by couples to drink marriage wine.

In art, they are not without achievements. There are deer head spoons carved from hardwood and various intricately carved offering plates. Their pottery, pipes, and medicine mortars also have their own styles. There is also a statue of an ancient hero, naked, looking quite handsome.

Although they have not reached the realm of perfection in art, a kind of brilliant talent can be expressed from the rough and simple.

### Luo Zhuoying Talks About the Political Situation in Guangdong Province: Food is No Longer in Short Supply, Transportation is Gradually Restored, and the Silk Industry Has a Promising Future

[Our Report] Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he attended a tea party hosted by the Guangdong fellow villagers in Shanghai, during which he talked about the recent situation in Guangdong. He reported on the security, food, transportation, and economic situation in Guangdong since the restoration.

Luo said: After the victory, there were more than 100,000 enemy, puppet, bandit, and mixed troops in Guangdong. The authorities have been continuously suppressing, incorporating, resettling, and disbanding them. It was not until April of this year that the situation gradually stabilized. At present, there is absolutely no problem with security in Guangdong. Only near Hong Kong and Kowloon are there still small groups of bandits.

As for food, Guangdong has always been insufficient. At the end of April this year, the price of rice once broke through the 100,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, thanks to the transportation of rice by the overseas Chinese in Luo'an Nanhua, the relief from the central government, and the assistance from the Guangdong fellow villagers in Nanjing and Shanghai, the price of rice gradually fell back, and the people's hearts tended to stabilize. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Government implemented a comprehensive production, comprehensive conservation, comprehensive purchase and transportation, and comprehensive control policy, which has been quite effective. This year, there is no problem with rice in Guangdong. At present, we are actively trying to solve the problem of food shortages in March, April, May, and June next year.

In terms of transportation, waterways to all rivers have been opened, but there are insufficient ships. The pre-war railways, Yuehan and Guangjiu, have all resumed operation. The highway is now handed over to private operation by the provincial government and given guarantees and incentives. Overseas Chinese have invested in construction.

Regarding the economy, the silk industry in Guangdong is very promising. According to experts' inspections, it is said to be more promising than Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The provincial government has set a five-year economic plan, but it lacks capital. It is hoped that all sectors will actively invest and not miss the good opportunity to build Guangdong. The development of production in Guangdong can open up the Nanyang market, which is closely related to the economic future of our country.

### Youth Army 202nd Division Came to Shanghai to Find Training Sites

The 146th Brigade of the Shanghai Garrison was ordered to gradually move its defense. It was rumored that the defense of the Shanghai suburbs would be taken over by the 202nd Division of the Youth Army. Yesterday, Wu Hanchao, the chief of the Staff Office of the Garrison Command, told reporters that the 202nd Division was looking for a camp in Shanghai for training. As for which unit would take over the defense of the Shanghai area, the order from the Ministry of National Defense has not yet arrived. However, according to relevant sources, after the 146th Brigade is transferred, the defense of this city may be taken over by the 67th Division of Major General Dai Jian's troops.

### Local News in This City

### Welcoming the New Year

"The moon is cold, the sky is clear, and the night is deep,
A beauty's smile is worth a thousand gold pieces,
Hanging silk sleeves dance, raising mournful sounds,
Do not sing Bai Xue in Yingzhong,
The Wu Song at midnight moves your heart,
Moves your heart, hoping you appreciate,
I wish to be a pair of mandarin ducks in Tianchi,
Flying away to the blue clouds one day."

Li Bai's White Silk Song

Music and women are indispensable decorations in a metropolis, and dancing is a synthesis of music and women, occupying a large force in Shanghai's entertainment circle. Dancing was originally the earliest product of human civilization. In any nation during the theocratic era, dancing was an important program for worshiping gods and ancestors. However, in the current stage of Shanghai, dancing has changed its nature. Under the dim and ambiguous lights, embracing women dressed like demons, coupled with the magnificent jazz music, has become a sale of money and lust. It is vastly different from the artistic dancing of the past.

Christmas has just passed, and the New Year is coming, which is the festive season for dancing. The night in the city is not lonely originally, but it is especially lively these days. Although neon lights have been banned, there are still many tempting lights everywhere, beckoning to pedestrians on the roadside at any time. A burst of music blows over in the cold wind. If you can't control your emotions, stepping into the door of the dance hall will allow you to see a moving scene. Pairs of dancers spin in the dance floor, and various instruments play together to form a "song of the night", stirring people's heartstrings. Here, it is full of the laughter of pleasure-seekers.

### A Review of Shanghai Dance Halls

The trend of dancing has become popular in today's Shanghai. From high-ranking officials and wealthy businessmen to salaried people, especially students, they all linger in the dance halls. They dance and dance, day and night, simply forgetting everything. However, dancing in Shanghai has only a short history.

The earliest dancing in Shanghai was originally a game for foreigners. At that time, the Astor House Hotel at the end of the Waibaidu Bridge and the Carlton Hotel near the Racecourse held social tea dances every Saturday and Sunday evening. Chinese people were very rare. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the Yipinxing Hotel also imitated the social tea dance. At that time, many high-ranking officials and dignitaries stayed at the Yipinxing Hotel, and the tea dance was also lively. This can be said to be the earliest Chinese dance hall in Shanghai.

Commercial Dance Halls Were First Created by Black Cat

The first commercial dance hall was the Black Cat Dance Hall next to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. There were dance hostesses to accompany the dance, three dances for one yuan, which was also the price set at that time. After the opening of the Black Cat Dance Hall, the tea dance at Yipinxing was virtually cancelled. Then, the Peach Blossom Palace on Aiduya Road, the Moon Palace on North Sichuan Road, and the Lidao on Ningbo Road were opened. However, at that time, there were very few people in Shanghai who could dance. It was not uncommon to see people making mistakes in their steps, somersaulting, and being embarrassed, which was often ridiculed by Westerners. Moreover, the society was not as permissive as it is now. It was unsightly for men and women to embrace, and there were many criticisms. The dance hall business was not very developed.

As dancing became popular over time, people gradually became accustomed to it, and there were more and more visitors. Therefore, new dance halls sprung up like mushrooms, such as Dadong, Dahu, Lafei, and Dahua, which were established one after another. The business was generally good. At that time, there was also a kind of small dance hall, which was set up by speculators to attract middle-class dancers, such as Shunfeng, Nightclub, Xiaoyao, Shengli, and Huilingdeng, which followed one after another. The dance tickets were changed to five to eight dances per yuan, and the tea fee was reduced to two or four corners. At this point, ordinary salaried people, and even small clerks in shops, became guests in the dance hall. Dancing in Shanghai slowly became popular. At that time, although the dance hall business was booming, they paid great attention to customers and did not lose their intention to accommodate. There would never be a situation where a large group of dance hostesses would come to introduce themselves to sit at the table, entangling endlessly, making people laugh and cry. Later, affected by the world economic panic, the Shanghai market was shrouded in "depression". The business was particularly accommodating. Many dance halls with three dances for one yuan did not hesitate to lower their prices and changed to five dances for one yuan. Almost all dance halls held afternoon tea dances, offering refreshments to attract customers. However, if you brought a dance partner in, you still had to spend money on tea, because the dance hall and the dance hostesses only hoped to earn more income from the dance tickets. At first, red dancers scorned participating in tea dances, but gradually, under the drive of the whip of life, many of them also switched to tea dances. This was a stage where the dance industry was going downhill.

The cannon fire of "August 13th" broke the extravagant life of Shanghai people who were obsessed with pleasure and extravagance. However, after the National Army withdrew to the west, the appearance of Shanghai gradually became prosperous again. At that time, a group of wealthy businessmen came to Shanghai from the mainland to take refuge. These people, who had huge amounts of money and nothing to do, indulged in pleasure, causing Shanghai's entertainment industry to develop abnormally. Dance halls, of course, were no exception. The old dance halls reopened one after another, and several new dance halls also opened. However, due to the martial law in the concession, the evening dance started at 8:00 pm. Every Saturday night, it was open all night, and some even stayed open all night. Tea dances were still very common. Many medium-sized and small dance halls also had so-called lunch dances. If you were interested, you could dance from 12:00 noon to 4:00 am the next morning.

The Dance Market in the Isolated Island Was Like Crazy

At that time, the residents on the isolated island were like crazy about dancing. Whether it was day or night, the dance halls were always full, and they were even more crowded on Saturdays. In the dance floor, you could only see shoulders rubbing against each other and crowds moving. The "foreign fiddlers" were also working extra hard. As soon as one song ended, another song started, tiring the enthusiastic dancers. The whole hall was shrouded in the atmosphere of rouge, powder, smoke, and alcohol, until the banknotes in the dancers' pockets were all sent into the dance hostesses' purses, and everyone returned with pleasure. At this time, on the long front line, countless officers and soldiers were fighting bloody battles, but Shanghai could no longer hear the sound of cannons. The tragic past was also blurred and forgotten. Who still remembered the national crisis and family difficulties!

After Victory

After the victory, Shanghai's dance halls were like weeds after a spring breeze, showing a prosperous life. American sailors had stashed away American dollar bills in their pockets that they had been unable to spend for months. Of course, they had to have fun after going ashore. The dance hall owners received a batch of foreign gods of wealth and were really smiling from ear to ear. However, the sailors fighting and making trouble after getting drunk were also a headache for the dance halls. Moreover, the good times did not last long. The sailors' pockets slowly emptied, and the business of the dance halls also declined accordingly. Therefore, they changed their business policies one after another and continued to do business with the Chinese.

### Social Dancing Relieves Loneliness and Eliminates Worries

The custom of dancing has spread to China and has almost become an important item in sensuality. Most young masters use social interaction as an excuse to achieve their purpose of playing with women. Many of the dance hostesses who accompany the dance are also transformed from girls in brothels. The dance hall has become a place to satisfy carnal desires. However, in European and American countries, the background and position of dancing are completely different from those in China. The men and women are either friends or colleagues. They like this way and go dancing together. They simply regard dancing as an indoor sport and a kind of beautified sentiment, so they dance easily and naturally. Relieving loneliness and eliminating worries really have a special flavor. At grand banquets, dancing in unison and in rhythm is even more indispensable, which is really worthy of the word "social".

The initial social dance was certainly very rigid. Later, the relationship between men and women in society gradually became free, the dance skills became more relaxed, and the steps became more complex, from "slow" to "fast". The purpose of this transformation is nothing more than to attract each other with the opposite sex and to adjust the dryness of social interaction with the melody of beautiful music. This is called high-level sentiment!

### Old Stories of Fifty Years Ago The Shanghai Daotai Office Dance Party Was the First Time in Chinese Officialdom

In the twenty-third year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty (1896 in the Western calendar), on the tenth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, it was the birthday of Empress Dowager Cixi. Cai Jun, the Shanghai Daotai, held a grand banquet to entertain foreign guests and held a dance party. This was the first time that the Chinese officialdom used a dance party to entertain foreign guests, and it was also the first time that Shanghai had a public dance.

The venue for the dance party was set up in the Foreign Affairs Bureau's office on Jing'an Temple Road. From the gate on the road to the outside of the Foreign Affairs Bureau's gate, thousands of bright, angular, and glazed lamps were hung, with colorful lights shining brilliantly. Five-color silks were hung on the corners of the lamps, dancing in the wind. At the same time, hundreds of electric lamps were installed, illuminating the place as if it were daytime. Inside, there were cloakrooms and cane racks. On the large restaurant, there were I-shaped dining tables, full of flowers and fragrant wines and delicacies. The dance hall was set up in the inner courtyard, with teak floors that were smooth and mirrored. There were also rest rooms, smoking rooms, and dressing rooms, with bright windows and clean tables, and new furnishings. The corridors were covered with national flags of various countries, as well as silk curtains. This arrangement took a lot of effort at the time.

In advance, Daotai Cai sent out 600 invitations, inviting consuls from various countries, naval admirals from the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, and gentlemen and merchants from various countries residing in Shanghai to attend the meeting. Daotai Cai led the interpreter Feng Taishou and the members of the Foreign Affairs Bureau, the commissioners, and the members of the Mixed Court to greet the guests. The patrol room also sent many interpreters to help take care of things. A Western music band, led by "Peina", was brought from Hong Kong, with a total of 40 people, and also participated in the grand event.

On this day, the newly arrived guests were either in armor, or in formal dresses with medals, and the women were in fox furs, bright and dazzling. The hosts were also dressed neatly and greeted them in person. The dishes prepared were extremely rich, and the cups, plates, knives, and forks were the best of the time. After the banquet, the guests rested briefly, and after the female guests washed up, the dance began. It was not until the east was white that the guests returned with pleasure. Afterwards, the foreigners praised Daotai Cai, saying that Daotai Cai treated Westerners not only with courtesy, but also knew Western customs well and did not bind Westerners with Chinese etiquette. Especially this dance party was indeed an exception. It was intended to connect with foreign countries in the midst of celebrating the festival and to show respect to Westerners. It was truly rare. This unprecedented dance party in Shanghai really set a precedent. Although it was a bit unappealing to the general public at the time.

### Male Dancers

The term "male dancer" may be unfamiliar to everyone. Originally, under the principle of equality between men and women, there should be male dancers as well as female dancers. In dance halls in European and American countries, male dancers are not rare. They, like female dancers, accompany people to dance, but this custom has not yet become popular in China.

In the 26th year of the Republic of China, male dancers appeared in the Paramount. It is said that he was a well-known expert who had been teaching dancing all along. Introduced by a certain dance hostess, he entered the Paramount Dance Hall and taught dancing there every night. At the same time, he could accompany ladies and wives to dance at any time. However, it was a flash in the pan and disappeared in a few days. Since then, no one has succeeded him.

### The Girls on the Volcano: From Greenhorns to Red Stars

Dancers are the most important element of a dance hall. Shops need sufficient goods, restaurants need good food, and dance halls of course need beautiful dancers. If the dance hall truly has red stars as numerous as clouds, then a magnificent lineup and thriving business can be expected soon.

The lives of dancers are full of tragedy. We only see them in heavy makeup and flamboyant clothes, radiating smiles, but we don't know that behind their smiles are actually tears of bitterness. They are mostly from backward petty bourgeois or middle-class families. Because of poverty, because of life, they are forced to walk onto the volcano, selling their youth. Although Shanghai is hailed as a world metropolis, career opportunities for women are still pitifully few. Moreover, most of them have not had the opportunity to receive education, and there is no suitable work for them to do. Even if there is work, there are not enough factories to accommodate them, and the meager wages cannot support them. In their families, most have widowed mothers, and weak younger brothers and sisters. Even if their fathers are still alive, they are plagued by poverty and disease. The entire burden of family life rests on their shoulders. In order to survive, and because of the demand in the city, they have no choice but to come out and dance.

To prepare to become a dancer, one must first learn to dance. There are several dance training schools in Shanghai that often give special treatment to these prospective dancers and do not charge tuition. As long as they patiently learn there for ten days or half a month, and understand a few dance steps, they can officially enter the profession.

Training complete. After completing their training, they are introduced to dance halls by their female friends or the dance training school. At first, they can only enter small dance halls. Before that, they have to borrow money from all sides to raise funds to purchase fashionable clothes, and go through a hasty procedure of getting a perm and beauty treatment to cope. Then they enter the hall and begin their dancing career.

The facilities in small dance halls are crude, and the patrons are vulgar and unrefined. After spending a year or half a year in small dance halls, they gradually become familiar with the ropes, and they get to know more female friends. At the same time, they also have some familiar patrons. At this time, they visit the first and second-class dance halls. Seeing the grand atmosphere naturally moves their hearts, and they try to move up to a higher-class dance hall.

Advancement. Advancement is not easy. In addition to having a decent appearance and figure, they must also have more refined dancing skills, and better conversational and social skills. Their clothes and decorations should also be more elaborate. Most importantly, they need wealthy patrons who can afford to support them. Otherwise, after being promoted, they will not be able to maintain their business, and they will lose face instead. It is a case of the higher they climb, the harder they fall. In this way, they rise step by step from third-class to second-class to first-class. A dancer with good looks, skilled dancing, and social skills can hope to step into a first-class dance hall in three to five years.

The income of dancers is mainly based on dance tickets. The dance tickets have to be split with the dance hall. The most popular dancers can get 70%, and the dance hall gets 30%. The next level gets a 40/60 split. The "Aunt Gui" dancers only get a 50/50 split. After the dancer splits the ticket price with the dance hall, they still have to go through another layer of exploitation by the dance hostess, who takes away another 20-30%, so the actual income is very limited.

Table. Sitting at tables brings in more income, but ordinary dancers do not get a turn every night. Only those red-hot dance stars can rotate between eight or ten tables a night. The most popular dancers now earn nearly ten million yuan per month. This huge number is staggering, but the most miserable "Osmanthus" dancers earn less than one hundred thousand yuan per month.

Patrons enter the dance hall to have fun, so the dancers cannot put on a stern face. However, vulgar patrons often make all kinds of unsightly jokes in addition to dancing. The dancers respond with smiling faces, but can only cry secretly when no one is watching. In the Shanghai, where human desires run rampant, patrons make further demands on the dancers. The young and inexperienced greenhorns, under the temptation of money, often give up the purity inherited from their parents and let themselves be slaughtered.

Red Star. It is very difficult to climb to the throne of a red star. One must have special talents in all aspects such as "art," "social skills," and "style," and at the same time be able to attract a large number of guests to patronize her. However, it is difficult to maintain such a luxurious lifestyle solely on normal dance ticket income. Even if one rotates between tables ten times a night, one can only earn 50,000 yuan (assuming an average dance ticket price of 10,000 yuan, which must be split with the venue and the dance hostess). Therefore, their biggest income still comes from the extra rewards of wealthy patrons. This, of course, comes with strings attached. The mysterious relationship is self-evident.

In the dance halls filled with debauchery, dancers are easily influenced by the environment. Many popular and successful dancers, after getting through the difficult times, often drift along with the current, only seeking immediate revelry and not thinking about their drifting fate. As for those who fall and become hopeless, it is sigh-worthy.

Banning Dancing

Currently, the number of dancers registered with the Municipal Government Police Bureau has exceeded two thousand. They are all young women, ranging in age from thirteen or fourteen to about thirty years old. Shanghai can be said to be a factory for producing dancers. In addition to being distributed to dance halls throughout the city, they also have to supply the needs of other cities and overseas. Nearby cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and far away cities such as Peiping, Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and even various parts of Southeast Asia have their traces. However, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places have successively banned dancing, and Shanghai's dance halls have also been hit by the recession. The miserable lives of these Yingying Yanyan are predictable.

### Dance Training School

Since dancing has become a popular pastime, many people who are enthusiastic about dancing must first learn it to avoid "stumbling" on the dance floor. Those who are preparing to become dancers must first understand a few dance steps. As a result, many dancing schools and dance training schools sprang up. Now, after the correction of the police bureau, they have all been renamed "Dance Training Schools."

Dance training schools are mostly located in dilapidated Western-style houses or upstairs in ×× mansions. There is only a small, cramped room, without magnificent murals or exquisite lanterns, only a few half-new and old chairs, a few artistic lamps, and some scattered paper flowers, and an indispensable phonograph. They are simple and crude, and compared with the magnificent dance halls, they are worlds apart. However, the waxed floor is as smooth as in the dance halls.

The students there include wealthy mistresses, young ladies from humble families preparing to become dancers, clerks from foreign firms, university students, and air force personnel who are about to go abroad. There are also many girls from Changsan parlors, who also come there to learn to dance because business is not good, and they want to work as dancers as well. There are also many small clerks who are not very wealthy, or young masters who are tired of playing in dance halls, who also come here to pursue pleasure even though they already know how to dance.

There are so-called "professors" and "assistant teachers" there. If you spend 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, you can learn and study under their guidance. At first, you are guided by the assistant teacher, and when you reach a certain level, the "professor" personally takes the stage. The so-called courses usually only include a few types such as "foxtrot," "blues," and "waltz." As for learning other steps, you have to pay extra.

When the students' dancing skills have made some progress, men and women can temporarily act as partners and dance there. At this time, those students who are preparing to become dancers do their best to seduce the male students. When they are about to leave the training school, they will brazenly say to you: "Help me out."

### Dancing Professors Come from Dance Hostess Backgrounds

After these "prospective dancers" complete their training, they are mostly introduced to dance halls by the training school. Fortunately, the professors there are mostly dance hostesses who have fallen behind, and it is not difficult for them to introduce one or two dancers. The "professors" often boast: "Look, red dance stars like ×× were all trained here!" In fact, what they learn there are only a few simple and superficial steps, because professors from dance hostess backgrounds cannot truly understand the art of dancing. As for these so-called "assistant teachers," they are even more ridiculous. They are mostly declining young masters: they cannot hold a pen to write, nor can they carry a load, so they can only appear as disguised "dance men" and serve others.

In the past, dance training schools were slightly more commercial in nature, and also had names such as tea dances and evening dances. In addition to the prescribed learning time, students who wanted to participate in dancing could buy a few practice tickets, which were actually a disguised form of dance tickets. At that time, in the dance halls, one yuan could only buy three or five dances, while the practice tickets of the training school could buy as many as sixteen. As a result, many friends who knew how to calculate rushed to it, and the small room was filled with pairs of men and women hugging each other. Many female students temporarily acted as dancers, because the tuition fees they paid were very low, or even completely free, so this was an obligation they had to fulfill. "Dancing is one of the eight major arts. If you can't dance, you are missing a page in the history of human social interaction." Although dance training schools used this sentence to promote and appeal, some people regarded it as a "holy land" for social interaction, a "paradise" for flirting, and a marriage agency.

### The Sunset is Infinitely Beautiful, but Only Near Dusk: The Declining Dance Halls

Within the dance industry, it is also a situation where the back waves push the front waves. After the dance halls that have lost their appeal fall, new dance halls are quickly established. Currently, there are 27 dance halls registered with the Municipal Police Bureau in Shanghai, with more than 1,800 dancers. They are the gilded dens that adorn the prosperity of the city.

The International Hotel, towering on the side of the racecourse, has an extremely luxurious dance hall, which holds tea dances every Sunday. However, it does not provide dancers, so you must bring your own female companion. Its noble style and courteous service can look down on other dance halls, and its high food prices are also unmatched by others.

The Paramount on Yu Garden Road is promoted as the most luxurious dance hall in the Far East. Indeed, when the building was first completed, the glass floor of the dance floor was unique. The Ciro's on Jing'an Temple Road was originally the private social venue of Mr. Yuan Xun, and was later rented by Xie Baosheng and converted into a commercial dance hall. In terms of interior and exterior, it is worthy of the words "luxurious," but unfortunately the dance floor is too small, and it feels like there is no room to maneuver when there are too many people.

The Lido Dance Hall on Metcalfe Road was originally the residence of a wealthy Shanghai merchant. In addition to the large dance floor, there is also a magnificent hotel, an exquisite garden, and a swimming pool next to it. The Metropolitan on Gordon Road is also known for its garden dance hall, with a circular classical dance floor, an open-air green garden dance floor, winding flower paths, and a golf course. The various facilities are similar to those of the Lido. The Vienna, which is far away from the Metropolitan, is also very sophisticated in its facilities. Not far north of the Metropolitan is also a New Xianlin, which is also converted from a garden residence, with some scenic beauty.

The Dahua on Avenue Edward VII and the Dahu, which faces the racecourse, are both very old dance halls. In the past, there was a period when they were very popular. The Small Metropolitan next to the Dahu is so small that it can be said to be true to its name. Before the war, it and the Dahu specialized in sailor business. The earliest hotels that also operated dance halls were the Datong and the Yangzi. The Yangzi was famous for its spring floor, and the Datong was not weak either. Now, on Tibet Road, there are dance halls attached to hotels everywhere, such as the Far East and the Santa Fe, which are all located on the lower floors of hotels. Even the Weida on Avenue Joffre also operates a dance business.

Among the 27 dance halls in the city, the majority of their patrons are from the business world. In the past, when the speculation craze was at its peak, brokers could earn millions with just a lift of their hands, and they were naturally not stingy with supporting and rewarding the dancers. But in years of economic downturn, they also have little interest in this. As for other "nobles" and "young masters," they are just slightly decorating the facade. When the business of dance halls plummeted, everyone was thinking of ways to attract customers. The large dance halls tried their best to attract red stars to attract dance guests. Some of them were temporary guest appearances, but they could earn at least several million at a time. In the past, there was a advertising war, competing to publish the names of dance stars in large fonts in newspapers to attract customers. Now this trend is popular again.

Singing is also a good business tool. This is a mobile advertisement in the dance hall. Several red singers rush to different venues, and their monthly income is considerable, and the venue benefits a lot. In addition, special programs such as martial arts and comic plays are also very popular in dance halls, and the fee is limited, but the guests like them very much.

Several dance halls combine tea dances and tea room dances into one. In the past, you had to brew tea twice, but now you only brew it once, and you can play from 2 pm to 7 pm continuously. Customers who enjoy this are getting a lot of benefits.

### The Distorted Business of the Metropolis: The Shanghai Dance Girl Investigation Bureau

The flourishing of dance is a distorted development in a metropolis. Furthermore, there are institutions that are happy with the dance industry, which are the so-called "Dance Girl Investigation Bureau" and "Preservation Institute". Suddenly, they moved their minds and attached a dance market investigation bureau. The proclaimed purpose of the bureau is to serve the society and seek happiness for the people, which can be removed "bright and upright." In the 30th year of the Republic of China, a "Dance Girl Investigation Bureau" appeared, which was managed by the Chinese. They were mostly failed dance hall people or declining dance hall "filial sons", and they actually came up with a new business.

The business scope of the investigation bureau: (1) Investigate their children for families. Young people who are not familiar with the world are most easily corrupted in Shanghai. There are many young people in dance halls who are still studying or have just entered society, and therefore abandon their studies. Parents can entrust the bureau to investigate in order to understand their secrets, and can also supervise them on their behalf. (2) Investigate their husbands for wives. In many families, husbands often dance, fall in love, and even abandon the "yellow-faced woman" at home. Wives, in order to prevent problems before they happen, can entrust the bureau to investigate their husbands' whereabouts outside. Similarly, husbands can also ask the bureau to investigate if they suspect that their wives are socializing and dancing outside. (3) Investigate their dance girls for customers. Customers falling in love with dance girls is common in today's dance halls, but the bureau can find out all the secrets about the dance girl's background, who is "supporting" her, whether she has a "trailer", and whether she is dealing with customers for their money, so as not to lead to various deteriorating situations. (4) Investigate their dance guests for dance girls. In Shanghai, there are slippery dance girls, and there are also dance guests who are at the forefront of slipping. Often, as soon as they enter the dance hall, they look generous, and dance girls are easily deceived by them and lose their bodies. Dance girls who want to investigate the background of dance guests can also ask the investigation bureau to provide services.

The fees of the investigation bureau are calculated by time. In the past, the general handling fee was 50 yuan, plus a public fee of 20 yuan was enough. If the investigation procedure is more complicated and cannot be completed within a week, the fee will also increase proportionally.

Shanghai is a slippery world. Only those who can use their brains can make a fortune. The Dance Girl Investigation Bureau is nothing more than for legal tender, and it can only exist in the distorted society of Shanghai. It is true that "strange things happen everywhere, but only in Shanghai are there more."

### Dancing for Disaster Relief

"If you don't use women as a gimmick, how would the money in the miser's purse fly out?"

Don't think that dancing is a kind of entertainment, a kind of consumption. Dancers also want to do a little responsibility for society. Our country is a country with many disasters and difficulties. In the past, when the wave of saving the country was singing high into the clouds, some people even shouted the slogan "dancing to save the country." Although dancing cannot save the country, dancers can call for something when there is something to do for disaster relief. This year's sensational Shanghai Miss Election also had a dance star group, which benefited the refugees in northern Jiangsu a lot.

In the Shanghai Miss Election, the dance star group was relatively simple. The participants were only Guan Minli, Li Zhenzhen, and Gu Lihua. Li and Gu temporarily did not participate in the election, so Guan Minli became the only one. However, the power of the appeal was not reduced because there was only one person left. Guan Minli still got 23,150 votes and won the queen's throne. The runner-up queen belonged to Gu Lihua.

Although there were not many dancers participating in the Miss Shanghai election, they had held a charity dance in advance to respond to the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu. Each dance hall designated a day for charity dance and charity sale. On that day, the dance tickets earned by the dancers and the tea money sold in the dance halls were all used as donations. As a result, nine dancers, including Xu Qinfang, won type A medals, among which Zhou Lijuan and Ye Meimei also won special souvenirs. Eighteen people, including Li Zhenzhen, won type B medals. On the dance hall side, nine companies, including MGM, Dahua, Ciro's, Queen, Dalu, Far East, Gaofeng, Small Metropolitan, and Guolian, won honorary certificates, which were awarded at the lively scene of the Shanghai Miss Election on August 20.

It is not a new idea to raise donations by using dance girls as a gimmick. It has been done many times in the past, but this year it was particularly lively. This grand event is viewed with mixed praise and criticism by the general public. Those who agree say: they have a warm heart for disaster relief and a charitable heart, and they have demonstrated the spirit of human mutual assistance. But there are also many sarcastic and ironic words that hit their ears. They say: If you don't use women as a gimmick, how would the money in the miser's purse fly out? But on the other hand, such a great appeal is indeed worthy of looking down on men. No wonder there is a sense of "then all the parents in the world will not value sons, but value daughters."

### Observations of a Certain Banker: The Financial Crisis is About to Pass, Ample Deposit Reserves Can Avoid Accidents

[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently visited a certain banker and inquired about the general situation of the financial community. The banker agreed to provide the following information: (1) The banking crisis caused by the soaring gold prices is about to pass. This incident shows the importance of adequate deposit reserves. Before the war, a 20% reserve was considered very safe; but in the current state of unstable currency values, the reserve ratio must be increased. The deposit reserves of the most reputable banks in this city exceed 50%; but the generally weaker banks, overly eager for profit, often have reserves of only 10-20%, so they cannot cope after a run on deposits. This is, in fact, the main reason for the bank's grounding, in addition to gold speculation. It is hoped that the affected bankers can accept this lesson, which will greatly benefit the stability of the financial market in the future. (2) In this large fluctuation of gold prices, the Central Bank is undoubtedly a winner, not only did it suppress gold prices, but it also had its own income. According to rough estimates, the Central Bank may have earned about 7 billion yuan in this incident. (3) Regarding the bank books for the coming year, it is heard that foreign banks have decided to cancel the jiao and fen units in order to save accounting procedures. The Bankers' Association of our country also has this suggestion, but it has not yet received the agreement of the major bankers, because on the one hand, this matter involves the national currency system, and on the other hand, jiao and fen cannot be omitted when paying direct taxes. The matter is of great importance, so it is not appropriate to make a rash decision. (4) The government's management of commercial banks next year will inevitably be strengthened, and the center of management will be to check the escape of funds to Hong Kong. These escaped funds are used to pay for imports that cannot be approved for foreign exchange. The work of the Financial Inspection Department of the Central Bank is currently very serious, but the manpower is still insufficient. If manpower can be strengthened in the future, supervising the accounting of commercial banks can also prevent the escape of funds. (5) There are rumors that a 5,000-yuan bill will be issued next year, and that the exchange rate will be revised in January. From the standpoint of the financial industry, there is no need for a 5,000-yuan bill, so this statement is undoubtedly a rumor. As for revising the exchange rate, it is theoretically necessary, but in view of the situation of stimulating prices during the last revision, it must be very cautious. As for the exact date, it is a matter of confidentiality, and everything circulated outside is just speculation.

### Official and Private Opinions Diverge on the Processing and Export of Domestic Silk

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the method of processing and exporting domestic silk, the views of the official and private sides have not yet been consistent. The official side hopes to provide 1,400 dan of raw silk and 2,000 boxes of rayon to be woven by private silk factories on consignment. The government will give appropriate "processing fees" according to the nature of the woven products, so that the silk factories in the precarious state can barely survive and avoid bankruptcy. The working capital required during the weaving period, amounting to about 6 billion yuan, will also be provided by the Four Banks interest-free. As for the sales of the finished products, it is entirely the government's business, and the profits and losses have nothing to do with the silk factories. From the government's standpoint, the overseas market must be maintained and cannot be interrupted. Even if there is no profit to be made, exports must continue. Moreover, processing and exporting raw silk can increase foreign exchange positions. The selling price of each dan of raw silk is about 800 US dollars, but after it is woven into silk and exported, it can get a price of about 1,500 US dollars. After deducting all necessary expenses, it can get at least 1,200 US dollars, which is very cost-effective. Regarding the private silk factories making and selling their own products, the relevant parties expressed difficulty in agreeing. The reasons are: (1) The factory is responsible for "processing," the raw materials belong to the public, and the finished products also belong to the public, so the sales should be the responsibility of the public. (2) The sales risk is very high, and if there is a loss, it is definitely not something that an organization with a capital of 500 million yuan can be responsible for; it is better for the government to handle it on its behalf. The public is focused on obtaining foreign exchange and maintaining the market, and profits and losses are not a decisive consideration, which is different from private operations. As of now, there is only agreement in principle between each other. Detailed methods are still to be discussed, and the final decision needs to be made by the administrative authorities before it can be implemented.

### American Commercial Ships Rank First Among Those Coming to China

According to authoritative sources in the shipping industry, the commercial ships entering and leaving Chinese seaports this year (from January to August) are led by the United States, with 669 ships totaling 2,695,720 tons. The United Kingdom is second, with 826 ships totaling 1,603,561 tons. Other Japanese ships are also above the Soviet Union and rank third. However, our country's commercial ships total only 265 ships, totaling 297,882 tons, and they are all old ships. How can they compete with other countries for a day's length? It will not be until the fixed 1 million tons arrive in China that our shipping industry will have a glimmer of hope.

### US-Japan Trade Restores to Pre-War Levels

According to important figures in the American business community in this city, trade between the United States and Japan has returned to pre-war levels, and the second half of this year has developed even more than the first half. From 1936 to 1938, the average annual exports from the United States to Japan were 20,300,000 US dollars, while imports from Japan were 13,000,000 US dollars. The above statistics include Korea and Taiwan. The total number of US exports to Japan in June 1946 was 16,900,000 US dollars, 16,900,000 US dollars in July, and 20,200,000 US dollars in August. The total number of imports from Japan in June of the same year was 14,000,000 US dollars, 11,000,000 US dollars in July, and 12,000,000 US dollars in August.

### Shops Make False Accounts

The Ministry of Economic Affairs is Trying to Prevent It

[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stated that the practice of making false accounts in the business community after the war is very prevalent, which is very wrong. It is now working with relevant authorities to jointly formulate a commercial accounting law so that the accounting system of the business community can get on the right track. At the same time, it will be stipulated that if someone makes false accounts in order to deceive others, they will be punished by law according to the crime.

### Many Chongqing Industrial and Commercial Businesses Bankrupt, Proposed Request for Loan Relief Based on Precedent

Chongqing's industrial and commercial businesses are currently struggling under the pressure of foreign goods flooding the market and slow sales. Bankruptcies and closures are frequently reported. According to tax authorities, over twenty industrial and commercial businesses in the city have closed in the past two months. With the end of the year approaching, it is difficult to predict whether more will follow. To salvage the current crisis, various industries plan to request the government to provide loans to Chongqing's industrial and commercial businesses, following the example of the Shanghai industrial and commercial loan relief program. Specific measures are currently being discussed.

### New and Old Year-Ends Approaching: Review of the City's Industrial and Commercial Situation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing] Today is December 30th of the 35th year of the Republic. The solar new year has arrived, and the lunar new year is only twenty days away. Looking back on the past year, industrial and commercial businesses have faced an unprecedented crisis due to currency depreciation, foreign invasion, and high-interest loans. During this year, the price of gold soared from 785,000 yuan on the opening day of January 4th to 3.3 million yuan, even reaching a record high of 3.95 million yuan. The U.S. dollar jumped from 1,385 yuan to 7,800 yuan (price on the 23rd). Although the assets of factories and shops increased with rising prices, their debts, due to high-interest exploitation, increased several times more than their assets. This year, the industrial sector faced greater difficulties than the commercial sector. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed various industrial sectors and learned that their common difficulties were: 1. Lack of raw materials, 2. High taxes, 3. Frequent labor unrest, and 4. High-interest exploitation.

The situation in the commercial sector is not as alarming as some reports suggest. It was previously reported that 30% of the shops on Nanjing Road would close by the end of the year, but this sensational figure seems unreliable. According to the person in charge of the Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, "It is currently impossible to estimate the situation of the shops on Nanjing Road, but they are generally doing their best to survive the Lunar New Year. However, this period is closely related to the entire social economy. If the situation is stable, the number of closures can be reduced. Otherwise, some shops on Nanjing Road may indeed find it difficult to survive." However, the seriousness of the situation in various industries cannot be denied. Some shops on Avenue Joffre have already closed their doors, and news of company and business closures is heard every day. A portion of the city's shops will disappear with the 35th year due to weak consumer purchasing power and high-interest exploitation. However, if the city's financial situation remains calm in the last twenty days before the Lunar New Year, it will be able to save the majority of industrial and commercial businesses that are on the verge of collapse. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the heads of more than ten businesses in the city, asking about the past year and how to survive the new and old year-ends. According to Mr. Xu Jiqing, a financial giant and chairman of the Cloth Merchants' Association, the future is not pessimistic.

Economic Prospects Not Pessimistic

According to him, "Recently, the decline in China's production capacity, the sluggishness of industry and commerce, which affected the rising prices, and the depreciation of the legal tender, and the gold rush, did not hesitate to fuel the flames, creating a panic situation, which is indeed the current reality. However, I can assert that the future situation will gradually improve, and the clouds will clear, revealing a clear sky, because the peak of recession is the eve of prosperity. Therefore, in our view, China's economic prospects are not as serious as imagined, and there will be no economic collapse. For example, the Central Bank has achieved considerable results in stabilizing gold prices. In addition, the Four Joint Offices, the Central Bank, and the newly established Temporary Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans have successively provided large-scale loans for legitimate production. This measure will strengthen production, revitalize the economy, and reward new vitality. Regarding the prices of daily necessities and rice in this city, it is believed that Mayor Wu is determined and effective in suppressing market prices, and it is expected that they will not rise in the future."

Money Shops Expected to Safely Pass the Year-End

Shen Rixin, Chairman of the Money Shop Association, believes that money shops will definitely be able to safely pass the year-end. The recent surge in gold prices and tightening of credit had minimal impact on the industry. According to him, the most worrying thing at the time was the sudden reduction in interbank lending. Fortunately, it was short-lived and has now improved. Moreover, the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve Association has issued treasury bills for the assets paid by the industry as reserves, such as real estate, after evaluation and registration in the Land Administration Bureau. These bills can be used to apply for interbank lending from the association at the prevailing interbank rate for regulation. He also stated that there are currently 72 member money shops in the city, including the three companies Yong Sheng, Yong Qing, and Yi Feng, which moved from the mainland, and the four companies that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and are about to resume operations. It is expected that the end of this year will be safely passed. And all the shops can have a surplus. As for the market turmoil, what this industry feels is that there are few stores that are owed compared to those that save and trade commercially. If it is a short-term loan, it will not be greatly restricted.

Wool and Velvet Industry Doing Well, Department Stores Lamenting Hardship

As for the various commercial sectors, they are not necessarily all affected by the social and economic downturn. For example, the wool and velvet industry has been able to safely pass this year. On the contrary, department stores and restaurants are suffering, especially the restaurant industry, where more than 60% are losing money. According to the person in charge of the Restaurant Industry Association, more than 60% to 70% of the more than 500 restaurants that have joined the association are losing money. More than ten have applied for closure in the past half month, which shows the general operating conditions. The person in charge also said: "High-interest loans are the fatal wound of this industry, and the heavy taxes are also a factor. Each restaurant has to bear six types of taxes, including business tax, income tax, profit tax, stamp tax, and license tax, which invisibly increases the price of food. The business is therefore more affected. Their only hope is that the collection of banquet donations will still be handled in accordance with the standards set by the National Government, so that the business may improve slightly. As for the year-end, some will be able to survive with difficulty, but the number of those forced to close down may not be small. The department store industry is also sluggish. It can be said that the larger ones are already in a state of marking down prices. According to the person in charge of the association, their member stores generally suffer from low purchasing power, so business is very sluggish. During the price surge in September and October, they generally tried to purchase as much goods as possible, even borrowing high-interest loans to buy them. But in fact, the goods that were originally expected to be sold in two or three months have not been sold out after five or six months. Now, on the one hand, the business situation is not good, and on the other hand, they have to pay high-interest rates, so most of them are lamenting hardship. They hope that the government can provide low-interest loans. As for the year-end, although it is in extreme difficulty, they are trying their best to find ways to survive.

Except for some shops in the wool and velvet industry that closed down in the first half of the year, the general situation is now very good. There are 63 members in the association. According to the person in charge of the association, the profit margin of wool and velvet is very thin. There is no feeling of threat to supply this year, and the supply and demand are balanced. In particular, the price has always been stable, without huge fluctuations. There is no problem at the year-end, and they can all pass it safely. There are 300 members in the watch and clock industry association. The general business is very good. The watches and clocks sold on the market are all automatically imported by Americans, so the watch and clock industry has not directly ordered goods from abroad since April this year. Although the year-end is coming, they can all pass it safely in the sluggish business environment.

Cotton Cloth and Pigment Situation is Better

The situation of the cotton cloth industry is still good this year. According to the person in charge of the association, the business situation has been good for most of the time except for the past month, which has been worse. The industry association had only 800 members last year, but recently it has increased to 1,400. Generally, those who are more financially sound can cope, and only a few who use interest are relatively worse off. However, 90% of the industry can survive, and only a few need to see how the overall economic situation is before the Lunar New Year to decide their fate. The business situation of pigment merchants is much better than other industries. The association originally had 184 members. There have been new openings and closures this year. Now there are about 200 members. The business situation is that most of the supply cannot meet the demand because there are not many sources of supply. Before the war, the sources of pigments were all ordered from abroad from American, Hengqi, Bao, and foreign firms. Now these firms have all closed down, so the current sources of supply completely rely on the enemy property management office to auction the enemy property pigments of the Detfu Foreign Firm. There are also many imports of American pigments. They hope that the import management committee can help them handle foreign exchange settlement and purchase goods to facilitate the sources of supply.

Prosperous Imports, Sluggish Exports

The import and export industry in this city, the importers are naturally prosperous in all the "Westernization", and the profits are also higher than the general commercial industry, while the export industry is bleak and lifeless. According to the person in charge of the Import and Export Industry Business Association, the import of goods in this city was quite enthusiastic before the promulgation of the import management measures on November 17th. Daily necessities were imported, and cotton and automobiles were the most numerous. After the promulgation of the import management measures, the government stipulated that all goods below 2,000 US dollars can be freely requested for import; goods above 2,000 US dollars must be submitted to the Imported Goods Management Committee for approval before import. The import industry was still prosperous in the 35th year, and the profits were still not bad. However, the export industry was not doing well. The main export goods were tung oil and pig bristles, with a monthly output of 2,000 tons in peak months and about 1,000 tons in off-peak months. Our country's silk and tea were also major export products, but the situation was very bad this year. The association authorities hope that there will be new agricultural development next year, and hope that import companies will take into account the actual needs of the country and society, import daily necessities and production equipment, and minimize the import of luxury goods. The export industry is bleak, and it is hoped that the government will provide assistance and encouragement in terms of capital transportation. Furthermore, Southeast Asia was originally our country's export market, and cloth and general daily necessities can be promoted, but in recent years, it has been taken away by India, and it is urgent to rise up and catch up to restore the old appearance, which is the main plan of the export industry in the coming year. The real estate business this year can be said to be one of the years with the least transactions in recent decades. According to the person in charge of the association, since the central government clearly stipulated that real estate is prohibited from being leased or mortgaged, all business has plummeted. Now the municipal government stipulates that all real estate, etc. should be priced according to the price in the 26th year of the Republic of China, and pay 15/1000 of the land price multiplied by 400 times. If it is an inheritance, inheritance tax is often paid. At this time of declining people's livelihood and heavy taxes, if you want to sell, no one will buy it, so it has caused a year-long stagnation. There is no way to break the deadlock.

The construction industry is related to the real estate industry. Since the real estate cannot be active, it affects the construction. In addition, according to the person in charge of the association, there are three main reasons: (1) The industrial and commercial sectors are declining, and they are unable to build large-scale high-rise buildings and larger factories. All major projects rely solely on a part of the government's infrastructure construction, such as repairing roads and building and repairing airfields. (2) If the owner of the contracted project is a private enterprise, such as the owner going bankrupt in the middle due to business losses, the contracted construction company will definitely be implicated. (3) Under the circumstances of constant fluctuations in prices and workers' living standards, it is not easy to contract for construction or labor. If the estimated price is too high, no one will be interested; if the estimated price is too low, it will be a loss. More often, the correct price has been estimated to the owner and a contract has been signed. After the start of construction, prices suddenly rise, or workers request to change their wages, which will undoubtedly be a loss. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the situation where it is not easy to find customers, and it is even more difficult to contract. According to statistics, only Baohua Construction Company, Tao Guiji Construction Factory, and Chengtai Construction Company can maintain. 60% to 70% of the entire industry is already difficult to support.

Talking About the Cigarette Industry - Drawing Inferences

In terms of industry this year, except for the cotton textile industry, all have the feeling of being difficult to maintain. Due to time constraints, the reporter was unable to interview the industry associations of various industries, but the general situation of the serious industries in this city can be seen from the various industries such as cigarette making, leather making, and knitting that were visited. In the second half of the year, the cigarette industry suffered from high-interest loans and sluggish business. Several companies even went bankrupt. According to Dai Gengxin, Chairman of the Cigarette Industry Association, and Zhao Erchang, Secretary of the Association, the biggest difficulties currently faced by the industry include four major points: (1) Lack of raw material sources, (2) Exploitation of high-interest loans, (3) High taxes, (4) Labor unrest. Recently, it has been learned that the government will adjust the tax amount due to the rise in cigarette prices. The cigarette industry really cannot afford it, so it was decided to send Bao Gengsheng (Lixing Cigarette Factory), Shen Kunshan (Yizhong Cigarette Factory), Jin Yigeng (Huamei Cigarette Factory), Li Zitang (Guohua Cigarette Factory), Zhang Yuwen (Greater Southeast), and Guo Keyong (Nanyang Cigarette Factory) to Beijing by overnight train on the 27th to help the Tax Affairs Administration to appeal, requesting a temporary exemption from adjusting the tax consideration. At the same time, a temporary meeting of all members was convened at 3 pm on the 26th to discuss the workers' year-end bonus, which will be one month's salary per person to show encouragement, and to take unified action, and no arbitrary additions or subtractions are allowed.

Leather and Knitting Both Without Improvement

According to Zhang Shanzhang, Chairman of the Leather Industry Association, the leather industry has not improved after the war. The main reason is that foreign goods are flooding the market and dumping at low prices, which has caused a major blow to the domestic leather industry. Secondly, the wages are too high, which affects the production cost, and some have closed down because they cannot afford it. Furthermore, the tax rate set by the government is too high, which makes production and sales difficult, and the cost is heavy. The more than 300 leather industries under the exploitation of high-interest loans feel even more breathless; therefore, they hope that the government will implement three points: (1) Reduce the tax rate to the same tax as people's livelihood products and the cotton textile industry; (2) Please issue low-interest loans; (3) Prohibit the import of foreign soles and increase the import tax rate on foreign leather.

The knitting industry includes three types: silk stockings, underwear, and clothing. The general business has not improved. According to the person in charge of the association, especially the factories that accumulate silk and rayon are even more miserable due to the dumping of glass stockings, which has led to many closures. As for the reasons for the blow to the entire knitting industry, it is also nothing more than high-interest exploitation, too high costs, foreign dumping, and weak purchasing power. At the same time, the restriction of electricity and the source of raw materials are also extremely difficult. During the Lunar New Year, most people feel difficult to make ends meet. However, they are all willing to do their best to support so as not to affect the social economy and production industry. They all hope that the government will provide low-interest loans. However, there has been no news of industrial and commercial loans being granted to the knitting industry. At the same time, the industry also hopes that the authorities can allocate raw materials and abolish electricity restrictions to increase production."

### China's Wartime Losses Estimated at Over 50 Billion US Dollars

[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that the total direct losses suffered by China during the war are estimated to be worth 30 billion US dollars, and the total indirect losses are estimated to be worth 20 billion US dollars. The total losses suffered by industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises are estimated to be worth 4 billion US dollars. The government will recently send personnel to Japan to dismantle some industrial equipment as part of Japan's war reparations to China.

### Bankruptcies Plague Hankou: 1,200 Stores Closed in the Past Month

As the end of the year approaches, the wind of financial and industrial bankruptcies in Hankou is getting worse. According to the Hankou Municipal Government, from the beginning of last month to mid-December, a total of 1,262 stores closed in Hankou, with a total loss of 3.1976 billion yuan. This includes 10 banks and silver shops, 4 oil and salt shops, 7 clothing and fabric shops, 13 grain shops, 22 hardware and grocery shops, 29 restaurants, 6 gold and silver shops, 11 construction companies, 12 hotels and freight forwarding companies, 10 cigarette shops, 3 fuel shops, 3 barber shops, 2 watch shops, 2 seafood shops, 8 daily necessities shops, 1 stationery shop, 1 paint shop, and 18 other shops.

### Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises Revalue Fixed Assets: Method to Adjust Capital: New Capital Cannot Be Added If Old Capital is Not Adjusted

[Our Newspaper News] Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, specially hosted the local news media at the conference room of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday to announce the "Method for Revaluing Fixed Assets and Adjusting Capital of Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises", which was recently passed by the Standing Committee of the National Defense Supreme Committee, consisting of ten items, and added a report, stating: Regarding the methods for assisting production enterprises, the relevant government authorities have recently studied many plans under the leadership of President Song. However, it is found that the general concept of assisting production enterprises in all sectors is nothing more than borrowing loans from the government. However, the accumulated loans have caused the government to suffer unbearable burdens, and industrial and commercial businesses are just like drinking poison to quench their thirst, which is by no means a thorough solution. Therefore, the Ministry has repeatedly discussed how to concentrate market idle funds into the production industry. The reason why idle funds are unwilling to concentrate in the production industry is that the poor conditions of the production industry are one of the reasons. However, if the old capital is not adjusted, the new capital will not be added. The National Defense Supreme Committee has taken this into consideration, and then passed this method, which will be implemented immediately. It is found that this method was already considered in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War. If the capital before the war is not revalued, the following drawbacks will occur: (1) The accounts cannot be accurate. (2) Depreciation cannot be made. (3) The capital cannot be increased, which will only increase the tax burden, and there is a drawback of virtual profit and real tax. Therefore, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the production industry in the rear requested the government to allow the fixed assets to be revalued. However, considering the identity of the general civil servants and the government's tax revenue, it did not work out in the end. Now that the domestic currency value has not stabilized after the victory, it has been decided to re-determine the method of government valuation.

Mr. Pan continued to explain the main points of the method. The scope is temporarily limited to industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. As for finance and commerce, they are not included. The government has two concerns: (1) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Accounting believe that the recent issue of bank deposits and creditors requesting to be repaid twice the amount of deposits before the war has not yet been resolved. Now, if the financial industry is rashly allowed to revalue, it will implicitly support the creditors' position. (2) According to the provisions of Article 7 of the method, it can invisibly force a large amount of cash idle funds in the society to invest in the production industry so as to enrich the foundation of the enterprise itself. However, the government will never expect idle funds to concentrate in the commercial sector, so as not to encourage speculation and manipulation.

As for the multiple of increasing capital, it is now decided to use half of the national wholesale price index compiled by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the 35th year of the Republic of China as the criterion for calculation. According to Mr. Pan's estimate, the index in the 35th year of the Republic of China is 3,500 times, and half of it is 1,750 times. This is the highest amount for calculation. If it is not easy to raise new shares as a result, the multiple can still be reduced automatically. However, some people think that the multiple is too small. However, Mr. Pan believes that if the valuation is too high, it will easily lead to danger when prices stabilize in the future.

As for production enterprises other than industrial, mining, and transportation, such as fishery and agriculture, they can apply the provisions of Article 10 of the method. However, another feature of this method is that the Ministry of Finance previously believed that the increase in assets was an investment gain and should be taxed in accordance with the law. Now, it is stipulated that the asset value increased by revaluing fixed assets in accordance with this method is specially allowed not to be considered as an income gain and is exempt from income tax and excessive profit tax. Now this set of valuation and capital increase regulations is limited to one time. In the future, it is hoped that the currency value will tend to stabilize, so that there will be no more changes. As to whether the production industry will be saved as a result of the implementation of this method, it still depends on the success or failure of the cooperation of other factors, and it cannot be relied on solely on this method. The full text of the ten articles of the method is recorded as follows:

(1) When an industrial, mining, or transportation enterprise has one of the following circumstances, it may revalue its original fixed assets to adjust its capital amount.

1. When the original capital is insufficient for operation and turnover due to the impact of prices, and new shares need to be raised.

2. When expanding the business and raising new shares are required.

3. When merging with other organizations and readjusting capital is required. The revaluation and capital increase in the preceding paragraph is limited to one time and must be completed within the 36th year of the Republic of China.

(2) The industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises stipulated in the preceding article are limited to those that have been registered with the competent authority.

(3) The various fixed assets of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, except for land, shall be based on their original purchase price, minus the residual value obtained by depreciation and loss up to the 34th year.

The maximum limit of the revaluation price is obtained by multiplying the remaining price in the preceding paragraph by half the multiple of the national wholesale price index in the 35th year and the index for the same year of purchase. The calculation formula is as follows: current price.

(4) In accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 2, the national average price index for each year to be applied shall be compiled jointly by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance based on the statistical data published by the government, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation.

(5) All land owned by industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises shall be revalued according to the value estimated by the local land administration agency.

(6) The amount by which the fixed assets are revalued in accordance with Article 3 and the preceding article shall be transferred to the capital of each enterprise, and distributed to each shareholder in proportion to the original amount of its capital, and shall not be converted into cash for distribution.

(7) When industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises that revalue fixed assets and adjust the original amount of capital increase capital in accordance with this method, they shall raise new cash shares separately for at least one-fifth of the total amount of the increased value.

(8) Industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises that revalue fixed assets and adjust the original amount of capital shall, by their partners, shareholders, or directors who perform their duties, request the consent of other partners or shareholders in accordance with the law, or request their shareholders' meeting to make a resolution to increase capital in accordance with the law, and prepare the following documents and submit them to the competent authority for approval.

1. A copy of the original registration items.

2. A plan to revalue fixed assets and adjust capital. 3. A certificate of consent from partners or shareholders or minutes of the shareholders' meeting. 4. A balance sheet certified by an accountant, and a balance sheet after revaluing fixed assets and increasing capital.

If the industrial, mining, and transportation enterprise is solely owned, the application in the preceding two paragraphs shall be made by its capital owner. Regarding the application in the preceding two paragraphs, the competent authority is the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the case of a company, and the competent bureau of the municipal or county government in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship.

(9) After the capital adjustment of the industrial, mining, and transportation enterprise is approved, it shall still apply to the competent authority for a change of registration and reissue of the registration documents in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Registration Law or the Company Law and other relevant laws and regulations.

(10) If production enterprises other than industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises need to revalue fixed assets and adjust capital, they shall apply mutatis mutandis to the provisions of this method after being approved by the competent authority.

### Ninety Minutes Without a Goal - Youyou Draws with Qingbai Again

Youyou Defends Strenuously While Qingbai Attacks Ineffectively

In the Jia Group match of the League, Qingbai met Youyou again, facing off yesterday afternoon at the Yiyuan. Although the weather was cold, the sun shone brightly, so more than 6,000 spectators attended, making the atmosphere enthusiastic. The two teams drew 1-1 in the first round. Although Qingbai no longer has much hope for the championship, they made every effort to defeat Youyou in order to maintain their reputation, but the result was still not as desired. Instead, the two teams shook hands with a score of 0-0. Li Yichen missed a penalty kick in the first half, which was an unfavorable omen. Although Youyou had no hope of winning, they were fortunate to have forced a draw last time. They also had confidence in not losing in yesterday's match, and their ideal was realized, so Youyou can be satisfied.

Li Yichen Misses a Penalty Kick

The match was refereed by Jiang Yin-seng, and both sides lacked brilliant performances. Qingbai's Qu Yongfu and Xiao Luo have not returned from Hong Kong, and A'Gui was absent. The new players filling in on both wings were virtually useless. Fortunately, the defense was solid, so they remained impeccable. Youyou knew it would not be easy to attack the enemy's headquarters directly, so they defended more than they attacked. The 90 minutes passed in a chaotic situation, with each side attacking and defending without any success. In the first half, Qingbai's attack was fierce, and Lazy Cow knocked on the door several times, but they all went out of bounds. Youyou's Lati performed brilliantly. In the 33rd minute, Wang Nanzhen fouled in the penalty area. Referee Jiang Yin-seng awarded a penalty kick. Li Yichen took the kick with great force, but it was saved by Lati. This missed goal dampened Qingbai's spirit, and Youyou became more rampant, but they also failed to achieve anything. The first half ended 0-0, with neither side scoring.

Youyou Concentrates on Defending Vigorously

In the second half, Youyou's lineup remained the same. Qingbai made major changes to the front line. Xiao Jiang Jing Lin-gui changed to playing center forward, Li Yichen played as left winger, Song Ling-sheng played as right inside forward, Xiao Gu played as right winger, and Fei Chunhua replaced Chen Wei-zhi. However, after these adjustments, there was still no improvement. Youyou concentrated on defending vigorously. Qingbai had four decisive corner kicks, but they also achieved nothing. Midway through the second half, Li Yichen unintentionally kicked Lati in the abdomen, causing a momentary uproar among the spectators. Fortunately, Lati recovered quickly, and the fans were relieved. After the two teams entered the second half, they acted cautiously, so no further incidents occurred. The match ended with a pair of zeros in a relaxed atmosphere of back-and-forth play. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Qingbai

Qin Bi-gao

Yan Shi-xin Wu Qi-xiang

Gao Bao-zheng Meng Yi-liang Zhang Feng-gang

Fei Chun-hua Chen Wei-zhi Song Ling-sheng Li Yi-chen Gu Yi-che Jing Lin-gui

Youyou

Lati

Professor Hayes, a professor of marine geography at Princeton University, said that the depth of the western Pacific Ocean is greater than previously imagined. Detailed measurements of the western Pacific during the war revealed many other facts. A new seabed map is being drawn.

### A Tour of the Huainan Coal Mines

— Wuhu, 20th News, Our Special Correspondent Kang Feng

These two places: Datong and Jiulonggang, if you have visited the Huainan coal mining area, you will know that these are two glittering gems.

Datong Coal Mine started growing in the third year of the Republic of China. More than 20 mines were excavated, but no coal was found. The funds were exhausted, and even the food for dozens of workers could not be provided. The founder, Xia Lüping, had operated coal mines in Qinhuangdao, Liujiang, and other places. He was convinced that coal could be mined in Datong. He sold a steel cable (worth several thousand yuan) to support the workers' food and make a final gamble. Finally, with the support of the food maintained by the proceeds of the sale of the steel cable, they found a coal seam. Datong Coal Mine Company raised capital funds (2 million yuan), and the funds promoted production. Datong coal production began the history of Huainan coal mines, reaching a peak output of 1,800 tons per day before the War of Resistance against Japan.

Datong and Jiulonggang

In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau began mining the coal seam in Jiulonggang, five kilometers east of Datong. Hu Weizhong (the police chief at the time, and now the deputy director of the Huainan Railway Bureau) said, "When we arrived at Jiulonggang, there were only six households in this place, and five and a half of them were bandits."

This desolate village developed into a small town of 30,000 people in the 26th year of the Republic of China. In addition, there were also new villages for miners, workshops, etc. The peak of Huainan coal production reached 2,700 tons per day.

In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the Japanese invaders approached, Deputy Director Hu Weizhong was responsible for the final destruction of the mine and roads. The railway was destroyed section by section from Yuxikou to Tianjia'an (Yuxikou is the terminal of the Huainan Railway, diagonally across the Yangtze River from Wuhu; Tianjia'an is on the south bank of the Huai River and is the starting point). He sighed and left. Hu Weizhong, who resembled Feng Yuxiang and spoke with a similar accent, finally returned with the reception of this destroyed railway after eight years in the rear.

During the eight years of occupation, the Japanese changed the route of the Huainan Railway and placed the Datong and Huainan mines under the management of their navy. In order to save gasoline, which was in short supply, for supplying fuel to the Japanese navy, these technicians from Kyushu Imperial University in Japan used methods like killing the goose to get the eggs, ravaging the mines. In order to increase production, they abandoned many coal pits after mining them poorly and opened new pits for wasteful mining. Even so, the highest daily production of the Japanese in eight years never exceeded 3,800 tons (less than the daily output of 4,500 tons from the two mines in the 26th year of the Republic of China). Naturally, the coal mined by the Japanese in eight years strangled countless Chinese soldiers and civilians. This coal powered the Jinpu Railway to transport troops to suppress the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. This coal powered the Japanese navy's coal-fired ships to plunder and kill our soldiers and civilians in the Yangtze River and along the coast, and to transport the captured war materials. The total amount of this coal was 7 million tons. The Japanese are beginning to repay this debt, but so far only 200,000 pit props have been delivered from Japan. The Japanese must compensate for their plunder!

(II) Receiving with Four National Flags

Engineer Zhang Youxian followed the reception route of September 34th of the Republic of China from Chongqing, Zhijiang to Nanjing, and then transferred to Bengbu, arriving at the Huainan coal mine managed by the Japanese Navy in Jiulonggang. He only brought a few assistants, and he carried four national flags.

He thought that the first important thing in Daodifang was to tear down the Japanese flag and replace it with the national flag that had not been seen for eight years. Little did he know that when he arrived at the mine and looked up, the Chinese flag was flying in the sky, higher than the gallows (not the execution tool for killing people, but the one used to hang coal carts in the mine shaft). The Japanese's obedience made Zhang Youxian even more careful, fearing that there was a poison hidden in the sugar coat to destroy the mine!

Zhang Youxian had been a diligent mine engineer in Chongqing and Guizhou for eight years. Prolonged hard work and poor nutrition in the rear almost destroyed this old youth who had been engaged in mining for 20 years. Therefore, when he arrived in Huainan to take over, he was a little sensitive. When he arrived at the mine, he had few people, and the mine area was nearly 20 kilometers in diameter. He could not manage all the mine shafts, machinery and equipment, so he put two telephones by the head of his bed and a truck at the door to control the overall situation. One of the two telephones connected to the Tianjia'an Power Plant. He could not allow any problems at the power plant. If the power plant broke down, the water pumps in the mine would stop working, and the mine water would flood the mine. The other telephone connected to the Datong Mine. He had to control this largest producing mine area and pay attention to its survival at all times.

Soon, Deputy Director Xie Fangan arrived, and Zhang Youxian's hard work was partially transferred to this chubby northerner. However, the chubby deputy director's blood pressure rose rapidly due to the mine's takeover and management, from 140, 150 to 180. This middle-aged man in his fifties fought against cold calculations and open shots from all sides to protect the Huainan industry. Their wit and means naturally achieved safe results. It was not until January of this year that the mine's manpower gradually supplemented and was equipped and used satisfactorily. It was not until April 20 that the last two Japanese technicians left.

In addition to the coal areas and tunnels that were dug out, the original appearance of the mine was not damaged at all thanks to the strict supervision of these two supervisors against the Japanese and the expected hands of the puppet army. However, the production of huge amounts of coal only started this year with the gradual increase in manpower, because what the Japanese left behind was a barren wasteland where everything had to be started from scratch!

### Visiting the Tianjia'an Power Plant

If the Huainan Mine Road system is called an industrial giant, the Huainan Power Plant located in Tianjia'an on the south bank of the Huai River can be compared to the brain or heart of this giant. Early this morning, I was led to see the power plant. There is currently a motor in this power plant that is roaring and turning. Steel barbed wire surrounds this two-story building made of cement and steel bones that houses the motor. Upstairs are the generator room and the distribution panel room. Downstairs are the coal loading machine, boiler, electric pump, water pump, etc. This generator consumes 60 tons of black rice (coal) every day (24 hours), which is mined with the help of its power, and then generates 2,000 kilowatts of electricity, which is transmitted through high-voltage wires with a diameter of one inch to any place in the mine road area that needs electricity.

Although this power plant is loud, there are only a few people working inside. The entire plant has only 200 people, including the small workers. Li Rongbao, the head of the electrical department, sits in the distribution panel room upstairs every day. This thin and tall head of the power plant was originally a power plant technician. Twenty years of practical work and the theoretical knowledge he acquired through self-study made him more than qualified to be the director of a power plant today.

A new motor has already been transported to the open space downstairs in the power plant. This motor can also generate 2,000 kilowatts of electricity. It was originally promised to be sold to the Dujiang Power Plant in Guanxian County, Sichuan by an American company. However, because the Huainan Coal Mine has performed so well this year in urgently supplying the light needed in Beijing and Shanghai, the Executive Yuan gave it priority as a reward for this mining area. In fact, this motor still requires a huge investment. The person who accompanied me said that it was 27 priorities, which of course had to be deducted from the coal price provided by this mining area in the future. From all sides, I heard that the motor originally allocated to the Dujiang Power Plant was transported to the Huainan Coal Mine, which caused a big quarrel. The people in the Huainan Mine thought that the central government would probably not be biased in these matters, and that quarreling would be useless. After this new motor is installed, it will naturally increase the production of Huainan coal. When winter strikes the rich Yangtze River Delta, the day and night power generation of the Huainan Power Plant will not only illuminate the dark mining area, but also transmit heat to the beautiful Jiangnan. This power plant did not exist before the war. There is no need to boast about the achievements of the Japanese. What the Japanese did in China was nothing but a cruel exploitation of the universal strength of the people to accumulate capital for military industry. Needless to say, it is not the achievements of the Japanese that can be boasted, but the things forged from the cream and blood of the Chinese people.

I looked at the old power plant built before the war. The electricians were repairing the turbine. The water rust in the iron sheets almost blocked the impeller with a one-inch gap. The Japanese only knew how to use the machines as much as possible without checking and repairing them, reflecting their psychological lack of future and the secret of brutally using material resources. In fact, this old motor should also be discarded, but it is not easy to develop the industrialization of our China universally for a while, so this old power plant still has to be repaired for power supply. Engineer Zhang Youxian told me that in addition to the power that this power plant can generate 1,600 kilowatts, the old Datong Power Plant can also generate 1,000 kilowatts, and the Huainan Mine's abandoned 345 kilowatts of power generation and the transfer of the Gaoping Coal Mine are still very grateful to others. Only the people in the handicraft mines know the effectiveness of the machinery and equipment under emergency needs, and those who are isolated from these things know where to look for the thirst of the ship fully loaded with sails for the wind.

### A Glimpse of the Coal Mine Shaft

The Huainan Coal Mine currently has three locations: the East Mine, the West Mine, and the Branch Mine. The East Mine is the location of the former Huainan Coal Mine Company's mines, the West Mine is the location of the former Datong Coal Mine Company's mines, and the Branch Mine is located near the West Mine. A person from the mine area described the coal seam in the mine area as being like a crucian carp. The old Huainan Mine (East Mine) in Jiulonggang is the head of the fish, the old Datong Company Mine (that is, today's West Mine) is the back of the fish, and the tail of the fish is the Dongshan Mine that is now closed.

Except for the closed Dongshan Mine, which I did not visit, I followed Engineer Zhang Youxian to visit the East Mine, the West Mine, and the West Branch Mine. Although I had seen the Anyuan Coal Mine in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, and the Huagushan Coal Mine in Xinyu County earlier, I was still as terrified as a student entering school who was reading "The Primer of Classic," and I was too embarrassed to ask questions in front of this old mining master.

At the No. 2 shaft of the West Mine, I stared at the steel cables flowing up and down. The No. 2 shaft is 180 meters deep. One steel cable drops an empty coal car, and the other lifts a coal car full of coal. The time taken is 30 seconds. Working non-stop all day can hoist out 2,884 coal cars. Each military coal weighs 0.53 tons, totaling 1,500 tons of coal. This is the maximum limit for coal output at the No. 2 shaft. Due to the complexity of the work underground, although three shifts of workers go down the shaft to engage in coal mining, the amount of coal hoisted out of the shaft in one shift is between 400 and 600 cars. The total daily output of this shaft is 700 tons. After the coal car is hoisted out of this shaft, the coal loading car is immediately pushed out of the hoist basket, and an empty car is immediately pushed into the hoist basket to fill the empty space and dropped into the shaft to load coal. The coal car pushed out of the hoist basket is pushed by two workers on a small track, sliding to a flip cage 50 feet away. The turning force of the flip cage turns the coal car over and drops the coal onto the conveyor belt in the stacking room downstairs. The conveyor belt is made of wide leather and runs non-stop. The coal is sent to the separation cage through the conveyor belt to separate the coal lumps and coal fines. When the coal lumps are being transported, there are also workers sitting next to them all day to pick out the rotten wood blocks and stones in them, and then reach a large storage area, which is injected into the coal loading train carriages through a funnel and transported to the places where coal is needed.

Naturally, I regret that I have not been able to go down the mine to see the coal mining labor at the bottom of the pit. Just being next to the shaft, with coal fines flying in the sunlight, makes breathing heavy. Doing a shift of hard work underground will almost leave a lot of coal particles in the lungs. Therefore, the physical pain of the miners can be said to be the most severe type of human labor. In the Huagushan mine in Xinyu, I imitated the labor of the miners, carrying a basket rope basket filled with 30 pounds of coal on my shoulders and neck, climbing from the three-foot-high tunnel at the coal mining site to the elevator next to the coal hoisting machine. That basket of coal was dragged along by me, a beast-like crawler. The tunnel was dark, and a firefly-like mine lamp on my neck illuminated the tunnel. There were no demonic images in Dante's Purgatory. The air in the pit was like a narrow cave filled with a smoking coal stove. Occasionally, I would encounter another beast pulling coal crawling head-on. The naked skeleton covered with a layer of skin added to your feeling of being in hell. This is the painful labor that provides light and warmth for others. I have not been down to any mine in Huainan, but I know that these miners will not be much more comfortable than the people in the Huagushan mine in Xinyu. Of course, the engineers and assistants in the Huainan mine are also suffering from the pain of being corroded by the hard work under the strata, just like the officers who lead the troops are suffering from the hardships of the battlefield. The engineer Zhang Youxian, who accompanied me, used to go down the shaft and come up again to rescue the accumulated water in the shaft or the fire. Therefore, he often used a razor blade to cut open his riding boots when he came up. Because the immersion in water had long swollen the legs of this underground worker so that he could not pull down the leather tube of his riding boots that was tightly embedded in the flesh, and he had to cut it open to remove it. At present, because the power supply is uninterrupted, the accumulated water in the shaft can be extracted in time without any problems, so there have been no incidents of drowning. There have also been no incidents of fire or gas explosions in the shaft that have burned people. However, there are often people who are suffocated by the strong gas. On November 11, more than 20 workers were intoxicated by gas in the shaft. They were carried out and rescued without dying. Immediately, a 600-meter iron pipe of a coal stove chimney used for office heating was moved to this tunnel full of gas to send in fresh air and discharge the gas.

In a mine lamp room, I saw that the organization of this mine was a bit like a military camp. Every mine worker had to wear a small mine lamp attached to his hat in places where the electricity could not reach. This mine lamp was powered by a dry battery. This lamp room had a total of 1,600 mine lamps, which were arranged very neatly and continuously charged to supply the next shift of workers to pick up before going down the shaft.

The Huainan Coal Mine is a fairly mechanized industrial system due to the use of equipment and electricity to assist. However, because its coal system strata are steep slopes that are straight down at 80 degrees or more, the mine shafts are straight down and cannot be like the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which has flat tunnels. Therefore, underground coal mining sites and shaft traffic cannot use electric trams like the Pingxiang Coal Mine. Therefore, in terms of the total production cost, although the current Huainan coal production has advanced from 20 workers per ton (the productivity during the Japanese occupation) to today's five people producing one ton of coal (the output of the No. 3 shaft), it is still far from the level of one person producing one ton of coal in the Huainan Datong era before the war (the current working level of American miners is 40 tons per day per person. American coal production is so abundant, and the number of miners is only 400,000, of course, the high degree of mechanization of American mines is the main reason.)

The new port of Taitung is a famous fishing port, with abundant fishing grounds and aquatic product processing facilities. The future development of this area is worth looking forward to. (Sent by Jiang Muyun, special correspondent of this newspaper)

In Shanhua Town, Tainan County, a farmer's ewe gave birth to a lamb a month ago, with a head that was no different from a human head. According to medical speculation, it may have been caused by intercourse between a human and a sheep. This thing is now preserved in the laboratory of the Tainan Wanzi Sugar Factory.

### The Progress of China's Meteorological Undertakings

— Lu Wenfu

Meteorology is a branch of applied science, and meteorological undertakings are important cornerstones for national defense and the construction of people's livelihoods. Before the Republic of China, China's meteorological undertakings were entirely in the hands of foreigners, who overstepped their bounds, which is shameful to say. The earliest establishment of an observatory was actually the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, established by Jesuit missionaries (1873), while the Hong Kong and Qingdao observatories were founded during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the declining Qing Dynasty. These were managed by the British and German governments. After the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese widely established meteorological stations in southern Manchuria and the Yangtze River basin, while the Russians did so in Outer Mongolia and northern Manchuria. In remote areas, such as Yunnan and Tibet, the French and British also had meteorological facilities. Even the customs meteorological stations along the Yangtze River and the coast were established on the recommendation of the British man, Hart. It can be seen from this that officials and people at that time disregarded science and technology.

At the beginning of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education of the former Beijing government established the Central Observatory. In the second year of the Republic, a meteorological section was established, marking the beginning of China's self-run meteorological undertakings. Initially, observations were limited to Beijing, but later, branch meteorological stations were added in Kulun, Zhangbei, Kaifeng, and Xi'an. However, due to financial constraints, the branch stations were successively shut down by the 13th year of the Republic of China, and the Central Observatory itself was also on its last breath. At that time, the work of the observatory and its branches was limited to surface observations. Although weather forecasting had attempted to draw weather maps, it was difficult to achieve accuracy due to the small number of stations, and it never escaped the experimental stage.

In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. The Meteorological Research Institute was established, directly under the Academia Sinica. Under the leadership of the Institute's director, Zhu Kezhen, China's meteorological undertakings began to make substantial progress. In addition to establishing its own meteorological stations in Jiuquan, Guiyang, Shanghai, Ningxia, Baotou, Lhasa, Beijing, Zhengzhou, Wuchang, Xi'an, Taishan, and Mount Emei, the Institute also provided instruments, trained personnel, and assisted various parties in establishing meteorological stations. At the same time, provinces, cities, and institutions involved in aviation, water conservancy, and education also gradually paid attention to this and decided to establish meteorological observatories and meteorological stations to meet their own needs. By the 25th year of the Republic of China, the number of meteorological stations across the country had reached more than 300. Technically, they all accepted the guidance of the Meteorological Research Institute. The scope of observation was not limited to the surface but extended to high altitudes. Wind-measuring balloons were launched daily in Beijing, Nanjing, Xi'an, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and other places. In Beijing, Nanjing, and Hong Kong, high-altitude meteorological observations were also conducted regularly using kites, airplanes, and sounding balloons. As surface and high-altitude observations became increasingly complete and the number of researchers increased daily, the effectiveness of weather forecasting greatly improved, and the true picture of the climate in various places gradually became clear. This was of great benefit to the improvement of aviation and navigation safety and the design of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and it was not only for academic research.

Since the invasion of the Japanese pirates and the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the southeast half of the country has been lost, and the hard work of the past has been reduced to ashes. The Meteorological Research Institute moved to Sichuan. Due to insufficient funds, it could not promote meteorological undertakings. However, due to the needs of the times, the Executive Yuan established the Central Meteorological Bureau in the 30th year of the Republic of China. Since then, meteorological undertakings have been in the hands of a dedicated agency. Under the leadership of the Bureau, the meteorological observation networks in the southwest and northwest were completed, and the Meteorological Research Institute was able to devote all its efforts to theoretical research. However, at that time, maritime transport was not open, and equipment was inevitably simple and crude, and it was difficult to be satisfactory. After the victory, the Central Meteorological Bureau officials returned to the capital and immediately worked hard to take over the meteorological stations of the enemy and puppets and plan the revival of meteorological undertakings. They also drafted a five-year meteorological plan in order to complete it year by year. The main points of the plan are three: (1) To build a national meteorological observation network, setting up 32 first-class meteorological observatories, 119 second-class meteorological observatories, and 355 third-class meteorological observatories, divided into 11 districts. All meteorological stations are equipped with radio equipment. In addition to regularly observing surface and high-altitude meteorology, the district central meteorological observatories also collect records from various stations daily and issue weather reports. (2) To cultivate meteorological talents and establish a meteorological specialized school. (3) To replenish instrument equipment and establish an instrument factory to manufacture various meteorological instruments. At present, the Bureau directly manages meteorological observatories and stations, including seven first-class meteorological observatories or meteorological stations in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Dinghai, Suzhou, and Mount Wuyi; forty second-class meteorological observatories in Meitan, Chongqing, Kangding, Changsha, Yuanling, Chaling, Changde, Dali, Nanzheng, Yangquan, Taiyuan, Tanggu, Zhongning, Tianjin, Nanning, Shibei, Songpan, Guangyuan, Yulin, Xichang, Ya'an, Qilian Mountain, Nanchong, Pengshui, Youyang, Leibo, Daxian, Fengjie, Lijiang, Yuxi, Zhenyuan, Xingren, Weining, Tongren, Anshun, Luodian, Shangxian, Mount Hua, Sanjiang, Fulin, etc.; and four third-class meteorological observatories in Xining, Dulan, Anxi, and Lhasa, totaling 51 stations. All conduct surface observations at regular intervals, 24 times a day for first-class stations, 6 to 8 times for second-class stations, and 3 times for third-class stations. In addition, there are 19 first-class meteorological observatories, 54 second-class meteorological observatories, and 21 third-class meteorological observatories in various provinces and cities. In the past, although the technical aspects were all guided by the Central Meteorological Bureau, due to the inconsistency of systems and repeated overlapping, the equipment varied in quality. There is now a proposal to have the Bureau take over and manage them in a unified manner. However, when the Bureau itself was established, it was constrained by the wartime environment, its organization was small, and its budget was limited. If it wants to develop, it still needs the attention and improvement of the government. The business of the Central Meteorological Bureau can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Managing meteorological observatories and stations at all levels across the country. (2) Collecting and organizing meteorological records across the country. (3) Issuing weather reports, and the latter is the most concerning to the general public. At present, the Nanjing Bureau and its affiliated Shanghai and Beijing meteorological observatories collect meteorological telegrams from home and abroad in East Asia every day at regular intervals, draw weather maps and high-altitude charts, and formulate weather forecasts and various warnings based on them, which are submitted to newspapers and news agencies for publication, and broadcast by radio stations, coastal radio stations, and its own XQG5 (1/2KW, 8500KC.) radio station once a day for aviation, sea, and coastal fishermen to listen to and use.

The study of meteorology depends on the collection of records from various places. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Central Observatory published a series of observation publications, which were discontinued in the tenth year of the Republic of China. After that, the Meteorological Research Institute also published meteorological yearbooks, monthly journals, and high-altitude observation reports. The results of observations from all over the country were widely collected and carefully selected. The Institute also devoted itself to the整理 of historical records. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, a special publication on rainfall in China was compiled and printed, which recorded 353 stations up to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and was accompanied by maps of annual and monthly rainfall distribution, totaling more than 500 pages, which was magnificent. After the War of Resistance, the "Temperature of China" was also printed, and its content and compilation were the same as the previous book. With the arrival of victory, the Institute also published "Climate Data of China," in three volumes, including the average and extreme values of rainfall, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, etc. before the 30th year of the Republic of China in various places. The content is rich and sufficient for reference. After the establishment of the Central Meteorological Bureau, it also broadly collected records from various places over the years, publishing ten-day periodicals every ten days and annual reports every year. Recently, there has also been a large-scale production of "Atlas of Chinese Climate." The atlas contains 96 distribution maps of air pressure, wind direction, temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, fog, haze, and frost days. The maps are carefully drawn and are essential reference books for those engaged in construction plans such as farmland water conservancy.

The most important domestic purely meteorological publications are the Collected Papers of the Meteorological Research Institute, the Journal of the Chinese Meteorological Society, and the Meteorological Series of the Central Meteorological Bureau. In addition, the geography departments or aviation research institutes of various universities also publish special or collected publications from time to time. The Collected Papers of the Meteorological Research Institute is an international publication, mostly written in English, and has now been published to Volume 13, Number 3. The Journal of Meteorology, formerly known as the Meteorological Magazine, emphasizes both introductions and monographs. All papers are accompanied by English abstracts. Before Volume 10, the publication was an annual publication. Volumes 11 to 13 were monthly publications. After Volume 14, due to printing difficulties, it was changed back to an annual publication, and it has now been published to Volume 18. The Central Meteorological Bureau Series was published in the 34th year of the Republic of China and is irregular. Generally, one volume is published per year, and each volume has four issues. The third issue of the second volume has recently been published. The research on Chinese meteorology, judging from the published papers, is mostly concentrated on the study of weather and climate issues, and there are fewer theoretical aspects. This is probably due to practical needs. In recent years, as meteorological undertakings have developed and meteorological education has greatly improved, the geography departments of various university science colleges are mostly attached to meteorological groups, and the Central University and Tsinghua University have even established meteorological departments, but not many people apply for the exam, and only a few graduates graduate each year, which is far from meeting the needs. It is hoped that domestic youth will be determined to pursue science and devote themselves to this field, so that this undertaking related to national defense and the construction of people's livelihoods can develop rapidly and lay the foundation for the country's lasting prosperity.

### Speaking of Fengqiu with Tears (Part 2)

— Kaifeng, 19th Dispatch from Aviation News, Our Reporter in Bian, Wang Shoumei

Director Chen said: "In his mind, besides the nation, the people, and military plans, there are also the two words 'self-discipline'. In spirit and in material terms, these two words really dominate his thoughts and actions. Therefore, he has never competed with others for fame or fortune, and has never had any misunderstandings with superiors or subordinates. Whether his superiors treat him well or poorly, whether he is rewarded or punished, he accepts it sincerely, obeys absolutely, and will never be dissatisfied or doubt his superiors. Even when he heard the New China Daily editorial of the Communist Party of China speaking out for him, he just smiled it off. He is the same to friendly forces and subordinates. Whether it is slander or misunderstanding, he uses practical actions to answer other people's misunderstandings. His private life is very simple. I know that this winter, because military uniforms were too expensive, he dismantled an old overcoat and remade it into the set of military uniforms he is wearing now. I don't know anything else." Director Chen said while thinking, as if with a bit of shyness.

"Thank you. My interview work with General Sun is over." I thanked him with a smile.

"That won't do. You are doing work unintentionally, and I can't take responsibility!" he said with a smile.

Morning Assembly in the Wind and Snow

On the morning of the 17th, we reporters, who were used to living an upside-down life, exceptionally got up at six o'clock in order to participate in the morning assembly. The weather is unpredictable. Yesterday it was sunny and beautiful, but today it was windy and snowy. Director Chen braved the wind and snow to invite us to the assembly hall. In the blowing wind and snow, we walked to the assembly hall (a vast open space). A thunderous burst of applause sent us to the front of the flagpole. I looked back and saw a dark mass. To the north were the troops, in the middle were civil servants and students, to the south were the people, and behind were the artillerymen about to depart. On the platform stood a chairman, who was the principal of the central school. (The morning assembly—raising the flag—was a joint event held at 7:00 every morning after the Fifth Pacification Zone arrived in Fengqiu, mobilizing people from all walks of life in Fengqiu, including the party, government, military, schools, and the public. The chairman was rotated among the heads of the various provinces.) After the majestic national anthem was sung, everyone saluted, and the bright and beautiful national flag rose into the snowy sky amid the melodious military music.

The invigorating exercises of thousands of people began. This was a vigorous activity that we had never seen in Kaifeng.

"Eliminate bandits!" "Eliminate corruption!" "Develop the economy!" "Pay attention to education!" "Support righteousness!" "Build a new Fengqiu!" Forty minutes later, these slogans ended the morning assembly.

There were photos to be taken here and photos to be taken there. We, who choose the lens every day, have become the lenses of others.

Listening to Military Affairs

At nine o'clock, we arrived at the headquarters of the Fifth Pacification Zone. Commander Sun and Deputy Commander Dong sent us into the reception room. The walls were covered with military maps, with red circles, blue circles, arrows, and small flags, which looked quite fresh and eye-catching. After the host and guests were seated, the taciturn Commander Sun spoke: "If you gentlemen want to understand the current situation in our Pacification Zone, let our Chief of Staff Hu report to you." Then Chief of Staff Hu stood up. He first gave a comprehensive report on the battles that the Fifth Pacification Zone had gone through from Henan to eastern Henan and last month in the Fengqiu, Huaxian, Dongming, Puyang, and Puxian areas. Then he said sadly: "Our headquarters has been fighting bloody battles with the enemy for the past eight or nine years, and then resisting the Communist army in self-defense. Now, we still have to endure the pain of defending against the Communist army for the sake of national unity. All officers and soldiers are very sad. I am absolutely obedient to the Central Government's ceasefire order and will not move. However, the Communist army is always burning with the flames of war and wants to make a comeback at any time. If you look at the current situation, you will know their ambition." As he spoke, he took a long bamboo pole like a teaching whip and walked to the front of the map with a section chief from the Second Department. He began lecturing like a geography teacher: "On the Communist army's side in our Pacification Zone is the Fourth Military District of Liu Bocheng's Jilu-Yu Border Region. In this area, the Communist army has 25 local regiments, stationed in the area of ​​Batouji in Dongming and the area of ​​Baliying in Huaxian. In addition, its main force has seven columns, stationed in the Yanggu and Chaocheng areas, constantly attacking our national army..." As he spoke, he pointed to the map with that slender bamboo pole.

Chief of Staff Hu stood up again and supplemented: "The Communist army will not forget this land. They always want to paint this land red again, but this dream will never be realized because of the terror of the vast number of farmers in the war. In January this year, the Communist army kidnapped more than 90 of their women. They will never forget this bloody debt of shame. Their urgent hope is to live in stability, to seek to restore their former peace and comfort in life, and to seek future progress, and are unwilling to entrust their destiny to the unreachable illusion with the current bloody struggle. Based on this awareness, they believe that it is necessary to strictly organize training in order to cooperate with the national army to ensure the safety of their families. They have suffered enough, but in extreme hardship, they need to organize an armed self-defense force. In response to the needs, the Political Department of our headquarters has divided the eight townships in the county into eight self-defense brigades, 120 self-defense squadrons, and 9,022 self-defense strong men. The cadres at all levels are served by retired military officers. A political instructor is assigned to each township to work with the military training officers sent by the county self-defense corps to conduct district training for two or three hours every day during their spare time. Having been trained for more than two hours, their knowledge and skills in armed protection of their hometown and maintaining local security have been preliminarily established. They can all be competent as "the government's armed force", "the people's protection", and "the national army's helper". We hope that the people on this land will live and work in peace like this, and we hope that you gentlemen will give more guidance so that we can follow!"

Sounding Cries

Commander Sun's banquet lasted for more than an hour. Without delaying, we went to the county government to attend a symposium with local representatives. I took the opportunity to go to the detention center alone to take a look. This detention center was pitifully small, with only five or six rooms (even the county government was pitifully small. It is said that the original county government was torn down by the Japanese and the Communist army, and the current county government was originally a private house.). Divided into two rooms, there were more than 70 prisoners detained, mostly murderers and stray troops. Those prisoners who had rarely been judged and were detained shouted when they saw reporters enter: "Commissioner, please be merciful and give us a judgment quickly!" I couldn't answer them, so I backed out. When I arrived at the conference room, the symposium had already been going on for half a day. County Magistrate Liu had already finished his report, and Provincial Councilor Wang Faping was crying out in pain with tears in his eyes. He said: "Fengqiu was originally a fifth-class county with congenital deficiencies. After more than eight years of devastation and several destructions by the Communist army, the people are impoverished and their resources are exhausted. The local people's strength cannot support the current large army gathering and the huge supply needs. In order to survive, the people need the army to protect them. With the army to protect them, they are unable to survive. They are willing to give everything they have to supply the difficult army, but they have nothing. The burden of various apportionments of 305,275,048 yuan and 1,565,000 catties of grain, as well as 912 sets of cotton clothes and 334 sets of cotton coats, has fallen on the shoulders of the only 130,000 people who remain out of the original population of more than 150,000. The total amount of losses due to various natural and man-made disasters is 16,878,222.025 yuan. This heavy burden figure, placed on the shoulders of a dying patient, is unbearable for them, but most of them are still gritting their teeth and enduring it in the position of military-civilian cooperation and sympathy for the army. They cannot afford to pay for firewood and have already demolished their own houses to use as firewood to send to the army, because the troops in the Fifth Pacification Zone are all very good now. Although the people are suffering, they cannot bear to let the army have no firewood to burn. Some places really can't bear it anymore, so they painfully "hand in their license plates" (hand in their doorplates, and they flee to other places). When they hand in too many, it forms a "collapsed guarantee" (the guarantee becomes empty, just like this guarantee has fallen into a probe). Therefore, you will not see a smiling face in Fengqiu, and you will not hear a singing "road show". Everyone is waiting for relief in the tragic cold, waiting to reduce the burden. Liu, the speaker, and the president of the Chamber of Commerce both had tearful cries that made the reporter unbearable to recall and unwilling to repeat! Again, at 2:00 in the afternoon, we carried the light and blood and tears here, said goodbye to Fengqiu, and returned to Kaifeng.

### Agricultural Improvement Undertakings of the Jiangsu Provincial Government

— Ji Junmian

A Historical Retrospect

Jiangsu Province has a long history of agricultural improvement. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Second Cotton Crop Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce was established, and the provincial forestry farm, mulberry farm, wheat crop experiment station, and miscellaneous grain experiment station were established one after another to lead the improvement of agriculture in Jiangsu Province. Unfortunately, due to the warlords' manipulation of power, the failure of politics to get on the right track, and the impact of financial constraints, it failed to develop. Although scholars and experts such as Zou Bingwen and the late Mr. Zhang Qian advocated it, it was never able to develop.

After the Northern Expedition, the Jiangsu Provincial Government established a Department of Agriculture and Mining, with Director He Yushu, who was very enthusiastic about handling affairs, and hired experts to preside over it, such as cotton expert Sun Yushu and horticulture expert Lu Feishuchen, who had devoted their efforts to the agricultural construction of Jiangsu Province and determined the business of each farm and station and carefully planned its funding.

The provincial fisheries experiment station was also established at this time, and there were fishing boats to demonstrate fishing.

The cultivation of land has always been important in Jiangsu Province, but it has not been paid attention to by the agricultural administrative authorities in the past. After the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, the Cultivation Undertakings Committee was established, and experts and representatives of land reclamation groups were invited to jointly organize it to discuss land reclamation matters. This was the beginning of the provincial administrative organs paying attention to land reclamation undertakings.

On the promotion side, there was a promotion committee to plan the promotion of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, sericulture throughout the province.

Agricultural improvement and promotion, the county-level agencies were originally extremely important, but they have always been ignored. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, the county agricultural farms in Jiangsu Province were universally established, and in the counties with the benefits of fish and salt in the coastal area, fisheries guidance institutes were also established. Funding is the mother of undertakings, and the provincial government also stipulated that an agricultural improvement donation should be levied as funding for county agricultural improvement. There are two other characteristics of this period. One is that the responsible host of the county agricultural farm must pass the examination of the department before he can be appointed, and he can not be easily changed to be able to appoint true talents to make the workers feel at ease. The other is that the administration belongs to the county, and the use of funds is absolutely subject to the supervision of the county, and the implementation of the undertaking is directly subject to the guidance of the county, and only reported to the county for record. The foundation is gradually solid, quite vibrant. The business of the county farm is tailored to local conditions, and divided into the first main business, the second main business, and the sideline business. Promotion is the main thing, and the preservation and breeding of species are secondary. This period can be regarded as the golden age of agricultural improvement in Jiangsu Province being most on the right track.

Department of Construction Improvement of Animal Husbandry and Cotton Seeds

The effectiveness of agricultural improvement cannot be waited for immediately. It must be meticulous and move forward step by step. In the era of the Department of Agriculture and Mining of Jiangsu Province, only the foundation was fixed and the preliminary plan was completed. If given time to advance in an orderly manner, there will be achievements. Unfortunately, not long after, the provincial government partially reorganized, and the Department of Agriculture and Mining was merged into the Department of Construction. The provincial farms were once suspended, and the county farms were changed to agricultural extension centers. A few counties still retained the fisheries department, but it was only a change in name, and the actual situation was empty, not as orderly as in the past. Moreover, there was no seal or bell mark, and the administration could not be promoted at all. It was not like an organ or a group. The agricultural improvement donation was also merged into the construction treasury and became a part of the county's construction funds. It could not be independent, and it was inevitable that there would be difficulties in application. Although Changju hoped very much, it was ultimately because the organization was unsound and lacked a complete plan, it only became the end of a powerful crossbow, and it could hardly maintain the glory of the previous period.

However, during this period, animal husbandry was more advanced than in the previous period. The famous pig and sheep producing areas in Jiangsu Province were selected, and the pig and sheep breeding preservation and animal husbandry experimental areas were jointly established with the Central Breeding Farm to improve pig and sheep breeds. The history is relatively shallow, but it has made many contributions to the prevention and control of animal diseases, and those who raise pigs and sheep have benefited greatly from it. This is one of the characteristics of this period. The fisheries departments of various counties (it seems that there is no longer the name of fisheries guidance institute, only attached to the agricultural extension center) have successively tried to start with practical demonstrations, building ships and buying nets, in order to carry out fishing and hope to be self-sufficient, not relying on the support of public funds. This is the second characteristic of this period. In terms of cotton industry, in addition to the original provincial cotton farm, there was also the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office. The former paid attention to experiments, and the latter paid attention to promotion, division of labor and cooperation, and the scope was quite broad. The Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute also cooperated with it, and the effectiveness of the undertaking was still demonstrated. This is the third characteristic of this period.

After the Victory: The People are Looking Forward To

When the Japanese invaders invaded the country, the government moved west, and all agricultural, fishery, and animal husbandry institutions in the province were completely suspended or assisted in matters related to the War of Resistance. Today, one year after the victory, the agricultural institutions in the province have not yet fully returned to their original positions. Although some provincial farms have been formally restored, the funding is so small that the undertaking cannot be launched, making the hosts disheartened and the expectations disappointed. The animal husbandry part is still in the custody period. As for the county-level agencies, there is no need to talk about undertakings. They either work in the county government, or they are established but lack funding and have nothing to do, so they are abolished.

In the eight years since the fall, the countryside has been exploited by the enemy and puppets. It is extremely tragic and painful. Looking at it today, one year after the victory, it is still full of holes and scars. Unless relief and restoration are carried out as soon as possible, it will not be enough to relieve the farmers' difficulties. However, how to get on the right path of relieving difficulties is difficult to achieve without the joint efforts of those responsible for administration and agriculture. - The characteristic systems and undertakings of the past are all the teachers of today, and more importantly, it is to hit the current malpractices and not to engage in empty talk in order to be practical.

### Reasons for Unemployment

— Hao

There are many reasons for unemployment. Scholars have studied and divided them into five categories: accidental, individual, social, political, and economic.

(1) The so-called accidental causes are of two types: natural disasters and man-made disasters. (1) Natural disasters include earthquakes, floods, fires, droughts, and hurricanes. (2) Man-made disasters include international wars and domestic wars.

(2) The so-called individual causes include deficiencies in intelligence, physical strength, and morality, as well as diseases, old age, and special changes in duties, all of which can lead to unemployment for laborers.

(3) The so-called social causes are those where the blame for unemployment is attributed to society. In short, there are approximately six aspects: unequal distribution of wealth, monopolization of land, overpopulation, lack of organization, lack of training, and lack of job placement services. Unequal distribution of wealth weakens the purchasing power of ordinary people, causing capital to stagnate and factories to close down. Monopolization of land allows landlords to manipulate arbitrarily, engaging in unproductive speculation and competition, leaving farmers with no land to cultivate. Moreover, lack of organization leads to misunderstandings between laborers and employers, preventing concrete reconciliation, and workers are unable to take mutual assistance measures. Furthermore, lack of training deprives laborers of opportunities to learn vocational skills, resulting in a lack of precise skills. Even if they勉强engage in work, they inevitably waste materials, produce substandard products, and have limited sales, causing factories to shrink. As a result, laborers are dismissed by employers.

(4) The so-called political causes include the lack of legal protection for laborers and the heavy burden of excessive taxes on industry and commerce.

(5) The so-called economic causes are more complex. Because laborers are originally one of the factors of economic production. Now, list the twelve items as follows: (A) Changes in the economic cycle cause industry and commerce to decline from prosperity, resulting in labor unemployment. (B) The evolution and changes of industry cause old-fashioned workers to become unemployed due to their inability to adapt to new and different machinery. (C) Seasonal industrial laborers become unemployed due to the periodic nature of their work. (D) Industry and commerce lack accurate information, resulting in supply and demand imbalances, business failures, and workers being unemployed. (E) Abuse of the credit system and easy borrowing lead to widespread imitation of even slight profits, resulting in overproduction and labor unemployment. (F) Excessive working hours and unsuitable work cause workers to be overworked, reduce wages, result in poor production, damage business, and cause labor unemployment. (G) Excessive competition among businesses leads to mutual infighting, ultimately resulting in overproduction or collapse, creating unemployment. (H) Children's early employment leads to physical damage, making them unable to work in old age, leading to unemployment. At the same time, healthy adults are crowded out by child labor, leading to unemployment. (J) Lack of raw materials prevents factories from manufacturing, leading to laborers being unable to find work. (I) Currency chaos causes prices to easily rise, and the industrial sector closes factories due to overproduction, causing workers to become unemployed. (K) Excessive speculation causes financial tightening in the market and credit instability, leading to industrial and commercial decline and worker unemployment. (L) The rise of class struggle makes labor and capital prone to disputes or union strikes to pressure factories, or factories close down and dismiss workers, causing workers to have another chance of unemployment.

### Building the Jin'ou Railway

— Nairen

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which connects the most important trunk lines in Southeast and Southwest China, is currently under active construction. The transportation between the Southeast and Southwest regions is expected to be smooth soon.

This reminds us of a railway line that seems to need to be built immediately, namely the Jin'ou Railway proposed by the Jinhua Chamber of Commerce. The construction of this line can be said to have added an important artery to the Southeast region and also be said to have given the most powerful assistance to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Now that Taiwan has been restored to our national territory, we cannot ignore the importance of building this railway line, both in terms of national defense and economy.

Between Jinhua and Oujiang, the original highway was completely demolished during the war. Although part of it has been repaired after the victory, most of it has not been repaired. As for the Oujiang River, it is only navigable by some civilian ships, which is difficult to bear the heavy responsibility in the future.

Starting from Yongjia, passing through Qingtian and Lishui, and reaching Jinhua, it is connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The section from Yongjia to Lishui follows the Oujiang River, and the route seems to have no problems. However, for the section from Lishui to Jinhua, should it pass through Xuanping County, pass through Wuyi to reach Jinhua, or pass through Jinyun and Yongkang to reach Jinhua, it seems that there is still a need for discussion. Because the former has relatively flat terrain, while the original highway passes through Jinyun and Yongkang. As for Yongjia, it can even be extended to Ruian and Pingyang, and even to Fuzhou and Xiamen.

The wealthy Wenzhou was opened as a commercial port in the second year of Guangxu. The Prime Minister designated it as a third-class fishing port in the industrial plan. The industry and commerce are prosperous, the agricultural products are abundant, and the fishery is particularly developed. Other things like Pingyang's alum, Qingtian's 礦minerals, and Wuyi's 戴dai stone are all closely related to agriculture and national defense industries, and all need the construction of this railway to help their development and internal transportation.

Wenzhou is very close to Taiwan, and it can be reached by boat in less than a day. Building the Jin'ou Railway is the best way to connect Taiwan with the mainland, so as to control Taiwan Island and consolidate national defense. At the same time, Taiwanese rice, Taiwanese sugar, camphor, petroleum, etc. can also be transshipped from Wenzhou to Jinhua and sold in various places in the mainland, so that this "Formosa" (meaning beautiful island) can be integrated with the mainland economically, politically and culturally, and will no longer be a special administrative region.

### Improving the Textile Industry

— A Lecture by Rong Dexin, Recorded by You Maoquan

Mr. Rong Dexin, Chief Engineer of Shenxin No. 25 Textile Factory, gave a speech at the Gengchen Alumni Association of the Chinese Textile Society after returning from the United States. The main points are excerpted below. Today, I am very happy to be warmly received by all of you. Now I will talk to you casually.

Obtaining specialized knowledge from school and then going to the factory to do it in practice, you must go through all kinds of difficulties to get the results. This is valuable experience. Therefore, as long as everyone can earnestly devote themselves to hard work, they can get sufficient experience.

Human affairs are complicated and intricate, so dealing with people is much more difficult than dealing with technology. Especially in my country's textile factories, human affairs are even more complicated. Under the same organization, many, many factions will be created, so dealing with people is even more difficult. When we deal with people, we must first determine a handling policy based on the actual situation in all aspects. At the same time, in any environment, the most important thing is to first understand the evolution of the entire environment; second, adapt to the trend of the entire environment. In this situation, carefully deal with the opportunity. After a considerable period of time, can you start the established steps of transforming the environment and implement the improvement plan.

When I was trained at the Central Personnel Training Institute, I respectfully listened to Chairman Chiang explaining that the government's war of resistance was three points military and seven points political. We should observe the international situation and determine the political path. With seven points of sound politics and three points of sound military, we can attack and win, and win every battle. Therefore, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, our country followed the above-mentioned policy to achieve this unprecedented final victory.

Those of us who serve in the textile industry, especially in the current situation of my country's textile factories, should deal with human affairs seven points and technology three points. Although each of us recognizes the importance of industrial construction now, we must understand that construction should start from everyone's psychology and complete "psychological construction." At the same time, no matter how big or small things are, the disposal should have the spirit of "utmost sincerity" and "utmost impartiality." I hope everyone has a common spirit to promote the great future of my country's textile industry.

When I was in the United States, I went to a factory research laboratory to study. There were many experimental instruments that I had never seen in China. From this, I can understand that there is no end to learning and technology. In short, if you don't advance, you will retreat. You should catch up quickly and work hard at the forefront of technology. In addition to working hard in the factory, you should also seek advancement in academic aspects, cultivate your personality and body, and learn in the aspects of dealing with the world.

### Preliminary Discussion on Management

— Xu Baiyi

Various Issues in Personnel Management: Labor Issues

Regarding labor issues, they vary depending on the goods being manufactured. Usually, the more exquisite the goods, the higher the wages paid. In the past, general manufacturers did not pay much attention to labor issues, so workers often changed their workplaces. As long as a factory could pay a higher price, they would go there to work. This situation is actually very inappropriate for manufacturers, because on the one hand, skilled workers, once they leave, will inevitably affect the work, and on the other hand, every factory has some commercial secrets, such as the style of the machines, the installation situation, and the production situation, as well as the work situation, should not be known to the same industry.

Therefore, modern personnel management should be able to achieve the following points:

1. Able to hire appropriate workers, 2. Able to make workers work with peace of mind, 3. Able to increase the service period of workers. Therefore, personnel management has also become a specialized subject. To make the enterprise organization develop, the work in the personnel management part must be sound.

Personnel Management Work and Production Work

There used to be a saying that "doing the purchasing work perfectly is equal to doing half of the sales work." This sentence does contain a great truth, because if the raw materials we use are the best and the price is very fair, then we can make cheap and beautiful goods, which will of course be much more convenient in terms of sales, that is, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. In a manufacturing plant, the purchase of materials needs to be handled shrewdly and reasonably. The employment of labor is in principle equivalent to purchasing a batch of raw materials, because the wages of labor must also be included in the cost of goods, and labor issues are more important than raw materials, because when purchasing raw materials, just look at the samples and carefully check them, and there will be no problems. After employing labor, it is also necessary to supervise them from time to time so that they will not waste time, and to encourage them so that they will have better work performance, because if the workers waste time, it will reduce production efficiency and indirectly affect costs and reduce profits. Therefore, labor issues are closely related to production, and to make production work smoothly and achieve good results, labor issues are indeed worthy of attention.

Personnel Management and Management Section

Since personnel management is very important, the personnel management section cannot be taken care of by a low-level employee. The scope of personnel management is very wide, because in an enterprise organization, in addition to the general manager, manager, and factory director being hired or concurrently held by the board of directors, the rest of the employees need to be hired or employed. Hiring or employment is the first step of personnel management work. If it is presided over by a low-level employee, and the person hired is a higher-level employee than him, then in order to implement all the implementation of personnel management due to the relationship of position, it will be difficult.

Therefore, the person responsible for handling personnel management matters must be an important employee. Previously, we have proposed the method of organizing a personnel management committee, which can really be said to be from a reasonable ideal, because organizing a committee, all department heads can participate, this method can make the actual situation of various aspects can be used as a reference before deciding on a certain measure, and it can be known in advance whether there will be difficulties when implementing it in the future.

This method of personnel management committee can produce the following effects:

1. When formulating various rules and regulations, you can get opinions from many aspects and know in advance whether there will be difficulties when implementing them.

2. Each part of the enterprise organization can receive the same treatment, and there will never be any discrepancies with each other.

3. In the event of personnel problems, such as the demands raised by labor, they can be dealt with concretely.

4. Because it is a concrete organization, it makes all employees easily obey the consolidation rules set by the committee.

In the personnel management committee, there must of course be several clerks to handle daily affairs, such as statistics, records, various copying and distribution of affairs.

### Talking About Several Ways to Write a Play

— Ding Bolu

"There is no fixed rule to follow when writing a play." This is a famous saying by Ibsen. As far as he himself is concerned, some of the works produced by him did not completely use a fixed method.

But if we try to summarize the experience of some playwrights, it is not difficult to see that although they do not admit that there is a certain way to write, they always stick to several ways.

One way is to first have a proposition (the author uses the ideas that have been nurtured in his life experience and observation to make a suggestion or proposal), and then select appropriate characters and appropriate situations to illustrate the author's thoughts. This method is a common one after the emergence of modern drama. Writers who unite social values and artistic insights often start writing with such steps. There are many people who have achieved success by completing their works in this way, and there are also many failures, because the people and things they arrange are often too logical, too conceptual, and too didactic... making the degree of complexity of the people and things in the play is not enough, the depth is not enough, and the convexity is not enough.

It is still worthwhile to take Ibsen as an example of this writing method. Although it was said above that he has used more than one method, he can also provide us with a good example in terms of this method.

After the age of fifty, Ibsen's daily life became a fixed set of habits. In two years, he conceived and wrote. Every second Tuesday in January, a new work was published. As soon as one was completed, he immediately planned the writing of the next one. He spent almost a whole year cultivating the proposition, characters, and plot he wanted to write; then he spent the second whole year constantly writing and constantly revising. Every day, at the same time, he walked into the usual coffee shop, sat in the usual seat, and flipped through the newspapers, peeking at the passing guests from the top of the newspapers. At home, he rarely spoke to anyone, with no exception to his wife and son; he was a lonely person. His family knew his temper well, and no one troubled him, nor did they ever ask what play he was planning or writing, because experience had already told them that they could read his new work only when the second Tuesday in January of the second year came.

He was a writer who cherished the original manuscript very much, and did not discard even the first draft like other writers. After his death, many original manuscripts were unexpectedly discovered. Those blank papers left traces of his thoughts in the writing process, leaving a great convenience for those who study Ibsen later.

When Ibsen was fifty years old, it was 1878, he stayed in Rome for a short time. One sunny afternoon, he received a letter, glanced at it and stuffed it into his pocket, and then went out for a walk. As he was walking on the street, a thought suddenly popped out. He immediately stopped and wrote down what he thought of on the back of the envelope. This envelope is still preserved to this day, and the words left on it allow us to peek into the secret of writing of a great writer.

The handwriting begins with "——October 19, 1878, Rome." Another line is like a small title —— "Tragic Data," followed by: "There are two moral laws, two consciousnesses: one is the man's, the other belongs to the woman. They do not know each other, and in real life, women's behavior is measured by men's rules, as if they were men rather than women." (——This is already a complete proposition.

A few days later, he wrote down: "The wife in the play encounters misfortune because she has no sense of right and wrong. Natural emotions and artificial authority confuse her."

"A woman does not exist in the present society, because they live in a male society, in which all the rules are made by men, and the judiciary that judges women's behavior stands entirely from the male point of view."

"She committed forgery, but she thought she was glorious, because she loved her husband deeply and had to save his life. However, the husband stood on the side of the law with worldly concepts and looked at this issue from a male perspective."

After reading these words left by Ibsen on the envelope, and thinking about all his works, those who are familiar with his works will immediately think: Isn't this the outline of "A Doll's House"? Yes, that famous play was developed from the proposition he got when he was walking.

Let's talk about another way —— starting from conceiving a character or a group of characters and then developing it into a play.

Hamilton said: "If I put some people together, if I pay attention to them for a long enough time, what they say and do will give me a wealth of writing material." This is a powerful revelation.

We still 不not search for examples from the documents left by Ibsen.

In his first memorandum when planning to write "Hedda Gabler", he wrote such short words: "Gray, cold as ice, beautiful as peach and plum." From those words, you can't see any meaningful proposition at all, and it is not a complete sentence. Then a phrase was added after this phrase: "Desire for great events in life or the joy of life." But still叫people can't see what the meaning is. Then, more complete words were added: "The man and woman finally won. He is mediocre in appearance, but he is a respectable, intelligent, and freedom-loving scientific researcher." At this point, a line of dialogue suddenly connected: "Hedda said —— I have no interest in anything, only boredom."

He used these fragmented materials to construct a　tall building.

William Archer probably disagreed with this writing method. He said: Even with "Hedda Gabler", he could not see that any proposition that the author wanted to propose could be found from the people in the play.

This is indeed a bit deliberately nitpicking; in any case, in this play, Ibsen did not forget the soul of a work —— the theme —— because he started from the characters. Think about it, isn't the misfortune of the heroine in the play —— Hedda's due to the social reasons seen in Ibsen's eyes? She is a woman of extremely good nature. If she changed to a better living environment,　she would become a shining gem. Unfortunately, she did not. On the contrary, she lived in a wrong world, a wrong country, a wrong city, and a wrong family, so she ruined others and herself. This play is another challenge book that Ibsen gave to society. It is unfair to say that "Hedda Gabler" has no theme.

In the early days of writing, many critics often said that Arthur Pinero's works had no obvious proposition, which made him very distressed. He once protested to those critics, saying: "My intention is to use characters or a group of characters to show the real social situation on the stage for people to see. If the critics want to extract some maxims or something from it, that's their business, but I didn't start writing from a certain maxim..." This is naturally an angry word. In fact, if Pinero's works really "extract" nothing proposition, then he would have lost his glory in the artistic field long ago.

Therefore, even though starting with character setting is also a way of writing, it is by no means to say that it can be a complete work without a theme.

Another way to say is to start with conceiving a very moving situation to write a play. Compared with the above two, this method may be easier and more clever, but the attempt of this method is not without conditions. You must have rich stage experience, theater experience, and be familiar with the psychology of the audience to know what can be used as a "moving and dramatic situation."

The best example of this method should be found in the achievements of Victorien Sardou. He extremely believed in Aristotle's saying that "action is the basic element of drama", and he also extremely believed in what Hugo said —— "The dramatic action is easier to succeed when expressing emotions than using reason." Therefore, the situation he planned focused on using "action" that stimulates the audience's emotions to win. His success had another fortunate encounter, that is, when his career began to unfold, a first-class actress became the pillar of her success. Her name is Sarah Bernhardt. In her performance skills, there are three special skills that others cannot learn: one is to express a kind of tempting emotion with a voice like a turtledove, one is to argue with people in a voice like a crow, and the other is to perform the voice before death. Sardou used her strengths to write many plays suitable for her to perform. In the eyes of others, those plays are naturally unrelated to each other. In fact, they are just that the actress has changed into different costumes; the central characters of each play are just what the author created with her as the object.

This method is generally most suitable for writing comedies and most suitable for writing farces.

Let's say not to start writing a play in this way. For a playwright, it is also necessary to pay attention to the "situation" with strong drama. Because no matter how you write, since you are writing a play rather than other literary works, you have to pay attention to some important situations and increase the harvest in terms of effect. Otherwise, what is written will inevitably become a literary work that is specially appealing to the sense of hearing, rather than a drama "with visual components as the main".

The last way to say is —— the playwright can consciously capture the feeling that he was occasionally aroused at a certain time, at a certain place, and in a certain situation —— capture and translate this kind of feeling that comes and goes with inspiration, and this can also be developed into a play. The famous playwright Hauptmann's "The Weavers" was written in this "way", and "Riders to the Sea" is an outstanding example of this method. According to Mrs. Gregory, the reason why the author Synge of the latter play wanted to write this play was to move the atmosphere felt in the real life of the Aran Islands to the stage for others to infect. Naturally, he was completely successful.

No matter what the way is, in order to hunt for materials, you have to remember a sentence, that is, "Always open your eyes wide, move your joints, and face real life closely."

### Heine's Poem

— Translated by Liao Xiaofan

Girl! When we were both children,

Two happy and naive children;

We often climbed into the henhouse,

Hiding under the straw, playing games.

We pretended to crow like roosters,

People walked by there,

"Chirp chirp"! They all thought this

It is indeed the love song sung by the rooster

In the courtyard, those wooden cabinets, we framed

Pasted its panels

We lived together inside,

Decorated into an elegant bedroom.

The old cat from the neighbor's house,

Often comes here to visit,

We teach it how to salute, kowtow,

And how to greet health.

Since we got to know it,

I would like to say to it and say that

Those fragmentary words that I have cared for many old cats as before.

We sat and talked properly,

Exactly like those adults.

And mourning that our generation

All the beautiful things become sighs.

"Love, faith and sincerity

No longer exist everywhere,

It's just that the price of coffee is getting higher,

And the society coins are becoming increasingly scarce.

The joy of childhood has passed away,

Everything has become another way,

Money, world and year,

Sincerity, faith and love."

羅闌司 (T. Lawrence 1769-1830) was a renowned English portrait painter of the 18th century. This portrait is of the most famous tragic actress of that time in England; the original is held in the National Gallery of England. His style is rich in emotion, elegant, and unrestrained, placing him alongside耿司保洛, 鞠茲, 羅姆萊, and others, as a member of the Rococo movement; he is also a figure whose contributions occupy a significant place in the history of English art in world art history.

### Year-End Grass

— 胡膺東

I.

The biting cold wind and continuous drizzle of the Christmas season make it seem like an aging person draped in a silk scarf. As I step into the bustling district of this metropolis, watching the surging flow of people and cars, and counting down the days to the end of the year, I feel a sense of urgency in my heart. Yes, I have been making a living in this city for almost a year now. Year-end sentiments evoke myriad feelings.

II.

Time is inherently ruthless, and life before my eyes seems especially so. In this Christmas season veiled in rain and mist, I have no particular feelings. If there are any, they are extremely ordinary, because, as an ordinary person like myself, I don't have an extraordinary life. Therefore, the confessions I sketch are something I dare not even look at directly.

III.

In this real world, I am a slow learner. I suffer from the pallid illness of intellectuals. Unhealthy thoughts flow unconsciously from my pen. Life is like this, and what I write cannot be positive. If you call me a new sentimentalist, I must frankly admit it.

Living in a small circle, the world is narrow. Unfortunately, my mouth is a bit swollen, and I cannot stand the reality. The fact that I cannot face reality is also a fact. This contradiction sinks deeper and deeper, and complaints are inevitable. I can only blame myself for not being cultivated enough and for not having a large enough heart. Unable to push away, unable to untangle, my life and writing are trapped in this quagmire.

The days in the quagmire hold me back. I hope to break free from this bondage.

IV.

As long as a person is alive for a minute, their hope is still leaping. The problem is that this hope is artificially arranged, a vestige directed towards the bright side.

I carry hope and stroll on the road of life. A year, a not-so-short period of testing, makes me feel how distant this is from hope.

I live arduously in this city, selling my cheapest youth, working like an ox, regardless of sunshine, heat, wind, or rain. I always have to carry the cross and enter the slaughterhouse of youth to accept the spiritual punishment of the exploiters. Interest and life have separated, and this is what I deeply feel as a poor thing.

A year slips by lightly in this chronic exploitation.

V.

Regarding the future, I harbor a simple extravagance; I only hope that I can bravely break free from the shackles of the spirit, shake off the unhealthy consciousness, pursue my interests, and embrace the side of life that interests me. Here, I extend my hand of passionate desire, hoping that more friends will encourage each other with me, guide me, and nurture me with enthusiasm.

The past should be turned into relics, and the future awaits the power of people to explore. Here, let me draw a confession. I hope that the front will no longer be a terrifying execution ground, and I hope even more that I will not smear myself with filth in the mire.

Standing at the end of the year, I confide in the past and look to tomorrow. My heart flows towards the ocean of goodness. In the heavy fog of wind and rain, I yearn for the realm of bright wind and clear moon. Of course, in between, I inevitably have to fight a battle with my limited vitality.

### Characteristics of Short Stories

— 復君

In Western literature, the term "Fiction" includes three categories: (1) Novel, (2) Novelette, and (3) Short Story, which are discussed here. Many people often confuse Novelette with short stories. In fact, a Novelette is a Novelette, and a short story is a short story. They are two different things, not the same. This is just like some people thinking that the difference between a Novel and a Short Story is only the length of the piece, which is the same mistake. Currently, many literary publications have separate columns for short stories and novels. If we carefully examine their content and structure, some editors and authors really have not clarified the distinction between these two things.

We know that since about the mid-19th century, the trend in world literature has been to move from long to short, from complex to concise; because as a result of the industrial revolution, the competitive pressure of human life has become increasingly urgent, and the concept of time has become particularly precious. Therefore, in poetry, there are very few long poems like those of Homer, Milton, and Dante, which are hundreds of thousands of words long. Everyone is competing to write short lyrical poems (Lysical Poetry). In drama, there are very few that are as long as Shakespeare's Hamlet, which is five acts and twenty scenes. It has gradually changed to five acts and five scenes, then to three acts and three scenes, and finally evolved from three acts and three scenes to "one-act plays." Therefore, in novels, it has also evolved from novels to short stories, to the point of such a flourishing era as it is now, which goes without saying.

The creator of the short story, the American writer Allan Poe, said it well: "In a short story, the author can fully develop his intentions. Therefore, when reading, the reader's soul is controlled by the author, and there is no fatigue or interruption." In reality, what a short story expresses is only one event, one scene, or one mood. It does not depict a panorama of life or society, but only depicts a small part of it, or even just a small fragment; but through the skillful hands of short story writers, "the reader's soul is controlled by the author." When we read the works of excellent short story writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, Anton Chekhov, and O. Henry, they have their own unique techniques, and in various poses and styles, they grasp a cross-section of life in a short space, and use their gorgeous writing to diligently describe the subtle things that people do not pay attention to, which cannot fail to fascinate us after reading them. This is what distinguishes the short story from the novel, and it is the characteristic of the short story.

At present, there is no lack of excellent short story writers in the Chinese literary world, but many promising writers often cannot withstand the pressure of life and attempt to obtain a little more manuscript fees. They spare no effort to render a short story that can be made completely exquisite and lengthen its length as much as possible, and it has evolved into a novel. As a result, of course, it is empty, powerless, rough, and even worthless to read. On the contrary, there are many great themes that can be properly and methodically organized to complete a novel, but they have become short stories that are "unfinished" due to the author's time and energy, or even due to literary cultivation. A few years ago, the literary world was noisy with the question of "great literary works." A small number of people actually decided whether a literary work was "great" based on the "length" of the novel, which is really too naive!

### Poetic Words

— 歐陽琴

Do not insult poetry; do not bury poetry: do not rape poetry, poetry is the noblest empress in the wealth of art

The highest realm of poetry is truth, the deepest understanding of poetry is goodness, and the greatest expression of poetry is beauty, and the three are indispensable.

Good poems are easy to remember, easy to read, and easy to sing, but extremely difficult to write.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 137

— 葉勁風

Since the dawn before dawn, when 鶴見 launched the plan at the 安坂 chicken farm, 野猪 conveyed various orders, and 圓子 was in charge of the internal operations, her actions have become the most important link in the chain of this plan. Until about 8:30 in the evening, when 鶴見 left for the airport, he had received a report once. But the most important report should be after the second extra edition of the evening newspaper published that short message. 鶴見 needed to know the reaction of 別府 to this short message to the fullest extent. Whether the actions of 別府 from various departments were reported to 近衛, and what his attitude was after receiving the report, and so on.

But how could 鶴見 obtain this report? They could not, in the name of something, send a radio message to 鶴見 at 飛機山; it seemed that they could also arrange for 野猪 to come to the airport to deliver a message when they got off the plane; in the Staff Headquarters, 鶴見 had several subordinates with "〇" at the beginning of their names, who were in charge of internal work, and it seemed that they could also find a way to deliver a message; if not, 鶴見 himself, before or after meeting with the secretary's office officer on duty at the Staff Headquarters, could also use the excuse to make a phone call to 安坂 or other pre-arranged places to inquire; finally, the secretary's office ordered 鶴見 to take the original car to 別府 to visit 近衛, and there should be an arrangement for delivering a message on the way. All this seemed very possible.

However, why didn't 鶴見 think of this? With 鶴見's espionage knowledge, and the shrewd and capable characters under his command, how could they not have deduced this point with such meticulous and precise thinking power? Since this report was so important, how 鶴見 should sing this play of seeing 近衛 for the second time should be determined based on this report, but what was the reason for not pre-arranging a way to transmit the message? Why did they create a period of silence in this most important period of time, cutting off 鶴見's contact?

What they didn't know was that creating this period of silence was a great knowledge and an extremely clever arrangement. International master spies often create a period of silence before launching a major plan. The greatest function of this period of silence is to reduce the danger of all kinds of "suspicious consequences" to below zero for the main actors. In other words, after the plan is launched, whether the result is success or failure, the role of the main actor can always remain "innocent," and any suspicion will not be involved.

鶴見 is undoubtedly the active center of launching this major plan; but in this section where he appears, he always performs as if everything he is doing is passive, and he is being played by people in a mysterious way, and behind this play is a precise plan, and it is performed very suddenly, so that even such a shrewd 鶴見 has no time to detect it, and falls into the cage.

Everyone knows that Tokyo is the neural center where the networks of spies and counter-spies are arranged. The cadres and lackeys who arrange various spy networks create waves without wind, and they create incidents even when nothing is happening. Moreover, 鶴見's sudden return this time is a problem figure in their minds. Even if 近衛 expressed further recruitment of 鶴見, at least that Fifth Column should cooperate with 鶴見, and should often give up hostile surveillance, but the fact is not the case; because two different spy groups absolutely have no possibility of cooperation, and if there is any, it is only limited to mutual use. From this, it can be known that if 鶴見 wants to remain innocent, he should be absolutely insulated from his own group, at least from the time he goes to the airport; so that no special service group can catch a trace of a handle.

### Responsibility

— 少夫

As of last night, seventy people had died in the three plane crashes of China Central Airlines and China National Aviation Corporation. Eleven more people are still in the hospital waiting for treatment.

No matter what, the airline should be held responsible for this tragedy, and the transportation authorities should also be held responsible. This responsibility is divided into two aspects:

1.  Thoroughly investigate the reasons why the planes failed to land safely. If there are problems with the equipment, why is the equipment not perfect? For the safety of passengers in the future, ways should be found to improve this aspect immediately.

2.  According to the company, each deceased will be given a consolation payment of one million yuan. This amount is too unreasonable. What can one million yuan be used for? The company should be responsible for compensating for the losses based on the identity of each deceased, etc.

Although the history of civil aviation in the world is short, it has been nearly forty years since then. In these forty years, we have never seen a record of three planes crashing in the same area on the same day. Therefore, some people say that the three plane crashes on Christmas, although they occurred in Shanghai, can be said to be the biggest news in the world.

We are now waiting for the transportation authorities and airlines to give us an explanation on the above two points.

### Icebergs and Snowy Seas, Competing to Hunt Whales - Soviet and Japanese Whaling Fleets Head to Antarctica

— 魯純父

According to the announcement by the Natural Resources Bureau of General MacArthur's Headquarters, the Japanese whaling fleet heading to Antarctica has obtained more than fifty whales in total. Moscow newspapers reported: "The Soviet Union also has a whaling fleet of nine ships and one large supply ship heading to Antarctica." It seems that the desolate Antarctica is stirred up again by whaling.

Antarctica is an extremely cold region, buried in ice and snow all year round, with towering icebergs floating everywhere. Except for explorers, no one goes there. However, because it is rich in whales, it is the best area in the world for whaling. 雷納, a member of the British Scientific Research Association, went to Antarctica to explore whale tracks in October 1934, floating on the ocean surface for seven months. According to his report after returning, there were as many as two hundred whales a day. Therefore, countries around the world are unwilling to let go of these natural resources lightly.

Before the war, the countries that worked the hardest to hunt whales in Antarctica were Britain and Norway. Every fishing season, more than a dozen whaling ships would depart. Although Germany, Denmark, and Japan had tried a few times, they could not match the two countries of Britain and Norway. But now, the Japanese, with the support of the Americans, are actually strutting their stuff in Antarctica.

Difficult to Catch

Because whales are heavy and powerful, and habitually stir up waves in the ocean, they are very difficult to catch. The famous whaling expert史溫特方 said that he had stabbed a whale as long as ninety-five feet with a harpoon. A Soviet whaler once harpooned a whale overseas in Siberia. It dragged the boat in the sea for seven hours, at a speed of eight nautical miles per hour. The rope was three thousand feet long, and the boat could not keep up with it. Therefore, if whaling is not done properly, one's own life will be lost.

This is an office designed by a British expert for a bank manager.

Whaling began about a thousand years ago; until this century, countries have been desperately catching them, but whales reproduce slowly. If they continue to be caught like this, they are in danger of becoming extinct. However, it is precisely because everyone knows that the whaling industry is an industry that is about to end that whaling companies in various countries have decided on a method of "quickly hunting as much as possible" in order to strive to obtain the largest harvest first.

Great Fight

Whales are playful in nature. They often play chasing games with fishing boats. They float up and down around the boat, swimming back and forth, sometimes playing like this for two or three hours. When they get tired of playing, they wag their tails and swim away. If whalers do not disturb them, they will not hurt people much, but if fishermen stab their sensitive flesh with harpoons, they will cleverly swim out of the range of the fishermen's harpoons, and then fight the fishermen. Therefore, to catch them, you must aim at them and give them a fatal blow, otherwise the entire ship will be in great danger.

In 1937, J.Perno, a scientist who was skilled in whaling, invented an ingenious whaling method. They first built a radio station and lookout post on a mountain three hundred feet high, and used the most precise telescopes to observe the waves on the sea surface to determine the whereabouts of whales. If they found them, the shortwave radio station immediately flashed a flame signal to the whaling ship under the coastal cliffs. Then, they launched a high-speed catch boat with the lightest aircraft engine and shortwave radio command. At this time, the whale would definitely appear near the whaling ship about half a mile away, exchanging fresh air to the sea surface. Therefore, the whaling ship quickly approached the whale's body. Within the range of the harpoon gun on the ship, the gunner under the deck loaded the gun, (this type of shell can automatically explode eight seconds after being fired. Five minutes later, when the whale appears near the ship again, they will rush forward to chase and capture it. At the same time, the gunner turned the gun body towards the whale's body and attacked the whale's abdomen. The whale was in pain and dived into the sea, but because of the automatic explosion of the harpoon head, it still sent the whale out of the sea.

Bombardment

At this time, the gunner fired an electric harpoon into the whale's body, and dragged an electrically conductive wire behind it. Then, the helmsman connected the electric wire to the motor and introduced current. As a result, there was a scream on the sea surface, waves splashed everywhere, and the whaling ship sailed up to fire the final shot to prevent the whale's body from sinking into the sea again. This scientific war on the sea ended in a few minutes. This method has now been widely adopted by various countries.

At present, the whale fishing season has arrived again. In the cold currents of the Southern Ocean, the Soviet Union, Japan, and other countries are competing for whaling again. At present, the world is really full of competition and contradictions between countries in every piece of land!

### Random Notes on Counting Money

— 陸士雄

I recently heard that the Central Bank will recruit many money counters.

When this fascinating and all-powerful piece of paper - banknotes - is in its gestation period, it must also undergo several times of management and teaching. The first time is to review the large sheets, including: the color of the ink, the printing technology, and the position of the paper, etc. The second is to check whether there are any errors or omissions in the numbers or official seals, etc. The third is to check the number of sheets. The above work is often done by young girls in our country, because women are more meticulous. Therefore, before each banknote flows into the market, it must go through many touches and explorations by women. When people hold a bundle of brand-new banknotes, they may proudly think that they are lovely because they are 'first in my hands'. In fact, they have already tasted the air of rouge and powder, and they are slaves who have been managed by women many times. Here, I am reminded of the American habit of respecting women, where Ladies first in everything. When it comes to the brief history of currency gestation, women are also first! The job of calling female counters may be a new profession and title. Their educational level ranges from junior high school to university. They are a flexible group and must be quick with their hands and eyes to be able to do the job happily.

Banknotes are loved by everyone, and having banknotes to count, even if it means 'burning the midnight oil' or 'braving the wind and rain', they will not be tired. But I think only money counters and female money counters, because they sit in a city of banknotes every day and are with them all day long, will naturally feel bored with seeing banknotes, or even have headaches. The reason for this is still 'for whom are they working so hard?' and only dreaming of being a 'fortune god who passes by'!

Open an old book and take a look. In 'Biographies of Immortals' there is the myth of 'turning stones into gold' and in 'Records After Hearing and Seeing' there is the myth of 'turning iron into gold'. In modern monetary studies, the new example of 'turning paper into gold' should be added. Among our poor public servants, there is only the pain and depression of 'lacking the ability to turn gold' and 'lacking decoration for the New Year'.

To turn the conversation back: the same banknote has different destinies and values. For example, a two-thousand-yuan note, in a wealthy family with assets calculated in the 'billions', this mere two thousand yuan is not even generous to give to a beggar, but in a poor family, it can buy several liters of rice and several pounds of vegetables. Every time a two-thousand-yuan note is used, it must first be caressed, like a loving mother and her beloved child, reluctantly parting! Even after parting, they are still very reluctant to part with it!

I remember that an American economist, R.M. Sauille, had some comments on the value of money. He had a similar view. He said: How much is a dollar really worth? It all depends on who the dollar falls into and what it is used for:

In the hands of a housewife with a fixed income, a dollar is worth a dollar.

In the hands of a widow without a fixed income, it is worth nine dollars.

In the hands of an unproductive elderly person, it is worth five dollars.

In the hands of a young person with a promising future, it may only be worth three cents.

Finally, I believe that the lives of the rich and the banknotes of the poor, which is more important, or whether they are equal, whether they can also be counted.

(Note: This is the answer to the article "Is it a wrongful killing?", which was published in this journal yesterday. It was a dark night without stars or moon. There were people five miles away, so there was no possibility of light. In the dark, no animal's eyes will glow unless there is reflective light; as for human eyes, they will never glow under any circumstances.

Therefore, 白德婁 could not have seen any so-called glowing eyes staring at him in the dark. (If you don't believe it, you can turn off the lights and try it at night.) Obviously, it was a deliberate murder case!

Shanghai Cross-Section

### Those Who Fish in Troubled Waters

— 張季皋

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the United Nations brought in a large amount of relief supplies. The Yangshupu Wharf, which had been deserted for several years, suddenly became lively. Those who had changed careers and started running foreign ships came to life again. Teahouses were where they met. This wharf is mine, that wharf is yours. After the spheres of influence were divided, everyone recruited brothers. With an order to start transportation, hundreds of porters, bending their backs and sweating, moved the mountains of supplies to the shore. Their wages were calculated by the day, and a day's wages were enough to cover a person's life; if they had a family, it would not be very well-off. But working at the wharf was still considered a good job. There was certainly a reason for this. If we pay attention, we can see that the porters all wore old overcoats. Now that the weather is cold, wearing an overcoat is not surprising, but they were dressed like this a month or two ago. The so-called "mystery" lies in this, and it is conceivable that the overcoat has other uses.

The work is completed, and it's time to go back. A large number of canned goods; pork, beef, everything; thousands of bags of flour piled up like a small mountain. This is certainly a temptation. They picked a few big cans, clamped them under their armpits. They really had the skill. They put on their overcoats and swaggered out. No one could tell that they were carrying anything. If it was their turn to move flour one day, they would be extremely happy. When the work was completed, they quickly opened a bag of flour, poured half of it into a pre-prepared bag, clamped it under both armpits, and mixed in.

As time went on, flaws would naturally be revealed; so a few people were caught by the ×× on the shore, but soon everyone got along with them. They put an empty kerosene barrel at the exit. When friends who were carrying things came out, those who carried cans would give cans; those who carried flour would grab a handful of flour. In a while, the barrel was full, so they would change to an empty barrel.

The two American sailors who guarded the cargo hold on the ship rarely asked questions. Later, it became too outrageous, so they caught a few people, locked them up overnight, and released them the next day.

As for the leaders of the porters, they enjoyed the fruits of their labor. The little brothers had to pay tribute to them every day. They really had "everything beautiful," and they went to teahouses every day. Sometimes they opened a can of chrysanthemum evaporated milk, poured hot water on it, and added sugar cubes. They really enjoyed themselves!

### Insufficient Evidence, Feel Free to Guess!

— Ge Chunliang

"I am going to the cinema now." Chou Lai said to Professor Huo Danai in the club, "I hope you will talk to Uncle John and spend an evening with him. He seems very worried lately."

An hour later, Professor Huo Danai arrived at Chou Lai's home and found the male servant in a state of panic.

The male servant said, "Sir, Mr. John asked me to bring him coffee an hour ago and then locked himself in the study. Now I knock on the door, but he does not answer me."

The two men forced the door open and found Mr. John lying on the floor, with an empty poison bottle beside him. The door to the front balcony of the study was open. After a detailed inspection, Huo Danai returned home. Several hours later, Chou Lai walked into the parlor of his house.

"I thought I would come here for a short stay before going home. Does Uncle John seem very worried?"

"Your uncle is dead. He died of poisoning. Your male servant and I found him lying on the floor. But it was too late to save him."

"How terrible, Professor Huo Danai! Why was the door to the study locked? Do you know?"

"I am also baffled. Has your male servant worked in your home for a long time?"

"For many years," Chou Lai replied, clutching his head with both hands.

"Ah, with such an inheritance, now you can become rich."

"What does that matter? Uncle John is worth more to me than all the money in the world."

"I wish I could believe you," Professor Huo Danai replied, pointing to the movie ticket stub nervously held in Chou Lai's hand, and said, "Relying solely on this is insufficient evidence."

Smart readers, how did Chou Lai arouse the professor's suspicion?

### When You Have Insomnia

— Zui Yin

Insomnia is not a serious matter unless you take it too seriously yourself.

Occasional one or two hours of insomnia, it is best not to take it as a big deal, and naturally you will accept it calmly the next day! Conversely, it will become more and more lingering and harm your nerves.

The increasing severity of neurasthenia is mostly due to you taking it too seriously; therefore, it becomes a vicious cycle, ultimately becoming unmanageable!

Many methods seem to cure insomnia, but they are useless; methods like counting numbers only make you think, "Oh, why haven't I fallen asleep yet! Fall asleep quickly!" Little do you know that the more you force yourself to fall asleep, the less you can sleep.

The best way is: don't pay attention to it! You close your eyes, and you will always fall asleep! You have such confidence, and that's it. Don't be irritable, suspicious, or get up and walk around; you must have the determination: lie down until you fall asleep! Even if you lie down all night. (In fact, that's not the case.) In this way, even if you suffer from insomnia for many nights, you can pass it safely, and soon, the demon of insomnia will flee because he knows you are a strong person, and he cannot aggravate your neurasthenia!

In fact, as long as you exercise a little during the day, and do not write articles or talk loudly before going to bed, you will not suffer from insomnia! Wen Hua

At a grand wedding ceremony, the groom noticed that one of the guests seemed displeased. "Have you kissed the bride?" (Note: According to Western customs, guests should kiss the bride at the wedding to show their congratulations.) He asked, hoping to cheer up this unhappy guest.

The guest looked into the distance and said unhappily, "Not recently."

### General Qin Dechun

— Mi Shan

General Qin Dechun, who was recently ordered to come to Shanghai to be responsible for handling the Jiangwan ammunition depot explosion case, is the current Director of the Ministry of National Defense, styled Shaowen. He is a soldier of orthodox background, graduating from the second class of the Infantry Department of the Baoding Military Academy and the sixth class of the Army University. He has served as Chief of Staff, Regimental Commander, Brigade Commander, Division Commander, and Army Commander. During the Great Wall Resistance against Japan, he served as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, and severely damaged the Japanese invaders at Xifengkou and Luowenyu on the Great Wall Line. General Qin became famous for this battle, becoming a prominent figure in China's history of resistance against Japan.

In 1933, he served as Deputy Commander of the Twenty-ninth Army and Chairman of Chahar Province. In 1935, he was transferred to be the Mayor of Beiping. At that time, the enemy was actively plotting aggression and repeatedly made many rude and unreasonable demands to the Pingjin authorities. General Song Zheyuan was not in Beiping, and it was General Qin who was responsible for negotiating with Matsui Iwane. When the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly broke out, it was entirely thanks to the proper handling of Qin, Zhang Zhizhong, and Feng Zhian that the foundation for resisting the enemy was laid. Subsequently, Qin transitioned to a purely military position, fighting in various places in central and southern Hebei.

Before the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, Qin was the Director of the Military Affairs Department. After being transferred to the position of Vice Minister of National Defense, one major event that everyone will not forget is his trip to Japan this summer to testify at the Far East International Tribunal, accusing the Japanese war criminals Doihara and others of their crimes. Because Qin had personally experienced the enemy's various conspiracies on the eve of the War of Resistance, he was able to speak persuasively.

Qin is a native of Yixian County, Shandong Province, and his hometown is now occupied by the Communist army. He is now fifty-four years old and has authored the book "Memories of Beiping." In his spare time, he only likes to read books and practice calligraphy, and has no other hobbies.
