### The Complete Constitution Draft Review is Finished, Submitted to the Central Executive Committee and National Defense Council for Discussion, and then Presented to the National Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Constitution Draft Review Committee held its second meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 3:00 PM on the 19th. Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Lin Bin, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junmai, Wang Yunwu, and Miao Jiaming attended and thoroughly discussed the unfinished parts of yesterday's review. Lei Zhen also participated. It is reported that the meeting went well, and there were no changes in principle, but because the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, everyone sought perfection and scrutinized the wording until 6:00 PM. It is said that the entire review was completed on the 19th and it will be submitted to the Central Executive Committee for discussion on the morning of the 20th, and to the Supreme National Defense Council for discussion in the afternoon. It will then be submitted to the Legislative Yuan on the 21st to complete the legislative process, and then submitted to the National Assembly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] During the Constitution Draft Review Committee meeting on the 19th, the most important additions or deletions to the revised draft were the following: Under Article 45 of the chapter on the President, the following was added: "Regarding disputes between the Yuan, the President may convene a meeting of the heads of the relevant Yuan to discuss and resolve them, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution." At the meeting, all parties felt that it was necessary to add this article to the Constitution, because the revised draft did not have proper provisions for the connection between the five Yuan. In the event of a dispute between Yuan A and Yuan B, if there is no way to resolve the difficulties, the government may fall into a deadlock. Adding this article can avoid this drawback. The revised draft of the chapter on the Executive Yuan did not specify how the heads of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan should be appointed. The attendees agreed that this point should be stipulated in the Constitution, and it was agreed to add: "The heads of the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan and the ministers without portfolio shall be nominated by the President of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the President." In the revised draft of the chapter on the Central and Local Governments, the word "county" was added after the word "province" in Article 108, "The following matters shall be legislated and implemented by the Central Government or delegated to the provinces for execution," and changed to "executed by the provinces and counties," and the following clause was added: "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy." If so, when the provinces formulate provincial autonomy laws in the future, they must be based on the "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy." Although the county is not a "local autonomous unit," its autonomous characteristics are also more obvious than in the revised draft. In the chapter on Basic National Policies, the participants agreed to add the eight characters "national morality and sound physique" under Article 140 of the revised draft "Cultural education should develop the national spirit and the people's livelihood spirit of the people," and the last five characters "as the basic principle" of the article were also deleted. Regarding the implementation and amendment of the Constitution in the revised draft, the original "Item 2" of Article "144" stated, "If there is any conflict between the law and the Constitution, the Executive Yuan shall, within six months after the law comes into effect, request the Judicial Yuan for interpretation." According to this provision, it can be submitted to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation after being submitted by the Executive Yuan, and it is stipulated that the interpretation can only be requested within six months after implementation, which has great drawbacks. It was agreed in the meeting to change it to "If there is any doubt about whether the current laws conflict with the Constitution, the Judicial Yuan shall interpret it." It is not stipulated that it should be submitted by the Executive Yuan, nor is it limited to a certain period "after implementation," which is more appropriate. At the meeting, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan was also discussed, but no changes were made to the revised draft. The Supervisory Yuan, which everyone paid attention to, and the consent power of the Legislative Yuan, were proposed to be abolished by some people at the meeting, but no agreement was reached. According to a participant in the meeting, if the President can appoint the President of the Executive Yuan and the President of the Judicial Yuan without the consent of the Legislative Yuan or the Supervisory Yuan, then the President's power is too great, so it is necessary to retain the "consent power."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Supervisory Yuan held its 102nd meeting at 2:00 PM on the 19th. More than 30 members including Liu Chengyu, Yan Zhuang, and Wang Dong attended. The Minister of the Audit Department Lin Yunhai, Deputy Ministers Liu Jiwen and Ji Pingfan, and Supervisors Gao Yihan, Liu Houwu, Miao Peicheng, Li Sicong, Guo Zhongkui, Tian Jiongjin, and Zhang Weihan also attended. President Yu Youren presided over the meeting and reported on important work. Next, the part of the Constitution draft related to the supervisory system was discussed, and the attendees expressed their opinions separately. The meeting ended around 6:00 PM.

### The Chairman Enquires About the Review Process

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Chairman Jiang hosted a banquet for Zhang Qun, Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Cheng, etc. on the evening of the 19th, and enquired about the progress of the Constitution draft review during the banquet.

### Close Negotiations are Underway Between the Government and the Democratic Socialist Party; Concrete Results Can be Obtained Within Days

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] Close negotiations are currently underway between the government and the Democratic Socialist Party. Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, frequently visited Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian, and even talked until late at night on the 18th. On the afternoon of the 19th, Lei visited Jiang for an hour and then visited again around 5:00 PM, which lasted until 7:00 PM. It is reported that concrete results can be obtained in these negotiations within days, and an announcement will be made by both parties. When Jiang Yuntian met with reporters in the evening, he made the following remarks: "We are an ordinary political party, and we adopt gradual steps to strive for democratic politics. We can adopt any method that can promote democratic politics by one step. We are also willing to cooperate with any political party for the purpose of striving for democratic politics. If the goals are not the same, we cannot cooperate. Therefore, in order to strive for democracy, we are prepared to negotiate with the government at any time. If the negotiations are successful, we will also cooperate with the government at any time. At the same time, we will act in accordance with the free will of our party, and will never rely on any party, nor will we ask for instructions from any party." Jiang Yuntian further stated that the current negotiations have a high probability of success every day, because both parties can consider the interests of the people and the country. At the same time, the Democratic Socialist Party is acting in the spirit of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. All issues will be resolved without any doubt as long as the Kuomintang can abandon one-party dictatorship, truly return power to the people, and announce it to China and foreign countries. Furthermore, Zhang Dongsun may come to Nanjing within days. If he cannot spare time from the affairs of Yenching University, he will send Hu Haimen as a representative to Nanjing. Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi, who went to Beiping yesterday, may return to Nanjing on the 20th. In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party has sent Hong Shaozhi as a representative to Shanghai by night train on the 19th and then fly to Hong Kong to meet with members of the Democratic Socialist Party.

### Zhang Dongsun Says He Does Not Intend to Go South

Sun Baogang and Others are Scheduled to Leave Beiping Today

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party headquarters who invited Zhang Dongsun to go south, are scheduled to take a flight back south from Beiping on the 20th. Zhang Dongsun has decided not to go south. Today, Hu Haimen, a Standing Committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party who stayed in Changping, flew to Shanghai to convey Zhang Dongsun's views on the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly. On the 20th, Wan Renqian and Hou Bairen, important officials of the Democratic Socialist Party in Ping, will also follow Mr. Sun south to discuss their views on the current situation with the Democratic Socialist Party headquarters. After talking with Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi on the afternoon of the 19th, Zhang Dongsun told reporters that he did not intend to go south to participate in the National Assembly. As early as the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, Zhang was among the 120 National Assembly representatives designated by the China Democratic League. Zhang crossed out his name at that time and did not intend to participate. In his personal opinion, the Democratic Socialist Party should definitely establish a neutral position that does not offend either the Kuomintang or the Communist Party in order to maintain the qualifications of special negotiators and promote the realization of peace. He also said that the lineup of the third party needs to be reorganized urgently.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] Sun Baogang, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party who came to the north, told reporters from this newspaper on the 19th: (1) Whether the Democratic Socialist Party will participate in the National Assembly is still in the stage of exchanging opinions within the party, and no decision can be made yet. This time I came to the north under orders to inquire about the opinions of our party members in the north. This issue is extremely complicated, and I hope that fellow party members can go to Nanjing and Shanghai to observe more, so as to pay attention to the development of the current situation at any time; (2) At this moment, the participation of the Democratic Socialist Party in the National Assembly should not be taken too seriously. If the Democratic Socialist Party participates and the National Assembly cannot pass the democratic Constitution draft revised by the Political Consultative Conference, then the Democratic Socialist Party will still oppose the National Assembly. If the Democratic Socialist Party does not participate, and the National Assembly passes the Constitution draft of the Political Consultative Conference, then the Democratic Socialist Party will still support this Constitution; (3) There is a certain distance between the Democratic Socialist Party and the government. If the government gradually becomes democratic, this distance will gradually decrease. If the government is farther away from democracy, the distance between the Democratic Socialist Party and the government will also be farther. Whether the Democratic Socialist Party participates in the National Assembly also depends on the democratic nature of the government; (4) At present, the Democratic Socialist Party has not participated in the China Democratic League as a party, but some party members participate in the China Democratic League as individuals. Therefore, the actions of the Democratic Socialist Party are theoretically not bound by the China Democratic League.

### The Attitude of the China Democratic League Will Not Change

Zhang Shenfu Discusses the National Assembly Issue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The China Democratic League had no activity all day. When reporters asked Zhang Shenfu in the evening if the China Democratic League could consider participating if the Democratic Socialist Party participated in the National Assembly, Zhang replied that the determined attitude was not to participate. Also, the Communist Party delegation's residence was deserted in the evening.

### Liang Shuming Will Fly to Chongqing Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] Liang Shuming is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 21st to preside over the Mianren Academy and continue writing "The Essentials of Chinese Culture." This book was started in Yulin during the war and is three-fifths completed. It is also rumored that Liang will persuade Zhang Lan to enter Beijing to strengthen the China Democratic League.

### Women's Movement Association Hosts Female Representatives to the National Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The Central Women's Movement Committee hosted a luncheon for all female representatives to the National Assembly and leaders of the women's movement in Nanjing at the Lizhi Society at noon on the 19th. A total of more than 80 people attended, and it was a grand occasion with beautiful women in splendid attire.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The National Government issued an order on the 19th: National Assembly representatives directly selected by the National Government, He Yingqin, Cheng Tianfang, and Feng Wangxiang, have gone abroad on official business and have not had time to return to the country to report. They will be replaced by alternate representatives Yu Xuezhong, Chen Fang, and Gao Zongwu respectively to attend.

### The National Assembly Presidium Election Method Was Revised and Passed by the Preparatory Meeting; Candidates Will be Nominated by Each Unit Today

Separate elections by profession and region. The first speaker did not advocate separation. After a vote, it was passed by a majority vote that there would be no separate elections; 3. Deletion of the last sentence of Article 1. The voting machine button immediately lit up, and it was passed by a majority vote.

The number of candidates for the presidium elected by the representatives directly selected by the National Government shall be generated in proportion to the number of representatives produced by each unit. If it is less than the proportional number, it shall be calculated separately; 4. This method shall be implemented after being approved by the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly.

### National Assembly Preparatory Meeting Anecdotes

— Our Reporter Zhang Ming

Today, the second day of the preparatory meeting, the atmosphere at the meeting place was obviously more lively and dynamic, and it was also more democratic.

The most popular speaker today was Zhu Jingnong. His voice was clear, his speaking was organized and concise, and he won a lot of applause. Every time he spoke, he stood in front of the microphone and held the microphone pole, posing like an actor in a drama.

There were two who were the most annoying. One was a representative from the Shaanxi Federation of Trade Unions, and the other was a representative from the Farmers' Association. The former spoke ramblingly and unclearly. There was a constant hissing sound from the audience, but he still continued to speak calmly until he was almost driven off the stage. When he came down, the meeting place roared. The latter used the posture of mobilizing the masses in the countryside and yelled with a hoarse throat, and was also dissatisfied by the representatives and hissed off the stage. As soon as this gentleman stepped down, the Shaanxi labor representative stood in his position and defended him, playing a tune of sympathy, believing that their right to speak had been deprived.

Chairman Jiang arrived at the meeting place at 9:25 AM. The madam did not come with him. Secretary-General Hong was reporting when the chairman entered the venue, but he stopped immediately, which attracted the attention of the entire venue.

Bao Deming was the only female among the seventy-odd speakers in the two days. Her seat was upstairs, and a soprano voice was broadcast from the microphone, as if it had fallen from the sky. She was talking about the issue of women nominating candidates, but she did not get to the point and was deprived of her right to speak.

During the voting, the first time was still by raising hands. Many people were dissatisfied and raised questions. This was close to a child's curiosity, but then someone made an excessive reaction, saying: "There are too many empty seats. What if someone presses the button in the empty seat? So we should pay attention." Naturally, that is also a way to win by surprise, but Zhang Daofan stood up and said: "This kind of excessive concern is unnecessary. You can ask the people around you to monitor."

Not long after the meeting started, many people became impatient and felt that the chairman's voice was too small. So No. 1343 stood up and said something that the chairman could not hear on the stage: "The chairman's words cannot be heard at all in the back. If you can't hear it, you naturally can't express your opinion. Please pay attention!" But this sentence was like a breeze blowing across the water surface. There was no response on the stage, but it caused a commotion below.

The first vote was on the issue of whether to amend the draft or not. When the chairman put it to a vote, he said: "Those who agree to amend the original proposal, please raise your hands!" Conversely, it means that you do not agree with the original proposal. That is to say, those who raised their hands did not agree with the original proposal, but some people only knew how to raise their hands and naturally agreed. They did not know that what they agreed to was not the original proposal. After explaining it again, it was put to a vote again.

The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely enthusiastic, and it naturally became restless. In particular, the speakers were eager to speak and were extremely enthusiastic. The content of the speeches varied. Some were magnificent, some quoted scriptures, and some were long and boring. There were often people waiting for opportunities in front of the microphone. Several people almost looked like they were waiting for a bus.

When a representative was pulling out all the old cliches and giving a long speech from the manuscript, the chairman discovered that he was "off topic" and asked him to stop speaking, but the speaker could not hear him. So the chairman's bell did not work, and many methods could not stop this amazing speech.

In the chaotic situation of speeches, a representative gave the following wonderful theory: "If it is to be chaotic, it will be chaotic (referring to the atmosphere of the meeting). If it is not to be chaotic, it will not be chaotic. If it is already chaotic, then everyone will be chaotic. Why not correct it when it is just chaotic?" It sounds like it makes sense, and this passage is indeed chaotic enough.

The chairman left during the break.

The mercury lamp was never turned on once, and the photographers waited in vain for a long time.

Many people at the meeting hoped to hear Zuo Shunsheng's speech, but he said, "I am not prepared to speak today." The implication is that we will talk about it tomorrow.

Just as it was about to be put to a vote, Wu Tiecheng announced a note and sent it to the chairman's desk. After a while, Secretary-General Hong stood up and said: "Please note, news reporters should not sit in the representative seats!"

The break time was announced as five minutes, but it actually lasted from 10:20 AM to 10:40 AM, four times longer than announced.

### First Trial of "Murderous Devil":丁逆默邨 Deceitful Defense Unsuccessful; Attempt to Evade Responsibility Scorned by Judge

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] 丁逆默邨, former Director of the No. 76 Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, was tried all day on the 19th at the Capital High Court. Over a thousand people attended, those with certificates were allowed into the courtroom, while those without stood on the steps. The order was well-maintained, but it was not as lively as when 周逆佛海 was tried. Around 8 o'clock, 丁逆 was escorted to the High Court, wearing a dark blue wrinkled face camel hair robe, covered with a blue cloth long gown, gray trousers, and black leather shoes. His dry hair was tangled, his face haggard, and he wore rimless glasses. In the waiting room, after eating a bowl of noodles, he reviewed his confession statement one by one. At 9:45, Judge 金世鼎, along with judges 申屠宸 and 葛召棠, and Prosecutor 陈祖开 formed a collegiate panel in the Dacheng Hall. Lawyers 王龙 and 薛斋, and court-appointed defense attorney 章神吾 also appeared in court. Soon after, 丁逆 was brought in, and the interrogation began. From beginning to end, 丁逆 was sneaky and evasive, sometimes saying "I can't remember," sometimes saying "more or less," trying to get away with it. However, the judges were experienced and sharp, pressing him tightly with harsh words, and 丁逆's tricks ultimately failed.

Why the Fuss About "Explanation"? Attempt to Shift the Focus Ultimately Fails

At the beginning of the trial, his age, place of origin, occupation, and address were inquired about. 丁逆 vaguely stated: He was from Hunan, 44 years old, lived on Yuyuan Road in Shanghai, used to work in politics, and had never committed a crime. Then, Prosecutor 陈 thoroughly described the key points of the indictment, and the presiding judge further questioned his background and experience, and strictly questioned his motives for going to Hong Kong. 丁逆 claimed: In the 13th year, he did political work in the army in Guangdong, serving as a captain. When the headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army was established, he first worked as a secretary and then as a counselor. When the headquarters was abolished and the Military Affairs Commission was established, he served as a major general counselor. In the spring of the 22nd year, he also served as the director of the Third Division of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau. In the 27th year, it was renamed the General Affairs Office. After reorganization, he was dismissed from his post and went to Hong Kong for medical treatment due to illness. He suffered losses in business in Hong Kong and had a difficult life, so he returned to Shanghai, intending to practice Chinese medicine and engage in stock exchange business again. Unexpectedly, he was discovered by the Japanese within a few days. At this point, 丁逆 hesitated and prevaricated, finding it difficult to justify himself in the face of the court's multiple interrogations. He then requested to "explain" a few points: (1) He admitted his guilt, but later performed meritorious service to atone for his crimes, contacted the Central Government, and would never deny his criminal behavior. (2) After the victory and the completion of the takeover, he telegraphed Director Ying贺国光 of the Military Affairs Commission Office to forward it to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, asking for legal action and having no intention of escaping the law. (3) If the crimes were committed by the defendant, he should be punished, but those that were not should not be admitted, and he would not argue forcefully. (4) The favorable evidence was intended to show his sincerity and make the society understand that the defendant still had some contributions. Even if he was sentenced to death, he could comfort himself. In conclusion, although the defendant made a defense, he did not falsely claim innocence, and his repentance and surrender were not to seek exemption from punishment. He asked the court to understand thoroughly and would accept any punishment willingly; however, he could not be convicted based on hearsay. 丁逆's "generous" statement was interrupted by the judge, who sternly told him: "丁默邨! Favorable evidence for you will be thoroughly investigated. Saying you are guilty does not necessarily mean you are truly guilty, and saying you are innocent does not mean you will be let go. Everything will be based on facts and the law. Today is an investigation, guilt or innocence is yet to be determined. We are asking you why you went to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. We are carefully studying your motives. We only seek to understand the truth. You will have ample opportunity to defend and explain everything. There is no need to say more today." 丁逆 responded with a series of "yes," and his attempt to shift the focus failed. The court then asked: "You held an important position in the Central Government. Even after leaving the position of director, you still remained a counselor. The Central Government treated you well. Why did you leave without resigning or asking for leave, angrily leaving, and living in difficult circumstances in Hong Kong, not returning to Hankou, but instead going to Shanghai? Who asked you to go?" 丁逆 still claimed that the counselor position was concurrent, he had never received a salary, and he did not know whether it was retained or not. He was not used to living in Hong Kong, and Shanghai had good Chinese and Western medicine. He was tired of political life. 丁逆 firmly denied that he was invited to leave.

The Process of Joining "He Yun": He Claimed to Have Forgotten the Name of the Introducer

丁逆供 stated in great detail the process of participating in "He Yun," saying that he was coerced by the Japanese and Li Shiqun. He also claimed: He had always opposed Wang Ni, and his relationship with Wang was extremely bad, but because he had no way to escape, he was first placed under house arrest by Li Ni at No. 76, and then introduced by a certain Japanese from the "Mei Kikan," the Japanese strategy organization for China headed by Kageyama, to participate. He insisted that he had forgotten the name of the Japanese, and the "Qingqi" he provided in the prosecutor's investigation court was a memory error. He also claimed that his relationship with the Japanese at that time had to go through Li Shiqun, and he rarely participated in the planning of "He Yun." When talking to the Japanese, he never offered any advice, "because for major events they would look for Wang, and if they couldn't find the defendant, for minor events they would look for Li Shiqun, and they also couldn't find the defendant." According to 丁逆, his participation in "He Yun" was at the very beginning of the Pseudo-Sixth National Congress. He did not participate in any matters prior to the Qingdao talks, and he opposed the organization of the puppet government and expressed dissatisfaction with the "Basic Treaty," which were all resented by Wang Ni. "Everything in the puppet regime was based on Wang as the main body. The restoration of the 'Kuomintang' was just to deal with the rear and deceive people. The resolutions of the 'Central Executive Committee' and the 'Central Political Committee' were just read out by Wang, and there was no so-called approval. Even more ridiculous was that Wang often issued emergency orders first and then had the 'Central Political Committee' retroactively approve them. The defendant had no interest in this and did not often attend meetings, so he couldn't remember the details clearly." Here, 丁逆 wanted to gloss over the "Sino-Japanese-Manchurian Alliance Treaty" and our 重庆 Central Government's decree. After being pressed by the court, he had to admit: "It was passed by the 'Central Political Committee,' but in fact, I was just listening to the report. If I should be held responsible according to law, I absolutely admit it." The court then argued: "Don't try to delay or shift responsibility again. We want you to tell the truth. You must know that your attitude after repenting is related to your sentencing!" 丁逆 responded with a series of "yes," but still readily admitted responsibility from the side after his deceitful defense failed. Regarding the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, 丁逆 claimed that he had firmly opposed it. After the establishment of the puppet National Defense Conference, he did not serve as a member, but only listened to "reports" in the still abnormally existing "Central Political Committee." 丁逆 claimed: "Since January of the 34th year, because Chen Gongbo, the acting chairman, was more lenient than Wang, in order to obtain the most confidential intelligence to provide to the Central Government, I took office as the secretary general of the puppet National Defense Conference."

Shamelessly Calling "Injustice": Shifting Everything to Li Ni Shiqun

Then, 丁逆 explained in detail the process of holding various puppet positions, falsely claiming that there was nothing to do and that he had used every possible opportunity to do his best to benefit the people and resist Japan. He then held a defense statement, detailing the process of the No. 76 Puppet Secret Service Headquarters, falsely claiming: "Initially, Li Shiqun worked for the Japanese. After the agencies were established sporadically, they moved to No. 76 and expanded. After the Pseudo-Sixth National Congress, the headquarters organization was established. For the sake of appealing, Li Shiqun appointed himself as the deputy director and added the name of the director to the defendant, making it impossible to clear his name and being placed under house arrest. The defendant could not escape and did not want to commit suicide, so he could not refuse. It was an empty director position with no letter of appointment, and he could not take office and it was even more difficult to intervene in the work. Such circumstances were not easy for all parties to understand, but the fact that only power can control and oppress is a simple fact. Please investigate whether the defendant had the power. The guns and force of No. 76 were controlled by the defendant or by Li Shiqun. Later, the Secret Service Headquarters was renamed the 'Investigation and Statistics Department,' then renamed the 'Political Department,' and finally renamed the 'Political Security Department,' with Chen Gongbo concurrently serving as the director general and the defendant concurrently serving as the deputy director until he left Zhejiang in May of the 34th year." All the points he provided were nothing more than shifting all the crimes to Li Ni.

The court then read a letter to the editor column from a certain newspaper in Shanghai on the 11th of this month, an article titled "Ding Mochun, Whom I Have Experienced" by Zhang Yishu, the former Chinese director of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, investigating the crimes of persecuting patriotic individuals. 丁逆 defended, saying: "The person mentioned in the article, Geng Ji, was Li Shiqun's man, and he had met the defendant, but there was no relationship. He doesn't know who Zhang is, and there is no such thing." He denied it completely. The court then inquired about the case of Miss Zheng Pingru, an underground worker of the Military Statistics Bureau, and her comrades being arrested and killed after their failed assassination attempt against 丁逆, and the case of the murder of judges Qian and Yue. 丁逆 either lied and blamed Li Ni Shiqun and the Japanese, or claimed that the incident occurred outside of his term, trying to shirk responsibility, and shamelessly called injustice, saying: "If you say the defendant is a 'murderous devil,' you can execute him immediately, but it is really unfair to drag all the murder cases to the defendant. People who like to kill have different nerve movements from others. Please see how the defendant is." 丁逆 also claimed: Going to Zhejiang was on orders from the Central Government to serve as an internal response for the Allied forces, "turning against," "preventing communism." He vehemently denied all the evil deeds of collecting rice, conscripting labor, donating copper, and donating iron, using force to oppress the people. He also did not admit that the fallacy in his "New Year's Speech in the 33rd Year" was his handwriting, and said that he did not know who wrote it. For all of this, the court ordered that strong evidence be presented before it could be believed.

Presented Favorable Evidence: Actually Expressed Painful Regret for Supporting the Puppet Regime

Regarding the assault team, 丁逆 stated: "It was planned to establish an 'Anti-Communist Center' under 'Political Security' with the consent of Chen Gongbo. After going to Zhejiang in May, I did not ask about it. Chen then ordered Wan Lilang to prepare for it. Wan was also working on turning against the enemy. However, this matter was not realized due to the lack of firearms and funds." He arrogantly declared: "The plan for the assault team was definitely not to fight guerrilla warfare for the Japanese. To be honest, the defendant could command 50,000 to 60,000 people in eastern Zhejiang. If I wanted to take action, I really didn't need to start from scratch." Finally, the court presented a telegram from the Military Statistics Bureau stating that from the spring of the 26th year to March of the 29th year, when 丁 served as the director of the Secret Service Headquarters, he had captured and killed more than twelve underground comrades. 丁逆 vehemently argued that he was at No. 76 in the winter of the 28th year for only three months, and he could not be responsible for matters outside of this period and outside of Shanghai. The court then ordered that strong evidence be presented. At 1:30 in the afternoon, the investigation of favorable evidence began. 丁逆 then became sorrowful again, expressing painful regret for supporting the puppet regime. Then, defense lawyer 薛斋 presented seven categories and nineteen pieces of favorable evidence to the court. After the judge questioned the first category: "Assisting the War of Resistance and Benefiting the People," one of which was "Preserving Postal Rights and Maintaining Remittances," he announced a recess. It was already 1:45 in the afternoon. The four-hour interrogation had already exhausted 丁 Xun, who was as pale as paper and leaning against the interrogation seat, gasping for breath. His condition was very miserable. After the judges, bailiffs, and 丁逆 and his lawyers had lunch, the court continued at 3:10 to question the favorable evidence. The first category, two, "Rectifying Local Politics"; the second category, "Ordered to Rescue Central Underground Workers" (1) Rescue Wu Kaixian, Ge Jianshi, Jiang Bocheng, Chen Baohua, etc.; (2) Eradicate Li Shiqun, destroy No. 76; (3) Suggest the puppet government grant amnesty. The third category: "Assisting the War of Resistance and Benefiting the Central Government," (1) Alienate Wang Ni and Li Ni Shiqun; (2) Set up a secret radio station to provide intelligence to the Central Government. The fourth category: "Refused to Take the Nominal Position at No. 76," the fifth category: "Did not Kill Xu Ke of the Military Statistics Bureau," the sixth category: "Obeyed Central Government Execution Missions" (1) Notify Okamura to send a representative to ask for surrender; (2) Assist in the takeover. The seventh category: "Surrendered to the Central Government and Submitted a Letter of Repentance," etc., either with confirmation from relevant parties or with forced interpretations. The court questioned each one strictly. The trial ended at 5:30. The court ordered a retrial on a scheduled date, and the defendant was returned to prison. This mysterious and insidious demon king was already exhausted, walking with difficulty, returning to his cell in the twilight.

Capital High Court's Initial Trial of Ding Mochun (Above) The Face of Ding Ni (Below) Scene in the Courtroom (Photo by our reporter Gu Tingpeng)

### Snippets of the "Devil's" Initial Trial

— Our Reporter in Nanjing, Pu Dejie

The court strictly questioned why he left Shanghai for Hong Kong in the 27th year. Ding Ni said: At that time, his lung disease was close to the third stage, and he also had stomach and heart problems, so he had to go to Hong Kong for medical treatment. He was further questioned why he went to Shanghai again. He said that he had lost money in business, was more familiar with Shanghai, and wanted to make a comeback; he also said that he was not used to living in Hong Kong and there was no Chinese medicine. Looking at Ding Ni in court now, his appearance is really like a third stage T, B, and the traitor business can be considered completely collapsed.

From the start of the trial at 9:45 to the recess at 1:45, the trial lasted for four hours. Ding Ni was interrogated until his face was pale, and he asked for tea twice, drinking it like an ox, and slumped weakly against the railing of the interrogation seat, gasping for breath.

The presiding judge, Judge Jin Shiding, is a French-educated judicial expert. He questioned each topic from various angles, thoroughly and strictly. Although Ding Ni had three rabbit burrows, he was exhausted from escaping, had no way to defend himself, and all the attendees admired Judge Jin's superb interrogation skills. When the court questioned the murder case of Military Statistics Bureau underground worker Miss Zheng Pingru, Ding Ni initially claimed that he did not know this person. The court said, "You can't hide it. Instead of me asking, why don't you talk about it first." Ding Ni then began to describe it, first slandering Miss Zheng's personal morals for a while, and also said, please don't write it out in the newspapers; later he wrote all the accounts in Li Shiqun's and the Japanese's books. The court couldn't help but laugh at his ability to be eloquent, charming, and self-deceiving. When the court asked about his education, Ding Ni hesitated, saying that he graduated from the Second Middle School in Hunan, and he attended many universities, but none of them graduated. He smiled as if he was embarrassed. The old light bulb of the Asian Society's photographer exploded again (the National Congress opening on the 15th was also this public performance), and Ding Shu was startled first, and then smiled like an egret. This long-time special agent leader showed that he was used to this kind of sound. Ding Ni often said when answering questions: "I am saying it very frankly..." "This cannot be shirked...". The court then said, "That's good, there is no way you can hide the facts."

Ding Ni is extremely cunning, and often dodges with "I don't remember clearly" about the time and facts. The court always pursued the matter until it was accurate and certain. Seeing that his trick failed, Ding Ni had to pretend to turn over his confession and then say it.

### Savage Talks About TVA Project: May Not Be Completed for Fifty Years, Design Work May Be Completed in Two Years

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After arriving in Beijing, Dr. Savage, the designer of the American "TVA," has been studying various materials related to China's water conservancy plan for several days. According to him in a exclusive interview with the Central News Agency reporter: "The design work of the TVA has been completed by 10%. Because the survey and measurement work has not yet been completed, the design work cannot be carried out at an ideal speed. Two years later, the design work may be completed. Once the work begins, based on the foundation of China's industrialization, it may take fifty years to complete. The power generation will reach 10,560,000 kilowatts, the irrigation of farmland will reach tens of millions of acres, and navigation will also have great convenience. At current prices, this project will cost US$950 million." Also, Mr. Sa will soon accompany Huang Yuxian, Director of the National Hydropower Engineering Bureau, and other American experts to Kaifeng, Xi'an, Lanzhou and other places to inspect the water conservancy work in the Yellow River basin. Mr. Sa is now 67 years old, and his energy is still very abundant. He has devoted himself to water conservancy engineering construction for 43 glorious years. In addition to the "TVA," his engineering projects are spread across India, Australia, Mexico and other countries.

### United China Relief Holds Banquet: Begins Fundraising for Relief: Zhang Pingqun Explains That We Are Moving Forward on the Path of Democracy

[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] United China Relief (formerly United China Relief), the United China Relief, today began a campaign throughout New York City to raise $1.25 million in relief funds. Tonight, the association held a banquet. Speakers at the meeting tonight included the chairman of the association, recently elected Morningsted Dingnius of Connecticut, the chairman of the association, McKnow, Zhang Pingqun, the Chinese Consul General in New York, and McMullen, the secretary of the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, who recently visited China and returned to the United States.

[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul General in New York, assured 400 American friends at a banquet hosted by United China Relief tonight: "The goal of the Chinese government is to make China a unified, peaceful, and democratic country." China is now advancing on the path of democracy. At the opening of the United China Relief fundraising campaign, Mr. Zhang thanked the American supporters of the United China Relief for their unlimited help. Mr. Zhang said: If the Chinese people can have the opportunity to work in peace, they will be able to put the country on track and improve their living standards with diligence and perseverance, so as to contribute to world prosperity. When Mr. Zhang discussed the continuous criticism of the Chinese National Government and the Kuomintang by some people in the United States, he said: This kind of criticism is really unfair, because if there are any bad phenomena, they are formed over a long period of time and are not easy to eliminate in a short period of time. Mr. Zhang also urged the audience to pay attention: "Although China has encountered countless difficulties, it can actually achieve unity to some extent from the chaos, and achieve construction in uncertain situations." Regarding the internal disputes in China, Mr. Zhang said: "We firmly believe that unless China is internally unified, China's construction is really impossible. In other words, first unify and then start reform work." Mr. Zhang continued: The Chinese government cannot tolerate the Communist Party, destroying transportation? Abandoning political agreements, and military expansion to seize national power. But Mr. Zhang finally said: The government is now preparing to continue to use political means to solve the problem of the Chinese Communist Party in order to achieve unity.

### Editorial: The End of a Phase in Peace Negotiations

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative, Zhou Enlai, took an American plane yesterday morning to return to Yan'an, bringing the more than ten-month-long, on-again, off-again negotiations between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP to an end. Recalling the "Double Tenth Agreement Minutes" jointly issued by the KMT and the CCP last year, didn't it clearly proclaim a common principle? It stipulated that both the KMT and the CCP would "cooperate in the long term under the leadership of Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek], resolutely avoid civil war, build an independent, free, prosperous, and strong New China, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People." The two parties also agreed that "political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equal and legal status for all parties advocated by Chairman Chiang are the ways to achieve peaceful nation-building and freedom." However, over the past ten months, not only has the foundation for these peace negotiations not been expanded, but even the name of the CCP's Political Consultative Conference delegation has disappeared. Tracing the on-again, off-again peace talks of the past ten months, I don't know how many twists and turns there have been. One moment, it seemed like a breakthrough, and the future looked optimistic; but the next moment, darkness descended from all sides, and everything seemed bleak, leaving us, the ordinary citizens watching from the sidelines, almost lost in a fog, completely baffled. Sometimes, it was even a mix of laughter and tears. Now, it's finally clear: the government, with a spirit of tolerance, has repeatedly yielded, issuing three cease-fire orders in succession, but still failed to achieve domestic peace. The government has also repeatedly postponed the convening of the National Assembly, hoping that the CCP would realize its errors; however, the CCP's attitude remained stubbornly unchanged. It not only refused to participate in the National Assembly but also tried every possible means to undermine it, causing the peace talks to break down. Therefore, the CCP should bear full responsibility for the current stalemate, and it cannot evade it. The CCP's stubbornness is tantamount to isolating itself from the people of the country. We really feel sorry for the CCP. Now that the peace talks have come to an end, the future political development will naturally depend on how the government gives full play to the spirit of "doing its best."

This National Assembly, regardless of whether the CCP participates or not, opened in Nanjing on the 15th of this month, which is enough to prove that the government is indeed determined to return power to the people. Therefore, the people of the whole country have expressed warm welcome and support for the opening of this National Assembly and have placed unlimited hopes on it, hoping that Chinese politics will embark on a new era of peaceful nation-building. However, the sacred task of this National Assembly is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, and the implementation of the new constitution requires the government to hold general elections on schedule within six months after the closing of the National Assembly, in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution, to elect representatives to the National Assembly to carry out the task of implementing the constitution. Therefore, during the session of this National Assembly, in addition to paying close attention to the National Assembly's drafting of the constitution, we must also pay attention to the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan. Regarding the constitutional issue, this newspaper's editorial has already discussed it, and we still hope that this National Assembly can formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution to open up a good start for our country's politics to embark on the road of peace and democracy, so as to promote national prosperity and progress. This goes without saying.

Regarding the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, the Democratic Socialist Party also regards this as one of the conditions for its participation in the National Assembly. At the same time, according to informal representations from government representatives, "the reorganization of the government is under consideration, but it can only be discussed with the parties after the lists of all parties are submitted, so during the National Assembly session, the National Government Committee can be reorganized, and the quotas for the CCP and the Democratic League in the National Government Committee will still be reserved. As for the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, due to the time issue, it must be implemented after the opening of the National Assembly." We can also judge from common sense that issues such as the selection of the Premier of the Executive Yuan and how to expand the foundation of the Executive Yuan, since all parties have gathered in one place due to the convening of the National Assembly, will definitely be discussed at this time.

The accumulated malpractices of Chinese politics today are nothing more than two points: First, the widespread decline in administrative efficiency. Whether in central or local administrative organs, from the responsible officials to the clerks, there are very few capable and experienced talents, and there is simply no such thing as administrative efficiency. Second, the prevalence of corruption. Judging from the current situation in political circles, we are increasingly convinced that to reform politics, we must start with rectifying the political atmosphere. Recently, the calls for political reform have been loud, but what is the actual effect? It is difficult to say. The people's yearning for good governance is like looking to the clouds in a severe drought, and it is really too urgent. However, from the closing of this constitutional National Assembly to the opening of the next constitutional National Assembly, there is still six months, which is a transitional period for returning power to the people. The government should fully demonstrate the spirit of "doing its best" to jointly plan national affairs with all parties and factions, and must also voluntarily reorganize the government, recruit national talents and leaders from all parties and circles, form a government of national unity, not only strive for efficiency in its administration but also create an honest political atmosphere, so as to lay the foundation for a democratic rule of law.

There is another factor that cannot be ignored in China's political journey towards democracy, and that is progress. Democracy should not only pursue its name, nor can it be achieved overnight. To gradually democratize politics, progress must be sought in stability. However, our country is a country with many difficulties. After eight years of war, the wounds are deep and painful, and in addition, everything is backward. The foundation of the country has not yet been firmly established. Although it cannot be said that it is in a state of turmoil, it can at least be said that the foundation is not yet stable. In today's world of turbulent waves, how can we seek the independent survival of the country? And how can we stand shoulder to shoulder with the great powers? We must rush forward day and night and catch up. Therefore, we hope that the reorganized government can be full of vigorous and healthy vitality, create a practical and honest political atmosphere, and eliminate all the habits of bureaucratic politics. After observing the political trends of various countries in the post-war world, we are increasingly convinced that Chinese politics should also embark on this road of progress. Taking British politics as an example, after the war, a general election was held, and the Labour Party was able to overwhelm the Conservative Party and come to power. For more than a year, although the Labour Party has made few achievements in domestic and foreign affairs, the general public has not lost its trust in the Labour Party. In the partial reorganization of the British cabinet last month, several young and promising junior members were appointed to the cabinet, which injected a lot of new blood into British politics and made it more energetic. Secondly, taking the US election as an example, the greatest significance of the Republican Party's victory can be seen as an expression of the American people's desire for progress. Similarly, the result of the recent French general election, in which the Communist Party jumped to the first place in the new parliament, also lies in this. Therefore, the partial reorganization of the British cabinet last month can serve as a demonstration for the reorganization of our government.

In short, the constitution formulated by this National Assembly is indeed a major step in the start of our country's constitutional administration, but in the transitional period, how the government should prepare for the implementation of constitutional government, so as to open up a good start for our country's democratic politics, is really too closely and significantly related to the future political development. Therefore, we hope that all parties will consider the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan carefully and deliberate for a long time, so as to make the reorganized government look brand new, safely pass through this transitional period of returning power to the people, and enter a truly constitutional new era, laying a solid foundation for the long-term stability and security of the country.

### A Major Embezzlement Case in Suzhou. The Full Story Has Not Yet Been Revealed and is Under Investigation. It is Said to Be Extortion from Underground Banks.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 19th] Fan Junbo, supervisor of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce, senator, and president of the Suzhou Daily, and Lu Shaofen, president of the Suzhou Business Daily, are both local celebrities, but they were suddenly summoned by the garrison command a few days ago for four or five hours. Lu Tiesun, chairman of the front-line industry association, was also involved in the case. After the news leaked, social opinion was uniformly closely watching, and everyone wanted to know the inside story as soon as possible. According to reliable sources: there is indeed an unprecedented and shocking major embezzlement case hidden within. Specifically, it has recently been discovered that someone, under the guise of political and military agencies, extorted 30 million yuan from illegal underground banks. The garrison authorities believe that their military reputation is involved, so they are determined to thoroughly investigate it. Summoning Fan and Lu is to collect evidence.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 19th] Although underground banks in Zhenjiang have disappeared, usury is still prevalent. Small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises are trying to survive under the high-interest exploitation of one cent per day. The Suzhou Party and Government Reform Committee is paying close attention to the suppression of usury and is seeking effective ways to petition the authorities for suppression and relief.

### Anhui Provincial Government Holds Meeting on Financial Balance. Major Highways to be Repaired During Slack Season for Each Crop.

[Our Newspaper, Hefei] Since the financial reform in Anhui Province, the balance of revenue and expenditure for this year is over 2 billion yuan. The provincial-level finances are in great deficit, and according to the statistics of the accounting office of the Department of Finance for the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], the expenditure needs more than 110 billion yuan, and the income is only more than 20 billion yuan, a difference of as much as 90 billion yuan. It is inevitable to formulate measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditure to adjust it. Revenue-increasing measures include: (1) Increasing the price of grain levied, (2) Rectifying the collection of taxes. Expenditure-reducing measures include: (1) Cutting redundant agencies, (2) Reducing redundant personnel, (3) Starting from next year, the county-level grain offices will be changed to county-level salaries. According to the overall plan, the difference is still more than 20 billion yuan. The Department of Finance has prepared a financial revenue and expenditure statement for the 36th year, which will be submitted to the provincial government's regular meeting for resolution.

### A Cry from Refugees from Funing

I am from Funing, where I narrowly escaped death on October 19th. I only managed to escape to Shanghai alone on the 28th. I will now relate the actions of the Communist army in Funing to the people of the whole country.

1. All children, both boys and girls, around the age of ten and women, as well as old men up to the age of sixty, are forcibly conscripted, ostensibly to attend meetings, but in reality, they are sent to the front lines to boost morale and serve as cannon fodder. Those who are unwilling to go are immediately shot. The cries are earth-shattering and heart-wrenching.

2. Recently, in villages and towns, apart from one or two hundred elderly, weak, and disabled people huddled at their doorsteps, most of the young men and women who could not escape have secretly fled to desolate beaches, gathering as many as sixty or seventy thousand people. However, because food has been blockaded by the Communist army and there is no neighboring National Revolutionary Army to rescue them, they have no clothes or food, and they live in the open air, counting the days and looking forward to the National Revolutionary Army.

3. All one or two fair-minded intellectuals in the Communist area who are unwilling to join the Communist Party have been completely slaughtered.

4. Every village must hand over forty cowhides within a limited time, otherwise, they will be charged with being anti-democratic.

The above facts are all heard and witnessed by the author and are in no way fabricated. Therefore, most of the refugees fleeing on the Beijing-Shanghai line cry out in unison when they hear this, regretting their helplessness. They can only make a final appeal to our military and political authorities and to all the fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters in the country, pleading for our benevolent army to rescue them as soon as possible. We also ask the Communist side to have compassion and refrain from killing the innocent and forcibly conscripting women and children. We are anxiously awaiting orders - (Shi Ying, a newly arrived refugee from Northern Jiangsu)

### Rabid Dogs That Injure People Must Be Put Down Early

Recently, there has been a rabid dog in the area between Yangjiadu and Dongchang Road in Pudong, along Xinmalu, which often bites people, causing unexpected accidents to pedestrians. A few days ago, two children were bitten to death, and yesterday, a soldier from the 438th Regiment became insane after being bitten by a rabid dog. As a result, people are panicked and warn their children to avoid the area. However, rabies is highly contagious, and if it is not put down soon, it will inevitably spread everywhere as dogs bite each other. This matter concerns the safety of the lives of Pudong residents. We hope that the military and police authorities will capture and kill it as soon as possible. The citizens will be very grateful! (Zhang Tianyou)

### On Behalf of the Post Office

Reply to Mr. Zhang Daoquan: Regarding your letter pointing out a matter of enrollment at Nanjing Temporary University, we have received a reply from the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education stating: "An investigation reveals that there is no Zhang Daoquan among the students in the remedial class of Nanjing Temporary University. The Ministry's review of students' high school diplomas is based on those stamped by educational administrative agencies. If the student is found to have forged documents, they can be reported to the Ministry at any time." This is a special reply.

### "Traitor Party" Amendment Rejected: British House of Commons Trusts Government

Supporting UN Institutions as the Foundation of Foreign Policy

[Our Newspaper London Special Correspondent, 19th] The House of Commons rejected yesterday, by a vote of 353, an amendment on British foreign policy. A majority of Labour MPs abstained from voting. Prime Minister Attlee and the Cabinet are extremely concerned about this, because although the House unanimously rejected the amendment to British foreign policy, the fact is that between sixty and one hundred Labour MPs abstained from voting. Diplomatic sources predict that Foreign Secretary Bevin will pre-empt in the United Nations meeting in New York on the Spanish issue, in order to resist stronger demands from the Soviet Union. Bevin may suggest that the UN General Assembly provide economic assistance to Spain after the Franco regime is overthrown.

[United Press London, 19th] The House of Commons yesterday unanimously expressed confidence in the foreign policy pursued by Foreign Secretary Bevin. Fifty-eight Labour MPs had proposed that the Labour government's foreign policy should follow a "middle path between the Soviet Union and the United States." The result of the vote was 353 votes to zero against.

[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] The British House of Commons met today to continue debating the　book published by the King. During the session, Labour MP Crossman, speaking as a spokesman for the "Traitor Party" MPs, delivered a speech criticizing the Sino-American Commercial Treaty and supporting amendments to Britain's current foreign policy, expressing dissatisfaction with both Communism and anti-Communism. He said that the Soviet Union was attempting to incorporate Eastern European countries into its economic system, and that our government had repeatedly lodged protests against this, which he considered extremely appropriate. However, in the commercial treaty signed by China and the United States a few days ago, the United States forcibly stipulated the right of economic intervention in China. Why did the British government not say a word? Furthermore, the United States has stated that it will retain the bases it obtained from Japan. What will the result be if it does so? I would like to raise three questions for the government to answer: (1) Did the government deny the policy revealed by former Prime Minister Churchill in his speech in Fulton, USA? (2) Has the government signed an agreement with the US government to standardize military equipment between the two countries? (3) Have senior staff officers of the British and American militaries held talks? I know for sure that the British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff still exist, and I have also learned from responsible sources that Britain and the United States are still exchanging secret intelligence. Given the current international situation, Germany, Japan, and Italy have all surrendered. Who is the target of their intelligence gathering? If so, is it not in fact an alliance? This is enough to prove that the government has disregarded the promises it made and is acting in accordance with Churchill's speech in the United States. Britain must implement an independent foreign policy, opposing any international bloc, that is almost certain.

Conservative Party's Statement

Conservative MP Crookshank spoke after Labour MP Crossman, saying that the Conservative Party would continue to support the government's foreign policy, but that the government's policy in Germany was unsatisfactory. The results of the treaty negotiations that Stangate conducted with Egypt on behalf of the government were also unsatisfactory. In addition, the unstable situation in Palestine was also cause for concern. However, if the government were to split, the Conservative Party would still vote in favor of the government, he said.

### Prime Minister Attlee's Defense: Denies Forming a Bloc Against the Soviet Union; Claims No Separate Alliance with the United States; Sino-US Commercial Treaty is Largely the Same as Those Signed with the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] British Prime Minister Attlee recently declared in the House of Commons: Before reading the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, I asked someone to get me a copy. After reading it once, I found that it was only an ordinary commercial treaty. It is no different from the commercial treaties that our country has signed with other countries, as well as the commercial treaties that the United States and the Soviet Union have signed with other countries. Why is this treaty considered an example of American imperialism? It is difficult to understand. The signing of a commercial treaty between China and the United States is not an example of one country invading another. Regarding the issue of British defense, it is foolish to think that Britain can compete with the United States or the Soviet Union in terms of military equipment. We only want to ensure our own national defense. We plan to contribute to the United Nations. Although several international　meetings and economic institutions have sincerely invited the Soviet Union to participate, the Soviet Union has consistently considered them inappropriate and has not sent representatives to participate. Can we not therefore establish these institutions with other countries? If a powerful country is allowed to choose certain political parties in its occupied territories as its "protectors," it will have unfortunate consequences for international cooperation. Nothing could be worse than this. If we can view Germany as a complete economic unit, the situation may be better than it is now. Labour MP Crossman said that the government is only flattering the United States and is unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union. This argument is due to MP Crossman's misunderstanding of the facts. All of MP Crossman's claims are not factual. The government does not believe that Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Central Europe should form blocs or form hostile blocs. We will support the United Nations. There are many serious issues for which the opinions of the United States, the Soviet Union, and our country are not consistent. But if MPs think that countries around the world are organizing blocs, this view is a fallacy. We may be more willing to compromise than some other countries, but compromise should be the basis of peaceful civilization, so we do not want to form an alliance with the United States. Regarding the speech that former Prime Minister Churchill delivered in Fulton, USA, the government did not reply, because the government is not responsible for replying to opinions expressed by people in their private capacity. In addition, because British troops are still jointly occupying some areas of Europe with American troops, Britain should continue to cooperate with the American staff. In short, the government and the majority of people in the United Nations still fully trust Foreign Secretary Bevin and hope that the House will also clearly express its support for Foreign Secretary Bevin.

### French Communist Party Leader Talks About Foreign Policy

Agreements Must Be Formed With Britain and the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse London, 18th] French Communist Party leader Thorez spoke to a London Times correspondent in Paris today, calling for the Allied countries to unite and form a common front to prevent Germany from attempting to rearm itself or economically control the European continent. He said: Regarding the Communist Party's foreign policy, it took a unique stance before the war, opposing the so-called non-interference policy and the Munich appeasement of Germany. Our position on foreign policy, especially on the issues of security and compensation, has been approved by the French public opinion circles. We hope to eliminate Fascism and effectively disarm Germany. We believe that it is not only necessary, but also indispensable for France to form an agreement with the three Allied countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We oppose any policy that promotes the formation of blocs.

### Intense Debate in the Trusteeship Committee

[Reuters New York, 18th] During a debate in a subcommittee of the UN Trusteeship Committee today, the Indian representative suggested that all trustee territories should be governed by the UN agency itself. Soviet representative Novikov Tian advocated for the full discussion of the Indian proposal, and Iraq also seconded the Indian proposal.

[United Press New York, 18th] US representative Dulles declared in the Trusteeship Committee today that the Committee's discussion "proves that we are unable to handle any events." Representatives from other countries mostly said that India's proposal was only a formality. According to the UN Charter, if a trusteeship is to be transferred, the consent of the trustee country must first be obtained, but the Soviet Union still insisted on discussing it. The Soviet Union also criticized South Africa's request to merge Southwest Africa and Britain's refusal to submit a draft trusteeship of Palestine.

### The Romanian General Election Amidst Assassinations in Various Places

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th (Radio): Eight million Romanians today held their first general election in nine years. Assassinations occurred in various places, and all parties attacked each other. According to the National Peasant Party, the government implemented terror, and seven leaders of the party were assassinated this morning.

[United Press, Romanian Capital, 19th] Sources today claimed that whether the Communist-controlled government of Romanian Prime Minister Groza is supported by the people will be tested in Tuesday's parliamentary elections. Both Britain and the United States have protested Romania's election, believing it has failed to fully guarantee the opposition's right to hold free and democratic votes. Romanian military police are prepared to suppress any violence that may arise if public sentiment is agitated before the election. Riots occurred in the Romanian capital on Sunday. King Michael of Romania enjoys strong popular support, which is not an issue in this election.

### The Five Powers Discuss the Veto Power; China Proposes Principles for Simplifying Voting Procedures; The Soviet Union Declares Its Right to Reserve "Rejection of All Suggestions"

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, proposed principles for simplifying the Security Council's voting procedures during today's discussion of the veto power at the Five Power Conference in New York. Gu suggested adding a provision to the Security Council's procedural principles, stipulating that the inclusion or deletion of items on the agenda should be considered within the scope of voting procedures and not subject to the veto power. The suggestion also stipulated that whether an issue is a situation or a dispute should also be considered within the scope of procedure. The content of Gu's suggestion is as follows: (1) Before voting on an important issue, an opportunity for consultation should be provided to reach an agreement. (2) When a permanent member abstains from voting on an issue that is not within the scope of procedure, it should not be regarded as a veto. (3) The issue of including items on the agenda should be considered within the scope of procedure. (4) The issue of deleting items on the agenda should be considered within the scope of procedure. (5) The decision of whether an issue is a situation or a dispute should be considered within the scope of procedure.

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in a dramatic gesture at the Five Great Powers Conference today, reiterated that the veto power within the Security Council as stipulated in the Charter shall not be modified or abolished. However, he agreed to consider the proposals of the United Kingdom, the United States, and China to automatically restrict the use of the veto power, while still reserving the right to oppose them in the future. Molotov also stated that he did not know what significance it would have to burden the Security Council with more red tape. It is evident that Molotov firmly opposed the adoption of the "Rules of Conduct" proposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin to restrict the use of the veto power. Molotov also opposed China's proposal to suspend the discussion of the veto power issue in the General Assembly's Political Committee for two or three days to allow the Five Great Powers Conference to discuss the matter at length. However, the Chinese proposal was eventually passed by the Political Committee with 38 votes to 6, with 5 abstentions.

### Chinese Delegate Urges Establishment of an International Food Agency

The Chinese delegate resolutely proposed the establishment of a drafting committee to begin work immediately to resolve the food problem, as this issue is critical to the lives of millions and cannot be delayed.

### Nikerov Succeeds as Commander of the Soviet Army

### The Four Foreign Ministers Reach a Practical Agreement on the Trieste Issue; Belgium Plans to Request Boundary Revisions

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] The four foreign ministers, in a spirit of mutual concession last night, reached a practical agreement on the issue of the powers of the future Governor of Trieste. The agreement is generally the same as the draft chapter proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, with only minor revisions. After the meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said to his colleagues with a smile: "Today I made considerable concessions; when we discuss the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Trieste, do not forget this point." The original text of the agreement has been handed over to the representatives of the foreign ministers for final revision.

[United Press, Beijing, 18th] It is reported that Belgium is about to request a revision of the Belgian-German border to make it a straight line, correcting the current deformed state. Today's editorial in the "Liberation Daily" calls for straightening the Belgian-German border so that the cities of Aachen and the Urfa Dam are included in Belgian territory. It is reported that in addition to territorial claims, Belgium will also demand huge reparations, which the foreign ministry is currently studying.

### Fierce Fighting in the Northern Mountainous Areas of Greece; Government Reinforcements Suppress Guerillas; Southern National Army Moves Closer to the Greek Border

[Our Newspaper Correspondent, London, 19th] The sporadic clashes between Greece and Yugoslavia along the border have evolved into large-scale warfare. With the help of aircraft and artillery, the government forces have forced the guerrillas back to the southern border. The guerrillas' strong defense line in the Zhina Mountains has been broken by government forces, and government forces have now recovered the border positions. It is reported that the guerrillas once penetrated as far as six miles into Greek territory a few days ago. The Greek government has announced that this war is by no means a small-scale conflict and is in fact no different from a formal war.

[Reuters, Athens, 18th] Military sources: Since Saturday, fierce fighting has broken out between the Greek government forces and mountain guerrillas in the Skra Mountain area. The guerrillas have used heavy weapons and machine guns.

[United Press, Athens, 18th] Greek fighter jets and reinforcements were reportedly dispatched today to participate in the operation against the guerrillas. The guerrillas attacked the village of Grachinchiros, west of Skra village near the Yugoslav border, for the third time in five days. According to the Thessaloniki military newspaper, the attacking troops came from across the border, penetrating one and a quarter miles deep into the Greek defense line. Reinforcements rushed to the village, inflicting heavy casualties on the guerrillas, who retreated in panic, leaving corpses scattered on the battlefield. In addition, the Greek General Staff reported to Prime Minister Tsaldaris on all attacks near the border since October 1, so that it could be forwarded to the British and American ambassadors to Greece. The two ambassadors are scheduled to visit the Prime Minister today. Sources close to the foreign ministry said that the Yugoslav army has moved closer to the border, but the number of troops is unknown. More than fifty residents of Skra village have been killed.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 18th] Greek Liberal Party leader Venizelos tonight asked the Tsaldaris cabinet to resign in the House of Representatives and form a national unity government.

### Factionalism; A Tempest in a Teapot; Could Lead to Large-Scale Conflict; Observations on the Streets of India

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 18th] A cyclist colliding with a pedestrian would not be news anywhere in the world, but it might be in India today. One day, an elderly Muslim man was riding his bicycle down a street in New Delhi when he collided with a pedestrian, and an argument ensued. Two other Muslims intervened, accusing the pedestrian of trying to harm the cyclist. Bystanders gathered to watch, including this reporter. When the pedestrian said that he was also a Muslim, the two arbitrators changed their tone and rebuked the cyclist, saying, "You doddering old man, you haven't learned how to ride a bicycle properly and you're recklessly colliding with your fellow Muslims!" The commotion then subsided. If the pedestrian had been a Hindu, then this tempest in a teapot might have led to a large-scale religious conflict.

### China in the Minds of the British People

— Sent by Our Newspaper's Resident Correspondent in the UK, Zhu Zunzhu

[London, Airmail on November 5] Recently, a British Member of Parliament raised two questions with me about China: (1) China is currently embroiled in war, the United States supports Chairman Chiang, and the Chinese Communists apparently have the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union. Will this situation, if it continues to develop, escalate into World War III? (2) The United States is currently monopolizing trade with China. In the future, will other countries, including Britain, be excluded from the Chinese market?

In the minds of the British people who generally care about China, these are two big question marks. First, they fear that the world will once again be plunged into war, and second, they fear losing the 450 million Chinese customers. During the past eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, because there was no trade to speak of between Britain and China, and the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East had not yet become clear, the attitude of the British people towards China was indifferent. Most people believed that the Chinese battlefield was not important. After the war ended, the British Empire, which relies on foreign trade for its livelihood, opened one eye and looked at the Far East, and the two terrifying questions above spontaneously arose. The world situation is already dark enough in both politics and economics, but in the Far East, the clouds seem to be even denser!

After the abolition of the unequal treaties, the concessions no longer exist, and China, which was regarded as a semi-colony, has changed its past practice of handling foreign affairs and flattering foreigners. Where did past British merchants know about Chinese law? Where were they willing to go to Chinese courts? In addition, with the current inflation, soaring prices, traffic congestion, and widespread suffering, the adventurous British merchants cannot help but sigh repeatedly, believing that the world has completely changed. The Chinese paradise has disappeared with the war, and everything in China has reached a hopeless state. The news they send back, as well as the reports of some British merchants who have returned to Britain, portray China as a pitch-black mass. A group of so-called "Old China Hands" are even gnashing their teeth, believing that the future is bleak. The China in their minds was nothing more than the concessions in Shanghai and other places, so the Shanghai municipality after the return of the concessions to China is the spearhead of their attacks. They believe that China is not worthy of ruling a modern city like Shanghai.

The China seen in British newspapers and magazines is precisely an example of these unfavorable comments about China. The news from China is either civil war or corruption; either inflation or famine and death. Most readers do not have ill feelings towards China, and their reaction is only sympathy. However, some British people who sympathize with the Chinese Communists take the opportunity to exaggerate and make a big fuss about it.

Although British merchants are drooling over the Chinese market, under the current circumstances, most of them are hesitant to move forward, and their attitude is to wait and see. Sir McGowan, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, said very frankly: A stable Chinese political situation is a prerequisite for British assistance in China's industrialization. Now that China is in the midst of civil war, the economy is shaky, and the government organization has not become sound, at least Imperial Chemical Industries does not intend to invest in China for the time being. McGowan then said in a self-consoling tone: In the foreseeable future, the British economic recovery work will require a large number of technical personnel, and there is no time to look abroad. Imperial Chemical Industries is the largest chemical company in Britain, and McGowan's attitude can represent the general view of large capitalists. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Import Permit System Implemented Yesterday; Goods Reported with Permits for Import; Registration of Importers Conducted Simultaneously; Bei Zuyi Calls on President Song to Report on Work Progress

In order to strengthen the management of import trade, the government has implemented revised interim regulations for import trade and established a provisional Import Management Committee implementing committee under the Supreme Economic Committee. The committee has been established in Shanghai, and the import permit system for imported goods was implemented yesterday. For goods ordered before November 17 (the date of the announcement) but not yet declared for import, it is also necessary to obtain a supplementary import permit for customs clearance and foreign exchange settlement. Import permit application forms can be obtained from designated foreign exchange banks. After filling them out according to the instructions, an import permit will be issued after review and approval, and the goods will be reported for import with the permit. The authorities' move is aimed at reducing the import of non-essential goods, so the authorities will do their utmost to prevent illegal smuggling of goods by unscrupulous merchants in the future. In addition to the Port Reorganization Committee's security and investigation team being responsible for strengthening the seizure of goods in Shanghai, measures will also be taken to strengthen the crackdown on rampant smuggling in southern China. President Bei of the Central Bank has specially dispatched the bank's Business Bureau Director Lin Fengbao to fly to Guangdong to inspect the situation and discuss methods to ban the import of smuggled goods with the local military and political authorities. Bei himself will also go to the area for inspection soon. However, China's coastline is very long, and it is extremely difficult to completely eliminate unscrupulous merchants' smuggling of goods. Therefore, the authorities urgently hope that businesses can cooperate with the government to eliminate the evil practice of smuggling. In addition, in order to strengthen the management of importers and exporters, the authorities began to register importers yesterday. Those who were already operating before December 8, 1941, or who have been operating since then and are recognized as agents of foreign manufacturers, or who can prove that they have the ability to engage in import trade, may apply for registration.

Premier of the Executive Yuan Song Ziwen arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning at around 9:00, he went to the Central Bank Building to handle official business and met with Deputy Premier Weng Wenhao, Director General of Customs Li Du, Mayor Wu Guozhen, and others to discuss matters. He did not leave until 1:30 in the afternoon. At around 2:00, President Bei Zuyi of the Central Bank went to Song's private residence to meet with him and report on the progress and promotion of the work of the provisional Import Management Committee implementing committee recently established in Shanghai. After 4:00, Song returned to the Central Bank to work, and Weng visited again and had a long conversation.

### American Businessmen Discuss Feelings on the Implementation of Import Permits

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Since the administrative authorities announced the implementation of the import permit system, most American businessmen in Shanghai are still studying the measures in detail. Merchants who do not engage in import and export business avoid mentioning their feelings about the new measures, but those whose main business is import and export sometimes frankly express their positions. Yesterday, this reporter met with an American manager of a large foreign firm. He said that the detailed measures are still under study, but he has three impressions of the Chinese government's actions: (1) The purpose of these measures is to improve China's economic situation, which is not objectionable in itself. However, based on his past experience in China, measures and implementation are two different things. We hope that the government can implement these measures in a completely fair and impartial manner. (2) The Chinese government has imported a large number of radio equipment in the past few months, regarding them as commodities needed by the people. However, in the new measures, they have been listed as goods subject to strict restrictions. His company is not mainly engaged in the import of radio equipment, so the impact on him is not significant. However, he does know that there are some small Chinese trading companies that make a living from this, and the new measures will put them out of business. It is clearly unfair to ban civilian imports of radio equipment simply because the government owns a large amount of radio equipment. (3) Unless the import quotas are clearly announced and information is exchanged frankly, this measure cannot be said to be in conflict with the spirit of the new Sino-US commercial treaty. The new measures will not reduce the total volume of trade in the short term, but in the long term, they will reduce the volume of international trade. He concluded by saying that his views can represent the common views of most American businessmen in China. They have been doing business in China for many years and have developed feelings for China. They all hope to stay for a long time, expand their own businesses, and also be willing to do their best to assist in China's construction work.

### Beijing-Shanghai Train Post Office to Begin Operations Today

Postal news: In order to accelerate postal transportation between Beijing and Shanghai, the Directorate General of Posts has ordered the Beijing and Shanghai Post Offices to dispatch personnel to the Beijing and Shanghai Railway Administrations, respectively, to pre-sort and dispatch Beijing-Shanghai mail so that it can be delivered upon arrival. In addition, a train post office will be established on the daily overnight express trains running between Beijing and Shanghai, and personnel from the Beijing and Shanghai Post Offices will be dispatched to sort the Beijing-Shanghai mail dispatched by the two offices and the mail from the bureaus along the way that is handed over to the train. The goal is to ensure that mail sent between Beijing and Shanghai is received no later than the day after tomorrow. The train post office will also sell stamps and accept ordinary, registered, and express mail. It is reported that the Shanghai Postal Administration has complied with the order and is scheduled to begin operations today.

### Vice Chairman of the British Chinese Chamber of Commerce Talks About High Domestic Prices; Remittances from Overseas Chinese Are Far Less Than Before; Hopes for Proper Measures for Repaying the Principal of National Salvation Bonds; Handicrafts Are Most Popular and Should Not Be Neglected

According to Li Zigun, vice chairman of the British Chinese Chamber of Commerce, who recently returned from London to attend the Sichuan seat of the National Federation of Commerce Representatives: There are approximately over 10,000 overseas Chinese in Europe, of whom over 1,000 reside in Liverpool, England, over 600 in London, and the remainder of over 8,000 are scattered throughout the European continent, such as Germany and the Netherlands. The majority of them are employed as sailors, in restaurants, and in the laundry business. Their average weekly income is eight pounds, and their expenses are approximately two pounds per week. The remainder is mostly deposited in local postal savings bureaus. Overseas Chinese are concerned about the soaring domestic prices, which are nearly the same as the cost of war bonds purchased in England in 1931. The authorities should take proper measures regarding the exchange rate between legal tender and the pound at that time. The domestic political situation is of the utmost concern to the overseas Chinese. This time, the overseas Chinese are willing to return to China and assist in technical skills and capital. In the past, the Japanese deeply understood this mentality and often imitated them, labeling them with the words "Made in China" and mixing them into the European market to make huge profits. If China promotes export trade, these handicrafts should not be neglected. Moreover, the import tax rate there is approximately one-third of the value, which is far less than the 150% rate required for the import of raw silk. The reason for such restrictions on the import of raw silk is that the English artificial silk business is often related to government officials, so they allow it to develop as much as possible.

### American Medical Aid to China Association to Focus on Medical Education; Raising Funds in the United States to Help China Develop

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Mr. Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Health Committee of the Executive Yuan, has recently also been appointed as the Health Director of the American Medical Aid to China Association. According to Mr. Liu, the American Medical Aid to China Association is currently raising funds in the United States. It is still difficult to say how much money can be raised, but the amount is likely to be small. Next year, the association will focus on developing medical education. There are currently more than 50 public and private medical schools in China. The association's new plan is to select and provide special assistance to five or six of these medical schools due to financial constraints. The assistance plan is divided into three aspects: (1) providing teaching equipment and medical supplies; (2) sending professors to the United States for further study; (3) hiring foreign professors to teach in China. The association will not provide assistance for school expenses or building construction.

### Inauguration of the Pharmaceutical Policy Symposium; Discussion of Standards for Commercial Medical Equipment

The Pharmaceutical Policy Symposium, hosted by the Ministry of Health, opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday at the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Experimental Factory of the Central Biochemical Pharmaceutical Experiment Bureau of the Ministry of Health on Shangqiu Road.

Deputy Director Fang presided over the symposium. The Pharmaceutical Policy Symposium was held jointly with the Drafting Committee for Standards for Medical Equipment, the Editorial Committee for the Second Edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and the Pharmaceutical Policy Design Committee. The meeting decided to first discuss standards for medical equipment. In the afternoon, group meetings were held, and the general assembly of the Pharmaceutical Policy Symposium also took place. Several important cases were passed, and a consensus was reached on the adjustment of drug and equipment production. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The symposium is scheduled for two days, with the aim of fully discussing all aspects of pharmaceutical policy. It is expected to be extended by one day and will close tomorrow.

### Land Registration Measures for French Nationals Formulated Based on the New Treaty

[Reported by This Newspaper] The land registration measures for lands owned by French nationals in this city have been formulated by the Land Administration Bureau based on the new Sino-French treaty and the discussions held by Mayor Wu, Director Zhu, and the French Consul General. According to reporters, the main points are as follows:

1.  French nationals who own land in this city and hold deeds from the French Consulate, "Dao" deeds, or land ownership certificates, which are definitively owned by the French national, should immediately register with the Land Administration Bureau and exchange them for a land ownership certificate.

2.  French nationals who hold provisional receipts, field slips, or other temporary land certificates should also apply to the Land Administration Bureau for registration in their own name and be issued an ownership certificate.

3.  French nationals applying for land registration should first bring the relevant documents to the French Consulate to provide a statement confirming that the property rights belong to them. The French Consulate will review the deeds and issue a certificate.

### Closure of the National Assembly Reception Station in Shanghai

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Government previously established a reception station for National Assembly representatives at the Jinmen Hotel to assist with purchasing train tickets and arranging accommodation. As the number of representatives passing through Shanghai has decreased recently, the station was closed yesterday. Representatives needing the Municipal Government's assistance can contact the Protocol Section. Furthermore, Fang Xikong, Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wu Shaoshu, Director of the Youth League, will host a banquet for National Assembly representatives from Xinjiang at the Friends of the Military Society at 7:00 p.m. today.

### Extension of Company Registration by Two Months; Penalties for Non-Compliance; Businesses Must Not Call Themselves Companies Without Authorization

The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau previously received instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulating that any business using the name of a company should be investigated by the local authorities and ordered to cancel the company name in the newspaper. They should also be ordered to register as a commercial enterprise in accordance with the law. Companies that have not yet registered should be ordered to register within a specified period, and those who refuse to comply should be punished in accordance with the Company Law, and ordered to register within a specified period without delay. After receiving the order, the bureau published a notice banning ordinary businesses from calling themselves companies, and all companies that had not yet registered were required to complete registration before the end of October of this year. As the deadline has passed, and there are still many businesses that are not companies but use company names without removing the word "company," and companies that have not yet registered with the bureau, the bureau, out of consideration for the business community, and possibly due to a lack of clarity regarding the procedures for company registration under the Company Law, has extended the registration period by two months to the end of December of this year. Penalties will be imposed for non-compliance, and no further leniency will be granted. The bureau has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to urge all businesses to comply. It is hoped that businesses using company names without authorization will immediately cancel the company name and apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for commercial registration to avoid penalties. Companies that are actually companies but have delayed registration should pay attention to their own legal interests and quickly complete registration in accordance with the law, and not delay and make mistakes.

### The Mayor's Satire: A Dim Lamp in the Office

[Reported by This Newspaper] I remember not long ago, I went to the Municipal Government to interview Mayor Wu about a news item. The Mayor casually mentioned the issue of conserving electricity, but when he looked up, he saw six electric lights shining on the ceiling, plus a desk lamp, making a total of seven. The Mayor jokingly said to the reporter: "All I really need for my office work is the desk lamp, but the workers have turned on all the lights on the ceiling, which is a waste of electricity!" Yesterday, I went to the Municipal Government again to interview Mayor Wu about a news item. From outside the Municipal Government, looking at the Mayor's office, I saw only a dark space inside the window. I assumed the Mayor had finished his work and returned home. However, after submitting my name card, Mayor Wu immediately received me. Entering the office, I found Mayor Wu working on important matters at his desk under a dim lamp. The entire Mayor's office was immersed in that weak, dim light. This scene may not be very harmonious, but it serves as a powerful satire for those shops with their display windows full of fluorescent lights, or those mansions illuminated like daytime by electric lights!

### Air Raid Alert Tomorrow to Commemorate Air Defense Day; Rally at the Grand Theater; Display of Giant Bomb Model; Condolences to Families of Victims

The Shanghai Air Defense Day Preparatory Committee broadcast on all radio stations at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, asking families of those who died in air raids in 1937 to quickly register at the district office in their area to obtain proof of identity so that they can participate in the Air Defense Day Commemoration Rally to be held at the Grand Theater at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow and receive condolences from the rally. In addition, the committee has also sent invitations to the families of comrades who died in the line of duty during air defense in Shanghai in 1937, and to the families of those who died in the line of duty during air defense in the rear, asking them to participate in the rally and will distribute gifts of appreciation. The Preparatory Committee also sent a letter to the Air Force Supply Command here yesterday, asking it to display trainer aircraft and flight equipment in Fuxing and Zhongshan Parks tomorrow. Large models of bombs will be displayed at the locations where enemy planes dropped bombs on the Bund and the Great World area on August 14, when our air force dispatched a large-scale battle against enemy aircraft, as well as at major intersections such as Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, to raise the awareness of air defense among the citizens of the city. The committee also held its second preparatory meeting at the Police Bureau Conference Hall at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 20 representatives from party, government, military, police, and group organizations attended and decided on the spot: (1) At 9:00 a.m. on the 21st, an air raid alert will be sounded, first an air raid alert, then an emergency alert, and finally an all-clear alert. The time between each alert will be two minutes. (2) The Presidium of the Air Defense Day Commemoration Rally will be composed of the Mayor, the Garrison Commander, the Speaker of the Municipal Council, the Director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Commander of the Military Police Regiment, the Director of the Youth League, the Air Force Supply Commander, the Naval Base Commander, the President of the Local Association, the Directors of the Municipal Government Bureaus, and the Director of the Civil Affairs Office.

### Low Coal Reserves and Difficult Supply; Control Is Necessary

[Reported by This Newspaper] This reporter recently visited the fuel management authorities to inquire about the coal supply situation in this city and learned that the total supply of coal in this city this month is over 140,000 tons. Of this, public utilities account for 60,000 tons, railways account for 30,000 tons, shipping accounts for 30,000 tons, and the Coal Industry Association distributes 20,000 tons, mostly resold to small factories. In terms of price, public utilities related to the welfare of citizens are given special preferential treatment and are sold entirely at cost. This month, the price is only 90,000 yuan per ton. The city's inventory is only 70,000 to 80,000 tons in total, which is not enough to supply the entire city for one month if there is a problem with northern transportation. Therefore, applications for distribution must be very strict. As for the source of coal, the bulk comes from the Kailuan Coal Mine, and a small portion comes from Taiwan. Transportation is self-provided, with more than ten ships, each with a tonnage of over 5,000 tons. The supply of coal is subject to two restrictions: (1) The output of coal mines cannot be increased overnight. (3) The port and dock facilities at the production site have been used to the maximum extent. Many barges were damaged during the eight years of war and are difficult to replenish, which also reduces the efficiency of port loading and unloading and transportation. Maintaining the current supply is already the greatest effort. At present, the control of coal is necessary because the total supply is fixed. If merchants participate, they cannot increase the supply and only increase costs due to the inability to plan comprehensively, which increases the burden on citizens.

### Shipping Industry Promises to Send Ships to Help Transport Coal to Shanghai

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, in order to assist the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in transporting coal to supply ships and other coal users, yesterday Cheng Yuzhai, manager of the Zhongxing Shipping Company, and Li Zhiyi, manager of the Yixiang Shipping Company, and other representatives, discussed specific measures with Xu Letian, chairman of the association. After a long discussion, the shipping industry agreed to allocate one or several large ships to transport coal for the committee at a particularly low freight rate. Other ships will also assist with coal transportation as much as possible if they have spare tonnage. The Fuel Management Committee will also allocate sales fairly and fully to enable ships on all routes to operate regularly and maintain transportation. After the meeting, the person in charge of the association said that shipping is an urgent public utility, and its nature is the same as railways, electricity, and water. The Shipping Industry Association, in order to reduce the difficulties in supply for the Fuel Management Committee and enable various shipping companies to obtain the necessary coal, is preparing to send ships from the association to the production area to transport coal for reserve, and guarantees that it will never flow into the black market.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Orders Branches to Report Losses During the War; Strengthening Transportation and Reconstructing Wharves

The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has prepared statistical tables to investigate wartime losses and submitted them to the government authorities in order to claim compensation from Japan. The survey and statistics work in this city has been completed. It is reported that it has now further transferred the losses suffered by the bureau at various ports in South and North China. In addition to ordering personnel at each branch or office to investigate and report to the head office locally, it will also send personnel to ports that have not yet restored their pre-war institutions to conduct on-site investigations in order to ensure that all statistics are accurate and facilitate the work of claiming compensation. In order to promote the development of its business, the bureau has recently rebuilt the original wooden wharves into fixed wharves of steel and concrete to facilitate the loading and unloading of cranes and various heavier vehicles, thereby strengthening the work of land and wharf transportation. At the same time, it has also strengthened the management of the coolie workers at the wharves in order to reduce theft and unexpected events. As for the construction of warehouses, it is also actively proceeding to ensure that the entrances and exits are wide and the air is unobstructed to facilitate the entry and exit of goods and reduce spoilage.

New Shanghai-Philippines Route to Be Added Next Month

The bureau also believes that there are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and maritime transportation relies entirely on foreign shipping lines. In order to open up new international routes, it has recently added and repaired the Hai Xia passenger ship, which will be completed in two weeks. It has been decided that the Hai Xia will operate between Shanghai and the Philippines starting next month. The Hai Xia has a wide hull and can carry more than 600 passengers each time. The fare has not yet been determined. In the future, if new passenger ships can be purchased, the maritime transportation on the Shanghai-Philippines route will be further strengthened. However, passengers traveling to the Philippines must complete exit procedures, such as obtaining an exit passport, possessing various epidemic prevention certificates, and obtaining an entry permit from the consulate of the country in Shanghai.

### Wool Yarn Prices Fall Below Cost; New Prices Temporarily Postponed

The Wool Yarn Evaluation Committee held its fourth evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room yesterday to discuss the resolution of raw materials and other issues: (1) The prices of various grades of wool yarn have now fallen below cost, so new prices will be temporarily postponed, and the prices assessed by the third evaluation meeting will continue to be maintained. (2) In addition to the allocation of finished goods from various wool yarn factories being the main priority, members of the Wool Yarn Industry Association can handle matters directly with various manufacturers at their discretion. (3) The Wool Yarn Association proposed that if imported or exported wool yarn arrives, it should be distributed by members of the Wool Yarn Industry Association and not sold to people outside the industry in order to eliminate the black market. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this principle is acceptable, but it needs to be investigated further before a decision can be made and will be discussed further at the next meeting.

### Runway at Longhua Airport to Be Paved with Cement

The goods will be delivered successively in two weeks.

Cement runways are heavy-duty and durable and can be used for the landing of large aircraft. After completion, it will enhance air transportation significantly.

After the training is completed, they will be replenished to various troops or assigned to work in various military supply factories.

### Continued News of the Large Fire in West Shanghai; Two Factories Suffer Losses of Over 900 Million

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Hua Feng Rubber Goods Manufacturing Factory at 54 Panjia Ku, Dunxin Road, West Shanghai, and the adjacent Wang Deji Waste Flower Factory at 55, caught fire at around 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. The fire spread fiercely and continued until yesterday morning.

All were extinguished, resulting in huge losses. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the police investigation, although the fire was largely controlled by 8:30 p.m., the open-air storage of waste flowers at Wang Deji Waste Flower was piled up like a mountain, more than several feet high, making rescue difficult. Therefore, it took more than sixteen or seven hours to extinguish it completely. As a result, all four or five thousand bales of waste flowers were reduced to ashes. According to the person in charge of the factory, the insurance premium for waste flower storage is more expensive than other warehouses, so it was not insured. The fire insurance for the Hua Feng Rubber Factory is reportedly only 30 million yuan, insured by the Shanghai United Insurance Company for 20 million yuan and the Lihua Insurance Company for 10 million yuan. It is said that Hua Feng's losses are about 700 million yuan, and Wang Deji's are nearly 200 million yuan, totaling more than 900 million yuan, which is the largest disaster in recent years. The Changning Branch Bureau will submit the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for review.

[Another Report] After the first factory of Hua Feng Rubber Factory was hit by the fire, it is now known that the raw material and finished product warehouses are isolated from the factory and were fortunately kept safe. The company recently purchased a second factory on Jiangwan Road, which is much larger in scale and equipment than the first factory, so the output is not affected.

### Lengthening the North Station Platform; Construction to Begin Soon; Strengthening Police at the Beijing-Shanghai Railway

It is reported that the Transportation Department of the Railway Bureau believes that the North Station platform is too short, only more than 270 meters long, so that longer trains cannot stop completely when entering, which is prone to danger, and passengers are also inconvenient to get on and off. Therefore, it has been decided to extend it to more than 360 meters long, and construction will begin in the near future. It is expected to be completed in three months, and the canopy on the platform is also planned to be added. As for increasing the number of trains to reduce passenger congestion, it is feared that it cannot be realized in the short term due to the lack of carriages and other materials. Regarding the police department, it is reported that: In order to strengthen security, especially during the convening of the National Assembly, the department increased the number of armored vehicles and patrols one week before the convening of the National Assembly, patrolling between stations day and night. At the same time, armed railway police were also assigned to the special trains of the National Assembly representatives to protect them, so the escort situation was very thorough.

### Foolish Young Master Pretends to Commit Suicide; Passionate Girl Almost Dies for Love; Luo Shuzhi Charged with Two Crimes to Be Investigated According to Law

[Reported by This Newspaper] Luo Shuzhi, a young man from Hunan, 25 years old, is the young master of a certain winery at 91 Anyuan Road. Yang Jingwen, a beautiful, 16-year-old girl from the same hometown, is studying in the third grade of Wujiang Junior High School and lives at 1024 Jiangyin Road. Her father, Yang Zanchen, is over sixty years old and also runs a winery. He has only one daughter and loves her as the apple of his eye. Although Jingwen is of marriageable age, she looks about twenty years old due to her healthy development and already understands human affairs. After getting to know Luo Shuzhi in September of last year, their feelings have become increasingly strong and they have been very intimate. Since then, they have secretly met at various inns, such as the Continental Hotel, the Dafang Hotel, and the Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan, where they have often been seen. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 17th), Luo called Jingwen again from room 317 of the Continental Hotel, saying that he wanted to say goodbye to her forever because he was in too much debt and planned to leave Shanghai. Yang, a passionate girl, was shocked to hear this and immediately hired a car to rush over. She saw Luo Shuzhi looking distressed. Two packages of sedative pills, totaling twenty pills, were placed on the table. After pouring out their hearts, she learned that he was determined to commit suicide. The girl, because she was not completely pure, was willing to die for love, so she swallowed seven pills and lay down on the bed. As it turned out, Luo ultimately did not have the courage to commit suicide and never did it. It was not until around 4:00 p.m. that Yang was found to be in abnormal condition. He hired a pedicab to send her to Hongren Hospital, where the hospital reported it to the Xincheng Police Station and ordered officers Gu Qiliu and Sergeant Xia Shutang to investigate. Before long, the woman's condition turned from danger to safety, so they were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Yang spoke frankly and told everything in detail. After the preliminary hearing, the bureau charged him with interfering with a family and inciting suicide and planned to transfer him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law.

### Joke by an Informant? Two Big Vats of Gold Bars Now All Feces; Prosecutor Personally Inspects Fuxing Island; No Clues Found in the Bizarre Case

[Reported by This Newspaper] The complex and bizarre case of the theft of enemy hidden materials worth 20 million U.S. dollars from the underground of Fuxing Island has been investigated and replied by the Executive Yuan that no clues can be found. It was also stated that no personnel were sent to the island to receive it. The original informant was summoned again to the Shanghai Garrison Command, and it was replied that "there is no such person" and the subpoena was returned. The prosecuting attorney Gu Hongbiao felt that the case should not be concluded like this, and went to Fuxing Island with interpreter Yang at 6:00 a.m. yesterday to conduct an inspection. The members of the Chengye Association stationed on the island by the Executive Yuan hosted them and explained to prosecuting attorney Xian that the Agricultural Committee was not the original recipient of the island and did not find any materials. Prosecutor Gu, remembering that the informant claimed that there were two huge bathtubs filled with gold bars, asked about this. The association staff led him to inspect and confirmed that there were two large bathtubs, but they were filled with feces instead of gold bars. Coarse and fine hemp ropes were found scattered all over the ground, stretching for several miles, which was also mentioned in the informant's report. However, the Agricultural Committee staff said that the hemp ropes were transported by the Executive Yuan from Manila and there are account books to prove it, so this point cannot be regarded as a clue. The island is ten miles long and three miles wide, and land security is very strict, making it impossible for small thieves to operate, but water patrols are not easy, and theft or leakage is possible. There are many air-raid shelters on the island, and they are very well built, presumably the so-called underground tunnels, but they are all empty and no suspicious signs were found. Prosecutor Gu returned at 1:00 p.m.

### Rail Fracture Between Nanxiang and Huangdu; Beijing-Shanghai Night Train Almost Derailed; Railway Police Fire Shots to Warn Police to Avoid Disaster

On the upper half of the night of the 17th, Zhang Xikang, a patrolling policeman from the Huangdu Station Railway Bureau, together with Wang Xiong, Chen Xinchao, Chen Dong, Dai Tongzhao, and other five traffic policemen from the station, were patrolling along the railway line. When patrolling to 25 kilometers from Huangdu, they found a rail fracture of about five or six inches. At that time, the tenth express train from Shanghai to Beijing was about to arrive at the location. The patrol police prevented derailment and were unable to notify. In a hurry, they fired dozens of shots as a warning. After the train stopped, the patrol police informed them of the situation, and the train returned to Nanxiang Station. On the one hand, they reported to Nanxiang to send workers to repair the track. The track was completely repaired at around 2:00 a.m. on the 18th. When the repairs were being made, the twelfth train from Shanghai arrived at Nanxiang Station one after another and stopped to wait. After the repair, the twelfth train departed from Nanxiang at 2:42 a.m., and the tenth train departed at 3:05 a.m., safely. Afterwards, Yan Simin, the patrol officer of the Sixth Branch Station of the Nanxiang Station Railway Police, reported by telephone on the night of the 17th that the track there had originally been cracked in the early years and had been welded by someone. Until recently, it had been too long and had been shaken by passing traffic, causing the weld to break completely. If the flaws had not been discovered this time, it would have caused a derailment. Moreover, both the tenth and twelfth trains were passenger trains, and if there had been a derailment, the damage would have been unimaginable. After receiving the report, the Xihu Section Police Station at the North Station commended the patrol police for being loyal to their duties and requested that each person be awarded a bonus of 100,000 yuan to encourage them.

### The Case of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Motorboat Sale: Three Defendants Released on Bail Pending Sentencing

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of a small motorboat belonging to the UNRRA FS-357 transport vessel, which was stolen and sold by the ship's sailors Kai Lai, George Otto, and the Swede Nansen, the three men were handed over to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution after UNRRA became aware of the incident. The District Court held a trial yesterday. Kai Lai confessed directly, but claimed that because the ship was in Jiji, all his cash was used up, and he was forced to sell the motorboat in order to survive. The other defendants all claimed that they knew nothing about the sale of the motorboat, and only received 80 US dollars afterward. The court granted the three defendants bail of 6 million yuan in cash and scheduled sentencing for the 25th of this month.

### Salvaging Wartime Shipwrecks: Shipping Administration Bureau and Other Jointly-Established Companies to Hire Foreign Experts to Assist

According to Li Guofan, Director of the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau, the bureau, in order to salvage ships sunk during the war, has specially joined forces with the Enemy Property Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Guild, and other relevant parties to invest in and establish the China Salvage Company. After the city was liberated last year, there were plans to establish a salvage company. However, the company lacked equipment and found it difficult to recruit technical personnel, resulting in no progress. Currently, the preparatory committee of the China Salvage Company has decided to invite this salvage company to participate in cooperation and to use its equipment as investment. As for the technical aspect, the Shipping Administration Bureau is in contact with salvage expert Mr. Williams. It is reported that Mr. Williams has served in various European and American countries and specializes in salvage work. His arrival in Shanghai is due to a dispatch from UNRRA. In the future, any ships salvaged by the China Salvage Company will be investigated. If the ownership belongs to enemy or puppet assets, the Enemy Property Bureau will take over and auction them off. If the ownership belongs to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after verification, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will reclaim and repair them. In short, after the ships are salvaged, regardless of who the owner is, they must hold conclusive evidence before they can be returned. All salvage costs will be borne by the respective shipowners. Otherwise, they will be publicly auctioned.

### "Speaking of Painting, Closed Mouth to Art": High Court First Trial of Female Painter Li Qingping Eloquent and Articulate, Claiming No Knowledge of Supplying Information to the Enemy and Puppet Regimes, Denying Ever Acknowledging Chu Minyi as Godfather

[Report from Our Newspaper] Female painter Li Qingping (pictured, taken by this newspaper) was requested to be arrested by the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters through a letter to the Shanghai Police Bureau. Li was arrested after opening a painting exhibition at the New Life Club a month ago and sent to the High Procuratorate for investigation. She was prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held its first trial, with a large audience. Li was eloquent and articulate, repeatedly stating, "I am a painter, studying art." She firmly denied ever acknowledging Chu Minyi as her godfather and denied ever knowing Matsushima Kei and Ueda, the heads of the enemy navy's information department, or supplying political and economic information. The entire hearing lasted one hour. The court adjourned the trial for further questioning, and the defendant was returned to custody.

At 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Zhensheng, accompanied by a clerk, entered the court and ordered the bailiffs to bring up Li Qingping. Li was wearing a collared white shirt, a navy blue Western-style short coat with colored patterns, black wool pants, champagne-colored leather shoes, her hair up, without makeup, and carrying a white handkerchief and a bundle of documents. Judge Chen first asked her age, hometown, and experience. Li replied, "Twenty-seven years old, from Jiangling, Hubei. My father is dead, and my mother is in the countryside. I have no sisters, but three brothers, all in Chongqing. My parents were both painters, and we have no property. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), I graduated from [omitted] and taught at Anhui Middle School in Zhabei, Shanghai. In the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), I was sent to Nanyang by the school because Kuncheng Girls' High School in Kuala Lumpur was seeking a teacher. I taught art and music there. When the Pacific War broke out and the area fell, I was repatriated back to China by the Overseas Chinese Repatriation Committee, arriving in Shanghai in May of the 31st year of the Republic (1942). I went to Hankou and Shashi and returned to my hometown of Jiangling, staying for about a week before returning to Shanghai."

The court asked, "What documents did you have when traveling to various places at that time?" She replied, "I had no documents. I always carried my paintings and declared that I was a painter, so traveling was not difficult. After returning to my hometown, I went to Yichang, wanting to enter the interior, but I needed documents, even if I declared I was a painter. So I returned to Shanghai." She continued, "After returning to Shanghai, I stayed at the Shanghai Art Academy for two months before going to Beijing and then to Hangzhou and Suzhou. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), I returned to Shanghai and opened an exhibition, staying at the home of my classmate Shen Xueqin at No. 6, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road. After four or five months, I went to Hangzhou and Suzhou again to paint. In the summer of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), I went to Beijing again until February of this year when I returned to Shanghai. In April, I went home through Hankou, stayed for two months, opened a painting exhibition in Nanjing, and returned to Shanghai on September 20th, staying at the New Life Club." The court immediately asked, "During these years, did you go back and forth with anyone? And how did you maintain your livelihood during this time of war and chaos?" She replied, "I went back and forth alone. As for the livelihood issue, I brought savings and jewelry back from Nanyang. In addition, I worked hard at painting for several years, and my results were very good, so I was able to maintain myself." Judge Chen continued, "After going to your hometown, why didn't you stay and insisted on traveling to various places?" She replied, "I couldn't buy painting materials in my hometown, and I couldn't sell my paintings after I painted them. I study Western painting and sketching, so I must go to various places to paint on location." The court asked if Li had ever acknowledged Chu Minyi as her godfather? She replied, "There is no such thing. I don't know anyone in the enemy puppet regime." Judge Chen said, "There is a document from the Hankou Police Department to prove this." Li replied, "I don't need this. My father just passed away recently, and there is no custom of acknowledging a godfather in my hometown." The court asked, "Otherwise, it wouldn't be easy to run around?" Li replied, "Why can't I run around? There were many people painting at that time." Judge Chen then asked, "Do you know Matsushima Kei and Ueda of the enemy navy's information department?" Li answered without hesitation, "I don't know them." The court asked Li, "What position did Chu Minyi hold at that time?" She replied, "I don't know. I am a painter." Judge Chen rebuked her, "You are using painting as a cover to inquire about our political and military news and supply it to the enemy?" Li, hearing this, questioned the court, "Is this speculation? Or is it a fact?" The court informed her that there was an arrest warrant from the Hankou Police Department. Li immediately answered eloquently, "Art is truth, goodness, and beauty. It won't be used by others. I have no political common sense, and I don't even know the word 'information.' What is the basis for them to arrest me like this? Please ask the Hankou agency that arrested me what agency they are based on and what reason they have?" The court then asked Li, "You must have had some friends since the 31st year of the Republic (1942). Do you have any evidence to present?" Li again replied fiercely, "No friends, nothing. Only art! I don't open empty painting exhibitions, but exhibitions with works. When selling paintings, I have never collected information. Colleagues in the art world all know that I am a painter." Chen, seeing that she was full of talk about painting and art, rebuked her sternly, "The prosecutor's indictment does not say that you are not a painter, but because you have engaged in extracurricular activities, interacted with the enemy, and supplied information." Li replied, "But I didn't!" The trial came to an end here. Li's defense lawyer then stood up and declared! "When the defendant was in Nanyang, she received a certificate of commendation for donating money for the war effort. Current government officials can also prove that the defendant is not a traitor. There are also group introductions for her to open a painting exhibition, which can be used as evidence." After speaking, he presented a letter of introduction for the painting exhibition signed by prominent figures and other documents. Li herself requested the court to grant her bail. Judge Chen replied, "I'm afraid it won't be easy. I can't make the decision alone. You must submit a written petition and wait for the collegiate bench to decide." Li left the court and spoke briefly with her cousin before being escorted back to the women's prison by the bailiffs.

### Blood Plasma Sealed Temporarily by Order; Price Recovery Undetermined

[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of recovering blood plasma flowing into the market has still not been resolved as of yesterday. It is understood that the dispute over a "reasonable" price between the Materials Clearance Committee and Lida Yanghang is very large, so no agreement has been reached to date.

The estimated amount of blood plasma stored in warehouses on Broadway and other locations is approximately 20,000 units. Yesterday, Mayor Wu temporarily sealed it off by government order. About 2,000 units have already been resold.

The Health Bureau also sent personnel to investigate yesterday and retrieved a sample box. The box contained two circular iron cans, similar to the meat cans in ration boxes, and the opening method was the same, but the volume was larger. Each can contained a glass tube, one filled with light yellow blood plasma powder and the other with distilled water. The two tubes were mixed during injection. Each of these samples was one unit, measuring 500 c.c., and was sold on the market for 25 U.S. dollars.

### "Black Hat" Case of Assault Resulting in Death During the Enemy Puppet Period: High Court Re-Prosecutes on Charges of Treason; Jiang Shiyan Abuses Power and Claims Ignorance; Judge Angrily Condemns Him as a "Bad Thing"

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Shiyan (pictured, taken by this newspaper), from Yancheng, is currently twenty-one years old. During the occupation of Shanghai, he served as the deputy squad leader in charge of security at the Shanghai North Station of the puppet Central China Railway Company. On the morning of March 4th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he beat female passenger Xu Peiwen to death at the North Station, resulting in the "Black Hat" outrage that shocked the city. After the incident, Jiang fled in fear of punishment and was eventually arrested in Qishuyan. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the puppet court at the time. After the victory, the High Court prosecutor reinvestigated the case and prosecuted him on October 7th of this year. During the trial, due to the defendant's service in an organization belonging to the enemy puppet regime, abusing his power, and harming the people, he was charged with crimes under Article 278 of the Criminal Law and Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. He was additionally prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor.

The case was brought to trial by Judge Qiu Huan of the High Court yesterday afternoon. Jiang was wearing a striped black cloth short cotton-padded jacket, blue cloth pants, a flat-top haircut, and was short in stature, wearing black cloth shoes. He testified, "I graduated from junior high school at Yancheng Middle School and joined the puppet Central China Railway Company on October 5th of the 29th year of the Republic (1940)." Judge Qiu immediately asked, "Since you are a middle school student, why did you become a traitor?" He replied, "I was forced to. I didn't have enough money to go to the interior." The court then asked about the incident of Xu Peiwen being beaten to death. He replied, "I neither knew Xu nor had any grievances with her. On the morning of March 4th, I was maintaining order at the military ticket window No. 3. The line of ticket buyers was very long. Xu Peiwen cut in the middle of the line without queuing. I initially advised her not to, but she didn't listen. When I went to drag her away, she still refused. I wanted to drag her into the stationmaster's office, but she refused to go and bit me instead. I grabbed her collar. At that time, the stationmaster, a Japanese named Sanben, came and took her away. I don't know what happened after that." The court asked, "You beat her with a leather whip and kicked her with your feet." He replied, "There is no such thing at all. Leather whips were used by the military. I didn't kick her either. At this time, the stationmaster had already arrived. In front of my superior, I couldn't beat people indiscriminately. That's what happened. There isn't a word of a lie." Judge Qiu then presented the defendant's previous written confession. After Jiang read it, he replied, "That's not right. It's completely fabricated." The court asked again, "What happened to Xu Peiwen after she was injured?" He replied, "When I left, Xu showed no signs of injury. I didn't know anything about her being sent to the hospital." Judge Qiu then said, "Xu Peiwen was sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium, which cost 200,000 yuan for the operation and 60,000 yuan in fees. You borrowed 150,000 yuan from your colleagues as compensation because you were afraid it would involve people." Jiang replied, "There is no such thing at all." The court then asked, "Then why did you flee after the incident?" He replied, "I didn't flee. I continued to work as usual on the 5th and 6th of March after the incident on the 4th. I took leave on the 7th to go to Qishuyan for business, not to flee." Asked, "Did you know that Xu Peiwen died?" He replied, "I don't know." Finally asked, "Is there anything else you want to say?" He replied, "It's completely unjust. You say I beat someone to death, but there are no witnesses." Judge Qiu told him, "Traitors are all bad." Jiang, hearing this, argued, "There are good ones among the bad." Judge Qiu immediately said, "You are one of the bad ones." The case was adjourned for further questioning. When the defendant was talking to his family, the court instructed the bailiffs to keep a close watch on Jiang because he was a murderer. After talking with his family, he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

### Municipal Council Meeting Venue: Executive Yuan Has Telegraphed Reply

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's meeting venue, which was previously resolved by the General Assembly to rent the original site of the former Japanese Autonomous Association on Peng Road from the Enemy Property Bureau, could not be decided because the Enemy Property Bureau had a lease contract with the U.S. military authorities for the building, which was originally due to expire on the 14th of this month, but could be extended for three months after the expiration date.

### Social Services Reader Consultation

Legal Inquiries

(1) Induced Sale Contract

Ye Jinguo asks: My father passed away in 1940. Due to financial difficulties, I sold the family property in the countryside to Lu, a fellow villager, for 3,000 legal tender. I received 1,600 yuan as a down payment, with the remaining balance to be paid later. However, when I went to collect the remaining amount, he denied everything. I then realized I had been tricked.  When the contract was signed, I was not yet an adult and was coerced into making an "X" mark on the contract. I also did not carefully examine the contents of the contract. Now, I have several questions to ask for clarification: (1) Is a contract signed by a 16-year-old child legally binding? (2) Is a contract signed during the enemy-puppet era legally binding? (3) Can I sue Lu for fraud?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies]: (1) If there is no signature from a legal guardian, it is not valid. (2) If there is no coercion or fraud, it is valid. (3) You must have concrete evidence of fraud to file a lawsuit.

(2) Overdue Debt

Ling Fusheng asks: A borrowed ten dan of rice from B, with a written agreement stipulating repayment of fifteen dan, including interest, in five months. A guarantor signed and stamped the agreement as a witness. However, B failed in business and could not repay the debt on time, while A is now demanding repayment from me. I have the following questions to ask for clarification: (1) What responsibility does the guarantor bear if B cannot repay the debt on time? (2) Is the guarantor required to compensate if B is unable to repay the debt? (3) If the loan was not arranged by the guarantor, can the guarantor's responsibility be reduced? (4) How should I deal with A's unreasonable demands for repayment?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies]: (1) (3) The guarantor is not responsible for repayment! (2) No. (4) You can only assist in urging repayment. If there is any infringement of freedom, you can seek legal recourse.

### The Poor Show Compassion for Each Other

Emergency Surgery Saves Two Patients

Zhang Chaogeng, a worker at the Da Zhonghua Shoe Factory in this city, from Yin County, Zhejiang, residing at No. 69, Lane 456, Jianguo West Road, has suffered from stomach problems for many years without a cure. On the 4th of this month, his condition worsened, causing unbearable pain. He sought treatment at the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society, where doctors diagnosed him with a perforated stomach and required surgery. With a monthly income of just over 100,000 yuan, Zhang was already struggling to support his family and could not afford the surgery. Therefore, the hospital's social services department applied for emergency assistance funds from this organization on his behalf. His application has been approved. Zhang's condition has greatly improved since the surgery, and he was discharged from the hospital yesterday.

Zheng A'kui, from Yin County, 36 years old, residing at No. 7, Yongxing Lane, Zhujia Ku, Huashan Road, was previously a partner at a cloth store. Recently, due to the impact of foreign goods dumping, business in the store declined, and he was laid off. Zheng has suffered from stomach problems for quite some time, and recently his stomach wall perforated and ulcerated, resulting in significant bleeding. On the 26th of last month, he was taken by his family to the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society for treatment. After a blood transfusion and wound closure, his condition improved significantly. He is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a few days. His application for emergency assistance funds has also been approved.

### Seeking Information

Seeking Sister and Brother: Zhang Lintao's sister joined a guerrilla unit with him during the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, fighting the enemy in the Jinhua-Xiaoshan area. He has not heard from her since 1943. His younger brother, Zhang Peixun, from Minhou County, Fujian, followed the cadet corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs led by Regiment Commander Lin Guanxiong to fight in Myanmar during the Anti-Japanese War. He has also lost contact after the victory. If any kind individuals can provide information about their whereabouts, it would be deeply appreciated to reunite the family.  Respectfully, Zhang Peichang.

Seeking Hu Hairu: Also known as Yuchun, he left home three years ago and has not been heard from since. The whole family is anxious. Please contact Hu Ruisheng at Xinhua Bank in Nanjing if anyone knows of his whereabouts. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Nantong Luo Sanze Seeks Son: Editor, I am old and frail, and I know I will not live much longer. Sadly, I have worked hard all my life but have no relatives to rely on. My wife is deceased, my son is gone, and my house is in ruins. My youngest son, Dezhen, was a student at the Artillery School of the Nanjing Shangzhe River Fortress before the war. After the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, he joined the Nantong County Anti-Japanese Student Brigade and moved north with the army. He has been wandering since then. I received two letters from him, detailing the hardships he faced along the way. In the spring of 1941, I received another letter from him in Xi'an, stating that he had been promoted to deputy regimental commander with the rank of major. As a father who had a son in his old age, I was proud that he could serve the country loyally, which would not betray my patriotic heart. Since then, I have not heard from him for five years. Although the Anti-Japanese War was won a long time ago, I do not know where my son is, and his fate is uncertain. I beg you to publish this in your newspaper. Your kindness would be like a second life. I write with sorrow and cannot express all that I want to say. Please accept my respects.  Respectfully, Luo Sanze from Nantong.

### Ban on Off-Exchange Trading Causes Stagnation in Shanghai Yesterday - Only 20 Bundles of Hong Kui Star Yarn Sold Slightly - Fourth Allotment of Yarn Scheduled for Tomorrow

The Cotton Yarn Trade Association, in order to implement a ban on illegal off-exchange trading, convened a temporary meeting of directors the night before yesterday to discuss and decide on the following measures: (1) All transactions among members must be conducted on the exchange from now on. Those who deliberately trade illegally off-exchange will be reported to the police for arrest by the association, which will also dispatch more staff to strictly monitor activities. (2) Members must immediately fill out a form upon completing a transaction on the exchange, detailing the quantity of cotton yarn sold and reported, whether for wholesale, retail, or self-use. These forms will be registered by the association. (3) The association will compile statistics based on the registered transaction volumes. Shipments to other locations will be notified to the Textile Control Board (紡管) for verification and release.  After these measures were announced, the exchange was unusually quiet yesterday, with very few attendees. Only 221 bundles of Hong Kui Star 20-count yarn were sold slightly, with no other activity reported. The Textile Control Board dispatched personnel to the market yesterday morning to monitor trading. The cotton yarn market on the first floor of Ningbo Road has been closed, with all transactions restricted to the ground floor. Openly displayed market prices were not announced, and the market report from the Liaison Society (聯誼社) was also not published. The yarn market is in a state of stagnation. According to the association, off-exchange trading in the past was mostly conducted in alleys, with middlemen acting as outside brokers. The association found it difficult to monitor activities, making it impossible to prevent illegal trading. At the same time, cotton yarn shipments to locations outside of South China can be freely transported without Textile Control Board approval, potentially leading to indirect shipments to South China. This is also a major reason for the flourishing off-exchange trading.

Fourth Yarn Allotment - Types Decided

The types and quantities of yarn for the fourth allotment of the third phase of the Joint Allotment Committee (聯合配銷會) have now been finalized. The total amount is 5,535 bundles (including 1,467 bundles from the Spinning Construction Company). This includes 926 bundles of 10-count yarn, 26 bundles of 12-count yarn, 638 bundles of 16-count yarn, 2,549 bundles of 20-count yarn, 350 bundles of 32-count yarn, 119 bundles of 32-count double-ply yarn, 477 bundles of 40-count yarn, 423 bundles of 42-count double-ply yarn, 10 bundles of 60-count yarn, 10 bundles of 64-count double-ply yarn, 4 bundles of 80-count variable-ply yarn, and 3 bundles of 80-count three-ply yarn. The equivalent 20-count allocation for all types is 5,800.6 bundles (including 2,000.5 bundles from the Spinning Construction Company). This matches the standard allotment amount of 6,000 bundles (including 2,001 bundles from the Spinning Construction Company).

Re-Allotment Committee Explains Reasons for Returns

The Re-Allotment Committee (複配會) has addressed the return of orders in previous allotments. In the third allotment, there were still 897 returned bundles, but 500 of these were unsuitable 10-count yarn, which the Re-Allotment Committee returned upon receiving the allocation list. The remaining 397 bundles included various counts. According to the Re-Allotment Committee, there are two main reasons for the return of yarn allotments: (1) The six trade associations of the reproduction industry (複製品工業) currently have a total of 1,889 factories eligible for allotments. Allotments are generally based on the level of production equipment and operating conditions. In the third allotment, due to returns of unsuitable yarn counts and combined allotments reported by members, the allotment quantity for each factory was reduced to 50% of the requested amount. It is inevitable that a small number of factories would return allotments due to unsuitable yarn counts or insufficient funds. However, the total number of returns does not indicate a surplus. (2) The original deadline for payment was Thursday to Saturday, but the third allotment deadline was moved forward to Friday without prior consultation between the Textile Control Board and the Re-Allotment Committee. This resulted in a significant number of last-minute returns. However, a small portion was accepted on Saturday after the Re-Allotment Committee consulted with the Allotment Committee. The Re-Allotment Committee has informed Mayor Wu that the increase in black market yarn prices and the return of allotments are evidence that the allotted yarn is not being diverted into the black market.

### Trust Bureau Auctions of Cotton Yarn - All Handled by the Textile Control Board

[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday:  An emergency meeting was recently convened with all relevant parties in the cotton yarn industry to discuss several measures to completely eliminate the cotton yarn black market and to ensure their implementation. The difficulties faced by manufacturers and the Re-Allotment Committee regarding joint allocation are currently being addressed. The quality standards of all yarn counts must be met for each factory's allotment. If deficiencies in count or quality are discovered, the allotment price must be reduced in proportion to the current agreed price. Mayor Wu has also obtained the consent of Liu Gongyun, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, to hand over all cotton yarn regularly auctioned by the Bureau to the Textile Control Board for distribution. The Textile Control Board will provide a detailed list of the Bureau's entire cotton yarn selection, including colors, counts, brands, and types, for each trade association to select and purchase according to the Textile Control Board's agreed price.

### US Dollar Steps Down, Gold Price Stabilizes

Yesterday's "Shat Chih" (烚赤) market fluctuated.  Opening at 2.502 million, selling pressure emerged from 2.51 million onward, leading to fatigue and profit-taking. The 2.5 million level was broken, and the Central Bank allocated 200 taels at a price of 2.4975 million. After 10 a.m., demand was weak, and the price retreated to a low of 2.483 million before being supported by actual sales. The price gradually stabilized, and the situation was relatively stable near noon, hovering around 2.495 million. The afternoon was extremely calm, with the forward price remaining around the noon price. As a result, the closing price was slightly down by 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was listed at 264,000, unchanged. Silver remained flat, and silver dollars fell slightly. Secret interest rates ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 jiao.

Foreign currencies continued to weaken, with sellers outnumbering buyers and prices gradually declining. The black market price of the US dollar immediately fell to 4,630 to 4,680 yuan after the market opened. Sellers were eager to sell, and the price continued to fall, dropping to around 4,550 yuan by noon, a decrease of over 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the rise in telegram rates to Shanghai, Hong Kong dollars rose to 108 yuan, but buyers were scarce, and the price fell significantly. The closing price was down by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate also fell to 915 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 11,100 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 14,800 yuan, all being selling prices. Only Hong Kong exchange saw some trading, while the rest were stagnant.

### Will the US Dollar Become Useless? The Key Lies in Whether Private Smuggling Can Be Eliminated

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the black market price of the US dollar traded around 4,550 yuan, with very few transactions. Observers point out that if the import permit system is effectively implemented and smuggling is severely cracked down on, the US dollar will become useless and its price will continue to fall. The reason for the sharp rise in the US dollar black market price to as high as 4,900 yuan in the past few days was reportedly due to the arrival of six foreign freighters, fully loaded with goods. A group of resourceful import and export merchants, finding it difficult to obtain foreign exchange approval from the Central Bank, bought US dollars on the market at high prices, and speculators took the opportunity to spread rumors, causing prices to rise to unprecedented levels. However, the current surge has passed. With the implementation of the new measures, the demand for US dollars has been greatly reduced. In the past, the so-called smuggling was because the Central Bank did not approve foreign exchange but Customs allowed imports, so merchants bought US dollars on the market as a payment method. Under the current permit system, the Central Bank will supply foreign exchange for all goods that are permitted to be imported. Conversely, Customs will not allow the import of goods that are not permitted to be imported, even if private individuals hold foreign exchange payment instruments. In this situation, even if the government still allows the free use of US dollars in our country, it will not be able to cause trouble and destabilize prices. Currently, the Central Bank has issued earnest warnings to the banking association to prevent commercial banks from engaging in black market US dollar transactions. For example, if a telephone is used to arrange US dollar transactions, the telephone line will be cut off upon discovery. There are many similar preventive measures. A reporter asked whether speculators who accumulate large amounts of US dollars will decrease in the future. The answer was: These speculators often borrow funds to buy US dollars, which results in a heavy interest burden. If the US dollar market price remains stable for a long time or even declines, they will find it unprofitable and will inevitably sell off large amounts. This will drastically reduce the demand for US dollars and greatly increase the supply, causing prices to fall further.

### Government Bonds Step Down

As a result, the closing price was down 150 yuan compared to the previous day. Types A, B, and D also fell by 150 yuan, while Type E fell by 70 yuan.

### Subsidized Vegetable Oil Prices Have Been Increased - Soybean Oil at 1,450 Yuan Per Jin - Northeast Soybeans Shipped to Shanghai for Oil Extraction

[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting on subsidized vegetable oil prices at 3 p.m. yesterday, presided over by Mr. Ji Mingzhai, head of the Grain and Food Department of the Bureau. Those in attendance included Mr. Cao Bingqian, a special commissioner of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mr. Li Tingdong of the National Vegetable Oil Factory, Mr. Xie Yuxiang of the Da Youyu Private Vegetable Oil Factory, Mr. Lu Jiannan of Weimin, Mr. Cai Bosuo of Changde, Mr. He Shuming of Shunyu, Mr. Zhang Chao of the Da Chang, Xin Zhou Wei Bo, the Shanghai Food Oil Retailers Association, and Mr. Yang Mingzhou of the Food Oil and Cake Association. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5 p.m.

Mr. Ji Mingzhai first reported that Premier Song was very concerned about the vegetable oil issue in Shanghai. He decided to supply soybeans to each factory and facilitate the circulation of funds for each factory. He also made arrangements to increase the electricity allowance for each oil extraction factory to reduce production costs and encourage the transportation and sale of vegetable oil.

The price discussion then began.  Nationalized, private factories, and transportation and sales merchants all presented cost sheets.  After detailed research, it was decided to review and determine the prices as follows: Soybean oil at 133,000 yuan, rapeseed oil at 129,000 yuan, sesame oil at 129,000 yuan, light oil at 124,000 yuan, pure raw oil at 128,000 yuan, and barrel raw oil at 135,000 yuan. The retail prices at the point of sale are soybean oil at 145,000 yuan, rapeseed oil at 140,000 yuan, sesame oil at 140,000 yuan, light oil at 134,000 yuan, pure raw oil at 150,000 yuan, and barrel raw oil at 150,000 yuan. The price per jin (斤) can be extrapolated proportionally. For example, soybean oil is 1,450 yuan per jin, rapeseed oil is 1,400 yuan per jin, and raw oil is 1,500 yuan per jin. The above prices will be implemented starting today.

It is also reported that each oil extraction factory requested the Central Trust Bureau to ship the 200,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast that the Central Trust Bureau has in its possession, in batches to the south for oil extraction. Currently, the Central Trust Bureau has already shipped 1,200 tons of soybeans from Yingkou to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive within a few days. It is said that each factory hopes that the Central Trust Bureau can sell the soybeans at a price of 29,000 yuan per dan.  Today, the Da Youyu Factory will send Mr. Xie Yuxiang to negotiate with Mr. He Molin, the manager of the Purchasing and Barter Department of the Bureau.

Joint Oil Allocation Continues

The Shanghai Vegetable Oil Joint Distribution Office continued to receive 400 dan of oil allocated from various private factories yesterday.  This includes 80 dan from Da Chang Xin, 52 dan from Changde, 48 dan from Shunyu, 64 dan from Da De Xin, 16 dan from Da Sheng, and 12 dan from Weimin. All of the above is soybean oil. Da Youyu was allocated 128 dan of raw rapeseed oil. The office distributed the oil to 115 retail oil stores in the Nanshi district, with each store receiving 3.5 dan. It is said that from today, the daily allocation and sale from each private factory will be increased to 500 dan. At the same time, in order to ensure widespread supply, the city government has borrowed 3,000 dan of raw oil from the China Food Oil Company and handed it over to the office for general distribution. The plan will be decided today, and the oil will be available for general retail sale in each retail store within three to four days.

Since the office started registering retail oil stores, the total number of registered stores is 1,429. However, due to manpower and time constraints, the office can only distribute to slightly over 100 stores each day. Therefore, the remaining 1,000 plus retail stores will be allocated by district each day, and they will be notified in writing before the allocation. All registered retailers will receive an allocation sooner or later, so please do not make unnecessary trips before receiving notification.

(3) The 50 million yuan cash guarantee of identity can be changed to three substitutes, which is still awaiting approval from the Ministry.

### The Voice of the Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Industry

Cotton yarn is neither supplied through official channels nor allowed to be purchased on the black market; more than seventy cloth factories are on the verge of being forced to close.

Wujin is located in the center of the Beijing-Shanghai line and has always been a distribution area for local cloth production and sales. Before the war against Japan, various dyeing and weaving factories had more than 7,000 electric looms. After the victory, 70 factories were repaired and resumed production, with more than 4,500 looms in operation. The daily demand for raw cotton yarn is more than 280 bales, or 8,500 bales per month. They produce fine cloth and twill, which is sold in Shanghai and as far as the southwestern provinces. Although Wujin has two yarn factories, Dacheng and Minfeng, which spin yarn, their sales are very small except for their own weaving. Wujin cloth factories have been relying on the supply from private yarn factories in eight cities and counties, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Tongzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Chongming, and Taicang. Now, due to the price-limited distribution of cotton yarn implemented by Wu, the concurrent chairman of the Spinning Control Commission, to eliminate the black market, only the Mubu area has received allocations, while other areas are still disappointed. The Wujin County Dyeing and Weaving Factory Industry Association noted that Shanghai dyeing and weaving industries have received limited-price cotton yarn allocations, but Wujin cloth factories still purchase cotton yarn on the black market, resulting in higher costs and difficulty in sales. Therefore, Cha Bingchu, chairman of the industry association, along with several directors and supervisors, went to Shanghai to submit a petition to the Spinning Control Commission, requesting to participate in the allocation program and receive the same treatment to maintain their survival. They also pointed out that the Wujin weaving industry has always relied on Shanghai for raw material supplies. Now that they are not receiving allocations, it is bound to create a black market. If the black market is to be eliminated, a comprehensive plan is necessary; otherwise, not only will Wujin cloth factories be forced to shut down, but it will also encourage yarn factories to evade domestic sales.

### Speculative Sentiment Prevalent; Difficult for Chinese Stocks to Improve

Chinese stocks generally fluctuated yesterday. All stocks opened lower in the morning, causing unease among investors. Numbers 199 and 143 were sold off, lacking support, and the selling pressure persisted, leading to a gradual decline. Yong Yarn for current delivery fell to 574 yuan. Numbers 87, 198, and 171 were actively supported. Around 10:30 AM, with light volume, there was a rebound of a dozen yuan after hitting a low, but the rally was hampered by continued selling of numbers 84, 89, 83, and 27, making it difficult to gain momentum. There were repeated struggles at the lower levels. Starting from 11:45 AM, there was increased activity in covering short positions. Number 38 aggressively bought Yong Yarn, and Number 151 also entered the market. Numbers 152, 198, and 232 bought Xinyi, turning the sentiment more stable. The market closed relatively stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinyi, and Jingfu all fell by 3.33%, while Xinguang and Dongxing remained flat. Cold stocks such as cement saw slight gains, while others fell by a small margin up to 0.5%. Yonggong saw no trades for current delivery, while others experienced slight declines. In the afternoon, the market was once again pressured lower by off-exchange sellers. Short-selling activity on the trading floor was limited. Numbers 229, 89, and 38 sold off, causing all stocks to fall again. However, there was some support after the decline, and there was a brief rally near the close. Xinyi and Meiya showed signs of being squeezed for current delivery. For current delivery, Yong Yarn was only a few yuan away from the cash price. Besides Yong Yarn and Xinyi, almost no one paid attention to other stocks in the market, creating a desolate situation. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Xinyi each fell by 4%, Xinguang rose slightly, while Jingfu and Qinxing fell slightly. Cold stocks such as Datong saw some acquisition of shares and rose slightly, along with cement. The rest fell slightly up to 0.5%. For current delivery, besides Yonggong, which had no trades and no price quotations, Yong Yarn, Xinyi, and Meiya each fell by more than 0.5%, while Jingfu and Xinguang fell only slightly. Off-exchange stocks saw little change.

Foreign stocks turned sideways after the initial decline, with British and Allied Industries and Guang Steel showing relative stability. Trading volume was low, and the market opened very late. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shipping, Paper, Jardine Matheson, and Hong Kong Brewery and Distillery saw slight declines, while others remained flat.

### Extension of Household Registration Deadline by Three Days

The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau convened over ten responsible individuals from the South Goods Industry Association at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss three issues regarding sugar allocation: (1) Due to the weight of the bag, there is a shortage of 40,000 catties of sugar for all stores in the city during this allocation. It was decided that Taiwan Sugar Corporation would provide 30,000 catties for free as compensation, and the remaining 10,000 catties would be purchased by the South Goods Industry Association at a price of 800 yuan per catty. (2) The original regulation stipulated that each sugar bag should weigh 5 catties, but the bags received actually weighed 6.5 catties, resulting in a difference of 1.5 catties per bag and a total shortage of 30,000 catties for the city. It was decided that Taiwan Sugar Corporation would replenish the shortage. (3) Zhang Jingan, the head of the 18th bao in the 25th district, failed to distribute sugar allocation certificates according to regulations. It was decided that the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government would be responsible for taking disciplinary action. As for the substandard sugar issued by Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the company will be responsible for replacing it. Furthermore, some citizens have not yet received their certificates, so it has been decided to extend the deadline for three days until the 22nd. The date for the second allocation has not yet been determined.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] According to the person in charge of the primary and secondary school textbook section of the Ministry of Education, the previous reports in various newspapers that primary and secondary school textbooks were completely liberalized were inaccurate rumors. The Ministry of Education designated seven publishing houses during the war and added four more after the victory, for a total of eleven publishing houses, to jointly supply nationally approved primary and secondary school textbooks. For primary schools, nationally approved textbooks will continue to be fully adopted. For secondary schools, the "Humanities" and "Natural Sciences" subjects will be treated differently: the "Humanities" subject will continue to fully use nationally approved textbooks, while the "Natural Sciences" subject may be liberalized, with popular publishing houses compiling textbooks according to the curriculum and teaching material standards promulgated by the Ministry and submitting them for review. After the contracts of the eleven publishing houses expire in March next year, the Ministry of Education will make appropriate plans on how to conditionally and partially liberalize the market while maintaining the supply of primary and secondary school textbooks during the transition period.

### Black and White Team's Basketball Luck Lacking; Loses to Encas Again Yesterday; Only Two Points Separate the Teams at 37-39

The Fei Dao Black and White basketball team's luck continues to be lacking. In their fourth game in Shanghai last night, they lost to the Western Encas team by a score of 37-39, with only two points separating the teams. In the first half, Encas took the lead 17-13. Only about a thousand spectators attended the game at the Municipal Gymnasium last night. Cai Tingkai, the famous anti-Japanese general of the former 19th Route Army, also attended. The game was close throughout, with Black and White taking the lead in the first quarter, but they were unable to maintain it and gradually fell behind. However, the point difference was never too great. Unfortunately, Black and White ran out of time when they closed the gap to just two points.

Black and White Leads Early but Fades

The game started at 7:00 PM, with Zheng Zhifang and Liu Hesheng as referees. Black and White started with Fu Yongxin, Lin Ziyi, Guo Guoye, Li Jinzao, and Xu Yinzhen, while Encas started with Que Libotuo, Bao Lai, Ao Chailiao, V. Kailuosiji, and Gebeng Ka Guofu. After the tip-off, team captain Fu Yongxin of the home team scored first, and Lin Ziyi and Li Jinzao each made three free throws. Encas then scored their first point through Bao Lai. Fu Yongxin scored again, and Li Jinzao scored a basket, making it 9-1, with Black and White taking a significant lead. This was their golden age. As the foreign players Ao Chailiao and Libotuo scored three points in a row, Black and White led 9-4 at the end of the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Encas became more active. Libotuo and Bao Lai each made significant contributions. Black and White substituted Shen Renshou for Fu Yongxin. Foreign player Libotuo scored twice, and Encas took the lead 10-9 for the first time. Bao Lai made a free throw, and Lin Ziyi scored, tying the game at 11. They then tied again at 13. Libotuo dribbled with one hand, and Ao Chailiao scored. The buzzer sounded, and Encas led 17-13, staging a comeback.

Narrow Defeat by One Basket

After the break, the teams switched baskets and resumed play. Encas substituted Ma Han for Gebeng Qiguofu. Libotuo made a free throw first, and Cai Jindian scored. Foreign player V. Kailuosiji scored, and Black and White called a timeout, substituting Fu Yongxin for Lin Ziyi. Fu scored two baskets as soon as he entered the court. Encas called a timeout, substituting E. Kailuosiji for V. Kailuosiji. Ao Chailiao scored five points in a row. Black and White substituted Ye Kexi, taking out Shen Renshou. Before long, the third quarter ended, with Encas leading 23-29, three baskets ahead of Black and White. In the final quarter, Li Jinzao of Black and White re-entered the court, and Ye Kexi was taken off. Fu Yongxin made a long-range shot, but foreign player Libotuo scored six points in a row. Black and White called a timeout five times to reduce their momentum. Guo Guoye and Fu Yongxin then scored through a combination of shots and free throws, reducing the deficit to 32-37. At this point, Li Jinzao fouled out for the fifth time and was replaced by Lin Ziyi. Lin made a long shot, reducing the difference to just one basket. Encas called a timeout, substituting Gebeng Qiguofu for V. Kailuosiji. Bao Lai made a layup, and Cai Jindian immediately retaliated. Black and White were about to reverse the situation, but time was running out. The final buzzer sounded, and Black and White unfortunately lost to Encas 37-39. The statistics are as follows:

Encas  Field Goals  Free Throws  Fouls  Points

V. Kailuosiji  1  0  0  2

### Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Counties and Cities: Should Be Handled Seriously According to Law

City Government Follows Order to Notify Subordinates

The Municipal Government received an order from the Executive Yuan stating: "The public funds and properties of counties and cities are important local financial resources. Since the work of reorganizing local autonomy finances began in the 32nd year of the Republic, provinces, counties, and cities have been implementing the 'Provisional Regulations for Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Provinces, Counties, and Cities' (now the 'Regulations for Properly Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Counties and Cities') promulgated by the Yuan. The funds and properties have been increasing daily, with some positive results. However, this cleanup work was carried out during wartime, making it difficult to be thorough. Occupied areas were also unable to implement it due to factual constraints. Even when it was carried out sporadically, the gains and losses of the county were unstable, causing what was cleared out to be submerged again. Now that the War of Resistance has ended in victory and constitutional government is about to be implemented, in order to make the local financial foundation healthier and achieve self-sufficiency, counties and cities should actively and earnestly handle the cleanup of public funds and properties according to the 'Regulations for Cleaning Up Public Funds and Properties of Counties and Cities,' ensuring that all public funds and properties of counties and cities are returned to the public without any concealment, thereby increasing local financial resources. Furthermore, according to the promulgated 'Measures for Leasing Public Properties,' tenants are not allowed to fraudulently claim rent or sublet. However, it is reported that many counties and cities allow people to fraudulently claim rent for public properties that are leased through bidding according to the law, and then sublet them, which not only violates regulations but also affects the management and revenue of public properties. All provinces should be ordered to strictly prohibit this in order to comply with the regulations." It is reported that the Municipal Government has issued orders to its subordinates after receiving the order.

### Dark Clouds Lock Inside and Outside Tongguan

— Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

Xi'an Airmail, 11th

Why are the soldiers so hurried, building the Tongguan road?

The large city is stronger than iron, the small city is ten thousand feet high.

May I ask the Tongguan official: Is repairing the pass also to prepare for the barbarians?

——Du Shaoling

Negotiations in Shanghai and Nanjing, a full-scale war throughout the country; dark clouds tightly locked inside and outside Tongguan. The people are increasingly sinking into the abyss of poverty and distress, their sorrow and indignation soaring into the heavens.

The north is early cold, flocks of geese fly south, their cries are very sad, passing through the windy sand that covers the ground. Late autumn is already like early winter, and the fur coat is no longer warm. The old Tongguan post, the railway is repaired in a rush, lacking materials, and the construction is sloppy, so travelers are in danger and suffer greatly. This reporter traveled through the Central Plains and the Three Qin regions, abandoning the plane and taking the train to cross Tongguan, sharing the suffering of the people, feeling a sense of self-satisfaction, and taking it as a joy. From Zhengzhou to Xi'an, the same train included gentlemen from the inspection team of the Ministry of Transportation, with extensive knowledge. They were dispatched by Mr. Yu Dawei to inspect various lines. The reporter asked if there were railways in the world today like the Longhai Railway. They offered no direct answer, but lamented the distress of Chinese engineers, saying that they had nothing to do.

The 588 kilometers between Zhengzhou and Xi'an took two days and nights, a total of 40 hours. Travelers described their exhaustion and misery, the cold air in the car was overwhelming, and they spoke of the country with sighs, followed by laughter. When experiencing the suffering of the journey, everyone showed extreme patience. Perhaps they were entrusting deep sorrow to humor. The weakening of the Chinese national character did not begin today, and those who call for tempering and striving may not have noticed the root causes. Crises are everywhere, making people tremble! There were students from the Northwest Associated University on the train, sons of the three great families of Thailand, feeling that employment was difficult, and even studying abroad was full of obstacles. The reporter comforted them with "nothing to do," trying to share their feelings.

The Longhai Railway passes through Luoyang and Shanzhou, crossing Tongguan, and relies on the Xiao Han of the Funiu Mountains. Zhongnan Mountain is the spine of the Northern Range, and the Funiu and Xiao Han are its limbs. Following the road westward, the terrain gradually rises, overlooking the Yellow River, which is rushing north, striking the Shandong hills, with a myriad of sights. The "Historical Records" mentioned the solidity of Xiao Han when discussing the situation of the Three Qin, referring to the area east of Tongguan. Passing Mianchi and entering the territory of Shanzhou, Zhangmao Station is the highest point through the Xiao Mountains, with upward and downward slopes of 1.5 per thousand, extending for 30 kilometers. A train overturned at Jiaokou, and 120 passengers were killed in the valley, not a single one survived, just a month ago, on that slope. Soldiers forced the train to add cars, the driver lacked experience, and the roadbed was newly built, still in the detour stage, resulting in the tragedy.

On this road, there is also a detour bridge 150 meters long, crossing a valley, reaching a height of 45 meters. It uses more than 10,000 pieces of wood and more than 10,000 iron bolts, all locally produced. The screw threads on the bolts are not deep, and they are easily loosened after vibration. According to the usual practice of Chinese and foreign railway engineering, detour bridges are generally about 20 meters long, and 50 meters is extremely dangerous, but this bridge reaches 150 meters and is used to officially transport passengers and goods. The train travels on it, trembling and staggering, with hearts in throats. Although the road is inspected every day, there are things that cannot be remedied by human effort. Once an accident occurs, the tragedy can be imagined. Today, in order to rush to open the railway, there are unavoidable difficulties due to the lack of materials, but it has not been heard that the transportation authorities have any guarantees. This urgently needs to be questioned by the Ministry of Transportation. The reporter observed the terrain and found that it was not impossible to change the bridge into a large embankment. Although the amount of earthwork is huge and the project is quite extensive, in the absence of readily available steel for bridge construction, while temporarily opening a detour bridge, starting construction on the large embankment would be a way to ensure safety, and its cost would definitely not be higher than using a steel bridge.

In the Zhengzhou area, on both sides of the Longhai Line, 100 meters from the railway, defensive trenches are being dug, running parallel to the railway, stretching endlessly. The project is also enormous, and I believe that if the earthwork of ten miles were moved here, it would be more than enough.

The Longhai and Pinghan lines currently have the busiest military transport, reaching almost 70 percent. Railway workers are often beaten and insulted by soldiers, even to the point of injury. The soldiers accuse the railways of being corrupt, and they call the soldiers tyrannical. In short, it shows a lack of law and order. Stationmasters along the way board the train to report incidents that have occurred or are occurring. The salaries of Longhai employees are very low, far less than those of the soldiers. But they are serving the soldiers with 70 percent of their effort, and encountering this, it is also understandable! As for the corruption of the Longhai Railway, it is almost a settled conclusion.

A certain military quartermaster on the train was excited to hear that military pay would be adjusted again in September. But he also did not know how much a military's monthly expenses were. Taking a division as a unit, there are Class A divisions and Class B divisions, and the brigade organization of each division is not entirely consistent. Each unit also has different treatment depending on its nature and local conditions, so it is not easy to find a standard budget figure. There are eight supply zones and seventeen officer teams nationwide. In Zhengzhou alone, there are as many as 260 military supply units. At the time of victory last year, the monthly expense of an ordinary division was 160 million in cash. It has now been adjusted three times, almost increasing tenfold. If we take 200 infantry divisions (brigades) and estimate an average of 1.5 billion per division, it would be 300 billion. Furthermore, high-level agencies, officer teams, air force, navy, and special forces are not included. As for the allocation of food, the staple food is wheat at 67 catties per unit, costing 200 yuan per catty, the required amount for 4 million people would be worth 53.6 billion. Rice in the south is twice as expensive. But this is in kind and does not require negotiating prices. Although it is stipulated that non-staple foods and other military supplies should be distributed in kind in principle, it is still difficult to do so completely in China today. The non-staple food of dried horse meat, etc., is converted into cash, which still relies on negotiating prices. Therefore, after this adjustment in military pay, the reporter estimates that at least an additional 1 trillion yuan in new banknotes will be required each month, without a doubt. This will have a decisive impact on stimulating prices.

Recently, prices have been soaring, just like on the westward line, the higher the terrain, the higher the prices. When we arrived in Xi'an, the price of rice reached 130,000 yuan per hundred catties, and flour was more than 500 yuan per catty. The government strictly enforced price controls, which was said to be in accordance with the Executive Yuan's implementation. How could the situation in Xi'an be so special? The result of the price controls has caused a serious food shortage in Xi'an, with flour and meat disappearing, and people fighting and bleeding for rationed flour. Today, Xi'an is probably the city with the highest food prices in the country. But 20 miles outside the city, food prices are only half of that, so the manipulation is clearly visible. This price stabilization association, jointly formed by officials and merchants, has increased the pressure of prices on the 500,000 citizens of Xi'an.

Red Soil and White Poplars Pass

The Central Plains is yellow soil, the Guanzhong region is red soil, and Chinese agricultural society grew up here. The Central Plains has become a battlefield, the people have a worried look, there are no complete houses in the fields, and it is difficult to describe the devastation. However, Guanzhong relies on the Yellow River and the Tongguan trench to ensure its integrity. The reporter once discussed the situation in Guanzhong: During the War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist army confronted the enemy with a considerable corps in central Shaanxi. The enemy did not attack Yan'an or Chang'an, did not waste troops, and did not increase the battlefield. This was the only wise move in terms of political and strategic strategy in the war of aggression against China. Today, passing Tongguan and looking back, all that can be seen is the clouds and smoke of Mount Hua, layer upon layer, concealing the high mountains, the wheat is green, and the red soil and white poplars stand tall, the mountains have more forests than the Central Plains. Therefore, the pure and steady atmosphere of Guanzhong is still no less than it was in those years. However, the people's poverty and distress have not lessened compared to the Central Plains. Many people in Chang'an wear fur coats in the market, but on the road, old women and children with ragged clothes are seen everywhere.

The access point to southwestern Shanxi today is only through Tongguan and Fenglingdu. Mr. Yan Xishan has his own province-based methods for Shanxi's facilities. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the situation was difficult, but he was still able to hold his own. He was praised as Yan Xishan who never retreated, and he truly deserves it. After the victory, Hu Zongnan's troops were ordered to cross Fenglingdu and enter southwestern Shanxi. The Communist army retreated, and the famous First Division advanced into Linfen. Emphasizing combat and neglecting defense, the Communist army mobilized a large force and launched a deadly siege, causing the division to suffer heavy losses. In recent months, there have been no major battles, and military forces on the north and south of the Tongpu Railway have reportedly clashed. The eastern front stops at Fushan, and Tongguan, a small place, is as crowded as it was in the early days of the War of Resistance.

North of Tongguan, the Yili River crossing can also enter southwestern Shanxi, but transportation is inconvenient, especially after the rain, the muddy pools can block the axles. The roads around the passes are mostly like this. Cao Ruizhi, director of the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, encountered the reporter in Xi'an due to rain blocking the road from Chongqing to Shanxi. He led a surveying team from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and planned to cross the river at Shanlongmenkou and survey the area along the way.

The situation in Shaanxi and Shanxi seems to be the same as in the one or two years before the War of Resistance. It is said that Yan Xishan has implemented a land distribution and integration of soldiers and farmers system, which is even more advanced than the "land village commune" of the past. The "integration of soldiers and farmers" means that farmers are organized to defend the local area. Every six people send one person to serve in the regular army, and the other five are responsible for supporting their families and cultivating the land. Some people in the area also oppose this, but it is still being implemented step by step. In politics, there is the establishment of the "Democratic Revolutionary Comrades Association," with Yan as the chairman. Today, many people in Shanxi no longer call Yan "official" but "Chairman Yan." Since the reporter has not obtained the details of all of this, it is inconvenient to make a judgment. However, driven by the situation, there are often practical reforms, taking the lead, which is most commendable. However, the current military discipline is not good, and the people of Shanxi have many complaints.

What the people of the country are most concerned about should be the confrontation in central Shaanxi, but since the victory, there have been major battles everywhere, except for this corner, which is silent. The outbreak of war began with the surrender, and who knows how far it will spread? However, there is nothing to report so far. There is no shortage of merchants coming and going, but they are all smuggling and trafficking privately. A train can be taken from Xianyang to Tongguan. Tongguan has coal mines. During the war, the Longhai Railway opened this Xiantong branch line to supply fuel. From Tongguan, the road is muddy and blocked after the rain, just like other roads.

As for what people in southern Shaanxi and western Henan are concerned about, Li Xiannian's troops are currently occupying the mountainous areas on the border of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei, and have even followed the southern foothills of the Qinling Mountains and the northern bank of the Hanshui River to the Liuba area. Although the number of people is small, they have a set of methods. The mountainous areas are barren and the people are poor, and they are organizing and developing, but they have not taken a step into northern Sichuan.

Heavy dark clouds surround Tongguan. In the past, the Central Plains was a place of four battles, and Guanzhong had the danger of four blockades, controlling Tongguan and being in the upper reaches of the Central Plains. Shanxi was like pouring water onto Hebei. Tongguan was its throat. Today, transportation is open in all directions, but the situation of interwoven interests is no less. Good generals and strong soldiers are gathered within a thousand miles, and it is impossible to imagine the situation after peace is completely destroyed.

After arriving in Xi'an, the reporter crossed the Wei River Bridge, toured Lintong, climbed Mount Li, visited the Hupan Stone, explored the traces of the Xi'an Incident, and bathed in the Huaqing Pool, becoming a wealthy guest for one night. The full moon rose in the east forest, the cold light reflected on the water, the mountain wind was piercing, the trees rustled, and I patrolled the ancient city of Lintong, with only a few dim lights. The sound of the spring on the left side of the road, the smoke and clouds of a hundred generations, still remain in the night mist. Thinking about the tortuous evolution of history, there were infinite emotions.

### Molotov at the United Nations General Assembly

— Our Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

New York Airmail, November 4th

He is forever the archetypal dignified old man on stage. … From the moment he disembarked from the Queen Elizabeth liner onto American docks, photographers and reporters followed him daily. Even the smallest details of his off-duty activities were revealed in the newspapers without omission.

In the entire United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is undoubtedly the most closely watched figure. His imposing “style” may surpass that of Metternich during the Congress of Vienna era or Clemenceau during the Versailles Conference era. Our generation did not witness Metternich or Clemenceau in their prime, but from what I imagine, I feel that Molotov is even more stubborn, profound, and overbearing than they were.

Molotov is weary of New York's nightlife. The Soviet delegation spent lavishly to acquire several luxurious residences in the New York countryside, close to the Flushing venue for convenience during meetings. On the opening day of the General Assembly, the Soviet delegation's cars lined up like a long snake at the entrance. Molotov led a large entourage of civil and military officials into the hall. Dozens of cameras were aimed at Molotov all at once, but he remained calm. He does not understand English or French, yet he calmly handles documents in those languages. The Soviet delegation is organized with machine-like precision. Before Molotov, Gromyko behaves like a well-behaved schoolboy. Vyshinsky occasionally speaks to him with a smile, but Molotov remains stern and dignified.

### For a Close-Up Shot, Mr. Molotov Performs Again

On the day the Security Council and the General Assembly convened simultaneously, Molotov also attended in person. As usual, when Molotov entered the hall, a large group of Russian civil and military officials followed behind him. American representative Johnson slipped in alone through a side door. Our representative, Dr. Guo Fuchu, was already seated in a corner of the hall. (The Security Council seats rotate, and China and France happened to be in two different corners). Sir Alexander Cadogan, the quintessential British diplomat, was the chair that day. He stood up and shook hands with Molotov. A large group of photographers surged forward, and some who were a step behind asked, "Could you do it again?" Molotov seemed to be in high spirits that day, and he really did "perform" it again.

### Cadogan's Muffled Pronunciation Translated by Molotov's Interpreter

Cadogan's muffled nasal voice filled the hall with a solemn British atmosphere. He read out the letter from the Swiss government requesting to join the "International Court of Justice" and then proposed it for discussion. Molotov did not understand English. A young, blue-eyed, blonde-haired attendant interpreter leaned over from behind and whispered a Russian translation into Molotov's ear. Molotov did not turn his head at all, his eyes looking upwards, nodding slightly. Then he considered his own ideas. He frequently raised his glass to drink water, and his two black eyes, with the hair receding in the middle, revealed a deep, sharp, and even stubborn expression.

Cadogan took off his glasses and held the earpiece of his glasses in his mouth like a pipe. The Mexican representative proposed referring it to a committee of experts for review, and then discussing it further. This Swiss public case was thus concluded. Cadogan loosened his buttocks and was about to announce the adjournment when the Polish scholar representative, Lange, prevented the adjournment. His fluent English, as always, was tactful and powerful, and he raised the issue of sanctions against Spain again. He said: The Security Council has discussed the Spanish issue for so long, but the issue remains unresolved. Why is it not included in today's "agenda"? After Lange finished speaking, as always, he turned to the people next to him with a smile, but the result was also the same as always, no one responded with a smile.

### Mr. Molotov Speaks in Russian, Cadogan Shows Difficulty

Molotov spoke in Russian. He agreed to immediately discuss the issue of sanctions against Spain. After the young translator rendered it into English, Cadogan looked very embarrassed. Finally, the representatives of Egypt and the Netherlands mediated and decided to postpone the discussion for three days. Cadogan asked Molotov, and Molotov said nothing, only nodded a few times. Lange again used beautiful English to say that the Egyptian representative's meaning was: "Reasonable and acceptable."

At the adjournment, Molotov was the first to rush out of the hall, with the Slavic civil and military officials following closely behind. That day, Molotov's short few words made "headline" news again in the New York evening papers.

### Two Young Interpreters, Excellent in English and Shorthand

The New York Times and the Herald Tribune published the full text of Molotov's speech blasting England and the United States, and also published many photos of his speaking posture. That speech was delivered at the General Assembly, spoken in Russian and then translated into English. Molotov brought two very capable interpreters who not only needed to be good at both English and Russian, but also needed to understand very proficient shorthand. These two young Russians were in no way inferior to the General Assembly's full-time interpreters.

Russians mostly speak solemnly, with stiff postures but not lacking in emotional power. Molotov is the same, his hands always moving up and down, and moving in the same way. When he speaks Russian, the audience, because they do not understand the content, only looks at his expression and posture. After it is translated into English, the seats of the British and American delegations are immediately filled with tension.

British Deputy Chief Sir Alexander Cadogan sat at the foot of the podium. After each representative of a major country (and also small countries) finished speaking and stepped down from the podium, he would definitely bend over and shake hands warmly. There was only one exception, and that was when Molotov stepped down from the podium.

### The Most Subtle One-Fiftieth of a Second Shot - Unfortunately, the Photographer Did Not Capture It

The opposite situation was: Molotov walked past Mrs. Roosevelt's seat, wanting to reach out and shake hands with Mrs. Roosevelt, but the American women leader did not move, nor did she say a word of compliment about the success of his speech. That moment was subtle, at most "one-fiftieth" of a second, and the photographer did not capture it.

The New York Daily Mirror reporter, Edward, sitting next to me, said: Although Mrs. Roosevelt is seen as "left-leaning," she is, after all, a devout patriot. He also said: A patriotic American cannot tolerate such a public insult to the United States. Edward saw that "one-fiftieth of a second" shot very clearly.

### Mr. Molotov Rarely Applauds, Except for Truman

Diplomatic occasions must be evenly matched. When the US Chief Representative Austin responded to the Soviet speech, there was a burst of warm applause from the audience, but Molotov did not move. Molotov rarely applauded for others. He applauded when President Truman delivered his speech. When Indian representative Pandit spoke about countries withdrawing troops from the territories of non-enemy states, the Russian delegation applauded enthusiastically, but Molotov was not there that day.

### The American Public's Impression of Mr. Molotov is Extremely Deepened

But whether viewed positively or negatively, Molotov's impression on American society is extremely profound. Since he disembarked from the Queen Elizabeth liner onto American docks, almost every day, New York newspapers have published Molotov's speeches, actions, and photos. Photographers and special reporters follow him daily, and even the smallest details of his off-duty activities are revealed in the newspapers without omission. I remember that during the first United Nations General Assembly in London this January, Vyshinsky also became the object of British reporters' attention for a while. Vyshinsky told those reporters: "Please don't keep focusing on me for news, go find my daughter, she is a beautiful girl who can talk and socialize!" That Miss Vyshinsky later made many absurd remarks, such as: "Why is the clock in Westminster Abbey so old?" For example: "I like to see the white horse of the Royal Guard in front of Buckingham Palace," which became good material for the supplements and "bits and pieces" or "tidbits" in London newspapers.

### Besides Quoting Lenin, He is Not Accustomed to Citing Classics

Molotov did not bring such a son or daughter to America. He is forever the archetypal dignified old man on stage. In Vyshinsky's speeches, he often liked to mention Turgenev, Tolstoy, Gorky, etc., and even "bragged" about Russian music one day in a subcommittee (Russian music has always been considered very important in Western society). Just like Chinese Dr. Xia Jinlin, who often uses fluent English to talk about Confucius's philosophy, this can originally reconcile the atmosphere of the meeting. But Molotov never does that. He sometimes quotes classics, but only from Lenin or Stalin, and even Lenin is rarely quoted.

On the weekend of the first week of the meeting, I watched a movie in a theater. In the newsreel, Molotov appeared again. In the left corner of the theater, there were seven or eight voices applauding, followed by a large chorus of "boo" sounds. Is this a small public opinion poll? Molotov himself must understand it better than we do.

### A Perspective on Xinjiang (3)

— Special Translation by Our Editorial Office

(3)

The position of Zhang Zhizhong, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, can be considered the most difficult position in all of Asia. If Zhang can make the four million Muslims in that vast region loyal to the National Government, he will surely establish a great miracle in political history.

Zhang is now undertaking this arduous task, facing various obstacles, the biggest of which is the legacy left by his predecessor, Sheng Shicai. What Sheng Shicai's ten years of tyrannical rule left in the hearts of the Xinjiang Muslims was nothing but a deep-seated hatred for the Chinese authorities.

As a result of the successful Yining Incident, an autonomous Muslim government was established in the northwestern part of Xinjiang, which accounts for one-third of the province's most fertile area. The rebels signed a treaty in Dihua on June 6 this year, agreeing that the three rebellious areas in the northwest should be part of Xinjiang Province and be governed by the joint Chinese-Muslim government. However, from all aspects of my observation, I cannot prove that the so-called "East Turkestan People's Republic" has the sincerity to fulfill the Dihua Treaty.

Currently, the military power of the Chinese government in Xinjiang is bounded by the Manas River, which is 70 miles west of Dihua. Outside this boundary, no Central Government troops or officials are allowed to cross the line. As a result, the Xinjiang government in Dihua cannot obtain the much-needed coal, oil, gold, grains, flour, meat, and leather from the resource-rich northwest, while the rebels are doing good business with the Soviet Union across the Kazakhstan border. In fact, a large number of Soviet goods are freely smuggled to Dihua via Yining, and the Muslims in Yining even prohibit Chairman Zhang from obtaining gasoline from the rich Usu oil field 150 miles west of Dihua. In Dihua, the price of gasoline per gallon is three US dollars.

The Yining rebels have a well-organized army, with a strength of at least 11,000 people, totaling six regiments, half cavalry and half infantry.

I have spoken with several Uyghur leaders loyal to Zhang, and they are all worried about Zhang. Unless Sheng Shicai is brought to justice, it will be difficult for Zhang to regain the hearts of the people. In fact, the Muslims have filed a lawsuit with the Xinjiang Provincial Assembly accusing Sheng of mistreating the people, confiscating people's property, and imprisoning good people, requesting a legal trial. The Central Government still retains administrative control in the vast desert area south of the Tianshan Mountains, but the Uyghurs also do not have a good impression of the Chinese government because they resent Sheng Shicai.

### The Trade Scramble between England, America and Soviet Union the Outline of the Three Trade Worlds Are Gradually Emerging

— Translated from "World Report" Weekly by Nan

Translated from World Report Weekly by Our Editorial Office

The specter of war is gradually disappearing, and the outlines of the three trade worlds are gradually emerging.

One trade world is forming under the leadership of the United States: The United States is the largest exporter, and is currently providing tens of billions of loans to other countries, hoping to export even more as a result. Another trade world is centered on England: England is the largest importer, and is now stepping up exports, hoping to import even more as a result. The Soviet Union is forming the third trade world: The Soviet Union is the most self-sufficient country on Earth, and is now obviously trying to become even more self-sufficient.

What is dangerous is that the boundaries of these three trade worlds may harden and become barriers, and the result may not only fail to achieve trade but also harm peace.

The surge in exports from England and the United States temporarily conceals the fact that the world is divided into three trade spheres of influence. The value of US commercial exports has reached a 26-year high, and the highest record of 1920 is already in sight. England's exports are more than 50% higher than expected, and 15% higher than in 1938.

But the sharp wording in the Paris Conference has already revealed the fear and future difficulties hidden behind the increase in export figures. US Secretary of State Byrnes has publicly accused the Soviet Union of trying to force small countries to join its own trade world, not allowing outside interference. He compared the Soviet Union's actions to those of Germany in the Hitler era, calling it economic slavery and exploitation. Byrnes said: The United States advocates the establishment of an economic world in which there are no treaties or conspiracies that can restrict trade and distort international economic relations.

### World Trade Divided into Three

But what Byrnes opposes already exists in fact. In terms of trade, what exists today is not one world but rather three quite distinct worlds. In addition to geographical conditions, different trade policies and implementation methods divide world trade into three.

Moscow is the hub of a trade world, which includes not only pre-war Soviet Union but also other countries such as Finland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania. The strength of the Soviet army, supplemented by the political activities of communist groups, has dragged these lands into the Soviet world.

Due to the Soviet Union's domestic reconstruction work, it is urgently necessary to conduct trade with the outside world, but the conditions for this trade always follow the methods prescribed by Moscow. There are very few opportunities for private commerce, and all transactions are handled by government agencies. At the same time, Soviet politics influences many transactions, changing the nature of trade.

In fact, the trade controlled by Moscow is still relatively small in quantity, accounting for only about 7% of the world's total exports and imports according to pre-war figures.

But the actual importance is much greater. Moscow's success in trade will increase the Soviet Union's self-sufficiency, which will accelerate its political isolation. If Europe is isolated from the eastern agricultural areas, the chances of recovery will be even less than they are now. The entire economic world advocated by the United States will also be shattered.

### US Trade Scope Unclear

Washington is the hub of another trade world, whose scope, methods, and purposes are almost completely different from the trade world centered on Moscow. The scope of US trade is vague. Generally speaking, it includes most of Central and South America, with Argentina as an exception. The Philippines are clearly included, and perhaps China is also included. As for whether the United States can bring European countries that accept its loans into its scope, it is still uncertain.

What connects this world is the common acceptance of the United States' leadership in economic affairs, at least verbally agreeing with the United States' goal of freely expanding world trade. Different trade policies and methods are considered temporary products of wartime.

The scope of US trade represents the ideal of free trade. In normal times, one-fifth of international commodity trade circulates within this region. The United States itself accounts for 15% of the world's commodity exports and 10% of commodity imports. The improvement or deterioration of the US economic situation is closely related to the whole world.

### London is Between the Soviet Union and the United States

London stands in the middle of Washington and Moscow, both in terms of trade and geography. The trade world centered on London is willing to support the United States' world trade policy, but has not yet abandoned the wartime measures against free trade. When signing the Anglo-American loan, England guaranteed that the sterling area, preferential treatment within the British Empire, and bilateral agreements restricting trade competition would all be eliminated. As for when to eliminate them, it must be decided by England after considering the actual situation.

The composition of England's world trade is clearer than that of the United States, and includes the entire United Kingdom. Before the end of the war, the bilateral currency and trade agreements signed by England and Western European countries expanded the scope by a lot. Before the war, the British Empire accounted for one-third of the world's imports and more than one-quarter of the world's exports. If London's power can absorb many European countries through many bilateral agreements, then England can represent half of the world's trade.

The struggle between England, the Soviet Union, and the United States in trade concepts and methods has now gone beyond their own scope and touched on several countries that occupy strategic positions. The trade struggle is evolving into an ideological struggle.

### Trieste Port

— Zuoqi

At the recent meeting of the four foreign ministers in New York, there is still no sign of a solution to the long-standing unresolved issue of the Port of Trieste.

The Port of Trieste (Trieste) is located on the Istrian Peninsula, on the northernmost end of the Adriatic Sea. This place is a strategic point for Central Europe to reach the sea, and its position is important. Therefore, both Italy and Yugoslavia attach great importance to it, and compete for territorial sovereignty. The Soviet Union wants to gain a foothold in the Mediterranean, and England and the United States want to prevent its influence from intruding, so they do not hesitate to act as backstage supporters, and often argue endlessly in many international conferences, which increases the complexity of the Trieste Port issue.

Before the First World War, the Port of Trieste was the only important port for Austria to reach the Mediterranean. After the war, it was ceded to Italy according to the Treaty of Versailles. Now, after the Second World War, the sovereignty of the Port of Trieste is still undecided.

The Port of Trieste is industrially prosperous, with shipbuilding, oil refining, and machinery being its main industries. Commerce is also thriving. Exports mainly include grape wine, oil, tobacco, wool, etc.

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Misguided Path of British Diplomacy: Economic Panic Has Cast a Shadow

— Chu Yu-kun

In the post-war world, both politically and economically, vulnerabilities are exposed everywhere. In order to restore the freedom of international trade, the United States convened an international trade and employment conference in London to discuss reducing tariff barriers. At the same time, it took the lead in conducting business negotiations with eighteen countries in the world, hoping to jointly reduce tariffs with various countries. However, the future of American export trade is still difficult to maintain at past levels. In Britain, too, the shadow of global economic panic has been cast upon the world, and to prevent this shadow from moving to Britain, it has begun to implement austerity measures. The reporting of these news makes everyone have to worry about the future of the world economy!

In this week, the issues discussed by the United Nations General Assembly, in addition to the demands of some small countries to amend the United Nations Charter due to dissatisfaction with the permanent members of the Security Council exercising the "veto power", there was also the issue of the trusteeship of a colony, which also took a long time for the United Nations General Assembly to discuss without achieving any results.

Small Countries Advocate Amending the Charter

The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met on the 14th of this month. Representatives of several small countries, especially Australia, Cuba, the Philippines, Argentina and other countries, delivered speeches one after another, unanimously criticizing the "veto power" and believing that the existence of the "veto power" is a manifestation of "dictatorship by powerful countries", which should not be allowed to exist in this era of peace and democracy. Therefore, they unanimously demanded the amendment of the United Nations Charter; but on the other hand, the five permanent members, especially the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union, firmly opposed amending the United Nations Charter and advocated submitting this issue to the Five Powers Conference for resolution. At that time, the major powers and small countries held their own views, almost bringing the General Assembly to the brink of collapse. Fortunately, the representatives of China and France, with a moderate attitude, put forward a compromise plan, advocating that the five powers should exercise their veto power only on important issues, and the atmosphere of the United Nations General Assembly began to ease slightly. In addition, the United Kingdom proposed to submit this issue to the Five Powers Conference for discussion, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also expressed his agreement.

In addition, British Foreign Secretary Bevin also put forward a suggestion, advocating four points: (1) The five powers should exercise their veto power only on cases that are closely related to their own interests; (2) Abstaining from voting should not be regarded as exercising veto power; (3) Efforts should be made to reduce the opportunities for the five powers to exercise their veto power; (4) Clear explanations should be given for various disputes. The US representative has expressed agreement, and there will be no problem with China and France.

Progress Has Been Made on the Trieste Issue

This time, the four foreign ministers held a meeting in New York to review the drafts of various peace treaties passed by the Paris Peace Conference, which were originally only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. US Secretary of State Byrnes also stated that if this meeting of foreign ministers still ended in discord, the United States would no longer participate in any international conferences in the future. However, when the four foreign ministers discussed the draft peace treaty with Italy, the most thorny issues of the border between Italy and Yugoslavia and the port of Trieste encountered another reef. The focus of the so-called Trieste port issue lies in the powers of the administrative governor. The Soviet Union advocated that the powers of the administrative governor over the police should be restricted, but the United Kingdom and the United States believed that they should not be restricted, otherwise it would be impossible to maintain law and order. After the reconciliation and compromise of French Foreign Minister Bidault, a compromise was finally reached. However, Molotov still wanted to clearly define the "state of emergency", and this minor issue has now been submitted to the four undersecretaries for discussion, and it is of course not difficult to resolve.

Labor Party Members Dissatisfied with Diplomacy

After the Labor Party came to power, the second Parliament opened on the 12th of this month. The King delivered a speech, and Prime Minister Attlee delivered a speech, reporting on domestic and foreign affairs. Although opposition leaders such as Churchill and Eden also routinely attacked the government's failures in domestic and foreign affairs, it is not worth paying much attention to. However, forty-one Labor Party members suddenly jointly submitted a motion, opposing the current diplomatic policy adopted by the Labor Party government, and advocating the adoption of a policy that opposes both American capitalism and Soviet communism. The news came out, shocking the world. It can not only see the cracks within the Labor Party, but also makes it very obvious that British foreign policy is at a crossroads.

After this motion is put forward, the House of Commons will inevitably discuss it, but Foreign Secretary Bevin is far away in New York, attending the meeting of four foreign ministers. Although the Prime Minister telegraphed him to return to the country to defend his diplomatic policy, the meeting of foreign ministers is of great importance and he cannot be spared, so he cannot return to the country and can only ask the Prime Minister to represent him. When the time comes, the Prime Minister Attlee's situation will be embarrassing, which is also self-evident. It is reported that Prime Minister Attlee will propose a vote of confidence. If so, the split within the British Labor Party may be inevitable.

The post-war world is disintegrating, making it really difficult for countries to cope. American diplomats have long felt depressed, and now British diplomats are also hesitating and worrying there. Where to go from here? It really requires the Labor Party authorities to carefully consider and then make a wise choice!

### Symphony of Peace

The contemporary great composer Honegger's "Prayer Symphony" was premiered in France last week with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which can be called a major event in the music world. This piece was completed in 1945 and was only played once in Zurich, Switzerland a few months ago. This time, it was played by the French Orchestra in the theater on the Avenue of the President, and the celebrities of the Paris music world warmly welcomed it. The song includes three movements, using music to describe the drama of the modern world, the sorrows of mankind, and the restoration of peace. At this concert, two other contemporary masterpieces were also premiered, namely Roberts' "Fifth Symphony" and Prokofiev's "Four Portraits".

### The Lucky One Within the Soviet Sphere: Finland Enjoys More Freedom

— Nan

Finnish Authorities Pay the Price for Democracy

Anyone who has been to Finland feels that the Soviet Union is treating this Nordic neighbor with gentle means, because compared with most countries in Eastern Europe, Finland currently enjoys more freedom.

This country has not been occupied by Soviet troops. The behavior of some Red Army soldiers and sailors attached to the control committee (located in Helsinki) is impeccable.

Although Finland was defeated in the Second World War and German troops were stationed on its territory for three years, and has been at the mercy of the Soviet Union since the armistice agreement with the Soviet Union in September 1944, the Finnish people are still free people, and are still democratic in their interests and actions, but they also pay a considerable price.

They endure pain with more tenacity than any other defeated country, but this pain is extremely serious.

There is not much food in Finland. The rations of meat, sugar and fat are far from what is needed to maintain health. Wheat bread is almost impossible to obtain, and the ration of rye bread is only barely enough. Although the rationing of fish and eggs has been abolished this summer, the price is too expensive for most families. Luxury goods are not available at all, and even tea, cocoa and coffee are included.

Although this situation has continued for two years, there are very few cases of poor health, there are no epidemic diseases, the infant mortality rate does not increase, and children do not have serious diseases or signs of malnutrition, at least not very severely.

Finland, like many other European countries, also has a black market, but its impact on the lives of ordinary Finns is relatively small. First, because very few people can afford to buy goods from the black market at extremely high prices; second, because it is not as easy to buy as in other European countries.

The extreme shortage of clothing and housing is another major problem for Finns. Leather shoes and wool fabrics are simply not available, and substitutes are very few and of poor quality. What Finns have the most is paper. At present, paper plays an important role in the lives of ordinary people.

Severe Shortages of Materials and Housing

Among the most popular paper "items" are: curtains, tablecloths, sheets, aprons, stiff collars, shoes and many other things.

Housing is also extremely scarce, so it is necessary to implement a one-room-per-person system, especially strictly in cities.

According to the armistice agreement, Finns lost Petsamo and the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean; they lost the Porkkala Peninsula near Helsinki (leased to the Soviet Union for fifty years as a naval base) and the direct railway connecting Helsinki and Turku, the two major cities; they lost the province of Karelia, including the city of Vyborg, the Saimaa industrial area, and the agricultural area that produces one-eighth of the country's meat and grain.

The provisions on reparations in the armistice agreement are particularly harsh. The Finns must pay the Soviet Union US$300 million by September 1952. Payment must be made in goods specified by the Soviet Union, and the 1938 level must be used as the basis for calculation, although the prices of several goods have increased by 10% or 15%.

Finns are not restricted by the Soviet Union in terms of propaganda, and they still run newspapers or organize political groups in their own way, the only condition is that they do not criticize the Soviet Union.

They still have the freedom to elect a parliament, but they are only prevented from admitting people who have had close relations with the Germans into the parliament. The current government is not one that the parliament likes to support, but is reluctantly elected to please the Soviet Union, but this government is at least not appointed by the Soviet Union. Moscow has issued them orders to imprison war leaders, purge the police, etc., but these orders have not gone too far.

Finns have a traditional fear of the Soviet Union, but it does not affect their tenacious attitude.

Spring and Autumn

### After Listening to Gao Zhilan's Solo Recital: Talking About Chinese Female Musicians

— Liang Youting

Listening to Miss Gao Zhilan's solo recital reminded me of the following:

Many articles discuss "women and music", and most of them cite many examples to prove that although women's personalities are closer to music art than men's, there are few female musicians in history. The nicknames of "King of Piano" (Liszt), violin virtuoso (Paganini), and even "Female Beethoven" (Schubert) are all male. In singing and opera, many women are clearly needed, but the "champion" is always unrelated to women. If there are any, they are just rare exceptions. The reason for this: I think it is not that women's musical talent is inferior to men's. God has no reason to particularly favor men; it is only because men can devote themselves to music, devote their lives to music, and even like Beethoven, never marry, "live for music, die for music", and even if men get married, it has little impact on their artistic life in music. But it is not the case for women. After marriage, the pursuit of art is sacrificed for the husband and children. Just like our professional youths, the pursuit of art is sacrificed for the sake of making a living. Lang Yuxiu's "coloratura soprano" is completely different before and after marriage. A few days ago, many people had heard her solo recital in the Zhen Dan Auditorium or the Hongkou Cultural Hall. It cannot be denied that her volume and range have been reduced to the minimum limit, and her tone has been so weak and powerless. Now, although she still wants to go to the United States for further study, it is difficult to be sure whether this mother of several children can restore her beautiful tone and bright volume before marriage. Also, the female pianist Pan Meibo was once as famous as Dong Guang, but now she is no longer seen on the stage showing her nimble and skillful ten fingers; she is now Mrs. Chen Jianhua, and family affairs have inevitably worn away her artistic efforts, and physiological changes have inevitably damaged her many talents. Although it cannot be said that marriage has absolutely destroyed her artistic achievements, the impression she gives us of going downhill cannot be said to be unrelated to family. Like Dai Ailian, a female dancer, although married to the cartoonist Ye Qianyu, a couple of artists, life is a joy, and both are currently in good shape, but how many years can it last?

Few exceptions: the soprano Mrs. Guan (Guan Yixuan) has not been adversely affected by marriage. During the Anti-Japanese War, she was very popular in the rear, no, not "popular", but indeed admired and praised for her excellent skills. She sang in Beijing and Shanghai after the victory. The volume, the tone, the expression, and the wide range (that is, being able to sing very high notes and still handle them with ease) are really fascinating and admirable. I (and many people) think she should be the top female singer in China.

However, in any case, women studying music and getting married are like bear paws and fish. I am not a shout for singleness, but this is a fact. To achieve a very high achievement in music (especially vocal music), if you are a woman, it is best to choose one between music and husband and stay with it forever. Only a few exceptions can have the best of both worlds. The famous Chinese female violin virtuoso Fei Man'er was married to an air combatant. Before the marriage, her mother strongly opposed it, fearing that marriage would hinder her musical career; during the Anti-Japanese War, her husband died in India, which made her heart covered with infinite pain and suffering in the situation of "gain and loss", although it increased her artistic emotion, it was ultimately not conducive to regular learning. Not long ago, I heard that she was going to the United States (or has already gone). If she can completely entrust her lonely life to the four strings of the violin in the future, perhaps her achievements will be more than if her husband had not died.

It is difficult to find female musicians in history, but there are quite a few female musicians in Shanghai; in addition to the above-mentioned ones, there are also Chen Liqing (a very good soprano), Qian Yishan (a cellist), etc., who all have unlimited prospects. And Miss Gao Zhilan, a coloratura soprano who is about to go to the United States recently (at the invitation of the National Music and Art Company of the United States), is also a female singer in the golden age. She is a student of Su Shilin (Italian), a famous vocal music professor in Shanghai. A famous teacher has a good student, which is highly praised. Mr. Su Shilin praised her very much. At the press conference last time, Su Shilin specially introduced her, saying that Miss Gao is the only Chinese soprano who has been hired by the American Music and Art Company. I can say that her farewell solo recital, which I listened to carefully, was generally successful. This soprano once played the lead role in operas in Shanghai before the victory. The Shanghai music scene is very familiar with her. She is often invited to the summer performances of the Municipal Orchestra. I think in terms of singing experience, she is not as experienced as Lang Yuxiu, but the "power" she expresses in her songs is far better than Miss Lang and second only to Mrs. Guan. This farewell solo recital was more progressive than her previous performances.

However, when singing later, perhaps due to vocal fatigue, the highest notes had some "raspy" feeling. This is not the case with Mrs. Guan. When she sang the entire wonderful program at the end, almost every song was requested by the audience to be repeated once, or even twice, but she showed no signs of being unable to cope. I think Miss Gao Zhilan will not let Mrs. Guan monopolize the beauty in the future after working hard for a certain period of time. However, because we have seen many musicians (especially vocal musicians) being adversely affected by marriage, I think if Miss Gao can marry herself to music, her future achievements will be extremely amazing, and will far surpass Lang Yuxiu and the others. This is one point; another point is that it seems that musicians are now withdrawing from Shanghai one after another and going to the United States unanimously. Do not "forget your motherland because of happiness", the barren Chinese music scene still needs your talents very much! Pretending to be an expert, I wrote a random article, I don't know if it is right or not?

### Red Leaves

— Xuan Jianren

—Autumn Day Submission

I love the maple forest in autumn. But red leaves evoke my boundless thoughts, because you picked this red leaf and pinned it on my chest, like a glorious medal.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

"Extremely beautiful!"

It is said that "seeing things evokes feelings". Life is a distance of many blanks, as if a playwright is playing with life, and insists on writing "reunion" as the result of a tragedy. I am now playing a tragic role on the social stage. I still don't know when it will end.

Why can't I "create" the world and find another way? What binds me is emotion; I don't have the courage to cut it off, let it make me grope on the journey of life.

When will I grope to the road of happiness?

On gloomy days, I weave the picked red leaves into poems and recite them to the boundless wilderness, so that they can resonate in your heart.

"I hope to write my name on the blank of my heart!"

Your charming smile opened the door of my melancholy, and the sun illuminated my heart.

"Don't write poems anymore!"

The water of the Jialing River converges into the Yangtze River, and the waves beat tightly on the boat. We are floating like ascending to immortality. I am silent, wanting to include our lives in one sentence. I think again and again: Oh, why bother to seriously guess the mystery of life.

No one can take away "love", unless like Newton seeing the apple falling to the ground, he is surprised by the truth of nature, and I am still waiting for the ripe fruit.

I returned to my "unfamiliar" hometown, because I was not born in this ancient city. This is my second time back to my hometown.

The pace of autumn has stepped to the gate of winter, and the red leaves will slowly wither and corrode. I remember Shelley's line:

"If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?"

I have welcomed hope towards spring, and I can have an answer in spring.

Regrettably, the west wind does not care about the old migrating geese, shaking and falling to the ends of the earth; just at the elegant gathering in the painted building (1), the bright pearl contains jade, and the wild geese fall on the sandy beach. The sound stops the clouds and flowing water (2), and the cranes cry around the vermilion glow; why bother with the autumn sound fu, chirping and sighing. Moreover, the pipa plays resentment (3), sending lovesickness red beans (4), and the fragrance teases the plum blossoms. Waiting for the curtain hook to reflect the moon, the distant green is covered by the evening smoke. Listening to the beautiful woman singing a song, the burden of playing the zither is endless and she spends her spring. The sound of the flute rises, three folds of Yangguan, where are the people.

### The Crystallization of Pain

— Ma Chaoying

When we finish watching a work of art, if we want to study this work more deeply, we may first study the inner emotions of the artist when writing this work, then we can get a deeper understanding.

Since ancient times, the works of artists have mostly been written in times of extreme grief and pain, because the world often gives many great artists extremely bad fates and encounters, making them struggle in poverty, hunger, loss of love and suffering; as a result of their struggle, their art is achieved.

A Chinese scholar said: "All great articles since ancient times are written in blood and tears." Indeed, Beethoven's "Symphony", Gissing's "The Poor Street", Storm's "Immensee", Morillo's "The Life of a Beggar", and Ropshin's "The Gray Horse" are all written after suffering. These great and immortal works of theirs are exchanged for blood and tears. They have tasted all the cruelty and sorrow of the world, but their art is as radiant as the sun and the moon. Their works are passed down to future generations, and when people read or hear them, they will feel the same way, which is what achieves their "Effect of Art".

Therefore, when we see a brilliant work of art, we should not only feel that this work is full of beauty and light, we must know that this is the crystallization of pain, this is the brilliance obtained in the darkness, it is immortal.

### The Writing Location of the *Pipa Ji*

— Tian Xing

A few months ago, I heard that the *Pipa Ji* was performed in America and received quite favorable reviews. Recently, I saw an advertisement in the newspaper saying that the *Pipa Ji* has been adapted into a spoken drama by Tian Han.

The book *Pipa Ji* is known as the ancestor of Southern Drama. Together with the *Romance of the Western Chamber* of Northern Drama, it is one of the two major pillars of Northern and Southern Drama. The story of Cai Bojie and Zhao Wuniang was already popular in the Song Dynasty. At that time, the poet Lu Fangweng had a line: "Who cares about right and wrong after death? I hear people singing about Cai Zhonglang along the street." Gao Zecheng expanded the meaning of this story and wrote the *Pipa Ji* libretto.

Gao Zecheng, originally named Ming, was from Ruian, Zhejiang, during the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. He once served as a county official in Chuzhou and had a good reputation in politics. Later, to avoid the chaos of Fang Guozhen, he abandoned his official position and lived in seclusion in Lishi Town, Ningbo. The book *Pipa Ji* was written in this place. Our *Yinxian Zhi* (Gazetteer of Yin County) has such a record.

Driven by curiosity, I made a special trip to Lishi Town. It is a small village about ten miles from Ningbo city. Ningbo Airport is now located in this area. The village used to be quite prosperous, but a major fire a few years ago destroyed more than half of the houses, so it has a rather declining appearance. Most of the residents here are farmers, and many women can weave mats. It is estimated that there are about one hundred households in the village. The folk customs are simple and honest, without gambling or other bad habits.

According to the elders, Gao Zecheng lived in a small building in a place called Shiqiangtou (Stone Wall Head). It is said that this building still existed in the early years of the Republic of China, but it was later destroyed by a fire. An old man once took me to see the ruins, which are now a vegetable garden belonging to the Liu family. He also told me many anecdotes about Gao Zecheng, saying that when Gao was writing *Pipa Ji*, he kept many fierce dogs to guard the door, fearing that guests would disturb his mind. However, Gao suffered greatly in his later years. His wife died, and he had no sons. He lived in a temple near the village, relying on a monk for a living. Eventually, he died in this place. He was buried next to a small river behind the village, without a tombstone, only a pile of dirt, leaving no trace. Unexpectedly, a writer of a generation ended up like this!

In this village, it is a tradition that every "Dengtou" (Lantern Festival, the fifteenth night of the first month), a troupe is hired to perform, and the entire *Pipa Ji* must be performed. However, in recent years, it has been difficult to find Kunqu opera performers, so Yue opera has been used as a substitute.

As mentioned above, Gao Zecheng's original hometown was Ruian, Zhejiang. I wonder what records are in the *Ruian Xian Zhi* (Gazetteer of Ruian County)? Our *Yinxian Zhi* (Gazetteer of Yin County) only says that he hid in Lishi, Ningbo, to avoid the Fang Guozhen rebellion and wrote *Pipa Ji*. Apart from this brief historical passage, there are no other records.

Recently, I saw a poem written by Gao Zecheng in the *Siming Suoji* (Miscellaneous Records of Siming) by Liu Yifeng, a scholar in the early Qing Dynasty, about lying ill in a monk's room. I have copied it out as the ending of this article.

"The white sun and yellow clouds herald dusk.

Little is left of these remaining years,

Illness is like snow on the eaves, hard to melt,

Sorrow is like ice on the pond, growing stronger.

Cutting off love exhausts my strength, but it enters my dreams,

Refining poetry opens my mind and leads to Chan;

The old monk has Zhongshan brew,

I beg for a deep cup to cure my sleeplessness."

### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood 98

— Ye Jingfeng

Under the "loyalty" test, most of the questions are of this type. It leaves you at a loss for how to answer. If you answer very beautifully: "The first principle of the Black Dragon Society is 'To sacrifice everything for the motherland,' so carrying out the orders of the committee is to protect the motherland." Such an answer will surely lead to even more difficult questions; the reason for the difficulty in answering is that if you answer correctly according to reason, what you answer will inevitably conflict with your previous answer. If you don't consider the previous and the following and answer according to reason, these executive committee members will surely think that your "thinking is inverted and illogical," and then you will not be able to receive the second-level "intelligence" test.

So, what is the most logical answer? You should say, "Executing orders is the obligation of a member. After executing orders, I will be subject to the judgment of national law and will never escape punishment." Such an answer is considered "logical."

However, if you answer this way, they will definitely ask you, "Punishment is very painful. Are you not afraid of pain?" Your answer, of course, is "I am not afraid of pain." Very good. Then prepare to suffer. They have many scientific forms of torture here; the terrifying types are all imitations of the various arrangements of sound, light, chemicals, and electricity used by Western detectives to interrogate and startle criminals. You have to try one or two of them personally. Or, like the cruel type, like the inhuman torture chambers of medieval Europe, such as fire burning, hanging, hammering, bone locking, tendon piercing, etc., you have to endure them a little. Of course, in order to keep you, a "useful person," they will let you taste a little and stop there, so as not to break your bones, but it is still enough for you to suffer. It is said that some members have suffered the disaster of three days in a water prison, and some have suffered seven days of starvation in a dungeon. That depends on the degree of trust the committee members have in you and their mood.

Or, if the committee thinks that your first-level answer is "illogical" and cannot continue the second-level test, then at most you will not be able to join the society, right? That is not possible. Why? Because you came to participate in this Black Dragon Society, whether voluntarily or forced, as long as you enter this secret society, you have already become a member. They believe that since you have come to be tested, you have stepped over the threshold, and since you have stepped over the threshold, you have learned about the secrets of their society, so you must become a member. It's just a kind of "probationary member." The so-called probationary member has a share in all the thankless tasks. When doing these thankless tasks, at least two or more senior members will be watching. If you do well, there is no reward; if you do poorly, the punishment is very harsh. If you want to "reveal the sincerity," then you can just give up your life. The so-called "revealing sincerity" means "jumping ship," or "defecting," or betraying the party, then your crime will surely be unforgivable!

The method for this type of initial test failure in the society is "on-the-spot testing," so there are also ways to accumulate merit in on-the-spot testing and be exempt from the first and second-level tests. Unfortunately, there are even those who spend their entire lives in on-the-spot testing.

In addition to the "loyalty" and "intelligence" tests, there are also "trust," "steadfastness," and "endurance," for a total of "five-level tests." After successfully completing the five levels, during the three-month initial new member period, like Wang Lun of Liangshan Marsh speaking to Lin Chong, you have to present a "certificate of allegiance." This is partly because they are imitating the method of controlling the younger brothers by the king of bandits; on the one hand, it is imitating the rules of European and American secret criminal gangs; members who join the party must first commit a murder, and the party leader will hold this criminal evidence to control you. If you do not listen to the transfer or betray the party, he will send this criminal evidence to the police station and reveal your crime.

### Abacus

— Shaofu

A taxi driver said to me:

"Friends who buy cars are too stupid. Instead of buying a car, it's better to hire a taxi."

I thought he was advertising, soliciting business for taxis. I asked him, "How do you say that?" He said:

"Sir, can you use an abacus? Suppose you spend ten million yuan to buy a car, at a monthly interest rate of two cents, that's two million yuan per month. May I ask if you need to spend seventy thousand yuan per day hiring a taxi? Moreover, if you have a car, there are the driver's salary, maintenance fees, repair fees, gasoline fees, and many other troubles..."

The reasoning is indeed correct.

Topping a house is also the same situation. Topping a building with four gold bars, two or three rooms, isn't that equivalent to paying two million yuan in rent per month? But in order to acquire property and buy a house, there are currently very few such wealthy friends in Shanghai.

All of this is due to high interest rates, which in the end reverses the principles of economics, making real value surpass everything, and banknotes keep flowing. All those who acquire property become fools.

### Ordinary People Are Not Good

— Wu Jun

Random Thoughts on Current Affairs

In this day and age, it is best to be a dumb Chinese person. If you are told to demolish the road, you obediently demolish the road. If you are told to repair the road, you obediently repair the road. Don't make a sound, because even a few words can cause trouble. It is said that there was such a story during the enemy-puppet period. A person was forced to eat three bowls and six plates of rice and was choked to death by the enemy-puppet for the two sentences "Eat more, speak less." So what can people say?

Otherwise, bow and make gestures of respect in all directions, with a smiling face, and tears can only be swallowed into the stomach. This is in accordance with Jesus's so-called mood: "If someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well." I read a news report from the Pinghan North Section front line on November 15th: "Xiao Peisun, the secretary-general of the Zhuoxian County Party Committee, told reporters that when he went to the countryside to inspect, he asked the ordinary people whether the Communist Party was good or the government was good. The ordinary people replied with a mournful face, 'The Communist Party is good, the government is good, the problem is with us ordinary people.' He almost burst into tears when he heard this." Who can read this passage without weeping bitterly!

The ordinary people's bowls are smashed, their houses are destroyed, their cattle and sheep are taken away, their chickens and pigs are slaughtered, the fields are overgrown with weeds, and the whole family has to flee in all directions and wander to other places, but they can only say "The Communist Party is good, the government is good, the problem is with us ordinary people." Isn't this even more bitter than during the Anti-Japanese War? During the Anti-Japanese War, the ordinary people could still curse the devils and the turnip heads!

After reading these three sentences, my eyes are full of tears. The long-accumulated resentment suddenly burst forth by these three sentences. The meaning of these three sentences is too much. Every word is a tear, every word is blood, every word is exchanged for blood and tears. And the ordinary people, under the pressure of blood and tears, can only say "The problem is with us ordinary people." I can't help but cry loudly!

### Heroes Devouring the People

— Yu Shiyun

Looking back at our country's history, it can be said that it is full of stories of "heroes devouring the people." Ordinary people have always been the "flesh" on the lips of "heroes," killing them as they please and eating them as they please, which is not a big deal.

Confucius's saying "The people are the most important" was also because Mencius saw the suffering of the ordinary people at that time, so he spoke angrily to urge the "heroes" to be vigilant. "I would rather betray the people of the world," Cao Cao had bad intentions, but he did not lose the argument of "heroes." Huang Chao rebelled, killing people like hemp, calling the killed ordinary people "two-legged sheep," which was a step further than Cao Cao's words. During the Jingkang disaster in the Northern Song Dynasty, the "heroes" of the whole country went even further, wanting only "sons, daughters, jade, and silk," truly wanting the "flesh" and also wanting to "wear it." During the late Ming Dynasty, the roving bandits Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng built "small feet pagodas" to satisfy their desires, and knocked on bones to extract gold, already with precedents to follow for killing people for money, and there was no shortage of words for "flesh." When the Manchus entered the customs, they also copied old articles, but the "flesh" was a little unwilling, and as a result, they staged a series of "Ten Days of Yangzhou" and "Three Massacres of Jiading." The "flesh" was still "flesh," bowing its head and lying down obediently.

Under the conservative philosophy of "killing," the "flesh" could not help but cry out in pain. With a "wow!" it mustered up five minutes of strength and became the master of the Republic of China. A second A Dou, it could not stand on its own. Those who wielded the knife came one after another, and it was paralyzed for eight years. Fortunately, blessed by heaven, victory came, and it learned the demeanor of a great nation, "not eating for three days, bulging its belly across the bridge," acting fat with others. Some "heroes" changed their minds and raised the banner of "liberating" the "flesh" of the "ordinary people," but alas, fate was doomed! It was given the title of "liberating the flesh." Other "heroes" were also wiping their greasy mouths, hearing that they no longer regarded each other as "flesh," and even automatically an "loving the flesh" organization appeared, but I don't know how to "love" them? From then on, the "flesh" can be made! It is no longer regrettable to be "flesh"!

### Mei Lanfang's Drunkenness

— Dongming

Mr. Mei Lanfang's performance at the China Grand Theater this time featured the basic good lineup of the Chenghua Society back in the day. Except for Wang Fengqing (father of the famous Qin player Wang Shaoqing) who retired due to old age, and the famous martial female role Zhu Guifang who has passed away, almost all of them were invited. It is commendable that Xiao Changhua, who is over seventy years old, also restored his collaboration on stage.

It is said that Dr. Mei responded to the repeated enthusiastic requests from all walks of life and decided to post "The Drunken Concubine," which can be said to be an amazing news! This play of Drunkenness cannot be performed without singing, reciting, acting, and performance all together. Looking around the famous actors in the north and south, in the past ten years, very few have dared to touch Drunkenness, and even if they do, they do not meet the four aforementioned conditions.

Dr. Mei's Drunkenness has a great background; every gesture and every lift of the leg is a rule, and every movement has an origin. The state of mind after being drunk is even more incomparable to any famous actor, not to mention that Mr. Mei is the most suitable person to play Yang Guifei!

Mr. Mei's singing in this play can be called a must, truly doing his best in being crisp, sweet, and charming. In addition, with the Huqin of Xu Lanyuan and Wang Shaoqing, the leading figures in the contemporary Qin world, especially Shaoqing's Erhu, it can be called unprecedented. This play has the most pieces, and both insiders and outsiders regard it as a daunting task. The pieces used by Xu and Wang in this play are many good pieces that are about to be lost, such as: Huihui Tune, Fighting Crickets, etc. Mr. Mei has not performed Drunkenness for more than ten years. The last time I saw him perform Drunkenness was at the Grand Theater. The impression at that time is still vivid, but in those years, I only saw him perform it once, so Mr. Mei's "Drunkenness" can be said to be very valuable, and it is truly not easily shown. This time, he sang for more than half a month, and every performance was full. His "body" is even better than before. Thinking that he is over fifty years old and still making progress unremittingly, it is truly admirable. Thinking of his "body" in "Drunkenness," it must be wonderful to the extreme. In addition, Mr. Mei moved this old play, whose rules are about to be lost, to the stage at the cost of hard work, which is the best opportunity for latecomers to study and imitate. Do not miss it.

### China's Exports

— Han Chan

The teacher was giving a geography lesson in the classroom, which was about China's foreign trade. The student Wang was impatient and stared blankly at the sky outside the window.

"XX: Do you know what is the most suitable export product for China today?"

Wang was suddenly called up by the teacher, and he didn't even hear the question clearly.

"You only need to say the thing that China needs the least but has the most of." The teacher was afraid that he would not understand the question, so he explained it for him.

"Then... only corruption."

### Diary of a Child

— Zhang Qiqu

Where is it Difficult to Raise?

Yesterday, because of livelihood issues, Dad and Mom had a fight. Today, Ping Shang, Dad, like a bookworm, was swaying his head and singing: "Only women and petty people are difficult to raise." Dad said this just to vent his feelings. Unexpectedly, Mom heard it, and a big wave immediately arose, thinking it was a great insult. She didn't chop vegetables or cook rice. She had to settle accounts with him. Asking him where it was difficult to raise? "The same woman, others have a Meiling plane and fly everywhere. We are also women, but with you, a man who is not as good as a beggar, we can't even afford three meals of rice. We don't have enough clothes for all four seasons, and we have to be accused of illegally occupying the house by the landlord. We are even said to be freeloading when we take the tram. What is difficult to raise about me? What is difficult to raise?"

Dad felt that he was in the wrong, but for the sake of face, he was not willing to admit defeat. He still mumbled: The difficulty in raising women and petty people has an annotation, it is not to say that their material life cannot be supported, it is to say that they "resent when kept at a distance, and are not humble when close." For example, that fallen wife next door, when her husband was in the rear, she "resented" him every day for not coming back. Now that she has brought back an anti-Japanese wife, she is not "humble" at all. Isn't this difficult to raise?

Mom saw him talking nonsense, knowing that he felt he was in the wrong, so she sneered and didn't bother to argue anymore. But I felt quite resentful in my heart, because the example Dad gave was really full of nonsense!

However, regarding the "petty person" part, I must express something. Generally speaking: there are three explanations for petty person, one is morphological, one is age, and one is personality. The woman and the petty person that the sage mentioned refer to the third type of person. The first type is a dwarf, the one who collects tickets at the Chongqing Zhongshan Park Zoo; the second type is me, a child. Neither of these two is difficult to raise, so I don't need to raise a teacher to punish them.

An Innocent Murderer The Story of a Psychoanalyst Xu Guiting

The police chief asked, "How on earth did this guy climb to such a high place?" He looked gloomily at the towering building. The young police officer replied, "There is a fire escape there. He must have gone up from there."

"Then he must be crazy," the police chief said expressionlessly. "There is no doubt about that."

Mian interrupted, "I thought maybe he would jump down."

The police chief shrugged and said, "If he jumps down, it will save us the effort of going up to catch him."

"Then, can you think of a way to get him down?"

"The friends from the fire brigade will always find a way. They will be here soon."

It was almost dawn, and Mian had already seen Lusun's back on top. He seemed to be sitting there quietly, his head against the wall. Up there, he seemed very small, and a little lonely and desolate. Mian suddenly made a decision: "I must go up and come down with him."

"No, you can't do that," the police chief said impatiently. "I will never allow anyone to break their neck for him, and he might shoot you."

"I don't think he will shoot me," Mian said. "Maybe I can get him down. I'm really sorry, Chief. I can't let him stand there. He is my patient. If I hadn't let him go in the first place, this would never have happened."

The police chief listened and had no choice but to shake his head and say, "Okay, but..."

The fire engine's bell rang. The police officer said, "They're here. They also brought a ladder."

The fire chief said to Mian, "Hey, friend. Climbing a ladder is not fun. Climb slowly and calmly. Remember, you can rest when you like when you get halfway up, but don't look down. When you stop climbing, don't forget to fasten your belt around your body!"

Mian ignored everything and climbed up.

The fireman said happily, "Maybe he can climb up. He actually has the courage to try."

"Oh, he does have the courage," the police chief said dejectedly, "but don't forget, the guy up there has a gun!"

Mian had always been afraid of going to high places. Because of fear, he clung tightly to the ladder, and his knees had no space to bend when climbing. But he had already started climbing, so he had to do it to the end. However, he forgot the fireman's instructions and climbed desperately fast. As a result, he was out of breath halfway and felt very tired. He had to stop for a while. During that short period of time, he almost made a mistake that would have caused eternal regret, because he glanced down when he was resting. Oh my God, Mian was simply scared to death, unable to move except for holding the ladder tightly. He had to close his eyes tightly and climb upwards desperately. (To be continued tomorrow)
