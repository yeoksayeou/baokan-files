### Chairman Chiang Officially Announces Eight-Day Extension of Ceasefire Order; Three-Person Meeting Possible Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang of the National Government formally announced the following on the 21st: To give the Chinese Communist Party a greater opportunity to achieve a complete resolution regarding the cessation of military conflict, the restoration of transportation, the reorganization of the army, and army stationing, I have previously ordered the front-line commanders to extend the effective period of the order to cease advancing, attacking, and pursuing until noon on June 30th of this year.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The fate of the peace negotiations, which could be continued or broken off, was decided today. At 2:00 PM this afternoon, Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda, issued a statement to Chinese and foreign reporters at the Ministry of Propaganda building: "To demonstrate the government's utmost sincerity and forbearance, it has been decided to extend the order to cease advancing and pursuing for eight days. The Chairman of the National Government has ordered that the order for all armies to cease advancing and pursuing should be extended until noon on June 30th of this year. During this period, an agreement on the cessation of conflict, the restoration of transportation, and the reorganization and unification of the army must be completed. Considering the long-term suffering of the people, it must be resolved quickly and without delay. There can be no further delays in the future."

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At 2:17 PM today, shortly after Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei read the government's public announcement of the extension of the ceasefire deadline, he received a regular call from the Office of the Chairman of the National Government. About five minutes later, he formally announced the order of Chairman Chiang of the National Government, which he had heard on the phone, resulting in many foreign reporters not being able to obtain the content of Chairman Chiang's explicit order at that time.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At 9:00 AM this morning, Marshall visited Chairman Chiang for an hour. After Marshall left and returned to his residence, he invited Zhou Enlai by phone. Zhou then visited Marshall at 11:00 AM and talked for about half an hour, thus realizing the final hope for extending the ceasefire deadline by eight days.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] It is reported that a new plan for restoring transportation may be agreed upon after one or two more rounds of negotiations. The crux of the current peace negotiations remains the reorganization and unification of the army. This issue will be raised by the Military Three-Person Committee for formal discussion. According to Zhou Enlai's public statement today, this meeting may be held tomorrow. Qualified observers say that if the CCP agrees to the government's new proposal regarding Marshall's arbitration authority, it could be held at any time.

### Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Discusses Content of Negotiations; Adds Item of Political Issues; Hopes CCP Will Discuss With Sincerity

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] On the evening of the 21st, reporters visited the spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department regarding the letter from the CCP representatives to the government representatives, seeking their opinion. The spokesperson said: "This afternoon, after the Chairman announced the extension of the ceasefire, the government representatives received a letter from the CCP, which also advocated continuing the ceasefire and continuing negotiations, but without a negotiation deadline. In addition to the three items proposed by the Chairman in the ceasefire order: cessation of conflict, restoration of transportation, and army reorganization and demobilization, a fourth item was added: 'The government, through consultation, will periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference to quickly resolve various political issues such as the reorganization of the government, protection of human rights, relief of people's livelihood, and completion of unification.' This fourth item is indeed important, but the resolutions of the Consultative Conference regarding the reorganization of the government failed to be implemented due to unexpected complications created by the CCP. The government has implemented measures for the protection of human rights and continues to strengthen them, but it is hoped that the CCP area will also improve slightly, so that the one area of northern Jiangsu will not have more than three million refugees fleeing, wandering and suffering beyond description. As for how the people's livelihood has not been relieved and how unification has not been completed, the CCP knows this very well. Putting these empty topics aside, like spreading nets everywhere, according to past negotiation experiences, it will take months and years, and the distance will become further and further. Therefore, the government advocates distinguishing between urgency and importance, and first deciding and implementing the three most urgent issues. Which of these different opinions is better? It is hoped that the millions of refugees in northern Jiangsu can answer immediately without thinking. Fortunately, General Zhou Enlai declared that he would strive to address the government's proposal to resolve the three urgent issues by the end of the month. It is hoped that the CCP will truly open up, be sincere, and earnestly discuss, so that the three issues can be resolved within eight days."

### Patriotic League of Northeast Students Parades in Nanjing, Shouting Slogans

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] More than a hundred members of the Patriotic League of Northeast Students paraded in Nanjing this morning, calling for peace and shouting slogans such as "Northeast cannot tolerate chaos," "Military orders must be unified," "Sovereignty must be complete," and "Strive for peaceful nation-building." They also distributed letters to compatriots across the country along the way, their emotions were extremely agitated, and the citizens were quite moved.

### Arbitration Authority; Decided by Majority

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] It is learned that the government has made some explanations regarding the arbitration authority. The procedure for handling issues in the future Three-Person Committee and the Executive Headquarters will be determined by majority vote (Majority Vote) instead of unanimous vote (UnanimouoVote), that is, the agreement of a majority of two out of three people is sufficient to make a decision.

### CCP Submits Four Proposals in a Letter; Government Representatives Forward to Chairman

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Zhou Enlai made the following statement regarding the government's decision to extend the Northeast ceasefire to June 30th: "We have always advocated a long-term ceasefire for the military conflict in the Northeast. Today, on the expiration of the fifteen-day ceasefire period, the CCP delegation has submitted a proposal based on the instructions of the CCP Central Committee, and further requested Chairman Chiang and government representatives to immediately announce a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast in order to negotiate all issues. Now that the government has announced the extension of the validity period of the order to cease offensive advances, troop movements, and pursuits in the Northeast until June 30th due to the efforts of all parties and the calls of the people, although this is far from our proposal, we will spare no effort as long as there is a glimmer of hope for peace. Therefore, as long as the government troops abide by the government's orders and cease attacking our troops, I dare to guarantee that our troops will firmly defend their original positions so that both sides can seek a long-term ceasefire and realize peace with the assistance of General Marshall." In addition, the CCP delegation sent a letter to Chairman Chiang and government representatives today, the original text of which is as follows: "Sirs Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Xueting, Lizi, Lifu, and Lisheng, and please forward it to Chairman Chiang for his perusal. Since the Northeast ceasefire, the hearts of the people across the country and world public opinion have all yearned for our two parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, to obtain a unanimous agreement on the three issues of transportation, ceasefire, and army reorganization in the Northeast during these fifteen days through the joint efforts of General Marshall, so that the temporary ceasefire can become a long-term ceasefire, so as to reopen the door to peace and unity. Unfortunately, after fifteen days of efforts by all parties, the army reorganization plan proposed by the government was completely unexpected, attempting to exclude the CCP troops from large cities and railway lines during the army reorganization period in order to eliminate them, and insisting on the final decision-making power of the US delegation in the tripartite agreement to ensure the implementation of this plan. Under such circumstances, our side is really hard to consider, and the government's preparations for troop movements and war are becoming increasingly urgent, and the great fire of civil war has a tendency to break out and be difficult to control. At this critical juncture, if the ceasefire is not immediately stopped, then the people will be in dire straits, the country will be ruined, and the future is unthinkable. Now, upon receiving the instructions from our Party Central Committee, based on the current domestic and foreign situation, the will of the people across the country believes that only a swift ceasefire and the realization of peace can save the current serious crisis, rescue compatriots from fire and water. Therefore, we hereby formally propose to your side to implement the following steps: (1) The Three-Person Committee shall immediately announce a long-term ceasefire in the Northeast and reiterate the national ceasefire order, stipulating specific measures to stop all military conflicts, and ordering the troops of both sides to strictly abide by them. (2) After the ceasefire order is issued, the Three-Person Committee shall immediately negotiate specific measures to restore national transportation, and first repair important railways. (3) The Three-Person Committee shall periodically discuss and determine specific supplementary measures for national and Northeast army reorganization and demobilization, and immediately implement them. (4) The government, through consultation, shall periodically reopen the Political Consultative Conference to quickly resolve various political issues such as the reorganization of the government, protection of human rights, relief of people's livelihood, and completion of unification. If the above four matters are agreed to, please submit them to the Three-Person Committee and the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Small Group for discussion and implementation, so as to reassure the people and console the public expectation. In this critical and urgent situation, we hereby make this proposal, and we await your orders with utmost urgency. With respect, Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, June 21st, 1946."

Zhou's Answers to Reporters' Questions

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] CCP representative Zhou Enlai held a press conference at the CCP office in Meiyuan New Village at 7:00 PM today. In addition to issuing a written statement, he did not make a single word of report. Reporters asked him questions, and Zhou answered them separately. The following is a brief summary: (1) The two meetings with Marshall today were to seek ways to urgently solve problems in the next eight days. The Three-Person Committee may be convened tomorrow, and it is hoped that some achievements can be made. (2) The three documents related to the army reorganization plan proposed by the government, the one related to the Northeast can be discussed, the one related to Guannei is a new requirement, and the CCP refuses to discuss it. The third document is a combination of the first two plans, with modifications and supplements to the February 25th army reorganization plan. (3) All the content of the negotiations is the same as what has been published in the newspapers on weekdays. The content is that the CCP should withdraw from Rehe, Chahar, Yantai, Harbin, Weihaiwei, and be stationed in Hailar, Qiqihar, and Yanji. The CCP cannot accept these conditions. (4) Regarding Marshall's "final decision-making power," the government representative's proposal is to give the US representative the final decision-making power, but Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and the Central Daily News stated that it was the final arbitration power. Today, Peng said at the press conference and Xu Yongchang wrote in a letter that it should be decided by voting, with the minority obeying the majority. So this is a new issue. He also said, "We do not agree with changing Marshall's original method when he first arrived in China, which was 'any agreement must be unanimously approved by all three parties, otherwise it cannot be established.'" (5) Recently, there have been killings of personnel from both sides in the Executive Headquarters, and both sides are investigating. (6) Regarding the issue of the Ministry of Transportation dispatching road police in the plan to restore transportation, Zhou said that he was unwilling to allow them to enter the "Liberated Areas." Finally, Deng Yingchao reported that she had received a letter from Vice Minister Hong of the Ministry of Social Affairs, saying that time was pressing and she could not attend the reception of the International Women's Democratic Federation held in Paris. The meeting adjourned at 8:40 PM.

### Third-Party Figures Consulted With Marshall Yesterday; Marshall Hopes the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Will Make the Greatest Concessions to Each Other

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At 8:00 AM this morning, Zhang Junmai and Luo Longji, representatives of the Democratic League, visited Marshall to discuss the issue of extending the ceasefire date and Marshall's arbitration authority, and conveyed the opinions of third-party figures seeking peace. It is reported that Marshall told Zhang and Luo at the time: "Peace negotiations seem to have a possibility of continuing, but the Kuomintang and the Communist Party still need to make the greatest concessions to each other. Third-party figures should also promote peace from the most impartial and fair standpoint, so that a permanent peace can be obtained from a temporary ceasefire." Zhang and Luo believed that peace was not hopeless, and after talking with Marshall for several tens of minutes, they gladly left.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Youth Party, Democratic League, and social notables, Political Consultative Conference representatives Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, Mo Dehui, Chen Qitian, and more than ten others, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 21st at No. 15 Lanjiagang to exchange views on the current situation. They all believed that the extension of the ceasefire deadline meant that there was still hope for peace. The gist of their discussions was: (1) It is hoped that within the extended ceasefire negotiation period, i.e., before the 30th, an agreement can be reached on the ceasefire, the restoration of transportation, and the army reorganization plan. (2) It is hoped that after agreements are reached on all issues, formal discussions on political issues will begin, but before agreements are reached, the parties will informally exchange views. (3) During the ceasefire negotiations, the three-party representatives are willing to do their best to promote the success of the negotiations. At today's meeting, it was also decided to invite CCP representatives to discuss at the Institute of History at 3:00 PM tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Youth Party Political Consultative Conference representative Yu Jiaju, Propaganda Minister Zuo Shunsheng, and Democratic League Political Consultative Conference representative Zhang Junmai took cars to Shanghai separately this morning, afternoon, and evening.

### Success of Peace Negotiations Depends on the Attitude of the CCP; Bai Chongxi's Remarks to Foreign Journalists

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi met with Associated Press reporters alone today. He claimed: "The success of peace negotiations in the next eight days depends on the attitude of the Communist Party, because the government has already made the greatest possible concessions." When asked what was the greatest concession the government had made to the Communist Party? He replied: "The government's principles decided by the Political Consultative Conference in January have been relaxed. The Kuomintang has overthrown the Manchu Qing dynasty, eliminated the warlords, and expelled the Japanese invaders. After completing these struggles, we invited the Communist Party to participate in the regime established by our efforts." The reporter asked: "If the negotiations break down, will war break out?" He replied: "We have never thought of war. We hope for peace." He then commented on Acheson's statement on training and equipping the Communist army: "This method can only be implemented after the peace negotiations are successful. The purpose is only to reorganize the Communist army into the National Army." He finally said: "The government has already started reorganizing the army according to the agreement, but the Communist Party has not done so."

### Communist Army Offensive in Shandong Province Has Passed; Situation in Shanxi Gradually Becomes Serious; Taiyuan is Isolated, Jiang County is Captured

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A reporter discussed the situation in Shandong and Shanxi with a certain military authority today. He said: "The second offensive of the Shandong Communist Army on the 13th (i.e., the most recent offensive) has passed, and what follows is still political negotiation. This is a consistent practice. People say that Chen Yi and the CCP Central Committee are not in complete agreement, which may be a superficial view. After reinforcing Jinan and Qingdao with two armies, at least the current situation in Shandong can be maintained, and it can be guaranteed that there will be no loss, and the Communist army must withdraw from the cities it has occupied since June 7th. The recent changes in Shanxi are particularly noteworthy. On the surface, it seems to be lighter than Shandong, but in fact, it is more important. This is because after the Communist army cut off the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, the two key points of Taiyuan and Datong have been strategically isolated. Moreover, Shanxi is located on the side of the hinterland of the Communist Party, and Liu Bocheng, He Long, and Chen Geng have large armies mixed in, so it is more worrying than Shandong."

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eleventh War Zone, Lu Wenzhen, told reporters: During the fifteen-day ceasefire period, he received three handwritten orders from Chairman Chiang, ordering him to strictly abide by the ceasefire order in the same way as the Northeast troops, and even if the Communist army attacked, he could only limit himself to self-defense.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st] Jiang County was captured by the Communist army on the afternoon of the 20th. The county magistrate, Chen Ziwu, was injured, and some of the defending troops who broke through retreated to the suburbs of Quwo.

[Associated Press, Qingdao, 20th] The Chinese Navy shelled Yantai and Weihaiwei, two seaports in northern Shandong occupied by the Communist army, at dawn on Wednesday. It is reported that the Communist army has recently used Yantai and Weihaiwei as landing sites for opening up the Northeast. It is reported that the Chinese fleet left the Qingdao base on Monday and returned to the ocean according to the planned mission. Another landing team was sent to occupy the Changshan Islands in the Bohai Sea to cut off the Communist army's route for transporting troops by sand boats.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Wang Wenti, the second son of the traitor Wang Zhaoming, who is twenty-one years old, was investigated and prosecuted by the Capital High Court and publicly tried in the court on the morning of the 21st. The presiding judge, Zhao Chen, first inquired in detail about the defendant's age and asked about the details of his affiliation with the puppet regime. The defendant answered each question, his words were stubborn, and he defended his father's behavior of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country.

Finally, Mr. Yu hoped that political issues could be resolved as soon as possible to stabilize the situation, restore transportation, and increase production, so that finance and currency values could be stabilized and revenue and expenditure could be balanced. After the speech, Councilors Xue Mingchuang, Fan Yushui, Gan Jiaxin, and others raised inquiries regarding the abuses of taxation, preventing malicious currency inflation, reforming the currency system, handling enemy and puppet materials, receiving corruption, and the treatment of public and educational personnel, which were all answered separately by Mr. Yu.

### The Case of Mr. Guo Ziqi, Government Personnel of the Xinxiang Team, Being Murdered

Zheng Jiemin Issues a Serious Warning to Ye Jianying

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] At the Nanbadong Village, eight kilometers south of Xiuwu, Henan, which was originally inhabited by over a hundred members of a Bo'ai local team, was suddenly attacked by over 3,000 Communist troops on the evening of the 12th. After two hours of fierce fighting, our troops were outnumbered and Nanbadong Village was captured by the Communist forces. On the 14th, our forces dispatched a team to recapture it, but on the evening of the 15th, it was again captured by the Communist forces. This was immediately reported to the Xinxiang Three-Man Group. On the morning of the 16th, the American representative, Colonel Whitelegg, agreed to go to Nanbadong Village. However, on the morning of the 17th at 11:00 AM, the Communist representative, Huang Zhen, excused himself, claiming that he had not received a report and that the truth was unclear. He promised to send Communist staff member Guo Liu to Jiaozuo for liaison. Guo returned to Xinxiang that afternoon and said that Huang Xinyou, commander of the Fourth Sub-district of the Taihang Military Region of the Communist Army, had decided to meet with the Three-Man Group at Fanqiao, south of Xiuwu, on the 18th. Colonel Whitelegg was to lead the investigation team to depart, but they had to return temporarily due to vehicle damage. At 8:00 AM on the 19th, US Lieutenant Colonel Kinna, government translator Guo Ziqi, and Min Qingshu, a liaison officer from the headquarters stationed with the group, along with Communist representative Huang Zhen, went to Nanbadong Village. As they were about to leave, Huang Zhen suddenly claimed to be ill and did not go, instead sending staff member Guo Huang along. They departed in a jeep. While passing through Huojia, our army's Division Commander Tang added Section Chief Zhu Runshen to accompany them. At 11:00 AM, when the jeep reached the vicinity of Nandong Village, the Communist garrison opened fire. Guo Ziqi was seriously wounded in the lungs, and Min Qingshu was wounded in the leg. The jeep immediately stopped, and Communist representative Guo Huang went into the village to negotiate. As a result, the Communist army only allowed US Lieutenant Colonel Kinna and Guo Huang to enter the village. The wounded translator Guo Ziqi and liaison officer Min Qingshu were taken by Section Chief Zhu Runshen to Xiuwu for treatment. However, Guo Ziqi soon died from his serious wounds. US Lieutenant Colonel Kinna and others returned to Xinxiang that evening. Our reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters regarding this matter. According to them, officers and soldiers are extremely indignant at the Communist army's perfidious and immoral actions. The Pacification Headquarters has recently been protecting Communist troops transporting wounded and disabled soldiers from northern Hubei, providing every possible convenience. However, the Communist army arbitrarily shot and killed our personnel participating in the group. Wherever the Communist army does not want the group to perform its duties, they detain, monitor, sweep, snipe, and kill at will. However, where they need the group to mediate, they force people to comply, treating the group as their tool. If such atrocities are not severely punished, it will not only fail to do justice to the national army officers who were killed, but the group will find it even more difficult to carry out its mission in the future.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 20th] Major Guo Ziqi of the Xinxiang Group Government side was killed by the Communist army in Xiuwu County. Zheng Jiemin, Government Affairs Committee member of the Military Mediation Department, was extremely enraged upon receiving the report of the death of Major Guo and others issued by the Government representative and US representative of the group. He has issued a serious warning to Ye Jianying, demanding that the murderers be punished and this inhumane and terrorist policy of murder be abolished. Otherwise, if government personnel are repeatedly harmed, leading to other unfortunate incidents, the Communist side will bear full responsibility. Major Guo, a native of Anhui Province, was 25 years old, a graduate of Guanghua University, straightforward in nature, and full of a sense of responsibility. During the War of Resistance, he served as a translator for the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, participating in the India-Burma campaign, with outstanding achievements. After the victory, he was transferred from the Central Training Corps to the News Office of the Beiping Military Mediation Department. He went to Taiyuan, accompanying the group to mediate outside. At the beginning of May of this year, he transferred to work in Xinxiang. He gave his life for the sake of peace, a matter of great regret to all sectors of society here.

### Members of the Twenty-Second Group Also Detained by the Communist Army

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] The radio station and staff of the Twenty-Second Executive Group have now been detained by the Communist army in Xuanhua Store, and the situation is extremely dire. There is clear evidence that the Central Plains Communist Army is disregarding everything and preparing to launch a struggle.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 20th] The death of Guo Ziqi, a member of the Xinxiang Group government side, in Xiuwu has aroused extreme attention here. The Wuhan Group held meetings all day today to discuss the safety issues of the group members in the future. The group, which was originally scheduled to fly to Zhengzhou on the 21st, does not plan to depart as scheduled. In addition, the group going to Xuanhua Store has also been postponed.

### Prosperous Port Affected by War, Qingdao Becomes an Economic Shell, Communist Army Cuts off Transportation Lines, Blocking Foreign Trade, Population Soars, Grain Shortages Felt, Prices are Extremely High

[Associated Press, Qingdao, 21st] Qingdao, originally a prosperous port in North China, has become an economic shell due to the impact of war from the outside and political relations from within, and can only avoid collapse by relying on the monetary resources of American sailors and Marines. The port of Qingdao was originally developed by the Germans and occupied by the Japanese army for seven years during the war. Later, it became the base of the US Seventh Fleet, and its name began to reappear in the newspapers. Recently, there have been reports of the Communist army attacking again, which has attracted more attention from the world. Today, nine-tenths of the eastern peninsula are under the control of the Communist army. Qingdao City is surrounded by mountains, and the Communist army is less than twenty miles away from the city, cutting off its transportation lines. Therefore, it is extremely impossible to trade with the outside world. Shandong's peanut oil production is abundant, and bean cakes and peanuts are piled up inland, waiting for the situation to be peaceful before being transported to Qingdao. The local textile mills have been devastated by the war, and the shortage of raw materials has led to the market being depressed. The economic capacity is only a quarter of what it was before the war, while the population has increased from 560,000 to 762,000 before the war, including about 90,000 refugees who fled from the Communist-occupied areas.

The nine textile factories used to employ no less than 30,000 male workers, but now they have been reduced to 4,000. The factories are now operated by the China Textile Corporation, with more than 600,000 spindles and 30,000 looms, with a total investment of no less than several million US dollars. Flour mills cannot operate because there is no wheat supply. Inflation and rampant speculation make the scene even darker. Most Chinese in the city do not get enough to eat, but neutral observers say that there are as many as 40,000 tons of millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, wheat, and coal stored in the warehouses, enough to feed the entire city for six months. According to municipal officials, there are only 7,000 tons of goods in the warehouses, but regardless of the true number, it is clear that someone is manipulating the market prices, which fluctuate, and speculators are profiting from it. On the 19th of this month, a pair of ordinary leather shoes cost US$40, coal fines sold for $75 per ton, and a men's suit cost $220. Although the municipal government has expressly prohibited price increases, prices are still rising. Political conflicts and armed warfare make it impossible for Qingdao City to be stable, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is in great pain to transport relief supplies to the countryside. According to Qi Hazhefu, the British district director of the League, automobile transportation could have been problem-free, but 90% of the people only received 10% of the relief supplies. American sailors and Marines enter and leave restaurants and dance halls in Qingdao, squandering at will, and there are projects worth millions of dollars to build public housing, so that Qingdao City can retain a part of its vitality. However, the feelings between China and foreign countries cannot be called harmonious, and accidents occur constantly. Pedestrians on the road show obvious hostility. Recently, the news of the Communist army attacking Qingdao has been heavily reported in various Chinese newspapers, which has made people panic and the situation is very tense. Walking on the streets at night is unavoidable anxious. The US military has always maintained calm and awaits orders, but some people believe that this is a test of the US military's diplomatic tactics, and a greater test is yet to come.

### Garment Factory Employee Flees with Huge Sum of Money

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 21st] The Sixth Garment Factory of the Ministry of Military Administration previously sent an employee named Hu to Hangzhou to withdraw a huge sum of money. It has been many days since the money was withdrawn, but the factory has not seen him return. The factory is now conducting a strict investigation. It is said that the total amount of money is approximately 100 million yuan.

### A Great Piece of Good News! The Last Chance!

The bright and shining ceasefire order was originally scheduled to expire at noon today. Yesterday, everyone was anxiously wondering if there was any hope for peace, when the Chairman of the National Government finally ordered an extension of the deadline by eight days! The validity period of the previous order for all armies to cease advancing, attacking, and pursuing has been extended to noon on June 30! This is a great piece of good news; this is especially the last chance! The government has certainly shown its greatest sincerity, and the Communist Party should live up to this great piece of good news. We believe that the Communist Party is, after all, the Communist Party of China, and the members of the CCP are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. They should no longer procrastinate and delay, missing this last and greater opportunity for a peaceful resolution!

During the 15-day ceasefire period, the original plan was to negotiate and resolve three major issues first: (1) completely stop the conflict in the Northeast; (2) completely restore domestic transportation; and (3) quickly implement the plan for the demobilization and reorganization of the armed forces. However, after 15 days of negotiation, no one was not headache and heartbroken. Not only did the fighting not stop, but the fighting became more fierce both inside and outside the Northeast. And the negotiations continued, with much talk but still no results! Finally, on the eve of the expiry date, President Chiang had to make a wise decision in his great concern, extending the deadline by eight days to give everyone a final chance to continue the talks. We wonder, how can these warmongers be worthy of the President? How can they be worthy of the country? How can they be worthy of their ancestors and descendants?

For the sake of the country and the people, we naturally hope that the Communist Party will cherish these eight days and not miss this last opportunity. Even for the sake of the future of the Communist Party, and for the sake of leaving a place for the members of the Communist Party to meet with the people, they should not miss this last opportunity. The CCP is strict in organization, brave in action, and skilled in propaganda, so no one dares to believe that the surprise attacks by the Communist army in various places in the past 15 days were free actions by local leaders, and not due to secret orders from the organization. Because of this, we still want to appeal to the leaders of the CCP: Today, China cannot afford internal strife! Friendly countries hope that our country will be peaceful and become a strong, unified, and democratic China. The people even more hope to complete the great cause of national construction and revival in an atmosphere of peace. After fighting for eight years, the people have suffered enough. Why not let everyone take a breath! However, although the ceasefire order has been issued and negotiations are underway, the conflict has never stopped. Why? In a word, the Communist Party's strategy seems not to hope for the success of the negotiations, but only to "delay." Delay! Delay! Delay! Delay until the country is divided, until the nation declines, until a strong, unified, and democratic China can never be built, until 450 million compatriots have no food to eat, until the day when their "proletarian revolution" can erupt, and we and our descendants can ignore whether we have the face to stand in the world. What a great "delay" tactic! The critical illness of China may be due to this "delay." We want to awaken our compatriots and agree not to allow the Communist Party to play the "delay" trick again in these eight days of extension! If we let them delay again, we will definitely delay until the "good news" is shattered and the "opportunity" disappears!

Why do we know that the CCP still wants to delay? Just look at the propositions Zhou Enlai made to the press after his talks with Special Envoy Marshall the day before yesterday. He said: (1) Regardless of whether it is inside or outside the customs, there is no time limit to stop the conflict and wait for mediation; (2) If the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party needs mediation by friendly countries, it must be handled in accordance with President Truman's statement on China policy issued on December 15 last year and the communique issued by the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the three countries. These two points seem very pleasant and high-sounding, but in fact, he still wants the CCP's masterpiece, the "delay" trick. First, without a time limit, the CCP can talk and fight at the same time, and there will never be an end. Second, mediation by friendly countries has long been a fact, and it has come from the wishes and requests of the CCP. Why go back today to repeat the "hypothetical" words "if it is needed..."? It can be seen that they are somewhat unwelcome to mediation. Third, mediation and negotiation must have results, and it must be about the most specific issues. Now, setting aside the three major issues within the deadline of the ceasefire order, why drag out the principles of Truman's statement and the Moscow Communique? Fourth, Truman's statement on December 15 last year was nothing more than (1) the US government hopes for a strong, unified, and democratic China; (2) the fighting between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party or other miscellaneous troops must stop; (3) convene a national conference of representatives of all parties and factions to complete China's unification; (4) The United Nations and the United States only recognize the current National Government as the sole legal government of the Republic of China, especially in cooperating with the National Government in clearing out Japanese forces in China. In addition, the announcement of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, regarding China, only stated that the three powers abide by the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs, and agreed that the US and Soviet forces would each withdraw from China after the mission was completed. We have reviewed the traitorous China policy of the past six months, which is completely in accordance with the above-mentioned principles and does not cross the line, and the negotiations facilitated by Ambassador Ma are nothing more than to realize these ideals. Instead of raising the principles again at this time, why not hurry up and seriously negotiate specific issues? From this, it can be seen that the CCP still intends to implement their "delay" policy. But can we common people still allow them to delay again?

From today onwards, we must cherish this good news and cherish this opportunity with 120,000 points of care. We must sincerely thank Special Envoy Marshall for his tireless efforts in mediation. We especially thank the US State Department for submitting to Congress a bill to continue military aid to China in order to accomplish the following two major missions: (1) to assist in the merger of the Kuomintang and Communist armies to implement the reorganization plan; (2) to develop an effective force so that the Security Council can use it to maintain peace in the Far East. This kind of assistance from the United States and this kind of mediation by Special Envoy Marshall are truly appreciated by every Chinese people from the bottom of their hearts! Opposing the stationing of US troops in China and refusing to listen to the arbitration of Special Envoy Marshall are by no means the opinions of the Chinese people. In short, in an instant, 15 days have passed! Now, it has been extended by eight days, which is even shorter. Every minute and every second of these eight days is especially precious and should be cherished. Don't let it go by again! The government representatives must work hard, the CCP representatives must work even harder, and we common people must work especially hard!

Local dispatches

### Thirteen Counties in Jiangxi and Anhui Complete Dike Construction, Anqing Establishes Construction Headquarters, Station Chiefs Arrive from Wuhu

[Our Newspaper, Anqing Dispatch] Since its establishment, the Anhui Branch of the Relief Administration has attached great importance to post-disaster relief work, actively repairing river embankments, dredging river channels, and digging wells to increase production and stabilize people's livelihoods after the war. It has also passively relocated refugees, comforted displaced people, and provided extensive relief, all in accordance with the regulations of the headquarters or based on local conditions. Recently, with the rising tide and the imminent arrival of floods, the Anqing Headquarters for Dike Construction was established to address the people's suffering and the importance of the river embankments. Sub-stations were established in Huaining, Tongcheng, Susong, and Wangjiang counties. Hu Qingzhen was appointed as the general station chief of the Anqing area, concurrently as the station chief of Huaining. Yang Yiming was appointed as the station chief of Tongcheng. Cai Yanxian was appointed as the station chief of Susong, and Hu Zuyin was appointed as the station chief of Wangjiang. The station chiefs arrived in Qing on the 12th from Wuhu. After surveying the river embankments, they will stay for about two or three days before going to the branch to carry out the plan to repair the Yangtze River embankments, completing the dikes in thirteen counties from Jiujiang to Dangtu, and jointly working with Sun, the acting chairman of the Central Yangtze River Water Conservancy Engineering Committee, and Zhu, the director of the blocking and embankment restoration project, and Sheng, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, to actively expedite construction. However, due to rain and busy farming season, the project is progressing with difficulty and is unlikely to be completed as scheduled.

### Grain Payments Held Back, Additional Taxes Unbearable

Appeals from the People of Nanling County

[Our Newspaper, Nanling Dispatch] According to a letter from the people of Nanling County: "Nanling, Anhui, has always been a rice-producing area in southern Anhui. During the Anti-Japanese War, it fell to the enemy three times, suffering heavy losses. In addition, there was no rain in early summer last year, and autumn harvest taxes were reduced. Last year, Anhui Province was ordered to requisition 3 million dan of military grain. After representatives from various counties went to Beijing to request a reduction, the amount was reduced to 1.8 million dan. Nanling's quota reached 120,000 dan. The central government set the price for the requisitioned military grain at 4,500 yuan per dan, but the provincial government deducted 500 yuan per dan, and the commissioner's office deducted 200 yuan per dan, leaving the people with only 3,800 yuan. At the time, the grain price differed by only 1,000 yuan. If the grain payments had been fully distributed, the people could have paid in full at once. However, the grain requisition was divided into three phases. The first phase was paid in full last year, including the grain sent to the Wuhu warehouse. The receiving personnel required a 'cigarette fee' before accepting payment, resulting in considerable losses. Even more strangely, the grain payments were withheld for months after the grain was submitted. Now, the second phase is being urgently demanded. The people have not received the grain payments from the previous submission, and the current grain price is 25,000-26,000 yuan per dan, a difference of 20,000 yuan compared to last year. The people have almost no grain left and cannot pay. Therefore, the county magistrate and township chiefs are wielding their authority, indiscriminately arresting people. How can the survivors of the war endure such suffering again? We earnestly hope that the authorities will investigate and severely punish corruption, and the people of the entire county will be deeply grateful."

### Large Batch of Animals Sent to Island for Atomic Bomb Test, Will Risk Experiencing a Man-Made Disaster for Scientific Research

[United Press, San Francisco, 20th Dispatch] A batch of animals for the July 1st atomic bomb test on warships are being transported by the U.S. Navy transport ship "Burleson" to Bikini Atoll. There are 4,000 white mice, 200 goats and pigs each, and a small number of guinea pigs and house mice, as well as a batch of microorganisms and insects. This batch of animals, like Noah's Ark, will risk experiencing a disaster in the flood – a man-made disaster. The day before the Bikini test, they will be placed in 22 ships. There are 77 ships in total for the test. After the first bomb explodes, as soon as people can safely step onto the test ships, these animals will be immediately transported back to the "Burleson" and examined by biologists to see what the effects of the atomic bomb explosion are.

The value and completeness of the instruments and equipment carried by the "Burleson" for this test can be said to be unprecedented for any ship. Everything from the animals' skin to the smallest parts of their body cells will be used as test subjects. Even the microorganisms and insects growing in the sick animals will be torn apart by scientists to determine what effects nuclear radiation has on their genetic makeup. Some animals will be vaccinated with smallpox, antitoxins, hormones, and vitamins to test whether atomic rays affect antitoxic substances. The hair of some goats will be cut short to match the length of human hair. This is to investigate the value of hair for protecting the brain and resisting heat and other types of radiation. Other goats will be coated with sunscreen to see if it is effective.

One hundred and twenty white mice are very prone to cancer. Will the rays emitted when the atomic bomb explodes cause them to develop cancer? Whether the atomic bomb explosion will cause infertility can also be answered by examining the sex organs of the tested animals. Another major issue in the test is the effect of the atomic bomb explosion on blood. White blood cells will play an important role in this test. The pedigree of each white mouse has been tested separately and recorded on cards. After the atomic bomb explodes, scientists can know what kind of changes occur in their blood and to what extent.

When this batch of animals is placed on the test ship, their position will be the same as the position during naval combat. Rice and water can be automatically supplied to them without human management. There are about fifty scientists and technicians working on the test in Bikini.

Lie Invited to Visit

[Reuters, New York, 20th Dispatch] It was announced today that the U.S. government has invited UN Secretary-General Lie to visit the atomic bomb test on Bikini Island. The invitation stated that the test is not a joint or international test, but a scientific test conducted solely by the U.S. government.

### Possible Agreement Between U.S. and Soviet Union on Atomic Energy Control, Britain Considering Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of atomic energy control, President Truman recently told reporters that the United States and the Soviet Union are negotiating and may reach an agreement. Truman declined to comment on the content of the Soviet proposal, but reiterated that he fully supports the proposal made by U.S. representative Baruch to ban the use of atomic bombs.

[Reuters, London, 20th Dispatch] The British government is considering the Soviet proposal to destroy and ban the use of atomic bombs. Non-official opinions are mostly opposed, saying that this is the opinion of countries that do not have atomic bombs, so they have only benefits and no losses. It is also pointed out that since the atomic bomb has been produced, even if it is destroyed, it cannot reverse scientific progress or eliminate general anxiety and suspicion. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union's simple proposal is not suitable for such a complex issue. The British government's Atomic Energy Committee is currently considering the proposal and will submit its opinion to the United Nations.

### International Snippets

The new proposal put forward by the British government has been approved in principle by the Egyptian delegation. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov has accepted the position of Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission.

### Unforgivable Treachery and Heinous Crimes: Traitor Liang Hongzhi Sentenced to Death

Face Grimaced Upon Hearing the Verdict, Cold Sweat on Forehead, Hands Trembling Slightly. No Family Visits Allowed During the Session; Mother and Daughter-in-Law Wept Bitterly.

[Reported by this newspaper] Liang Hongzhi, the number one puppet elder and traitor, was sentenced yesterday afternoon after being reviewed and concluded by the High Court. Those who went to listen in court, crowded the courtroom. At 2:30 PM, Court President Liu Yugui, along with Associate Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huanrong, Prosecutor Dai Rongduo, and others, took their seats on time and ordered the bailiffs to bring Liang Hongzhi forward. This scapegoat was then brought to the court under public scrutiny. Liang was wearing a thin floral blue silk robe, white silk pants, floral striped silk socks, and black satin shoes with white soles. He stood in the defendant's dock, trying to appear calm. At this time, President Liu held the verdict in his hand, his eyes shining brightly, and remained silent for a long time. All the listeners also held their breath and waited. The solemn atmosphere of the courtroom and the solemn demeanor of the judge seemed to be different from the past. The faces of the defendant's family, sitting upright in the audience, suddenly became tense. President Liu then began to speak to Liang, "Your case has been reviewed and concluded, and this court will pronounce the verdict today." After speaking, he stood up solemnly and read the main text of the verdict: "Liang Hongzhi colluded with the enemy and conspired to rebel against his own country. He is sentenced to death, deprived of public rights for life, and all his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated." After reading, he sat down again and said to Liang, "Because your crime is serious and unforgivable, this case is sentenced to death to uphold national law. If you are not satisfied, you can apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days after receiving the verdict." Standing in the defendant's dock, Liang Hongzhi's crossed hands behind his back began to tremble slightly when the judge read the "death penalty." He pinched and released his hands alternately, causing many wrinkles on his blue silk robe. Although he was still trying to force a smile on his face, his pale face, sweat on his forehead, and unnatural bitter smile failed to conceal his complex emotions. After the judge finished speaking, he took out a handkerchief to wipe his face and asked the judge if he could say a few words to his family. President Liu replied, "You can meet in prison." After speaking, he stepped down and ordered the bailiffs to take him back. At this time, one of Liang's wives and concubines stood up and followed closely behind, and his daughter-in-law cried out in court. Liang himself remained silent. Liang is the first person in this city's High Court to be sentenced to death for treason, but the date of formal execution is still pending and will be determined after the Supreme Court's review. (For the full text of the Liang case verdict, see the corner of this edition.)

### Another View on Solving the Housing Shortage

Should Protect Property Rights of Landlords and Ban Manipulation by Second Landlords

[Reported by this newspaper] The housing shortage in this city is severe. This reporter paid a special visit to Yang Kuanlin, a famous architectural engineer and dean of the College of Engineering of St. John's University, to ask for his opinion on solving the housing shortage. According to him, the main reason why landlords or the construction industry are unwilling to build houses is that property rights are not guaranteed and all the profits are taken by second landlords. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that the government can take care of the people's property rights and effectively ban the manipulation of second landlords. Regarding building materials, Yang's opinion is that domestic materials should be used as much as possible and improved and manufactured, which can not only reduce costs but also develop the domestic industry.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Military Law Office of the Garrison Command has completed the initial interrogation of the Grain Loan Case on the 20th and is now in the process of sorting and reviewing it, and the trial will begin in the near future. This reporter met with Zeng Zhaoyi, Director of the Military Law Office, yesterday and asked about Zeng's visit to the District Prosecutor's Office the day before. According to him, the Grain Loan Case will still be tried by military law. Although Wang Daren was not escorted back to the office yesterday, he will be brought to the office together with Ren Xingyai within a few days. According to this reporter's investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office prepared a document yesterday to welcome Rong Yongming. The Garrison Command did not agree to transfer the case because Rong's case only involved suspicion of raising rice prices and was not related to the Grain Loan Case. However, according to Prosecutor Wu of the District Prosecutor's Office, the handling of the Grain Loan Case should be fully accepted by the court in accordance with the provisions of the law. Therefore, the case is now being fully investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office in accordance with legal procedures. Due to insufficient preparation yesterday, the interrogation was not opened. The protagonist of the case, Wang Daren, was issued a "release order" by Prosecutor Wu before the interrogation on the morning of the day before yesterday, and it was planned to transfer him to the Garrison Command after the interrogation.

### The Hongmen Group Forming a Political Party May Not Become Reality

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper reported yesterday about the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang possibly changing its organization to form a political party. Lately, there have indeed been such rumors circulating outside. However, in order to investigate the truth, the reporter yesterday separately interviewed Zheng Ziliang, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhiben, Chen Peide, and Li Yongxiang, who are all related to the Hongmen. According to them, since Situ Meitang and Zhao Yu, representatives of the Zhi Gong Tang from overseas, came to Shanghai, there are plans to unite domestic Hongmen leaders and hold a Hongmen representative kinship conference on July 15th. As for the Hongmen forming a political party, they have heard nothing about it. They further stated that even if a political party were formed, it would definitely not be under the name of the Zhi Gong Party. Representing the various mountain halls of the Hongmen both domestically and overseas, the entire organization (Zhi Gong Tang) would not change to a political party. The Zhi Gong Tang is only a unit of the overseas Hongmen. Various places within the country have different hall names. This city does not have a Zhi Gong Tang branch, but there is a united Hongmen Association, established before the war. Hongmen pioneers Xiang Songpo, Wang Yucheng (deceased), Cui Tongxia, Mao Yun, and others (Zheng et al. referring to themselves) were all initiators. They have close connections with Hongmen mountain halls in the Yangtze River basin, South China, and North China. Last Tuesday, the association held a restoration meeting, attended by eighteen units from the mountain halls. The formation of a political party was not mentioned at all, and the mountain masters had absolutely no such motivation or intention. The Hongmen has three major traditional creeds, and does not wish to be involved in the political arena. We (1) unite with righteousness, (2) save the country with loyalty, and (3) eliminate evil with chivalry. Under these three creeds, we support the government, save the nation from peril, and stand on the side of the people to fulfill our duties. Therefore, there is really no need to form a political party. Therefore, the rumored change of the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang to a political party is only a proposal by a portion of the overseas Hongmen and may not become a reality.

### Full Text of the Verdict in the Liang Hongzhi Case

It is found that the traitor Liang is a native of Changle, 64 years old, residing at No. 150 Bute Road, Shanghai. The lawyers retained for his defense this time are Zhang Shizhao, Zhu Hongru, and Li Guozhen. The facts and reasons in the full text of the verdict in this case are recorded as follows:

Facts

Liang Hongzhi once served as a Counselor of the State Council, Senator, and Secretary-General of the Executive Department of the Beijing Government. After the success of the National Government's Northern Expedition and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, the defendant's political career came to an end. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out and Shanghai and Nanjing fell, the Japanese plotted to establish a puppet regime to promote their policy of aggression. The defendant recognized this as his only opportunity to seize power and colluded with Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Xi, and others to communicate with the enemy and conspire with the enemy chiefs in Shanghai to establish the puppet Central China regime, only three months after the National Government moved west. The pain of the Battle of Shanghai was still fresh in people's minds, and the people swore to never coexist with the Japanese invaders. However, on March 28, 1938, the defendant established the puppet Provisional Government in Nanjing, issued a declaration, established two houses and eight departments, and governed three provinces and two cities. The person himself served as the President of the Executive Yuan, assumed overall power, changed to the five-colored flag, presided over political meetings, recruited troops to secure the enemy's rear, forcibly occupied the customs to enrich the puppet regime's finances, and publicly sold opium to promote the enemy's policy of poisoning the population. He successively signed agreements with the enemy chiefs on railways, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking, and jointly operated companies with the enemy, such as Central China Railway, Electrical Communications, Salt Industry, Shipping, and Huaxing Bank. He repeatedly consulted with Wang Kemin, the head of the puppet Provisional Government in North China, to discuss a merger in order to boost their image. Finally, in March of the 28th year, the puppet Central China Government United Committee was established, and the defendant jointly issued a declaration of establishment. In November of the same year, he traveled to the enemy country to visit key military and political figures for liaison purposes. After returning to China, he published his impressions of his visit to Japan, filled with traitorous words. In April of the 29th year, Wang Jingwei betrayed the Party and the country and secretly came to Shanghai to form a puppet National Government. The defendant, realizing that Wang Jingwei had the support of the enemy and knowing that he was no match for him, consulted with Wang and Wang several times. Then, on September 21st and 23rd of the same year, he jointly issued a declaration in the name of the puppet Provisional and Provisional Governments, responding to Wang's proposed peace movement. In January of the following year, he convened a meeting in Qingdao and jointly decided to organize the puppet Central Political Conference. On March 20th, another meeting was held in Nanjing to discuss the adjustment plan for Sino-Japanese relations and the establishment of a framework for the puppet National Government, and announced the candidates for ministers of various departments of the puppet National Government. On March 30th, the puppet National Government was formally established in the capital, jointly issuing a preposterous declaration of returning to the capital and the political platform of the puppet National Government. At the same time, the puppet Provisional and Provisional Governments announced their dissolution, and the defendant was appointed President of the puppet Supervisory Yuan and concurrently a member of the puppet Central Political Committee. On November 20th of the 33rd year, the President of the puppet Legislative Yuan, Chen Gongbo, succeeded Wang Jingwei as Chairman of the puppet National Government due to Wang's death. The defendant took over as President of the puppet Legislative Yuan and revised many puppet laws. He only resigned and came to Shanghai after the Japanese surrendered and was escorted by the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission for investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor of this court.

Reasons

In this case, the defendant Liang Hongzhi, taking advantage of the war of resistance against Japan and the retreat of the national army to the west, colluded with Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Xi, and others in Shanghai to conspire with the enemy chiefs to establish a puppet regime. On March 28th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the puppet Provisional Government was established in the capital, and he himself served as the President of the puppet Executive Yuan, assuming overall military and political power, changing the national flag, recruiting troops, seizing customs, publicly selling opium, and successively signing railway, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking agreements with the enemy chiefs. He jointly operated transportation, electrical communications, salt industry, financial, and various other companies. These facts are not only admitted without hesitation during the trial and investigation by this court, but also supported by the staff lists of the various departments of the puppet Provisional Government, secret service agency files, classified documents, Central China Electrical Communications Company files, Central China Communications Military Agreement files, Sino-Japanese Treaty Anniversary Essay files, propaganda document files, records of the puppet Provisional Government, foreign debt loan files of the puppet Ministry of Railways, and the records in past years of the "Xinwen Bao" and "Shen Bao Yearbook," and the "New China Handbook." As for how he consulted with Wang Kemin, the chairman of the puppet Provisional Government, to organize the puppet Chinese Government United Committee and issue a declaration, how he traveled to the enemy country to visit key military and political figures, and published his impressions after returning to China, and how he responded to Wang Jingwei's peace movement, participated in the meeting to establish the puppet National Government, and served as the President of the puppet Supervisory and Legislative Yuan and attended the meetings of the puppet Central Political Committee, etc., are also described in detail in the confessions, and are corroborated by the seized anniversary album of the puppet Provisional Government, documents on peace and anti-communist nation-building, the special issue of the puppet Nanjing Xinbao for the second anniversary, the files of the puppet Provisional Government, and the declaration files. The defendant

colluded with the enemy to oppose the war of resistance

As for the defenses he has made, they are nothing more than the following: (1) After the 27th year of the Republic of China, the war became more intense and the people suffered more. The defendant, out of compassion for the people, organized the Provisional Government with the aim of rescuing the people in the occupied areas and preserving the nation's vitality. Its scope was no more than a larger maintenance association. The change of the national flag was to avoid Japanese military interference, the establishment of the Pacification Army was originally to maintain local security, the establishment of the Bureau of Opium Prohibition was to stop the Japanese from running opium, and the issuance of Huaxing currency did not affect people's livelihood. The collection of taxes was only enough to maintain the expenses of the Provisional Government. All of these were to rescue the people, and there was no intention to resist the country. (2) Regarding the agreements on railways, telecommunications, salt affairs, and banking, their nature was temporary, and their content was not beneficial to the enemy. Instead, they were trying to win back some rights from the enemy's hands. How could they be described as harming the country and humiliating the nation? (3) The Japanese military tried to establish special agencies and grain control mechanisms in the Provisional Government, but the defendant firmly refused to allow them to be implemented. The antiques and books of Nanjing were all looted by the Japanese military, but the defendant negotiated for their return, and the culture was preserved. (4) The defendant mistakenly believed that Wang Zhaoming's peace movement was a strategy for the central government to fight and negotiate at the same time, so he did not oppose it. Regarding the proposals of the Central Political Conference, Wang read them out and they were immediately passed. The defendant never participated, and even if he did, he never spoke, so he cannot be held responsible. (5) The defendant secretly reported enemy secrets to the central government in the 29th year and rescued political workers from prison. After the victory, the defendant worked in the vanguard army to maintain security in Nanjing and Shanghai, and he made some small contributions. On July 15th of the 34th year, he surrendered himself to the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau, requesting that his sentence be reduced according to law, and he presented witnesses Xue Dake and letters from former President of the Executive Yuan Kong Xiangxi and Chen Mengren Yuan Dao Qu Lizhai as proof. (The above are the main points of the oral and written statements made by the defendant's side.) Regarding the first point, according to the fact that the enemy established puppet governments in the occupied areas, originally to achieve

the goal of using Chinese to control Chinese and supporting the war with war

The defendant, following the enemy's wishes, organized the puppet Provisional Government, established two houses and eight departments, governed three provinces and two cities, assumed overall power, issued orders, seized Central China, and formed a separatist regime. This is not comparable to the maintenance associations organized by merchants and residents, and it is clearly inappropriate to compare himself to a maintenance association. Moreover, his recruitment of bandit troops, public sale of opium, issuance of counterfeit currency, and extortionate levies all harmed the country and the people and fueled the enemy's flames. Yet he still claimed to be revitalizing the people and preserving the nation's vitality, which is even more of a reversal of right and wrong. Furthermore, according to the declarations he has issued in the past, one said: "The scorched earth policy is tantamount to suicide, and accommodating communism is tantamount to inviting bandits. It is the only evil government in Chinese history!" (See the declaration of the puppet Provisional Government) Another said: "The power of the Kuomintang is more than two-thirds gone, and annihilation is imminent!" (Remarks made after the fall of Wuhan) A third said: "The party government, which is autocratic and misleads the country, has lost the people's faith and is on the verge of collapse!" (Remarks made on the anniversary of the fall of Nanjing) He wantonly slandered the central government. The political platform of his puppet Provisional Government also prioritized the separation of powers, changed to the five-colored flag, disrupted the national constitution, and rebelled against the government. The signs of his treachery are extremely obvious. His claim that he had no intention of resisting the country is obviously a lie. Regarding the second point, the Provisional Government was originally a puppet organization fostered by the enemy. Its agreements with the enemy were nothing more than farcical dramas. The content is not worth arguing about. Moreover, it is verified that the defendant, in the name of the puppet President of the Executive Yuan, signed a military agreement with Yamada Otsuzo, commander of the Central China Expeditionary Force of the enemy army, regarding communications in Central China. The first article states that the commander of the army or the commander of the fleet may conduct communication inspections and control communications based on military necessity (see the Miscellaneous Category Zheng Zi No. 4 file of the puppet Ministry of Transportation). Regarding joint railway operations with the enemy, it was stipulated that in the Central China region, the Provisional Government and the Japanese side would sign an agreement to establish the Central China Railway Company, which would be entrusted with management and operation, such as the Jinghu, Huhu, and Sujia lines (see the puppet Ministry of Transportation's planning on adjusting the joint railway company). Regarding shipping, there were the Huayun Shipping Company and the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, organized under Japanese leadership, which were approved by the Provisional Government one after another (see the puppet Ministry of Transportation No. 1579 file). The content of these agreements was absolutely beneficial to the enemy in terms of military, politics, and economy. The defendant’s

false claim to have won back rights from the enemy

is even more absurd and deceptive. Regarding the third point, it is verified that during the period of the Provisional Government, a puppet special agency had been established at No. 76 Jessfield Road in the western district of Shanghai,

killing, looting, and acting lawlessly

As for the grain control mechanism, although it was not established at that time, the enemy army collected military rice in the Central China area and needed the puppet government to assist them. It is difficult to believe that he firmly refused to allow these two matters to be implemented. As for the claim that he recovered Nanjing books and antiques from the enemy, even if that were the case, under the control of the enemy forces, even if they were recovered, it would be like taking them from one treasury and storing them in another. What preservation is there to speak of? Regarding the fourth point, Wang Jingwei, the traitor who betrayed the Party and the country, issued a flamboyant telegram advocating peace. The central government immediately condemned him, stripped Wang of his position, and expelled him from the Party. National public opinion unanimously criticized him. The newspapers at the time all published this (see the Xinwen Bao on January 1, 1940). How could the defendant have been mistaken? Furthermore, according to the statements made by the puppet Provisional Government, "Jingwei (Wang Jingwei) bravely escaped from Chongqing and repeatedly issued declarations of peace and national salvation, and is willing to discuss national affairs with sages at home and abroad. Wang took the initiative to achieve what we had long hoped for, and permanent peace between China and Japan will not be difficult to achieve." And according to the statements of the puppet Provisional and Provisional United Committee, "Based on the mission of the establishment of this committee, we are willing to assist Wang Jingwei with all our strength in establishing the central government." It can be seen that the defendant not only did not oppose Wang’s advocacy of peace, but also actively supported it. Their collusion is already obvious. Furthermore, the defendant served as the President of the Supervisory and Legislative Yuan of the puppet Nanjing Government and a member of the puppet Central Political Committee. He and Wen Zongyao and others publicly nominated Wang Jingwei as the Chairman of the puppet National Government at the 28th meeting of the puppet Central Political Committee on November 8 of the 29th year, which was approved by resolution, as recorded in the gazette of the puppet government. He now claims that he did not participate in the meeting and did not speak.

These facts are the opposite of the truth

Regarding the fifth point, although the defendant claimed that he secretly reported secrets to the central government in the 29th year, and the witness Xue Dake testified in court and presented a letter from the former President of the Executive Yuan Kong, the letter only stated that he had received reports (referring to Xue Dake's report) that Liang and other key figures of the puppet regime had secretly contacted them. This can only prove that the defendant had negotiated with personnel sent by the central government, but it cannot prove that he had any actual work. It is difficult to consider this as assisting the war of resistance. And the statement in Qu Lizhai's letter that Dong Renyi and Wu Qianli were entrusted to Liang Zhongyi (i.e., the defendant) to find a way to rescue them, so they were able to be released in advance, even if it were true, would only be occasionally accommodating friends and helping one or two individuals, and it is not enough to speak of actions that benefit the people. As for the claim that he made some small contributions to maintaining security in Nanjing and Shanghai after the victory, even if the vanguard army was working in the Nanjing and Shanghai area at that time and the defendant provided some assistance, it was only a matter of trying to cover up past mistakes when at the end of the road, and there is no merit to speak of. Moreover, the defendant did not voluntarily surrender before the crime was discovered, but was put on trial. This does not comply with the provisions of the Criminal Law and the Regulations on Dealing with Traitors. Even if he had stated the facts in writing to the Shanghai Office of the Military Statistics Bureau on July 15 of the 34th year, it was only a confession and cannot be considered a surrender, and cannot be used to request a reduction or exemption of punishment. In view of the above points, the defenses are purely excuses.

Attempts to shirk responsibility are not worth adopting

After the enemy launched the August 13 Incident, our country adopted a policy of long-term resistance, and the whole country made every effort. However, as soon as Shanghai and Nanjing fell, the defendant stood up, colluded with the enemy to rebel, seized Nanjing, claimed to be the government, changed the national flag, and signed agreements without authorization, confusing international audiences and shaking the psychology of the people. This was truly taking the risk of the world's disapproval. When Wang Jingwei betrayed the central government and issued a peace telegram, the defendant colluded with Wang Kemin to respond and support the movement. A group of traitors gathered to discuss and form a puppet government, still holding important positions and never leaving, only seeking his own power and status, disregarding national sovereignty and the nation's lifeline. Moreover, he took the lead in betraying the country, acting as Wang's precursor to stealing the throne, inciting chaos in Central China, and conspiring with the traitors in Hebei and Chahar. A monstrous traitor is rarely matched. If he is not sentenced to death, it will not be enough to demonstrate justice and highlight the national law. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, will be confiscated. Based on the above, it is concluded that, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1 and Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, and Article 9 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, the preceding paragraph of Article 2 of the Criminal Law, Article 28, Article 57, Article 37, Paragraph 1, the judgment shall be as stated in the main text. This case was executed in court by Dai Rongkun, Prosecutor of this court. June 21, 35th year of the Republic of China, Trial President of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai High Court, Judge Liu Yugui, Associate Judge Cao Jun, Associate Judge Qiu Huanxuan.

### Chairman Chiang Orders the Ministry of Education to Allow Graduating Students of Provisional Universities to Participate in the Graduation Examination of Formal Universities

The Ministry of Education is currently drafting appropriate measures in accordance with the order

[Special Report from Nanjing by Our Newspaper] For graduating students of provisional universities who wish to participate in the examinations for graduates of formal universities in order to pursue further studies, Chairman Chiang has personally issued an order to the Ministry of Education to draft appropriate measures to handle this matter. The Ministry of Education is currently drafting appropriate measures. It is said that graduating students of provisional universities generally believe that although their graduation certificates may state their qualifications, it is difficult to avoid societal discrimination. They worry that their future prospects for career opportunities and further studies abroad may be considerably affected. Therefore, they made this request. It is also said that the administrative side is providing relief measures, that is, graduating students of provisional universities this year can register three months before the graduation examination of formal universities for the same subjects they have studied, participate in the examination, and if their results pass, they will be issued a diploma from a formal university, allowing them to pursue further studies. This year, various universities have not fully recovered, and the graduation results of provisional universities have not been determined, so this matter will have to wait until next year to be implemented.

### Yongjia Launches a Respect-for-Teachers Movement - Fundraising Methods Border on Intimidation

[Xinhua News Agency, Yongjia] Since the Yongjia County Small Education Advancement Association in Zhejiang Province launched a respect-for-teachers movement, it has received a response from the entire education community, and the outside world has shown unlimited sympathy for the difficult lives of elementary school teachers. However, the collection of respect-for-teachers donations by various schools is not consistent in its methods, and students' families inevitably have mixed feelings. Moreover, a small number of elementary schools, for wealthy families, reject donations that only meet the prescribed amount, deeming it too little, and even warn students that if they do not pay the respect-for-teachers donation, they will be disciplined or expelled. This kind of method borders on intimidation, so that all sectors of society have mixed opinions on the respect-for-teachers movement. Knowledgeable people believe that influential families should uphold the ancient saying "A teacher for one day is a father for life" and donate as much as possible, while elementary school teachers should promote the respect-for-teachers movement with the attitude of "Teachers must respect themselves first, and then others will respect them."

As for the problem of elementary school buildings, it will require the assistance of enthusiastic educationists in the community, otherwise the school buildings for next semester will still be lacking, which will cause very serious losses to teaching. As for the adjustment of teachers' salaries and allowances, it will be handled in accordance with the treatment of general civil servants, and there are no separate regulations for separate adjustments.

### Respect-for-Teachers Western Art Charity Exhibition - Various Colors Manifest the Spirit of the Times - A Rare Opportunity, the Last Act of Respect-for-Teachers

Following the respect-for-teachers Chinese painting charity sale, there is now a Western art charity exhibition, which opened yesterday at the New Life Club. The reporter, being fond of art and sympathetic to the respect-for-teachers movement, drove to the club on Weihaiwei Road in the not-too-hot morning to visit. Over a hundred paintings, hung neatly and staggered, dazzled the eye in the fairly spacious "Frugality Hall" on the second floor, like being on the road to Shanyin, too much to take in! At the beginning, I saw an oil painting of about 40 inches, Jin Qijing's "Farewell at Jianggan," a poetic theme that is truly thought-provoking. There are green hills and clear waters, and several plum trees, half withered, swaying in the wind, quite close to the style of Chinese painting, but the small steamer in the middle, is firing up and moving quickly, which fully expresses the spirit of the times, and is different from the sails commonly seen in Chinese paintings. Below, a dark red strip indicates that this 500,000 yuan masterpiece has already been reserved by "Mr. Zhu".

Next, the reporter shifted his gaze to various directions, Xiao Shufang's watercolor "Sleeping Child," with its unrestrained brushstrokes, matched with rough and simple colors, looks as thick as an oil painting at first glance. Zheng Dingyu's oil painting landscape, with a deep dense forest, lining a pool of autumn water, shows the faithful style of neo-classicism, and is equally his masterpiece, like his other still life. Wang Tong's two watercolor paintings "Huangpu River" and "Broadway Building" are very accurate in color and outline. The former is a surging river tide, the ochre-colored river water is advancing; the latter is a towering building, standing behind the iron bridge, a very stereotyped building, using water and color to express the description, it is not easy to be so vivid and lively.

Ten years ago, most of the old Western painting writers have changed, and are striving in the direction of Chinese painting. Therefore, there are very few of their works here, only Yan Wenliang is left. Mr. Yan is purely a classical writer, and everyone still remembers his masterpieces "Kitchen" and "Lu Gao Jian"! This time he has three frames, all depicting the scenery of the Su-Xi area of ​​Jiangnan, with snow scenes, moonlight, and spring. Although small and exquisite, they took a lot of effort, and the price is very cheap. Yan Guang may be doing it for the sake of respecting teachers, seeking its universality. Zhang Chongren is the first-class painter among the new writers. Judging from his products, it can be said that every piece is a fine product, especially among the landscapes, the "Gu Family Garden" frame, the color is very harmonious, the brushstrokes are calm and powerful, and the background in still lifes such as "Flowers" and "Game" is deep and dark, making the picture particularly strong and powerful, it is indeed a masterpiece, Ding Guang seems to have the same style as Yan Wenliang, fine and gentle, like spring, like gentle wind, a large 50-inch oil landscape, introducing the sweet tenderness of Jiangnan water town, paired with a very beautiful mirror frame, making people yearn! Make people play! The price of over 200,000 yuan is too cheap.

Liu Cangxu, Chen Zhitong, Li Yongsen, Li Zongjin, etc., all have extremely fine masterpieces on display. Zhou Bichu's small landscape, the azure sky, dangling a few thin autumn clouds, the golden yellow and tender green ground, fully expresses the beauty and loveliness of the early autumn scenery! Liu Shi only has two nude sketches, relaxed and fluent, without any effort. I heard that he was just sick after his solo exhibition, so there were no masterpieces, which is also a pity. Female writers Han Anyi and Zhou Ruying have many unique strengths in their works, but unfortunately the reporter doesn't remember clearly and cannot introduce them one by one.

Finally, the reporter believes that the Western Painting Exhibition in honor of teachers is the last event of this respect-for-teachers movement. It is unprecedented and will never happen again. There will never be a second respect-for-teachers movement. I hope that people in the society who love art and sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers will promote and assist more, so that this Western painting exhibition will have better gains! A more satisfactory result! (Puchi, 35, 6, 21, in Shanghai)

### Truth Ultimately Triumphs Over Speculation - The Black Market for Public Bonds is on the Verge of Extinction - Tong Bing Fell 1,500 Yuan Yesterday

Various public bonds issued more than 30 years ago are scheduled to be redeemed universally starting on July 1st. Seeing the Nanjing telegram from the Central News Agency yesterday, black market speculators finally felt that their final fate had been decided. When the market opened yesterday morning, they rushed to sell. Bing bonds plummeted to the 1,000 yuan mark, with low prices seeing around 900 yuan, reaching two-thirds of the total value. Then, because short sellers made profits and replenished their positions, and speculators temporarily scrambled, the price rose again to around 1,450 yuan, a drop of 1,500 compared to before the closure. Jia and Yi bonds fell by 1,000 yuan, Ding bonds fell by 900 yuan, and Wu bonds fell by 1,100 yuan. In the afternoon, the bond and stock market was in a turbulent state, and rumors of closures were rife.

### Gold Price Rises by 90,000

Yesterday's situation stimulated people's hearts. When the market opened in the morning, it immediately stood firm at 1.9 million. After the opening, it gradually rose, and the US dollar came to help buy. After 10:00 AM, it hovered around 1.96 million. The central allocation of 262 bars was priced at 1,957,500. At this time, it struggled between 1.95 million and 1.96 million, and finally, due to the abundance of surplus funds, it rose again to around 1.98 million near noon. At noon, it first approached the 2 million mark, but it was suppressed and fell back in the afternoon. In the end, it still stood above 1.99 million. As a result, it rose by 90,000 compared to before the closure. Jewelry gold was listed at 210,000, silver was flat, and dark interest rose slightly, at around 1.5 jiao.

### US Dollars Become Popular Again - Hong Kong Dollars are Being Bought Up

Foreign currency US dollars opened at around 2,620 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. Speculators spread rumors of further increases, and buying interest followed stocks, hovering and rising. Near noon, it rose to above 2,710 yuan. In the afternoon, it briefly retreated to below 2,700 yuan, but in the end, it was easily pulled up again. As a result, it closed up more than 100 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were bought up by foreign exchange dealers and rose by another 30 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was being shorted by traders, and with the success of British and American loans not far away, general trading firms rushed to develop in that port, so demand exceeded supply, rising to 515 yuan, Indian exchange rate 615 yuan, US exchange rate appeared nominally flat but internally stagnant.

### Rayon Soars Again

Yesterday, the opening price of rayon in the market was more than 100,000 yuan higher than on Wednesday. This was because Zhongfang Company's shipment of No. 120 bright yarn was missing, causing those who held the goods to regard them as treasures, and the selling price skyrocketed. Tianqiao bright yarn opened at 1.78 million yuan, with the highest reaching 1.82 million yuan, before closing down slightly at 1.8 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the abundance of buyers and the need for actual sellers to replenish their stocks, the price rose sharply, reaching 1.9 million yuan and 1.94 million yuan, resulting in an increase of 300,000 yuan compared to Wednesday. No. 120 miscellaneous brand Meinu bright yarn was traded at 1.65 million yuan in the morning and 1.84 million yuan in the afternoon. Xuhui bright yarn was traded at 1.57 million yuan in the morning and offered for sale at 1.79 million yuan in the afternoon, both with an increase of over 300,000 yuan compared to last Wednesday. No. 120 semi-dull yarn increased by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, while No. 75 semi-dull yarn increased by approximately 200,000 yuan. Foreign silk merchants still lacked an appetite. Silk fabric merchants made some deals yesterday, with new inspection certificates for 76/77 grade evenness being traded at 2.2 million yuan and 2.25 million yuan. There were few transactions in user silk, with asking prices in various grades being around 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, with freight and other expenses to be borne separately. The transaction price was 1.63 million yuan. Silk goods rose slightly yesterday. Meiya bedspreads were 1.5 million yuan in the morning and 1.53 million yuan in the afternoon. Dacheng checkered cloth was 5,330 yuan in the morning and 5,440 yuan in the afternoon, more than 100 yuan stronger than Wednesday.

### Gold Arrives in Shanghai

Another 196 boxes were shipped from Tianjin and brought into the warehouse on Sunday (the 16th).

### South China Faction's Appetite Increases; Double Horse Reaches New High

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to soar. The South China faction's appetite for high-end goods remained strong, causing Double Horse to reach a new high of 1.48 million, an increase of 70,000 from the 19th. Other small and medium-sized yarns also followed suit, rising by about 120,000. No. 32 Sun Brand Blue Phoenix single yarn was also favored by both Hunan and Guangdong traders, with the final transaction price being 1.75 million, the same increase of 100,000 as No. 42 doubled yarn. At noon, Textile Construction opened yarn as usual, with prices similar to the previous period. However, the bidding price for No. 32 sub-brand Blue Phoenix single yarn was 30,000 higher than Wednesday. There were also ten types of coarse and fine yarn threads sold through bidding.

Yesterday, New York's American cotton telegram showed near-term weakness and far-term strength, ranging from 5 to 19 points. The near-term price was US$29.28 and the far-term price was US$29.57. The spot price of middling was US$29.88. The local raw cotton trade was stable. Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory and Wuxi Qingfeng Yarn Factory made slight purchases, but no purchases were reported from other factories.

The actual demand in the cloth market was sluggish, and customers remained hesitant. At the same time, Zhongfang Company continued to supply, and the market price fell by 250 to 500 yuan. However, in the afternoon, it was heard that the price of gold had risen, and market sentiment turned firm, with asking prices returning to their original levels.

### American Caustic Soda Has Arrived

Delivery Rumors Cannot Be Confirmed

The price of caustic soda in this city once soared sharply. Recently, it was heard that a batch of American brands such as Laotou, Xiannu, and Meinu 99.5% caustic soda had been transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, causing the price to fall. Merchants mostly took advantage of the high price to sell. It is now known that the above-mentioned caustic soda has been shipped from Hanyang by boat to Shanghai, and the unloading has been going on for five days. As of yesterday, over 1,600 barrels of caustic soda have been unloaded. It is also heard that Eastgate and other ships are also loaded with industrial raw materials. Whether there is more caustic soda among them is unknown because it has not been unloaded. According to people in the industry, among the raw materials shipped this time, there are also zinc oxide powder, water glass, leather, baking soda, etc. According to a certain raw material firm, foreign merchants recently offered a large amount of caustic soda for sale, but merchants were mostly unwilling to purchase it due to the recent consistent decline in the price of caustic soda. As for the rumors that a certain foreign firm has begun to distribute caustic soda again, it has not yet been confirmed.

### The Tea Market Is Quiet

Although there are currently sporadic exports of tea for overseas sales, industry insiders are not optimistic about the future. As for various types of domestic sales, sellers insist on hoarding goods, reluctant to sell them easily. However, in terms of sales, the demand in the Suzhou area has gradually been met since the Japanese plundering, and the intention to inquire has decreased. Shops on this street, aware that they cannot get what they want for the time being, have also adopted a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, the situation is generally one of quiet supply and demand, and transactions are not as enthusiastic as before the holiday, and prices fluctuate.

### Rice Milling Ordered to Stop Milling Refined Rice

The Rice Milling Industry Association of this city issued an important announcement today, stating that according to an order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Government instructed that "It has been found that various countries are currently facing food shortages, but rice mills are still milling refined rice. According to expert research, refined rice not only lacks vitamins compared to brown rice, but also consumes too much during milling, which is not a way to save food. It has been passed by the Municipal Council to prohibit the milling of refined rice. From now on, rice mills in this city are only allowed to mill the following three types of brown rice: (1) Superior grade must have 2% rice husk, 5% red rice, and at least 10% broken rice; (2) Medium grade 2% rice husk, 10% red rice, and 20% broken rice; (3) Third grade 3% rice husk, 15% red rice, and 30% broken rice." (The rest omitted) All rice mills in this city will implement this order from today.

### Rice Market Remains Calm; Miscellaneous Grain Market Improves

The rice market remains quiet and thin. As rice merchants have obtained legal protection, speculators are hiding in fear of punishment, and the market is calm as always. Yesterday, the prices of various grades remained unchanged. The total amount of goods registered by merchants to the market reached 1,583 *shi* (approximately 158.3 tonnes), a decrease of 459 *shi* compared to the previous market. This included 636 *shi* of white *japonica*, 267 *shi* of *bo dao* (thin rice), 80 *shi* of *yang xian*, 176 *shi* of *du xian*, 162 *shi* of *wu xian*, 22 *shi* of white *yuan*, and 240 *shi* of milled *xian*.

Qingdao wheat has moved slightly, and the market is active, with high-quality goods rising by 500 to 600 yuan, and medium and lower-quality goods remaining unchanged. Sesame is scarce and selling well, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are stable. Green beans are sluggish, falling by 1,000 yuan. Corn remains weak. After several days of sharp declines, broad beans have seen a reversal of production and sales, with a slight decrease in incoming goods, and the market has entered a stable phase.

### World Bank to Open Regularly on June 25

[Washington, D.C., American News Agency, 20th] Eugene Meyer, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, announced today that the International Bank has set June 25 as the official date for the start of operations, and requested that the 38 member states pay 10% of their subscribed capital around November 25. The Bank also urged each member state to pay 2% of their subscribed capital in gold or US dollars around November 25 (after deducting the 0.2% that had already been paid), and another 3% in the national currency around November 25. The Bank further notified each member state that it would notify them on September 25 of the amount of principal to be paid in their own currency before November 25, which would be 5%. As for the 1/1000 of the subscribed capital that each country had previously paid in gold and US dollars, totaling approximately US$767,000,000, it would be used to pay for the administrative expenses of the Bank, which were paid by each member state at the time of signing the Bank's Articles of Agreement. Meyer pointed out that, in accordance with the agreed terms, the Bank must select an official date for the start of operations so that it could notify the collection of capital, which is the initial step for starting operations. The agreement originally stipulated that within 60 days from the date the Bank began operations, each country should pay 2% of the subscribed amount in gold or US dollars. By November 25, the subscribed amount of each member state will reach US$767,000,000, of which US$153,400,000 should be paid in gold or US dollars. Meyer said that in addition to the 10% of principal payable before November 25, the International Bank will give priority to collecting another 10% of principal in national currencies. According to the agreement, the International Bank may use 20% of the subscribed capital of each member state for direct lending, while the remaining 80% may only be collected when the Bank must clear its debts due to borrowing or guarantee procedures. The total assets subscribed by the current 38 member states of the International Bank are US$7,670,000,000.

### Economic Briefs

The day before yesterday was the settlement period for the banking industry this year. It is understood that the banking business for the past six months has been more developed than the native banks, because after the opening of foreign exchange, the amount of exchange settlement deposits has increased sharply, with the average monthly total deposits reaching about 80 billion yuan.

[Tianjin, 20th] The Tianjin-Korea trade has been resolved through consultation with the Allied authorities. Recently, a diesel ship sailed from Tianjin to Incheon, Korea for the first time, and has already set sail, carrying a large amount of Chinese medicine, cloth, groceries, summer supplies, etc.

[Hankou, 21st] There were originally 70 wholesale fabric dealers in this city, which decreased to 47 after the Restoration. Recently, "Xinchangxiang," "Zhongli," and "Houyu" have closed down due to their inability to maintain operations. It is said that the reason for their closure is due to the exploitation of high-interest loans and the increase in business stamp duties and other taxes, resulting in a sharp decline in business.

### Speculative Market Storm Is Dangerous; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Plunge; Industry Insiders and Outsiders Are Uneasy

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw many people selling stocks to realize cash in order to compensate for losses caused by the renewed rise of the bond market. Outside investors, seeing the unfavorable situation, hesitated to move forward, and supply exceeded demand. At the morning opening, the high prices were: Yongsha 590 yuan, Meiya 3750 yuan, Jingfu 250 yuan, Xinguang 250 yuan, and Qinxing 190 yuan. Except for Xinguang, which was still favored due to the purchase of factory assets, the rest were mostly closed at low prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yongsha fell by 10%, Meiya fell by 20%, and Jingfu and Qinxing fell by slightly less than 20%. Xinguang has surpassed Jingfu, falling by only slightly more than 10%. Cold-market small and medium-sized stocks were also dragged down by about 10%. Although the old stocks fell less, industry insiders and outsiders were very cautious in order to avoid accidents. In the afternoon, the asking prices for Yongsha and Meiya, two popular stocks, fell by another 10%, with many people cutting losses. Outsiders should pay more attention. Foreign stocks also could not escape the exception. Those who also operated in the bond market cut losses to realize cash in order to support the precarious situation, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Yisha, after opening at 9600 yuan, continued to see supply exceeding demand and retreated to the 9000 yuan level before stabilizing. As a result, each stock fell by 10% to 15% compared to before the market closure.

### Early Hongniao Leaves are Offered

The early lychees produced in Zhangzhou have already entered the market. Yesterday, a small number of early Hongzhi and Wuye lychees, totaling ten *dan* (approximately 500 kg), were rushed to the North Market by motorized sailing ships, so the opening price was quite high. Wuye lychees were priced at 285,000 yuan, and early Hongzhi lychees also reached 280,000 yuan. However, the quantity was small and cannot be considered the official market, otherwise, using this as a benchmark would surely result in losses.

### Wing On to Hold Shareholders' Meeting; Plans to Increase Capital to 1 Billion Yuan

Wing On Co., Ltd. was originally organized and registered in accordance with the laws of the United States. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was forced to register with the puppet organization. The original directors could not perform their duties, and a group of directors elected during the war was responsible for everything. After the victory, the original directors resumed their duties. It is learned that the company's wartime directors and former secretary, M.E. Thompson, have issued notices separately, scheduling a shareholders' meeting on the 24th to discuss increasing capital, amending the articles of association, approving last year's annual report, re-electing directors, and discussing other related matters. The company's original capital was 100 million yuan in puppet currency, which has now been converted to 100 million yuan in legal currency, and an additional 900 million yuan is being added, totaling 1 billion yuan in legal currency.

### Taiwan Company Insists on Original Price; Medium Sugar White Rises Again

Yesterday, the sugar market remained strong. Although the Taiwan Company continued to sell, the quantity was very small and insisted on the original price of 98,000 yuan, with 2,100 bags being traded. This was a drop in the bucket and did not help the situation. Some say that such a low price will only drive the price higher. The Association's market trend continued to rise for the above reasons. In the morning, medium sugar white was 100,600 to 100,800 yuan for double bags and 100,800 to 111,300 yuan for single bags. In the afternoon, it was 110,000 to 114,000 yuan for single bags, and later remained at 110,000 yuan, with 100,800 yuan for double bags. Fourth-term warehouse receipts were 111,000 to 113,000 yuan, closing at 100,800 yuan. Numbered goods opened at 120,000 to 115,600 yuan for Xinghua white and 98,000 to 100,200 yuan for Jiuhua red, with over 300 *bao* traded, rising 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Dozens of *bao* of Zhangdiao green were 92,000 yuan, rising 10,000 yuan. The trend is unlikely to ease in the short term.

### Overseas Chinese Merchant in the UK Returns to Investigate Business

[Reuters, London, 21st] Mr. Xu, the manager of the Liverpool Chinese Trading Company, is about to depart to visit Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Peiping, and other places in the Far East. Mr. Xu will investigate the general trade situation and represent British and Chinese merchants to negotiate everything.

### Japanese Spinning Spindles Will Reach 3 Million; Rayon Production Reaches One-Third; 80 Million Tons of American Cotton Will Arrive in Japan

[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recently been notified that 43,000 tons of raw cotton will arrive in Kobe this month. This is the first batch of the estimated 890,000 bales imported from the United States this year, which will be used by Japanese textile factories to manufacture finished products. After the raw cotton is received, approximately 60% of its weight will be delivered to American commercial companies as finished goods for re-export in order to "pay" for the cotton. The remaining 40% will be retained by Japan for domestic use. According to a report by the International Textile Group, published by the US State Department and Allied Headquarters, the former Japanese textile industry has reached one-fifth of its pre-war cotton spinning production and one-third of its pre-war rayon production. In February 1946, the Japanese cotton spinning industry had 2,150,000 spindles installed, of which 1,115,000 were available for use. It is estimated that in January 1947, the number of spindles may increase to 3,285,000, of which the number available for use is estimated to reach 2,990,000.

### Full Text of Acheson's Speech: Continued Military Aid to China; Moving Towards an Orderly and Peaceful World

Dean Acheson, Acting Secretary of State of the United States, delivered a speech on the 19th before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the issue of military assistance to China. The main points have been published in yesterday's newspaper. The full text is recorded below for reference.

I am here today to briefly describe H.R. Bill No. 6795, which will provide for military assistance and advisors to the Republic of China. Now that Japan has been defeated in the war, China, after eight years of hard fighting, must once again embark on domestic reconstruction and revival. However, the end of the war has not solved all of China's problems. Due to years of enemy occupation and war losses, one of the main problems facing the Chinese government is to restore domestic order and repatriate the large number of Japanese troops who remained in China at the time of Japan's surrender. China must strive to solve this problem and quickly find a way to fulfill its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations to maintain peace. Since the passage of the Lend-Lease Act, the Chinese army has received American supplies and equipment, and has been trained by American military missions. China has been able to continue fighting because of this, and the Chinese army has made even greater progress in its war efforts through the use of our technology and supplies. In the 22nd report submitted to Congress on Lend-Lease activities, it was stated that the materials supplied to China from the day of victory over Japan to February 1946 were worth 600 million US dollars. I think that when considering the bill for continued assistance to China, it would be worthwhile to briefly review our country's efforts to assist China in resisting Japanese aggression. This is a story that we can be proud of, and it is also enough to show that if this kind of cooperation can continue, it will be of great benefit to world peace.

General Marshall is now in China attempting to bring the various Chinese groups into agreement for the benefit of peace. He has made considerable progress, so we must continue to provide the assistance that General Marshall deems necessary to enable China and us to move forward together toward an orderly world under the Charter of the United Nations. Shortly before the Pearl Harbor incident, the first batch of Lend-Lease materials had been shipped to China, and Brigadier General Magruder was sent by the Department of the Army to assist China in utilizing these materials. Several months later, General Stilwell replaced Magruder, and at the request of Chairman Chiang, General Stilwell was appointed as Chairman Chiang's Chief of Staff. At this time, the flights over "The Hump" had begun, and nearly five Chinese divisions, each with 10,000 to 12,000 men, were airlifted to India, where a training center was established in the Ramgarh area. The training there included infantry, artillery, armored troops, signal corps, and transport troops. The training of the Chinese army in Burma proved to be very successful. Therefore, General Stilwell initiated the so-called "Thirty-Nine Division Plan" in China, which was later continued by General Wedemeyer. At that time, China was in a critical period. As the Chinese army was forced to retreat step by step along the coast and the main industrial areas of central China, the United States sent officers to China and established a training center in Kunming, where training similar to that in Ramgarh began. Major General Chennault, who led the famous Flying Tigers in the early stages of the war, rejoined the service of the United States Army and was ordered to go to China to assist in training the Chinese Air Force. The training of the Kunming "Y Force" was also carried out at the same time. In addition to training the Chinese Air Force, General Chennault also continued to provide effective protection to the Chinese army fighting in various parts of central China. All the training products needed for the Chinese training program, as well as the supplies we could provide to the forward Chinese army, had to be transported by transport planes across "The Hump", flying over the "dangerous" route in the Himalayan mountains. The frequency and effectiveness of this transportation were astonishing. But munitions and other equipment finally arrived in China, and the morale of the Chinese army was greatly boosted after receiving these supplies. All equipment supplied to the Chinese army was based on the Lend-Lease Act. After the end of the war, the Chinese army still needed additional equipment and supplies in order to effectively carry out the recovery work in the occupied areas. Therefore, President Truman extended the Lend-Lease supply to China until March 31, 1946. At the beginning of this year, it was found that the work of the Chinese army in recovering the occupied areas would not be completed by March 31, so the President once again extended the Lend-Lease period to China until June 30, 1946. At that time, the authority of the Lend-Lease Act will expire, as this committee knows, and we will no longer be able to continue to make agreements for the supply of equipment. China must maintain order in areas where Japanese troops are still moving, and the Chinese government must rely on well-equipped troops to fulfill its obligations to its own people and under the Charter of the United Nations. The legislation added this time is based on this reason. The State Department, with the support of the Department of the Army and Navy, has requested legislation to provide advisors and assistance to China.

### The Unification and Reorganization of Chinese Troops is Imminent

General Marshall believes that the various Chinese military forces urgently need to be unified into one, which is the main goal of his work. He is currently working to resolve various complex issues, and we also hope to achieve complete results. The Communist troops will be part of a non-partisan national army, but so far they lack sufficient organization, training, and equipment. Therefore, the leaders of the Communist troops have requested (and General Marshall has agreed) to receive short-term American training and a minimum amount of equipment before the reorganization. Any assistance related to this decision in the coming months will contribute to the military plan. Our work is related to a very large army. The strength of the Chinese National Army is about 300 divisions, with each division numbering between 10,000 and 12,000. According to recent estimates, the strength of the Communist troops is equivalent to one-quarter of the National Army. Resolving various related issues and carrying out the reorganization work requires considerable authority. The bill under consideration will generate this authority. According to the reorganization plan proposed by General Marshall, the number of this large army will be greatly reduced, and the reorganized army will be a well-trained peacetime army. Its strength will meet our ideals. If General Marshall's proposal is implemented, and we continue to fulfill the obligations recommended by General Marshall that we should write down, China will have a powerful combat organization unprecedented in the past. This combat organization will also meet China's peacetime needs. The reorganization work will achieve great results: a huge workforce will be able to engage in rebuilding the recovered areas and post-war agricultural affairs to meet the urgent needs to deal with famine. A large workforce will be transformed for the development of Chinese industry. The Chinese government will also save the wasteful expenses of maintaining a large and poorly organized army. Before the reorganization work is completed, the Chinese government will have no hope of effective and orderly administration. Effective and orderly administration is a necessary condition for China to curb inflation and carry out post-war work.

### Fulfilling Promises and Assisting in Building Military Institutions

The most important part of the outline proposed by General Marshall is to send military advisory representatives to China. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek made this request several months ago. This is the core of the outline, and authority regarding this outline is currently being requested. After consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department, a plan has been drawn up for this military advisory group and approved by the President. The President, in accordance with his emergency powers, instructed us: the organization of the advisory group should be temporary in nature, but there are no additional regulations, and the duration of the group's existence has not been determined. Therefore, in this situation, a much-needed long-range plan cannot be developed. The current military advisory delegation will include 750 U.S. Army personnel and 250 Navy personnel. General Marshall believes that these 1,000 people will help him implement plans to modernize the Chinese army and determine the quantity of supplies and equipment that the Chinese army should have.

I must now solemnly state that the State Department has a great interest in facilitating General Marshall's implementation of his plan.

This proposal should be made into law as soon as possible. I firmly believe that this is extremely necessary and also very beneficial to the United States. This measure will enable the U.S. government to fulfill the promise made by the President on December 15th of last year, that is, to assist China in establishing military institutions, so that the country can bear the national and international responsibilities related to maintaining peace and order. As the President stated in that declaration: an unorganized and divided China is a destructive force for world stability and peace, and will invite external interference in its own problems. On the other hand, a well-trained and adequately equipped peace army of considerable size (as suggested by General Marshall in his military adjustment plan) will be of great benefit to peace and eliminating internal strife, and will also enable China to fulfill its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.

### Municipal School Reservation Fee

Mr. Editor: My daughter is studying at the First Municipal Girls' Middle School. She returned home the other day and said that the principal announced that all students preparing to continue their studies at the school next semester must pay a reservation fee of 5,000 yuan per person, and must pay it within two days, otherwise they will be considered as having automatically withdrawn from school. Although I am a small civil servant and have no spare money, because my daughter urged me so urgently and I was afraid that she would lose the opportunity to study, I had to borrow 5,000 yuan from relatives and friends to pay. Collecting reservation fees from students was originally one of the methods used by Shanghai private schools to raise money. Since municipal schools do not charge tuition fees, what is the basis for the school's collection of reservation fees from students this time, and the amount is as high as 5,000 yuan? Has it been approved by the Education Administration Bureau in advance? I hereby appeal to the education authorities on behalf of poor parents, hoping to thoroughly investigate and stop this practice. Shao Jinzhi, June 19th.

Waterwheels on the Bank of the Yellow River in Lanzhou (Photographed and sent by Jian Qiu)

### The Undercurrent in Lanzhou

— Guo Jianqiu

Lanzhou Airmail, 13th

When the great sandstorm from the Han-Gerry region stopped roaring, a small city wall emerged from the wind and sand. The white poplars and pear trees on the banks of the Yellow River are also verdant. People know that spring in the borderlands has passed. When the rhododendrons in the deep mountains used their last elegy to send off spring, the last petals of the peonies also withered away. What follows is the scorching summer and the abundant melons and fruits.

Where is summer in Lanzhou? On both banks of the Yellow River.

Look: On the river bank, the giant wheels of the water army, along with the rolling torrent of the Yellow River in summer, have begun their work again. Since the early arrival of winter in the borderlands, they have been having a very long dream for several months! It dreamed that the Yellow River would turn into a silver dragon in the cold wind, and then freeze on the earth without a sound. The people on the shore huddled in their cave dwellings, enduring the tyranny of winter in dilapidated mud houses. The strong pungent odor caused by burning horse manure for warmth enveloped the cities and villages. Of course, it often dreamed of the brightly polished white copper charcoal stoves and the aroma of hot white liquor in the homes of officials, merchants, and heads of households, but what could it do? When the frozen silver dragon is resurrected in the early summer sun, and begins to flow and sing again, it can also start its work again. They sing, letting the beads of sweat fly in all directions, drawing the water from the river to the high embankment, letting them gurgle through the sandy banks, through the fields. Let those farmers who huddled for a winter in the cold wind unfold a piece of hope of life in their cobblestone-stacked melon or wheat fields.

But summer in Lanzhou does not just stay in the suburbs. In the city, on the streets, in the ice cream parlors of old Hui people shouting loudly with white caps on their heads, on the strong bare legs of those mixed-race girls, and on the exposed left arms of lamas in fur robes, you can also see the footsteps of summer.

Local newspapers say that Lanzhou's summer this year has a high heat not seen in twelve years. But outsiders can't feel it. When they recall the summer days in the past, on the bamboo buildings like steamers in Chongqing, on the banks of the Qinhuai River exuding heat, those days of swallowing ice and waving fans, yet still sweating like rain, Lanzhou is happy. The indoor temperature in the luxurious mansions is only about 20 degrees Celsius. Inexpensive natural ice is delivered to homes every day. Canned fruits that have poured into Shanghai and local grape juice, after being chilled, are also wonderful products for cooling off in the summer. Moreover, in another month or two, the drunken melons, westerly winds, honey peaches, big apples, and crabapples that give Lanzhou the reputation of being a fruit city will also be on the market.

Lanzhou's summer is calm and not too hot. But it has a unique and bold border style. For example, in the calm hot sun, a black cloud suddenly appears, and it may fill half the sky in an instant. Then the strong wind rises, and the sand slams against your mouth and nose, making it impossible to breathe. It may also be mixed with a few large raindrops, pinging and popping and breaking all the window paper. If there is also electricity, be careful of your head. But don't worry, maybe in ten minutes, maybe in twenty minutes, everything will be in the past, and it will still be sunny and warm.

So is the weather, so is human affairs. For example, you are living a peaceful life, when suddenly the news comes that a gang of bandits is fleeing from the Gansu-Ningxia border area to Hexi; otherwise, it is discovered that water has climbed on horseback and returned to the bandits; otherwise, the bandits in Huajialing have come out again, so take ten cars less.

But none of this can affect the ongoing border construction work. Summer time, which is uniform throughout the country, has long been implemented, but the working hours here are not affected at all, and seem even more intense. Look: At the Engineers' Festival, the engineers who have the important task of developing the border areas have just finished a big meeting, and the Association of Scientific Workers has also been established. The electro-educational education of the Science Education Museum is said to have been launched on a large scale. The film drama troupe of the Political Department of the Military Command is also preparing to advance to the barren Gobi Desert. What Qilian Mountains survey teams, geological survey teams, hydropower exploration teams, Qingxin highway surveying teams, Tianlan Railway Lintao branch line surveying teams, and Lanzhou to Dihua copper cable line installation teams are all going out to work in all directions. Lanzhou University is actively preparing, and it also wants to add an engineering college. The authorities are trying to hire professors.

But all these efforts cannot save a declining undercurrent. This undercurrent includes two forces: one is the flood of industrial decline that has been hard-won, and the other is the flow of people rolling eastward by refugees, righteous people, gold prospectors in the frontier, and rebuilders of old homes after the Longhai passage opened. These two forces converge into a large flood, which is currently washing and impacting on this barren and dry loess plateau. If there are no appropriate measures to correct it and differentiate it, it may be like the Northwest Highway every summer, which will be washed into sections by huge mountain torrents. (June 13th in Lanzhou)

Free Talk

### Recover Hong Kong

— Shaofu

"I would rather fight with a rogue than talk to a rascal." Fighting with a rogue is done with fists and feet. Whoever loses and whoever wins is clean and crisp, clean and tidy; talking to a rascal is just rambling, crooked and twisted, dragging and dawdling, and just talking nonsense. This is probably the kind of distinction that we Chinese make between the United States and the United Kingdom.

People who have lived in Hong Kong can say that they are satisfied with the climate, etc., especially in winter; but no one dares to accept the colonial policies of the rulers.

Let’s not talk about the old debts of the past. Taking the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan as an example, in the Pingshan Airport incident, the Hong Kong authorities still maintained the face of the British Empire, which made us angry! And this time, the suspension of the National Daily News is even worse, simply absurd. We absolutely cannot tolerate it. We now resolutely put forward a slogan, "Recover Hong Kong and Kowloon."

The lease term of Hong Kong and Kowloon has already expired. When the unequal treaties were abolished in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), this issue was not resolved due to the relationship of fighting side by side, which we truly regret; in the UK, frankly speaking, that is shameless! That is a rascal!

Mark 12 says:

"Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely."

The United Kingdom has received the punishment it deserves in this war. May I ask, what reason does the United Kingdom today, in Europe, in the Near East, and even in India, have to put on the airs of a bully? In Hong Kong, can it do whatever it wants, show off the power of the master, despise our laws, insult our government, and enslave our people? Bah!

No negotiations can be conducted. Simply and directly, take it back. As for those bad guys who harbor traitors, no matter what country they are from, arrest them and then punish them.

### It's Hard to Be a U.S. Congressman

— Chuanqiu

Voters Send Up to 60,000 Letters a Day - Washing Clothes and Picking Up Stones Must All Be Performed

The 435 men and women congressmen in the U.S. House of Representatives and the 96 senators have different hobbies and habits, but at about ten o'clock every morning, they almost all do the same job, which is reading letters. Congressmen may be absent from committee meetings, not vote, or not attend meetings, but they must open their letters.

During normal times, mail is delivered to the Capitol four times a day, and on Saturdays and holidays it is reduced to twice a day, with an average of about 60,000 pieces of mail per day. One congressman recalled that 40 years ago, his grandfather was also in Congress at that time, and he hired a secretary to help answer all the letters. Today, each congressman has to hire three to four clerks to cope. In 1907, the average congressman from a major city in the Midwest received 12 letters a day. But in 1946, even though the population of the city had decreased, the congressmen received a total of 125 letters a day.

Approximately four out of every five letters ask about or support an event. Each congressman's work is often aroused by strange requests. One woman wrote to ask for stones from the Little Poodoo Meek River to increase her collection. Another voter learned that his son was about to be discharged from the army and returned to Washington, so he wrote to his congressman, saying that he had sent two sets of clothes and asked the congressman to help him hang them in the office, ready to be handed over to his beloved son upon arrival!

But, in fact, the letters received by congressmen are, on the whole, of great value to their contributions. No congressman can be aware of the content and advantages and disadvantages of so many proposals. Many individuals and groups such as the American University Women's Association and the Economic Construction Association conduct detailed studies of various issues, so their letters are well-reasoned and very helpful to the congressmen's thinking. However, congressmen are in a two-sided position. He not only represents his state in Washington, but also represents Washington in his state. For example, last December, Congressman Spearman from Alebaugh received many letters from his state expressing widespread dissatisfaction with the army's reinstatement and opposition to universal military training. Spearman was originally a member of the Congressional Military Committee. He certainly knew more facts than his voters. Therefore, taking advantage of the convenience of returning home for Christmas, he gave four lectures on these issues, which finally changed the views of the entire state's population. If Spearman only used the opinions provided by the letters from the voters of his state as the standard for voting, this would seem to be democratic at first glance, but what he did was include representing the government, which is a two-sided job, not a one-sided one. (Translated from American Freedom Magazine)

### Afraid of Death and Love of Money

— Chuanqiu

A Londoner boarded a train in Edinburgh and sat next to an elderly Scotsman with a worried face. When the train reached the first station, his companion hurried off the train, ran to the platform, and then hurried back, panting. The second station and the third station were the same. After the third station, the Londoner couldn't help but become curious and asked the reason. The elderly Scotsman replied, "I am going to London to ask a specialist doctor to diagnose my heart. He said it was very bad. If I don't take good care of myself, I will be in danger of losing my life at any time, so I buy a station ticket back one stop at a time!"

### Lament in Sickness

— Fang Jun

I seem to have an inseparable relationship with illness. I had already spent my younger years suffering from illness, and in these past eight or nine years, I have brought a lot of long, almost inhumanly tasting bitterness and cruelty from illness (I dare not say it was given to me by the war). This bitterness and cruelty once broke my family, starved me, killed people, and injured my ankles. What's more, for a longer period of time, I used two copper-coin-worth of cakes to fill my stomach. I only had the financial resources to eat that much twice a day, and that was considered the morning and evening meals of the day. Fortunately, I have not had to gnaw on grass roots or chew on leaves, which can be considered "favored by heaven." But as a result, my body has become even worse, and illness has been entangled with me for a long time, always staying with each other, sharing mornings and evenings, and my wife does not have such a deep feeling. But, because of this particularly affectionate fellow, illness, what I may get is a kind of "Wen Yuan Xiaoke" (wasting disease) weakening. There was indeed a time when I couldn't even afford the cost of two cakes a day. In particular, I will never forget that one time I fainted and fell under the cliff of a mountain road, with only a breath left. My soul seemed to float on the swaying treetops, and it was as if I had already attained enlightenment, wandering in the blue sky, and my mind was flying freely. Only this stinky skin was left, still lying under the cliff with only a breath left.

Fortunately, although I have an indissoluble bond with illness, I have already forged an indestructible body. This little bit of tribulation cannot trouble me much. Soon the illness temporarily bid me farewell. In fact, it was not farewell, but just hiding inside. However, for me, I really like it when it has such a short period of hiding, so that I don't have to spend too much effort on my physical strength when I go to find cakes. So I had what I considered comfortable days: writing a few hundred words, exchanging it for a ration that was more abundant than cakes, and naturally, I also had the strength to mend the only pair of leather shoes with holes in the bottom so that they looked like they were newly made.

I had such comfortable days for a while, just like when my wife was not around, leisurely and comfortable. However, as the saying goes, "without enemies, there are no reunions." Illness always has this karmic relationship with me in this life, and it is difficult to separate.

Today I am sick again. My personal thought is that I just caught a cold last night, and at the same time, I wrote a few hundred more words, and my spirit was too depleted. So when I got up in the morning, I felt dizzy and weak, and after crawling out of bed, I was forced to fall back to bed. I don't really believe in doctors, whether they are Western or Chinese. In fact, modern medicine cannot cure my illness, because it has this karmic relationship with me. Before the karmic relationship is over, illness is my unlovable but unavoidable lover, and its terrible affection for me is to make me disappear both physically and spiritually.

However, perhaps that is saying it too seriously. A little cold, is it worth making such a fuss about? However, it has to be said that for someone who has absolutely no good nutrition, illness is not just "a maggot in the bone!" But, this will not cause anything for me. Anyway, I'm used to it, and letting it stay in the disease for a long time can also be a little quieter. At least, the feelings of the world will not hit my heart. It's just a pity that there will be problems with the cakes, otherwise, I really want to close the door and get sick for years and months!

### Gualü Lychee: 100,000 Yuan Per Catty

Two Gualü lychee trees in Youyuan Monastery, Zengcheng, Guangdong, whose products were "world-renowned" tribute items, were priced at several hundred catties per fruit before the war. During the occupation, the Japanese army used them to "contribute to the Japanese Emperor" and "senior generals" in various places. This year's output is only seven and a half catties, priced at 100,000 yuan per catty, or 5,000 yuan per fruit. Before the fruits ripened, they were already "registered" and sold out. Later arrivals offered 150,000 yuan but could not obtain them. At a time of famine in Huguang (Hubei and Hunan), this is a small, ironic contrast.

Also, among fruits, mangoes, although those produced in Luzon are considered top-grade, the Xia Mao mangoes of Panyu are so prized that while Luzon mangoes sell for about 1,000 yuan each in the market, Xia Mao mangoes sell for 4,000 to 5,000 yuan each, and are presented in brocade boxes, displayed ostentatiously, with a touch of rising in value a hundredfold after entering a wealthy household. Despite this, supply still cannot meet demand. In light of this, who would dare to believe that there are forty or fifty people on the streets of Guangzhou who are starving?

The director of the Taiping Township Production Association in Changshou County, Sichuan, suddenly came up with a method to raise a large sum of money. On June 1st, he convened a meeting of the Bao chiefs (local security chiefs) and gentry, stating roughly: "Recently, I took the lead in mobilizing the villagers to raise four or two ducks per household. The ducks will be provided by the association. After the ducks grow to three catties, those raising four ducks will return two, and those raising two will return one. The association will sell these ducks, and the income will be invested to generate interest, using the interest to offset the county government's collection of various taxes in the future, as well as the funds that the township should raise. Hereafter, the villagers will never have to pay any exorbitant taxes. Those who do not fulfill this obligation will not have their interests protected," and so on. As a reader, I cannot help but write that the people of Taiping Township, Changshou County, are truly leaving a "long legacy." From now on, we will see "Changshou County becoming a Long Life County, and the people of Taiping Township becoming people of Great Peace."

According to a Chengdu newspaper report: "An employee of a certain office has been absent from work for three days recently, without asking for leave. When he came to work on the fourth day, the supervisor asked him. He replied, 'I have no money to buy rice. I haven't eaten for three days. My wife is crying and my children are wailing. How can I come to work? Today, I borrowed 700 yuan from a friend to buy sesame cakes to fill my stomach.'" He burst into tears as he spoke. This can also be seen as an example of lamentable hardship.

### Five Sons Succeeding, Lacking Only One Son

— Wuling Ren

A piece of good news that is unrelated to me: Commander Tang has sent fifty officers to Shanghai to investigate the matter of military personnel occupying houses left behind by Japanese residents. It is said that many occupied houses will be ordered to be vacated. Commander Tang is quite harsh in handling cases. Recently, a military man named Ma Weiliang was executed by firing squad in Wuxi for forcibly occupying a house in Shanghai. I believe that the results of this investigation will lead those who should not be residing [in those houses] to obediently move out. Otherwise...

The Xiangshan Popular Daily, offended the county middle school, and was interfered with by the school, forced to cease publication, the editorial department was destroyed, and even the president Wu Baozong was detained. A middle school is acting so recklessly, to such an extent. In the future, barbershops, bathhouses, the little boys, the little girls, can also rise up and follow suit. Will there be any of the news industry left? Alas, freedom, alas, freedom of speech!

I heard that the cost of living in Macau is extremely low, renting a house is no problem at all, and the rent is especially cheap. Friends! Aren't you suffering from the difficulty of living in Shanghai? You can go to Macau! I hope everyone goes! But perhaps I will not be able to accompany you, because I have already secured a loft. I feel quite comfortable with the small space.

A few days ago, there was news from Hong Kong: "Guangdong Province will soon release a list of three batches of traitors, totaling 300 names. Recently, the traitors have been busy sending cars, houses, women, and gold..." "Five sons succeeding," lacking only one son, actually having these four, why still need a face.

### Leisure

Minding one's own business is the best way to enjoy blessings. In this fragrant summer season, having a pot of tea in the afternoon, although there is no flower fragrance, hearing the bird's song, how leisurely! How leisurely!

### Meat as Cheap as Dirt

— Fang Cao

Meat products, in the eyes of today's people, are such attractive things! The middle and lower classes mostly sigh, "Three months without knowing the taste of meat." The reason is naturally the unspeakable expensiveness of meat prices. Now, the price per ounce of meat is equivalent to the price per ounce of gold before the war. It can be said: "Meat is as expensive as gold."

But the pork in Huangzhou during the Song Dynasty was as cheap as dirt, a world of difference compared to the value of a piglet today! If you don't believe it, please read Su Dongpo's "Eating Pork Poem:"

"Huangzhou has good pork, its price as cheap as dirt. The rich don't want to eat it, the poor don't know how to cook it. Cook it slowly over a low fire, with a little water, and when the fire is just right, it will be delicious. Get up every day and have a bowl, eat your fill and don't love it too much."

Such cheap pork, yet no one wants to eat it, truly a strange thing. Only Su Dongpo eats it as a snack every day. He tells you "don't love it too much," but I'm afraid you can't help but drool!

Legal Questions

(1) Bai Zhongxun asks: I have been in love with a certain woman for more than three years, and our feelings are quite in harmony, but her father is dissatisfied and constantly obstructs and destroys our feelings. However, our wills have become even stronger. Seeing that it is difficult for her father to agree, and since we can both support ourselves, is it legal to have a wedding without a presiding officiant? If a presiding officiant is necessary, can we ask a friend to act as an agent? Will the agent be held liable to her father? Is it permissible not to notify her family when holding the wedding? What are the procedures for completing a legal marriage in a simple manner? Please provide public guidance. I would be eternally grateful.

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin replies] Marriage between adult men and women does not require the consent of both parents, but a public ceremony and at least two witnesses are necessary. Other things, such as the presence or absence of a presiding officiant, are not essential.

(2) Zhou Da asks: I have a girlfriend, and our feelings have reached a solid and unbreakable level. However, she is a widow who has been married for four months and lost her husband, and she is in an old-fashioned family in the countryside. I have a few difficulties. Please teach me: (1) Has the marital relationship been extinguished with the loss for two years, or is it still continuing? (2) Is it illegal to marry someone without removing the Gengtie (marriage horoscope)? Can the parents-in-law use this as an excuse to interfere? (3) In the countryside, it is customary for widows to remarry to pay a Gengtie removal fee. Is this fee normal? (4) What steps are most legal and simple?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin replies] (1) Her husband's death extinguishes the marital relationship. It has been more than six months, and in accordance with Article 987 of the Civil Code, remarriage is not contrary to the rules. (2) If the woman is over 20 years of age and marries someone, the parents-in-law may not interfere. Whether or not the Gengtie is removed is irrelevant. (3) The Gengtie removal fee cannot be considered legitimate. (4) If you marry her, there must be a public ceremony and at least two witnesses.

(3) Ling asks: I married a woman in Huile Village in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), and it has been five years since then. Our feelings have been very good, and we have a son and a daughter. However, unexpectedly, after returning to Shanghai from the countryside after the victory [of the war], her attitude suddenly changed. She often stays out all night, not thinking about the family with a husband and children. I have repeatedly advised her, but she does not listen. She even made her own decisions and secretly went back to her original profession when I was not in Shanghai. Now that I have discovered this, she has instead proposed a divorce. I have always treated her well, and her mother and sisters are supported by me. She is only over twenty years old this year, and someone must be instigating her behind her back or enticing her. I ask whether the madam of the brothel has suspicion of inducement? For the sake of my reputation, I do not want her to engage in this shameless profession again, so as not to hinder my future. If she still does not listen to my advice, I plan to send her to the Jiliang Institute (a reformatory) for reformation, or what should I do? Please advise.

[Fu Kuang replies] If the woman is not your formal spouse but only a family member, and has already reached the age of twenty, the madam of the brothel does not constitute the crime of inducement. If it is for the sake of your reputation, you can only give up your past feelings and break off relations with her.

Spring and Autumn

### Hero (Novel)

— Zhang Qiqu

Ever since the Yellow River became the forefront of national defense, the common people on the north bank have been like the unfortunate ones excluded from the restricted area during the winter defense period. Their lives and properties seemed to be hanging at the crossroads, completely losing their guarantee. Although there were still troops, police chiefs, and various institutions and personnel that a county in a precarious situation should have in some mountain villages on the southern slope of Zhongtiao Mountain, those people were as pitiful as those common people, worrying all day and night.

However, great adversity can precisely invigorate a nation. Often, in extremely harsh environments, ideal flowers will bloom. This group of people, like islanders in an isolated county overseas, have formed a close cooperation between the military and the people for their own safety, better than in other war zones.

Not for the sake of winning medals, nor for seeking government praise. But for themselves, for their own homeland, everyone is doing their best to defend against enemy invasion, and even wants to find ways to eliminate the enemy's threat. As long as there is an opportunity, every common person is willing to go to the front line and kill a few devils. But where are the devils? They are hiding in airplanes equipped with steel armor, flying high in the sky, showing off their power. They can act wildly in the sky above the Yellow River's banks, which lacks air defense equipment. Bombs, machine guns, they can hit me, but I have no way to hit them.

Devils, devils! Just being sneaky like this, using superior weapons to attack defenseless common people. This kind of behavior can hardly be considered heroic!

Fan Zengguo is a young farmer from Jinshatan in Pinglu County, southern Shanxi Province. He grew up by the river and works in the fields at the foot of Zhongtiao Mountain. He always advocates being fair and upright, holding the principle of "I will not attack unless attacked." What he sees and what he gets close to are also a group of honest and straightforward farmers. He is deeply disgusted with the brutal invasion of the devils, and especially indignant at the devils' unfair tactics.

"One day, may heaven open its eyes and make one of them fall down! I will personally capture that pilot and bite him three times!" When he squats in the mountain gully to avoid the air raid alert, he often looks at the enemy planes flying high and low everywhere in the sky, vowing fiercely. But heaven just doesn't open its eyes, and not a single one has ever fallen. Even when flying low, they have never been caught by the treetops or telephone poles. It's really hateful!

"Hey! Old Li! That plane just now flew so low, why didn't you give it a shot?"

Fan Zengguo asked Li Mingxing, a private first class in the sixth company of the second battalion of the security regiment, who was serving as a lookout post twenty yards away, angrily.

Li Mingxing snorted and said:

"You think it's low, but you didn't see how fast it was flying! If rifles could hit it, people would have shot it down long ago."

"It's good to scare it a bit! Otherwise, it will come even lower tomorrow, and its wings will almost touch your hat!"

That's right! Even if you can't hit it, it's good to give it a warning and vent your frustration.

The next day afternoon, the air raid alert came again! Five planes, rumbling and roaring! They flew around the mountains and valleys like five bald-headed eagles.

"Old Li! Do it! That gray-white one is the lowest. When it flies over again, give it a 'health pill' to taste."

"Okay!" Li Mingxing, lying on the opposite hill, gently climbed up a little more, leaned against a tree stump, put the rifle butt on his chest, and pointed the muzzle at the sky.

"Bang!"

The plane kept flying, obviously not hit.

"Bang! Bang!" Shots were also fired from other places.

"Gak gak gak gak!" The machine gun on the plane fired. What a disaster! Quickly hide in the cave.

After a while, the sound of the planes gradually faded away. Fan Zengguo crawled out of the cave and looked around, suddenly seeing an airplane parked on Jinshatan.

"Haha! It really hit!" He couldn't help but shout, and rushed down the hill, heading straight for Jinshatan.

What was parked on the beach was indeed a Mitsubishi attack aircraft. The number was 306. The pilot, Second Lieutenant Yamada Kiyoshi, and Sergeant Major Omori Kiyozō were anxiously inspecting the engine. There was nothing wrong with the engine, and the fuel tank was not leaking, but half of the propeller was missing. What to do? Yamada Kiyoshi stomped his feet impatiently, while Omori Kiyozō still wanted to try to take off.

"It's no use! It's no use! Don't waste your time! Hurry up and unload the machine gun! If the Chinese surround us in a moment, we're all done for!" Yamada Kiyoshi said while putting the map in his pocket.

"What about this plane? If the Chinese get it and replace the propeller, it's still a good plane!" Omori Kiyozō wrung his hands, almost wanting to cry.

"Stop nagging! Buddy! Escaping is the priority! I'm leaving first! Straight north, over Zhongtiao Mountain and we'll be saved!" Yamada Kiyoshi said and rushed up the hill with his pistol in hand. He happened to meet Fan Zengguo coming down from the hill. But Fan Zengguo had already seen that the devil was carrying a weapon in his hand, and if he went up to meet him, he would surely be shot. So he flashed to the side of the road, not letting him see him. Yamada Kiyoshi was neither familiar with the road nor in a panic, just wanting to get to the mountain and find a hidden place to hide. But unexpectedly, he met Guan Yu on Huarong Road. Suddenly, from behind, he grabbed him around the waist and embraced him tightly, while starting to shout loudly:

"Catch the bandit! Everyone come and catch the thief!"

Yamada Kiyoshi was already terrified, as if in a tiger's mouth. Unexpectedly, at the end of his rope, he encountered an ambush. Thinking he was more dead than alive, he didn't want to return alive. Suddenly, he heard the person who had captured him still howling like a wolf. Although this cry sounded terrifying, it also proved that the other party was a common person with no combat experience, no companions, and no weapons. So he rekindled his one in a million hope, and began to struggle, trying to get his pistol, but the pistol was held by Fan Zengguo. No matter how desperately Yamada Kiyoshi struggled like a flood dragon, Fan Zengguo only remembered the lesson that it is easy to let a tiger out but difficult to catch it again, so no matter what, he had to use his original strength to fight him. And Yamada Kiyoshi? He was holding on to his last hope, using all his strength, wanting to break free from the other's grasp.

The two men twisted and fought on the hillside. The cries spread to Jinshatan, and Omori Kiyozō also saw it. He saw that his superior was already in the mouth of the tiger, so he couldn't care less about dismantling the machine gun, wanting to come and save him. But he was unwilling to give the plane, which could be used with a little repair, to his enemy. So, just as he was about to run to save Yamada Kiyoshi, he took out his pistol and fired a volley at the fuel tank. Gasoline ignited, and the plane burst into flames. Then he ran up the hill to save Yamada Kiyoshi.

At that time, Li Mingxing and other common people also discovered Fan Zengguo's scene of capturing a tiger barehanded in the mountain gully, and wanted to come and help him. But there was a ditch in between, and they couldn't get close for a while. Instead, Omori Kiyozō arrived first, walking behind Fan Zengguo, pointing his pistol at the back of his head, intending to end his life with one shot. But when he pulled the trigger, it didn't fire! He pulled it again, and it still didn't fire. Looking closely, the chamber was empty, because this fool had fired all the bullets into the plane's fuel tank.

Li Mingxing saw that the other party had help, and thought that Fan Zengguo would suffer, so he rushed to climb over the hill even more urgently. Unexpectedly, just at this time, the four planes that had just gone back flew back, rumbling and flying back and forth along the Yellow River - obviously looking for their companions. Omori Kiyozō waved his hand and shouted desperately, but those four stupid birds circled twice and didn't find the three of them fighting in the mountain gully. They only saw the blazing fire on Jinshatan, thinking that they had heroically sacrificed themselves, so they turned around and flew northwest.

When Omori Kiyozō saw that the rescuers had gone far away, and Li Mingxing was about to arrive, he had to intensify his attack on Fan Zengguo. He didn't have time to reload his pistol, so he could only hit Fan Zengguo's head with the pistol butt. The iron rod hit flesh and blood, making a hole with each blow, and a burst of blood spurted out. Pain! Needless to say, it was definitely painful. But the more it hurt, the less he could let go, like welding firmly together, the tighter the grip became.

At this time, Li Mingxing also arrived. The sentries on other hills, the village chiefs, the county magistrate, the company commander, and the adjutant, all arrived one after another. Omori Kiyozō saw that the situation was not right, so he had to abandon Fan Zengguo and Yamada Kiyoshi and escape alone, because there were enemies on three sides, he could only escape to the Yellow River. Did he want to swim across the river? No! He didn't think or plan at all, just instinctively wanted to escape. Like a cat, he blindly ran away.

The Yellow River became more turbulent in the middle reaches, and it was difficult to lift his feet in the mud and sand. It symbolized his fate, and the future was hopeless. However, Omori Kiyozō was still struggling to move forward in the hopeless river.

"Bang!" A patrol officer shot him in the calf. This stopped his delusions.

Over here, Yamada Kiyoshi was also rescued from Fan Zengguo's grasp by Li Mingxing.

The county magistrate directed the police to tie up these two prisoners who had fallen from the sky with ropes, and Fan Zengguo, supported by two policemen, went to the city together.

The city gate was crowded with women watching the fun. Everyone wanted to see Fan Zengguo. Fan Zengguo became the Wu Song in the drama. However, Wu Song fought a tiger, and Fan Zengguo captured two wolves. The wolves hung their heads and followed behind. Fan Zengguo's head was still dripping with bright blood.

"Hero!"

The county magistrate gave a thumbs up and praised the common people watching the fun triumphantly. The common people also nodded in approval:

"Good lad! True hero!"

### Dreaming of Hometown

— Fei Cun

Last night I dreamt of my hometown. It was still that tall Pine Mountain. Several white sheep were grazing in the green woods; on the path from the village, the cool and peaceful Earth God and Earth Goddess were smiling at the farmers resting their feet. How much emotion must there be in that smile: "The young grow strong, and the strong grow old, and what about the old?" Beside the road was a mulberry field. From the gaps in the mulberry trees, one could vaguely see the lively stream carrying small boats and bamboo rafts. Look! Under the sun, the dazzling silver color of honey-colored fish splashing and turning over! On the opposite bank of the river was a golden beach. Who was that girl squatting by the pier under the bridge, washing rice and clothes? Be careful of the naughty children throwing stones next to you, causing a "thump" and splashing water that wets your black pants and white short shirt. At the end of the beach was another vast mulberry field, behind which faintly floated the smoke from the kitchen chimneys. That was the hometown of the washing girls, the hometown of the naughty children, my hometown!

It was so intimate, yet it seemed so distant. When I timidly stepped into his arms, none of the people coming and going were familiar to me. It was only a separation of six or seven years! It wasn't like a young child leaving home and growing old far away! I rushed with full enthusiasm into the house of Grandpa Cai Kang, whom I knew best. Here, I finally saw the people I knew well: Grandpa Cai Kang, Uncle Zhi, Aunt Yue Di... They were all there. I almost wanted to hug them and tell them how much I had thought of them in these past few years. Strangely, they were all cold, as if they had just seen me five minutes ago. I walked towards Grandpa Cai Kang and said, "Grandpa, I'm back." He looked at my long gown and said, "Didn't you get rich? Those of us from Zhang Village who go out all make a fortune!" I asked, "I heard that Grandma has passed away?" He grunted, "Didn't you become an official either? You study until you graduate from university and don't become an official?" Seeing my blushing face, he walked away biting his dry cigarette holder.

So I reached out to Uncle Zhi. I said, "Let's arm wrestle again, like we used to do when we were in elementary school." But he also looked at my long gown and said contemptuously, "What strength do you have besides moving your pen? Let me tell you, it's not the time when long gowns are omnipotent anymore. My fists and my hoes are the true creators of the new world." I turned my pleading gaze to Aunt Yue Di, hoping to get the gentle caress I had once received from her, but she was silently shedding tears.

"Yue Di, Feng Gu, why are you sad? Let me play the erhu again, and you sing a song again."

"Who has the time for that?" Yue Di glanced at me sideways: "Rice costs 60,000 yuan per stone, and mulberry leaves are also expensive. We Zhang Village people live off silk, but silk just can't be sold for money. It seems we can only starve to death, heh heh heh." Then she started crying, "heh heh heh".

I woke up with resentment, just as this metropolis was falling into a deep sleep. Even the last peddler carrying wontons had gone home to sleep, leaving behind darkness, silence, and nightmares. The night was like a boundless ocean. I felt my body floating up, floating up, drifting away, like a discarded, withered, yellow vegetable leaf.

### Night Walker

— Lan Yi

The night walker, bared his ankles, and forever strides into the world of darkness.

There is not a paper lantern in his hand, nor a relative behind him; the lonely figure forever allows only the feet that are bleeding to trample.

No one compels him, yet he wants to walk; no one orders him, yet he wants to walk. In his stomach-filled, yet resolute heart, forever gestates a hope: He wants to walk out of this world of darkness.

From this piece of mud, to that piece of mud! From this small bridge, to that small bridge! From this village to that village! From this provincial city to that provincial city! He has walked all over the world, and also knows the world; time steals past in his footsteps. How many eras have passed? He only knows that his once rosy cheeks have turned dry and ugly, fleeting hope has turned into arduous trouble, and how much fresh, youthful blood has congealed in the cold, hard earth.

He recognizes: This world is dark, is selfish, is self-abandoning; just like this moonless and starless night. But he has to keep walking forward, even though the darkness in front of him is crossed by a river, a high mountain, but he has to walk, he has to walk out of this world of darkness.

He knows that darkness will eventually end, and the future has unlimited light. Courageously, he will definitely walk out of this world of darkness.

He is familiar with: everything in this darkness. The night owl in the forest is a harsh poet, he cries out the most sorrowful moans of mankind; the firefly by the pond is the most hopeful beacon, it strengthens the night walker's resolute will; the yellow dog in the village is the most snobbish villain, he portrays the powerful people who are in power in this world; the fleeting shooting star in the sky is the epitome of life, it awakens those who are wallowing in their dreams; and the shocking storm in the darkness is the most terrifying original form of this world.

But he still walks, using the footsteps of his own reason, towards the darkness. Oh, night walker, be even more courageous! Let us gather now, holding hands in the dawn's light, and let us each walk alone into the darkness.

### Crossing the River

### I Miss Shanghai

— Zhong Yuan

Lately, I often miss Shanghai. It has been eight years since I was taken from Rue Luber to the North Railway Station in a Yunfei car. After passing through layers of difficulties and batches of inspections, I boarded a crowded train under the gun butts and iron rods of Japanese soldiers. Then, the towering foreign buildings, the smooth asphalt roads, the tram tracks winding like snakes... all disappeared before my eyes.

I remember that when I was in Shanghai, I deeply hated Shanghai. I hated that pigeon-cage-like room, which couldn't see the sun or feel the cool breeze. All year round, there were only countless bedbugs breeding without limit, sucking people's marrow and blood.

But I also deeply loved Shanghai. I loved the quiet Avenue Joffre. I loved the fountain in the French Park, and the purple little flowers next to the fountain. I liked standing alone under the street lamps at dusk, watching the many Shanghai ladies dressed in gorgeous and alluring clothes. I didn't envy them, nor did I curse them, just silently watched them.

In Shanghai, I paid attention to the tycoons sitting in black-licensed cars, with their big bellies, gold chains, and diamond rings. I also paid attention to the paupers shrinking in the small alleys, who were as skinny as firewood and covered in sores. Then I remembered the story of the rich man and Lazarus in the Bible. I didn't congratulate the tycoons, nor did I sigh for the paupers. I knew that in a blink of an eye, the world would turn upside down, Shanghai would turn upside down, and both the tycoons and the paupers would turn upside down.

Shanghai, like a small ladder, had once carried me to the entrance of heaven; it was also like a terrible ghost car that pushed me to the edge of hell. However, I had neither the fortune to enter the hall nor the courage to descend into hell. I could only quietly leave with a tired body.

I left on November 26, 1938. It was raining. I thought to myself: Maybe I won't come to this place again in the future.

But I myself don't understand, lately, I suddenly often miss Shanghai, it seems there is a bit of attachment, a bit of melancholy, and a bit of indescribable contradictory emotions.

Night

Seeps through

The fine yarn on the window

Wind

Sways

The flame on the lamp

Beside the white sickbed

Clutching a silver spoon

Dressed in plain clothes

——The sound of rain on the banana leaves is soft

A low whisper

Across the gauze curtain

"Do you need anything else?"

### Flying Together (61)

— Zhao Qingge

"Xiao Hong! Xiao Hong! What's wrong?" Bao Ling shouted in a panic, while hurriedly helping her up.

Oh my god! The flesh that had already been frozen and starved could not suddenly come into contact with hot things. Now, Xiao Hong's two feet, all ten toes, were like they had been cut by a knife, dislocated from the joints, and falling off! A basin of water immediately turned into a basin of blood!

Bao Ling initially thought that Xiao Hong fainted because she was too angry, but when she saw that her two feet had become like this, she was simply flustered. She wanted to carry her out, but was afraid that the landlady would say even more gossip. She herself couldn't leave and had no way out, so she had to shout:

"Liao Landlady! Liao Landlady!"

After shouting for a while without any response, Bao Ling strained her voice and shouted loudly:

"Help! Help!"

With that, Liao Landlord came, the old landlady came, and Liao Dong also came. Xiao Hong had already woken up!

"What's going on?" Liao Landlord asked Bao Ling in surprise when he saw the scene.

"Xiao Hong's feet were frostbitten. She thought she could wash them with hot water to warm them up a bit, but who knew that as soon as she put them in the basin, they became like this." Bao Ling said, giving the landlady a fierce look.

"Strange, she was fine just now! I'm afraid the water was too hot and burned her, right?" The landlady said, pretending to be concerned, wanting to push the responsibility onto Bao Ling.

"Who has ever seen frostbite like this? Frozen flesh and blood cannot be roasted with fire or scalded with water!" Liao Landlord scratched his head anxiously.

"She in the afternoon--" Bao Ling hadn't finished speaking.

"She didn't do anything in the afternoon!" The landlady hurriedly interrupted Bao Ling's words, feigning surprise and saying, "It's really strange, how could she get frostbite like this? Although the weather is cold, it's always better indoors than outdoors!"

"Yes! Only outdoors can you get frostbite like this." Bao Ling deliberately repeated a sentence.

Xiao Hong heard all their words. She also didn't want to tell the truth, to make Liao Landlord and the landlady angry. It was even more inconvenient for her to defend Bao Ling. It wasn't his fault. She moaned in pain, her face becoming even paler, her heart so weak that it almost stopped beating.

"Quickly carry her to the bed in the room and let her lie down!" Liao Landlord said to the landlady. At the same time, he instructed Liao Dong: "Dong'er, go ask Master Li to weigh two taels of rice and cook some soup for her to drink. And bring a bottle of 'Yunnan Baiyao' to apply to her first."
