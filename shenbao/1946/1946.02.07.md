### Resuming Traffic Still Under Negotiation, Road Repair Work Awaits Commencement, North China Expected to Reopen to Traffic Within Three Months

(Special Dispatch from Beiping, February 6th) Regarding the issue of restoring transportation, the two sides' opinions remain far apart. However, with the success of the negotiation conference, this localized problem is unlikely to escalate into a completely irresolvable serious situation. It is understood that the government believes that transportation must maintain the traditional unity of the past and not be fragmented, while the CCP insists on its principles of railway neutralization and democratization, and puts forward specific requirements: (1) The CCP should send troops to participate in the management of railways north of the Yellow River and increase the number of railway police. (2) The CCP shall manage the railways in the CCP-controlled areas by itself. There is no sign of convergence between these vastly different views. It is said that the American personnel have indicated that the CCP should withdraw its demands. Ye Jianying originally planned to return to Yan'an for instructions, but due to the need to discuss a general outline for the transportation issue, the plan has been temporarily postponed. According to sources in the transportation sector, all routes have been calm this past week, with only minor damage to the Longhai and Tongpu lines. The repair teams and work crews dispatched from Beiping have arrived at the starting points of each line to be repaired, such as Yuanshi, Botou, and Qinglongqiao. However, the Communist army has not yet approved the start of construction, citing that no orders have been received. The special commissioner of the Ministry of Transportation in North China will fly with American expert Hill on the Jinpu Line on the 6th to inspect the damage along various sections from low altitude, in preparation for the restoration. It is heard that the government's estimated cost for repairing the railways in North China is about 10 billion, and the required rails are planned to be temporarily diverted from the rails of the Shide Road, the Qiancun section, and the sidings between Shanhai Pass and Huanggu Tun on the Beining line.

(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, February 6th) The eagerly awaited issue of restoring transportation throughout the country is impossible to begin immediately because the side issues that arose during the armistice agreements in various regions have not yet been resolved. According to a guest from the northern section of the Jinpu Railway today, the engineering and repair teams that had already arrived at their designated locations received a notice from the Communist army four days ago to postpone road repairs. Before the gradual realization of ceasefire and road restoration, the Communist army's military deployments must be completed in another posture. The Communist army is currently making major adjustments, and once its adjustments are completed, the road restoration issue can be agreed upon and proceed smoothly. Let us wait and see.

(Special Dispatch from Nanjing, February 6th) News from the transportation sector: After a long period of destruction, the loss of steel rails on major railways has reached nearly 600 kilometers, and the loss of sleepers is estimated at about 1.2 million. The repair of steel rails is being carried out as an emergency measure, dismantling and diverting rails from various branch lines and minor tracks for repair, but this can only barely make up 500 kilometers, and the remaining amount will require a great deal of thought. Sleepers are currently being purchased from various provinces. It is heard that a large number of steel rails are still hidden in the Taihang Mountains, which were transported by carrying them 30 li per day in the past. If they have not been moved for other purposes, returning them in good faith and carrying them down the mountain will undoubtedly take a considerable amount of time. The person who spoke of this was a young engineer bearing the heavy responsibility of road repair, and tears welled up in his eyes before he could finish speaking.

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, February 6th) Transportation Vice Minister Ling Hongxun stated that the provincial governments are very enthusiastic about purchasing sleepers and collecting civilian labor for road repairs. All routes have prepared restoration plans, and the first batch of repair funds has also been distributed. The engineering and repair teams organized by each route have already arrived at the locations to be repaired, but after repeated negotiations, work has not yet begun. The executive groups of the Executive Headquarters are currently traveling back and forth between the North and South, and it is hoped that results will be achieved soon, so that the various routes in North China can be repaired and open to traffic in two or three months.

The Executive Department group in the area has temporarily ordered the number of security team members to remain at the level of January 23rd and for any subsequent increases to be withdrawn immediately. It is hoped that both sides will remove their guards so that the people know that peace has truly arrived. According to the group's report, the local security team is reorganized from the 67th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade, the 14th Regiment of the 26th Brigade, and the 66th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the Communist Army.

### China is No Longer in the "Queue Era"

— Xu Zhongpei

(Special Dispatch from London) Recently, a pictorial magazine called Sphere in Britain published a large-format pictorial article about the return of the Chinese army to Nanjing. The picture fully expresses the excitement of the people, with men and women cheering on the streets. However, every man in the picture has a long queue trailing behind him.

To this day, foreigners' understanding of China is still stuck in the "queue era." Some foreign old ladies ask rapid-fire questions that are often impossible to answer. Do your parents still sell their daughters? Do couples still marry without knowing each other? Do women still bind their feet? In fact, I myself can refute all these questions. However, the deeply ingrained ideas of thousands of years cannot immediately give way to the changes that have occurred in the past thirty years. My appearance cannot answer their questions, so they feel bewildered.

In general, foreigners know that the Chinese man is Chairman Chiang and the woman is Madame Chiang. The remaining 450 million are all good-hearted farmers struggling under natural and man-made disasters in Pearl S. Buck's novels. The French address women, whether married or not, as Madame. At the International Women's Conference in Paris last December, we had a representative named Jiang sitting on the podium. An old Finnish lady next to me pointed and told me that she knew Madame Chiang had two sisters. I shook my head and said that we had just met and I didn't know her family situation. She widened her eyes and said, "You don't even know Madame Chiang's family history?" Chiang and Jiang are spelled the same in English, so she was convinced that the person sitting on the stage was Madame Chiang and paid her respects to me for a long time. In order to avoid misunderstanding, I obediently brought out the surname I never used, and the next day I transformed into Madame Lu.

As far as foreigners know, Chinese women are oppressed by men and confined to the kitchen. They vaguely remember that Empress Dowager Cixi once appeared on the late Qing political stage. Another shadow of a Chinese woman is Wang Baochuan—the Wang Baochuan on the British stage in Hsiung Shih-i's play. Thanks to Mrs. Cripps, whose China Aid Association recently printed a booklet called "Chinese Women," preparing to introduce Chinese heroines to Britain. In that booklet, the famous Mr. Lü Fengzi became the representative of Chinese female painters, with a photo attached. His name and his artistic style of long hair caused him to transform from a male painter to a female painter in Britain.

China is a large and resource-rich country, which is generally known to the world, but few people know to what extent it is large and abundant. A female clerk at the telegraph office, holding the telegram I sent to Nanjing, didn't know where Nanjing was. When I told her that Nanjing was the capital of China, she insisted that only Chongqing was the capital of China, as if she knew more about Chinese geography than I did.

When foreigners print maps of China, they like to put the titles China, Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Manchuria on them, so everyone has a false impression that Tibet, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Northeast are all self-contained entities. One foreigner was surprised to hear that the Northeast dialect is much closer to Mandarin than Cantonese. For ten years, he had always thought that the Northeast had some strange language and writing of its own.

The famous Chinese products known to foreigners are porcelain, tea (but they still don't know that Chinese people don't add sugar or milk when drinking tea), and embroidery. They can't appreciate Chinese calligraphy and painting. They think that Chinese people always paint when they pick up a brush, not write. Therefore, after the San Francisco conference, when Chinese representatives signed their names with a brush, all the London newspapers reported that the Chinese representatives painted their names in ancient Chinese characters, as if they had signed their names in Great Seal Script or Lesser Seal Script.

Ye Gongchao, the representative of the Ministry of Propaganda stationed in Britain, had a ruyi (a ceremonial scepter) that his ancestor Ye Mingchen had been given by the emperor repaired. After the repair was completed, the shopkeeper very politely said, "Dr. Yeh, here is your walking stick."

This series of comical facts are all caused by misunderstandings due to differences in Eastern and Western languages, writing systems, and customs. To eliminate these misunderstandings, we must understand each other. To understand each other, we must provide accurate information for people to understand us. In the Burma campaign, everyone was vying for credit. In Hollywood's "Battle of Burma," Errol Flynn appeared as an American hero, obliterating the British. Britain banned the film from meeting British audiences and rushed to produce "The Great Victory in Burma" with the British army as the center. Our Chinese Expeditionary Force once saved 5,000 besieged British troops and fought desperately in the wilderness of northern Burma, but they remained unknown.

R.H. Scott, the former Far East representative of the British intelligence department, wrote an article praising the Chinese in Malaya after returning from a prisoner-of-war camp in Singapore. They helped the British pass information, transport food, and made great contributions. However, in the international arena, if it hadn't been for Scott's quick pen, they would still be unsung heroes.

We want people to understand our culture, our politics, our society, and our lives. When East and West meet, we shouldn't just teach the West to come over, but the East should also go to meet them. Our victories in the war, except for the Battle of Taierzhuang, were all unknown. Some foreigners have never even heard of the Three Victories of Changsha.

Some foreign newspapers and foreigners believe that the Chinese Communist Party has a way to improve Chinese agricultural society because they advocate rent reduction and advocate dividing land to tenant farmers. The government's rent reduction policy, the policy of supporting tenant farmers and the principle of "land to the tiller" in the Three Principles of the People, are almost unknown to foreigners. Foreigners are even more confused by the political tutelage currently implemented by the Kuomintang. What exactly is political tutelage!

Yes, we need explanatory information for reference on policies, decrees, and construction. How can we blame people for misunderstanding, how can we blame people for misinterpreting—when we ourselves remain silent?

Westerners are truly eager to understand the East, absorbing all information about the East, even if it is wrong. Why don't we stand up and express ourselves! We cannot allow a few unscrupulous overseas Chinese to represent China, we cannot allow the so-called China problem experts who treat China as a semi-colony to mislead public opinion in their countries, we cannot allow some foreign correspondents stationed in China to telegraph back home and think it strange that Chinese generals working in Shanghai don't understand English. No, we cannot let all this continue.

Understanding between countries can eliminate war. Small misunderstandings can reflect large misunderstandings. The Times still calls Wang Buwei Dr. Shih Chieh, and still places Gui Sui in Rehe Province. There are too many places where we need to speak up!

Why don't we speak up? Why do we speak up so little? So cautiously? So hesitantly? Why do we let distorted interpretations exist abroad? Implicit reservation is not a way to express oneself. In the international arena, silence does not seem to be the best language. (Posted on January 20th)

### The Issue of the Soviet Withdrawal from the Northeast, Both Sides Are Currently Negotiating, Minister Wu Replied to Reporter Inquiries Yesterday

(United Press, Chongqing, February 6th) Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen replied to reporters today that China is currently negotiating with the Soviet Union regarding the issue of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast. The deadline for the completion of the withdrawal is stipulated as February 1st. The Soviet Union has not formally requested an extension, and China has not requested an extension either. The Soviet army's delay in withdrawing is probably due to transportation difficulties.

(United Press, Beiping, February 6th) Articles published in two Beiping newspapers today indicate that the Soviet army may not be able to complete its withdrawal from the Northeast before spring. "The World Daily" reported that the contracts signed by coal merchants and food wholesalers in the Northeast with the Soviet army, which were due to expire at the end of January, have been renewed until the end of May. This indicates that the Soviet plan does not intend to implement the withdrawal from the Northeast in the next four months.

### US House Naval Committee Passes Bill to Help China Build its Navy, Transferring Warships and Sending an Advisory Group to China

(Central News Agency, Washington, February 5th) The U.S. House Naval Committee today unanimously passed the government's proposal to supply China with warships and a naval advisory group. The committee also approved two amendments, allowing the President to be authorized by Congress to supply China with any surplus battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers (excluding escort destroyers) or submarines. The committee also authorized the President to transfer to China the materials needed to operate and maintain the aforementioned ships and train the personnel on board, including ammunition, parts, machinery in repair shops, and all items necessary to maintain and operate these ships. Naval Committee Chairman Vinson hopes that the committee's final recommendation will be quickly approved by the House in the next few days. The ships in this recommendation are divided into three categories: (1) Battleships and other ships that require authorization from Congress for transfer. (2) Naval small ships, floating docks, etc., that do not require authorization from Congress for transfer. (3) Materials necessary for maintaining various ships. The second part of the recommendation, sending a naval advisory group, will stay in our country for five years. In the initial stage, the United States, according to the contract, will have 100 naval officers and 200 enlisted naval soldiers. It is said that the U.S. Navy is vigorously advocating aiding the Chinese Navy with ships and advisors. Rear Admiral Cardner, representing Fleet Admiral Nimitz, Chief of Naval Operations, stated that the aid to China with ships and advisors is in full compliance with President Truman's statement on U.S. policy toward China, in which the President stated, "As China moves toward the path of peaceful nations, the United States is prepared to assist in building its military system, which can fulfill China's responsibility to maintain peace and order for its own country and for the international community." Cardner said that training Chinese naval personnel and providing them with landing craft will enable China to assist in removing the Japanese from the Asian continent. The government's proposal to assist China with ships and advisors was first initiated by Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, approved by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and revised by House Naval Committee Chairman Vinson. The Vinson bill passed yesterday did not mention the word "surplus," so the Naval Committee revised the wording of the bill today, stipulating that most of the ships transferred to China must be surplus ships.

(US News Service, Washington, February 6th) The U.S. House Naval Committee unanimously passed a resolution on the 5th, authorizing the President to transfer surplus naval warships to China. The purpose of the resolution is to assist the Republic of China in expanding and maintaining its naval establishment and for other uses. After the bill is passed by the House Naval Committee, it will be voted on by the entire House of Representatives. If it is passed, it will be submitted to the Senate. If it is passed by both houses of Congress, the bill will be sent to the President for signature before it takes effect.

### US Military Advisory Group to be Established in May or June

(Central News Agency, this city) Amidst the start of the U.S. military's demobilization in China, the U.S. military advisory group, which is expected to be established soon, is gradually showing signs of its organizational structure. Although the U.S. military department has not officially announced the advisors who will help us train the army, navy, and air force, it is learned that General Wedemeyer will serve as the temporary leader, with General McClure, the former commander of the U.S. combat command, responsible for the army, and General Randall, the current commander of the U.S. military in Chongqing, responsible for the air force. The people in charge of the navy and air force are currently in China. General McClure returned to the U.S. last year to report for duty and may arrive in China soon. According to U.S. official sources, the U.S. military advisory group will be formally established around May or June of this year. The staff of this group will be U.S. military personnel who volunteer to participate.

### CCP to Hold Central Committee Meeting to Discuss Demobilization and Other Issues; Communist Army to be Reduced to Twenty Divisions by April

[United Press, Yan'an, 6th] A CCP spokesperson announced today that the party will hold a plenary session of the Central Committee at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to discuss the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. In addition to party affairs issues such as relocating the party headquarters to a location closer to the central government and expanding party membership, the Central Committee plenary session will also discuss three urgent issues: (1) the restoration of transportation in the liberated areas, (2) the demobilization of the Communist army, and (3) relief and rehabilitation. The Central Committee will also decide whether to convene a National Party Congress to discuss recent events within and outside the party. The three main issues have already begun to be resolved. The restoration of transportation is currently being handled by the Peiping Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, but the CCP still has some reservations, including its demand to participate in the railway management and railway police authority in North China. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army will be reduced to twenty divisions within four months in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the surplus troops will be converted into militia and local security forces. The Political Department and all military-related activities of the CCP will be abolished. Relief and rehabilitation work is most difficult due to the extreme poverty in the border areas and requires external assistance. It is reported that UNRRA will transport 1,000 tons of relief goods and 500 trucks to Yantai within days. After the implementation of democracy throughout the country, the border area governments will be abolished, and new provincial governments will be organized in accordance with the new constitution. Regarding the expansion of party membership, the CCP plans to lower the qualifications for joining the party in order to absorb new members. The party headquarters will be moved to the capital, and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong and other CCP leaders will move to Nanjing for a long stay, but these matters have not yet been decided. The Central Committee is the highest organ of the CCP, with a total of forty-four members and thirty-three alternate members. It elects ten people to form the Political Bureau, which exercises its functions during the recess of the Central Committee. The last plenary session of the Central Committee was held in mid-April of last year.

### Representatives of Various Countries Await New Instructions; Greek Issue Stalled; Security Council Repeatedly Postponing Meetings; British Cabinet Convened a Special Meeting Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] London, 6th Broadcast reports: The Security Council, originally scheduled to meet this afternoon, has been postponed to 9:00 PM tonight (i.e., 5:00 AM on the 7th in Shanghai). The representatives are all awaiting new instructions from their governments. These new instructions are extremely important. Whether the Security Council will take action on the issue of British troops stationed in Greece depends entirely on these new instructions. At the same time, the representatives of the five great powers are also holding secret talks. British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Soviet Representative Vyshinsky this afternoon.

[Our Newspaper] London, 6th Broadcast reports: British officials have stated that British troops stationed in Greece will withdraw in early or mid-March. Local officials disagree with Soviet Representative Vyshinsky's claim that the presence of British troops in Greece endangers world peace. It is said that the British troops will definitely withdraw from Greece, without any doubt.

[Our Newspaper] London, 6th Broadcast: The Soviet Ambassador to Greece requested to meet with the Greek Prime Minister today. In addition, the British Cabinet convened a special meeting today to discuss the Greek issue.

[United Press, London, 5th] The five great powers held secret meetings regarding the Anglo-Soviet dispute over Greece, and after lengthy discussions, no solution was reached. The United Nations Security Council suddenly announced a postponement of the meeting today. French Foreign Minister Bidault stated that "a solution is very close."

### Unprecedented Global Food Crisis in Modern History; Director-General of UNRRA Issues Appeal; US President Convenes Cabinet Meeting to Discuss Relief Measures

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Reuters] The Director-General of UNRRA, Lehman, reported in writing this evening on the dangerous situation caused by the acute shortage of wheat and other food grains in various recovered countries. According to him, this is the greatest crisis facing the allied countries since the end of the war. The number of men, women, and children suffering from famine in Europe and the Far East this winter exceeds that of any period in modern history. Lehman also stated that UNRRA's total requirement for food grains in January was 700,000 tons, but only 40,000 tons were shipped. Judging from the current situation, the amount may be even smaller in February. Lehman also said that he will continue to consult with the authorities in the United States, Canada, and Australia on this matter. According to the United States Information Agency, Washington, 5th, Lehman stated that the countries assisted by UNRRA that need grain relief can be divided into three groups: (1) Albania, Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, whose need for grain is extremely urgent because the drought in the Mediterranean region has only produced half of the normal harvest in the past season. (2) China can only be supplied with a small amount of rice by the supplying countries, thus further increasing the need for wheat. (3) Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland have been disappointed in production in the past year due to the war's effects, fertilizer shortages, and lack of agricultural implements. Lehman said, "I have informed the governments of all the awaiting assistance countries of the situation and asked them to do everything possible to utilize their imported and domestically produced grain resources to ensure that the limited relief grains can be shared equally."

### Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong Announces Major Problems Facing the Ministry of Education: How to Coordinate Students in the Interior and Students in the Recovered Areas

The current situation of Nanjing Provisional University urgently needs to be improved. Vice Minister Zhu deeply felt that China's education and science are currently lagging behind, and said that more efforts are needed.

### Basketball League Last Night, Liangxi Greatly Invigorated, Shantou Overcomes Strong Enemy

The Bao Gou V-Team also has a solid strength basketball league. Yesterday, the game was originally not very tense, but unexpectedly, the two games in Divisions A1 and A2 were fiercely contested. Liangxi narrowly beat the Shantou team, and Desheng also narrowly won the V-Team in a very dangerous situation. In the women's group, the V-Team easily defeated Qianghua. The simple situation is described as follows:

In the women's group, the V-Team won the first quarter 10-4. The situation remained the same in the second quarter. The result was 17-10, with the V-Team taking the lead. In the third quarter, Qianghua didn't get anything, and the V-Team scored six points. In the last quarter, each scored two goals. The final result was 27-14, and the V-Team defeated Qianghua.

Following that, the general victory of the A2 Division, the V-Team, started a battle. After the start, Desheng took the lead all the way, once taking an absolute advantage with 17-6. Unexpectedly, the V-Team suddenly became active at this time. Chen Chengji and Zhu Mingxing were all accurate, and they won the first half with 23-20. In the second half, the V-Team was initially able to maintain the status quo, taking the lead with 31-24. Desheng had no choice but to call a timeout. As expected, they gained momentum. Tao Shaosheng and Zou Ziren were the most handy, and they finally defeated the V-Team with 39-35.

In the final game of Division A1, the Shantou team and the Liangxi team fought. At first, it was thought that the Shantou team could win, but Liangxi was very invigorated yesterday.

In addition, the game between Hualian and Jiangwan Air Force in Division A1 on Friday was postponed because the Jiangwan Air Force had another league and could not spare the time. The Basketball Federation allowed the postponement, so there will only be two games left on Friday.

### The Mission of Northwestern University

— Chen Fuhua

Northwestern University, which has a history of more than six years, was formerly known as Beijing Normal University and Beijing University. Although it was born for a short time, it has a very glorious tradition.

It is located in Chenggu, Shaanxi, and has cultivated many talents for the vast Northwest, promoted the development of education in the Northwest, and made Chenggu a cultural center.

The call for developing the Northwest had already resounded to the skies before the war. Today, at the beginning of the victory in the Anti-Japanese War and the establishment of the country, the importance of the Northwest has become even greater. How to consolidate the border defense? How to build the Northwest? This arduous mission undoubtedly needs Northwestern University to bear. Therefore, domestic intellectuals attach great importance to it and place great hopes on it.

President Liu Jihong

The current president, Liu Jihong, has a passion for education. He served as the president of Henan University for four years and achieved remarkable results. Since becoming the president of Northwestern University the year before last, he has hired more professors and expanded facilities, and has actively reorganized the school affairs, and everything has been renewed. His policy is to seek progress in stability, so that all aspects of the school can be improved day by day.

All major matters in the school are decided by the school affairs meeting. The meeting is presided over by the president, and the deans of each college, the heads of departments, and the representatives of the professors all attend and participate. At the meeting, everyone expresses their opinions freely, discusses them, and then implements them according to the plan without any changes.

Northwestern University attaches importance to administrative efficiency and pays great attention to the evaluation of staff. The office staff of each office work hard and on time, so the handling of all matters is very fast and accurate, and everything is in order.

Three Colleges in the Whole School

At present, the whole school is divided into three colleges of Liberal Arts, Science, Law and Commerce, including Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages, History, Border Politics, Education, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geology and Geography, Law, Political Science, Economics, and Commerce.

The departments of Chinese and Foreign Languages, Geology and Geography, and Law are further divided into groups such as English, Russian, Geology, Geography, Jurisprudence, and Justice, totaling seventeen departments and groups, and the scale is becoming larger and larger. This semester, Chinese, Russian, German, Japanese, Uyghur, and Tibetan will be added. In the future, after moving to Xi'an, it is also planned to add needed colleges and departments.

The teaching staff is quite complete. The professors of each department used to lecture at Normal University and Peking University, and their writings are rich and well-known at home and abroad. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they began to take refuge in the south. In recent years, new experts have been hired from all over the world. Among the current 100 professors in the school, more than half have served for ten years, and some have been teaching for more than 25 years. They have the spirit of being poor but happy, and they are dedicated to teaching. They can concentrate on teaching without easily moving. In the current situation of lack of teachers, it is really difficult to have such a foundation.

Tens of Thousands of Books

In terms of equipment, the old books and instruments of Normal University and Peking University were not brought out, which is very insufficient. However, in recent years, they have been continuously added from home and abroad, and they have been slightly replenished. There are currently tens of thousands of Chinese and Western books and magazines, and thousands of specimens, instruments and medicines. There is also a considerable quantity of items that have been ordered and are still on the way. In addition, there are more than 1,000 pieces of cultural relics from various provinces in the Northwest, including drawings of buildings of past dynasties, sketches of patterns, rubbings of inscriptions on steles and statues, photos of carvings, murals, historical sites and folk customs, and general antiques. They are rich in collection and valuable. Therefore, ordinary experiments and necessary references can be used slightly.

More than a Thousand Students

There are more than 1,000 students in the school, coming from 25 provinces and cities. Among them, the most are from Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong.

The research atmosphere is very strong: the library and periodical reading room are always full; professors often hold academic lectures, and the audience is enthusiastic and full; various academic societies and societies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and special issues are published on every anniversary, which are full of beautiful things.

The permanent school site has long been set as Xi'an, and the Ministry of Education has allocated the old site of Northeastern University for the school building, which is now actively preparing for the reception and repairs, and it has been decided to start moving north in early May. All the faculty and students feel excited and hope that after moving to Xi'an, all construction can be completed quickly according to the planned plan, and a new page will be opened in the history of education in the new China. (Sent from Chenggu on January 26, 1946)

### 240 Kilometers of Travel in the Snow: A Scene of Harbin: Compatriots in the Northeast Say: In the past fourteen years, it was like climbing a high mountain, and now we have finally climbed the last step: Central News Agency reporter Zhong Henian sent from Harbin

At 2:20 PM on December 26th, goose-feather snowflakes were flying in Changchun. A group of 27 people from the Harbin Municipal Government reception staff set off for Harbin by car. This is the first step in the reception work in northern Northeast China, and it should be considered a major event. In a hurry, the reporter left Changchun lightly and accompanied them on their journey.

Changchun to Harbin is 242 kilometers. The scenery along the line is naturally the most interesting object for people who have wanted to see it for fourteen years but have not been able to. Unfortunately, the curtain of night had already fallen on the 26th. On the entire Changchun-Harbin line, only a section of the road north of Changchun was seen. However, after six days, Zhang Jiaao returned from Harbin to Changchun, and the reporter returned south by car, saying goodbye to Harbin in the morning mist. This time, I not only saw the various scenes shrouded in the dark night sky last time, but also relived the wilderness seen last time in the south. Everywhere was a piece of white, and staring intently, everything, even a group of cattle and horses scattered on the snow, or a small tree far away on the horizon, felt particularly eye-catching.

### Looking at the Changchun-Harbin Line, We See the Japanese's Sinister Intentions

The villages are denser near the stations in the Harbin area. The food bags piled at the station can be seen at one station and then at another. The time when food was abundant is clearly displayed before our eyes. The "village" is certainly not as impressive and great as imagined, with roof tiles connected to the walls, but compared to the farmhouses seen at the stations in the Changchun area, which are sparse, low and simple, presenting a desolate scene, it is indeed much better. Northeasterners often say that when Japan ruled the Northeast, it wanted to make the north and south disparity: "South Manchuria" had no food to eat, and "North Manchuria" had no clothes to wear. After passing through the entire Changchun-Harbin line, we can see the sinister intentions of the Japanese.

When the car left Changchun, factory buildings could be seen within half an hour or so. The tall chimneys stood tall in the clouds, but there was no lingering green smoke, which made people feel lonely and desolate.

The palace-style station in Shuangchengzi is still the same, although the color is a bit gray, it has not lost its original shape. And many of the station names along the line have been changed by the Japanese invaders. For example, the well-known "Yaomen" is now called "Dehui".

### Riding Across the Songhua River, Everyone Feels the Harvest

The car arrived in Harbin at 10:30 PM on the 26th.

When the night curtain opened during the journey, the companions in the car all felt a little tired. At this time, the car climbed the bridge over the famous Songhua River, and one of the companions hummed the song "My Home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China", and the past was full of memories. We have the pain of not being able to return home in the past, and we should cherish our present.

At 10:30 PM in Harbin, the streets were already silent, and the lives of the citizens were the same as in Changchun.

### Harbin's Flying Snow Shows Beauty in Greatness

Among the cities in our country, Harbin is one of the most beautiful cities. Old Harbin people would say that when the Northeast is covered in snow in winter, Harbin can only be said to be "great". Everywhere is white, and the roofs of Russian-style buildings, the tall spires on the Lama platform, and the bare branches are all covered in snow, and only greatness can be shown in the simplicity. However, the reporter said that the characteristic of beauty cannot be concealed in greatness. When walking in Nangang or the Chinese Street here, the European style will appear in your mind, and even in some places it will remind you of Shanghai, in Daowai it reminds you of Tianjin, and the Daguan Garden area naturally reminds you of the Tianqiao in Beijing. On the famous Songhua River, there is a vast expanse, and the Songhua River Railway Bridge to Manzhouli spans the river. Sleds—locally called harrows—gallop below, making people feel infinitely affectionate. A special kind of beauty. The girls wear brightly colored scarves on their heads, covering their necks, and a bunch of hair is puffed up high on their foreheads. Snowflakes stay on it, whether it is a blonde foreign girl or a black-haired Chinese lady, setting off her rosy cheeks, making them look healthier and more charming.

### With No Wind, The Renowned Establishments Experience Extremely Quiet Business

Seventy to eighty percent of the shops have resumed business. The famous Churin Department Store and Victoria Hotel are experiencing a large number of customers every day. Especially in the days leading up to the New Year, many overseas residents were eagerly buying New Year's goods. After paying and collecting the goods, the procedures took almost a quarter of an hour of waiting. Harbin's dance scene is well-known, but although there are several dance halls now, business is very slow. The once-renowned Mardil Hotel is still a military camp. Even so, it shows Harbin's prosperity, with a unique flair compared to Changchun's commercial and political center.

Besides foreign businessmen speaking Chinese in Harbin, there are also many people from Shandong and Hebei. In Daoli district, the Shandong community has the upper hand, while in Daowai district, the Hebei community is dominant. More than twenty nationalities of foreigners reside in Harbin. According to a survey in 1943, there were nine Americans and thirty-three British. However, in recent years, their numbers have dwindled. It is said that there are no Americans left, and only two elderly spinsters remain in Harbin. In addition to cultural and educational circles, Harbin women's occupations also include so-called geishas, etc.

Because there are many foreigners in Harbin, Harbin people have relatively strong language skills. It is common for a person to speak two or three languages. For example, currently, the long-distance telephone line between Harbin and Changchun on the China Changchun Railway Bureau is the only line working. To communicate, one must use either Russian or Japanese; otherwise, conversation is impossible. Harbin people tell a joke: wealthy people all want a Japanese maid and a White Russian chauffeur at home, because without them, wealth is not truly enjoyed.

Currently, there is an educational issue in the Northeast that urgently needs attention: the "Kyowa language" (Japanese influenced Chinese) has become deeply entrenched. For example, "photography" is called "Shashin," and "broadcasting" is called "Hoso." Originally, these terms were also used in the North China region, but not as commonly as in the Northeast. Some articles from the Northeast are difficult to understand. However, Harbin is slightly better; the local newspapers use much less "Kyowa language" than those in Changchun.

### Beloved People Climb a High Peak

The people of the Northeast are generally lovable. After enduring fourteen years of enslaved life, their fervent love for the motherland and their strong sense of national unity are beyond the journalist's pen to describe. The enthusiastic cheers of the citizens for Mayor Yang Chuo'an in front of the Harbin Municipal Government after the reception on New Year's Day need not be repeated here. The journalist will record a passage from a conversation with Zhang Shixiu, the elderly principal of Harbin Jingwei Elementary School, during a visit on the 28th, to show a glimpse of the psychological state of the people of the Northeast in recent months, and to conclude this article: "The day we had longed for for fourteen years has finally arrived. Who knew that from 'August 15th' (Japanese Surrender) until now, almost four months have passed before we saw the arrival of the Central Government's receiving personnel. These four months have been truly difficult to endure, like climbing a high mountain for the past fourteen years. 'August 15th' arrived, meaning we were almost at the summit, only one step away. But this final step, we desperately couldn't climb it, struggling to endure, struggling to endure, struggling to endure until now."

As he spoke, he lowered his breath, his eyes looking at the ground. When he finished the last sentence and raised his gaze, meeting the journalist's eyes, the expression on his face truly revealed that he had reached the summit.

### Peace Dove Flies to the Province - Record of Ten Days of Work - Jinan Airmail - Special Correspondent He Bingru

The Political Consultative Conference established the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department to mediate the military conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and restore transportation. The department dispatched groups to various locations to mediate. The importance of their mission is recognized by all parties, and the resolution of the issue depends on the work of the executive groups. The group sent to Shandong consisted of U.S. representative Colonel 克 (Ke), Government representative Colonel Tu Xuwu, Communist Party representative Colonel Chen Shuliang, U.S. Communications Officer Lieutenant Haley, and members Wang Qi and Communist Party Captain Ma Jinqiao, totaling twelve people. They arrived in Jinan on a special plane on the 18th, and were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. They went to Tai'an on the 19th, returned to Jinan on the 20th, went to Zhangdian on the 21st, returned to Jinan on the 23rd, went to Tai'an again on the 24th, returned to Jinan on the 25th, and flew to Yanzhou on a special plane that day, returning on the 27th, and returning to Peiping on the 28th to report back. Colonel 克 and his party traveled back and forth to various locations in Shandong for ten days, tirelessly traversing the skies and land, enduring hardship. However, their efforts ultimately eased the tense situation in Tai'an, Yanzhou, Zhangdian, Zibo, and other places, and finally, under the principle of the nation first and the party second, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached an understanding and preliminary success. The process of resolving various issues is described below:

### Tai'an Turmoil - Pacified After Two Mediations

On January 19, at 11:00 AM, Colonel 克 and his party traveled by special train to the Namp'o Railway line to investigate and mediate the Kuomintang-Communist conflict in Tai'an. The Kuomintang and Communist troops were stationed separately between Jinan and Tai'an. Passenger trains ran once a day, and the borders had to be inspected by both sides. From Jinan south to Baimashan, 贾家庄 (Jiajia Zhuang), 炒米店 (Chao Mi Dian), 箇张 (Ge Zhang), 夏靑 (Xia Qing), and 杨树 (Yang Shu) stations, National troops were stationed. Four kilometers south of Qing Yang Shu was the Communist area. South to Wan De Jieshou and all stations to Tai'an were guarded by Communist troops. Although the defense areas were adjacent, there were no conflicts. As the special train passed, the military and civilians gave a grand welcome. The Communist area had not been notified in advance, and was allowed to proceed only after explanation. At 4:30 PM, they arrived at Tai'an Station. Zhao Dusheng, Commissioner of the First Special District of the CCP in Central Shandong, Fang Wei, Magistrate of Tai'an County, and Cheng Yetang, Commander of the garrison regiment, led the military and civilians to welcome them at the station. On the morning of the 20th, representatives from both sides met to discuss solutions to the conflict. The situation in Tai'an was such that the city and the western suburbs were in the hands of the National troops, while the station and the western end of the western suburbs were in the hands of the Communist troops. The two sides were confronting each other in the western suburbs. Although they had stopped firing, the defensive works of both sides were in the middle, less than 100 meters apart, with bayonets facing each other, and the situation remained tense. According to Ning Chunlin and others, the garrison in the city, the station was originally the National troops' defense area. On January 15, the Communist troops took advantage of the opportunity of the Japanese troops heading north to forcibly enter. To comply with the non-combat orders, the station garrison avoided conflict and, after requesting and receiving approval from their superiors, reluctantly withdrew. They requested Zeng Ke氏 (Shi) and others to restore the military status before the ceasefire order on the 13th, and requested the Communist troops to stop the blockade. They were also allowed unarmed soldiers and civilians to purchase supplies inside. The Japanese troops under 洼内 (Wa Nei) of the Dong Taiping Japanese troops were ordered to go to Jinan to surrender their weapons, but were also prevented by the Communist troops from doing so. The Japanese troops should be ordered to go north to comply with the United Nations' regulation of accepting the surrender of Japanese troops. Colonel 克 then proposed seven opinions based on the principle of the nation first and the party second: (1) Immediately stop all military actions and obey the orders of both parties. (Both parties agreed) (2) Immediately stop all actions of destruction, disturbing the people, and theft. (Both parties agreed) (3) Both parties shall jointly guarantee the construction of railways so that transportation is smooth and unobstructed. (At the same time, Mr. 克 explained that when he left Peiping, he received a telegram from Marshal Marshall ordering him to quickly find a way to restore transportation between Jinan and Xuzhou.) (Both parties agreed) (4) People from both sides are free to enter and exit (Both parties agreed) (5) Allow the more than 4,000 Japanese troops currently in Dafenkou and Dong Taiping to concentrate in Jinan to surrender their weapons, and the Communist troops will not stop them. (The CCP stated: If they are unarmed, they can allow them to pass, but armed enemy troops may cause conflict. It was decided to handle this matter after the CCP representatives arrive in Jinan for consultation.) (6) People detained by both parties should be released immediately. (Both parties agreed) (7) Restore the status quo before the effective date of the ceasefire, January 13. (Both parties started arguing again. Mr. 克 then amended the method: The National troops withdrew into the city, the Communist troops withdrew from the station. Neither side will station troops in the station, and the railway police will be responsible. The Communist troops did not agree, and the National troops also stated that they could not abandon the western suburbs. Finally, it was agreed to maintain the current military posture, and both parties would ensure that they would not fire, and remove all defensive obstacles to show peace. The National troops in the city are allowed to go out without weapons to purchase food, and the Communist troops will not prevent them. If any of the above conditions are violated, Mr. 克, etc., will come to deal with them as soon as they receive the news. That night, they returned to Jinan by the original train. On the 21st, Mr. 克 and his party went to Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Railway by special train as scheduled to inspect. As they were working hard, the conflict in Tai'an broke out again. It was not until the afternoon of the 23rd, after returning from Zhangdian, that they took a military heavy vehicle back to Tai'an at 8:00 AM on the 24th. In order to speed up efficiency, they drove straight to Tai'an and started discussions to find an effective way to stop the conflict. No satisfactory result was obtained. At 5:00 PM, Mr. 克 and his party returned to the station and held another meeting with Zhao Dusheng and others. The government representative, Tu Xuwu, and the CCP representative, Chen Shuliang, made sincere guarantees that neither side would fire the first shot. Mr. 克 then asked the CCP side: Because the people in the city lack food, there are 500 bags of flour brought by the special train. Please notify the Communist troops through the CCP representative, Chen Shuliang, to allow the garrison in the city to carry them into the city to alleviate the people's food shortage. The Communist troops agreed to do so, but only unarmed soldiers were allowed. At about 9:00 PM, all of them were transported into the city from the station. Colonel 克 was very excited and pleased by the peaceful sincerity of both parties. At 10:00 PM, the special train left Tai'an, and at 0:30 AM on the 25th, it returned to Jinan, and the turmoil in Tai'an subsided.

### The Crisis of Labor Strikes

Dear Editor: In the past month or two, strikes have occurred frequently in Shanghai, and the trend is intensifying. Initially, the government and public opinion circles inevitably held the principle that the capital should be more tolerant of labor to resolve labor disputes. The capital, because of its capital relations, is unwilling to have too much ill will with labor and would rather suffer losses and settle the matter. Who knew that there were other actors taking the opportunity to step in and agitate in many ways, leading to the most dangerous phenomenon today. It is found that the treatment of workers in major factories now is no less than before August 13 (Battle of Shanghai). If you check the salaries of lower-level officials in various government agencies, they are far less than the wages of workers. Furthermore, apart from those with technical experience, the knowledge, qualifications, and responsibilities of lower-level government officials are far higher than those of factory workers. Is it fair or not? The country is now recovering from an unprecedented disaster and embarking on the road to revitalization and nation-building. Industries and businesses need domestic capitalists and friendly people from all over the world to invest and operate. However, with one strike today and another tomorrow, who dares to invest limited funds in unnecessary consumption? Workers and capital in all factories should work with a sense of shared pain, and then the industry can last and the country can recover its rules. Then, I dare to assert that the number of factories in Shanghai will inevitably decrease day by day, the livelihood of workers in various factories will inevitably become more difficult day by day, and the country will inevitably become poorer day by day. I have traveled to Europe and the United States and have seen that whenever factory workers strike for demands and cannot resume work after mediation by legal institutions, the government has to temporarily take them over, and the army maintains order in the factory and starts work. The most advanced democracy, the United States, often uses this method, and our government can do the same. Our public opinion circles should also focus on the big picture and can no longer make biased arguments, so that industry and commerce can advance without limits, and the country and people will be fortunate.

### Madame Chiang in Changchun (Three Photos)

As early as a month ago, the people of Changchun heard the news that Madame Chiang was coming, and they looked forward to it every day. Women from Harbin, Shenyang, and other places had already sent representatives to Changchun in advance to welcome her. On the 22nd of last month, they were able to see Madame's graceful demeanor in the wind and snow. Welcoming meetings and cheers were everywhere, and some people in the crowd were moved to tears. Figure (1) shows: Madame Chiang's elegance as she works hard in the wind and snow of the Northeast.

Editorial

### Unwilling to Believe it is Happening

On the eve of the Spring Festival, the good news of the successful conclusion of the Political Consultative Conference was reported. As President Chiang said in his closing speech, it was "harmonious and coordinated" and "increasingly bright." The day before yesterday, the President met with foreign journalists and said that he would like all parties to cooperate permanently and jointly take responsibility for building the country. Especially in his reply to the Reader's Digest reporter, he recognized that political power is a responsibility rather than a right, and, on behalf of the people of the country, believed that the Communist Party would be able to earnestly implement the "nationalization of the military." This further convinced us that a new page has been turned in Chinese history, with a bright and boundless hope.

Before and during the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, we always advocated that only if all parties came forward with a sincere heart, respecting, trusting, tolerating, and conceding to each other, could China truly embark on the road to democratic politics. Under the call of the people of the whole country "only success is allowed, failure is not allowed," the Political Consultative Conference successfully concluded, which was to some extent due to the appeal of sincerity and trust. Especially on the government side, we can see many bright and tolerant places. For example, on the morning of the opening ceremony, the President resolutely excluded the dispute in the Rehe region, breaking the deadlock of the three-person team and making the cease-fire order finally issued. Before the conference, he solemnly instructed four ways to protect the people's freedom, first creating a good atmosphere for the meeting. During the group discussion, the government also made concessions from time to time and tried its best to show leniency. Expanding the government organization and accommodating people from various parties and social elites to participate together before the implementation of constitutional government is nothing more than paving the way for peace and unity. In the case of the draft constitution, the government also made major concessions. The principles for revising the draft even changed the nature of the "separation of powers and functions" and "the people have rights and the government has the ability" of the Five-Power Constitution, making the future government fall into the old rut of "mutual checks and balances, unable to move." The resolution on military issues did not even specify how many divisions the Communist Party's army should be reduced to, but first stipulated that the Central Army should be reduced to ninety divisions within six months to show impartiality. Such major concessions by the government in order to ensure the successful conclusion of the conference are probably undeniable even to those who are opposed to the government. The Kuomintang representatives often claim to be the largest party. Because they recognize that political power is a responsibility rather than a right, as long as it is beneficial to the country and the people, as long as it can truly achieve "political democratization and military nationalization," everything else can be tolerated. Based on this spirit of generosity and tolerance, they have achieved the effect of laying the foundation for peace and nation-building. "Sincerity and trust" are things that communicate with each other. We are all human beings, and we all have the same nature. Moreover, we are all Chinese citizens. If you are sincere and trustworthy, I will naturally be sincere and trustworthy. Therefore, we also believe that the President's guarantee in his reply to foreign journalists, "believing that the Communist Party will be able to earnestly implement the nationalization of the military," was said frankly after he had certainty.

However, in the past two weeks, the telegrams from various sources have reported many things that people dare not believe will happen. Logically, we believe that these things should not have happened. But in reality, there are such reports. We know that the government is unwilling to publicize such "harsh" incidents in order to show its sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution. However, since politics is required to embark on a democratic track, democratic practices should let the people know the facts and publicly comment. Hiding and avoiding things is not the norm in democratic countries. According to the news we have obtained, there have been intermittent Communist military actions in various places in the past ten days. The more important ones are as follows:

(1) Rehe: (1) The Communist troops in Chifeng were renamed the Security Team. Since the end of last month, they have been robbing, killing, and destroying the Nailing Station in the city, and forcing the people to suggest that the mediation executive team suggest the autonomy of Chifeng. (2) There were frequent movements in the area of Wafang in Ningcheng and between Suizhong and Jianchang, in an attempt to surround the flanks of the National troops.

(2) Liaoning: (1) The Communist troops in the area of Qingyuan, Fushun, and Benxihu in southeastern Shenyang are actively gathering in the southwest and northwest of Shenyang in an attempt to attack the urban area. (2) The railway bridges from Goubangzi to Panshan were all destroyed. (3) After the Communist troops reoccupied Yingkou, they continued to harass the city.

(3) Hebei: (1) Besieging Yuanshi. (2) Preventing the repair of the railway tracks. (3) Attempting to attack Jianchang, having already occupied Tianyi Station.

(4) Shanxi: (1) The southern section of the Tongpu Railway was repeatedly destroyed. Dongguang Lianzhen has been occupied, and Mitou is still under siege. (2) Fushan Yicheng was occupied. (3) The Communist troops in the Niangziguan area are obstructing traffic on the Zhengtai Railway. (4) The Communist troops in Linfen are actively invading the west. (5) The Communist troops captured Ninggu and attacked Mengcheng. (6) The Communist troops burned the houses of the people in the city gates of Quwo and tried to attack the city. (7) The National troops attacked Qinxian.

(5) Shandong: (1) Fiercely attacking Jimo and attempting to besiege Yanzhou. (2) Fiercely attacking Liaocheng on the Jinpu Railway. (3) Fiercely attacking Yidu on the Jiaoji Railway.

(6) Henan: (1) The Communist troops in Huaxian invaded the south. (2) There were continued offensives on the border between Fengqiu and Yanjin, attempting to occupy Yanjin. (3) Obstructing the repair of the Pinghan Railway line.

(7) Northern Anhui: (1) The Communist troops attacked the western border of the Dabieshan base between Ying and Huo, Ling.

(8) Northern Jiangsu: (1) The Communist troops in Dongtai are agitating around Zhen. (2) The Communist troops in Yizheng are actively expanding their army. (3) The Communist troops in Liuhe are invading the area of Xudubridge. (4) Besieging Donghai. (5) The Communist troops in Guanyun invaded from the east and west of Xiyangzhuang and occupied Zhuma. (6) The Communist troops attacked the town of Putown in Ru. (7) The Communist troops occupied Xin'anzhen, A'hu, Niushan, Xinpu, Baitabu, and other stations. All railway bridges were destroyed.

(9) Hubei: (1) The Communist troops continue to destroy telecommunications equipment in various places.

In addition, according to the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's announcement, the total length of the road destroyed by the Communist troops reached 125 kilometers and 705 meters. According to the North China Daily in Peiping, more than 30 kilometers of the Jinpu Railway near Tai'an was destroyed in the middle of last month; more than 1,000 railway tracks were removed from the Pinghan Railway near Anyang; near Dongguan on the Tongpu Railway, nine bridges were destroyed, and 40 kilometers of the railway; one bridge, three kilometers of power lines, and 430 meters of railway tracks were destroyed on the Baijin Railway. These Communist troop activities of destroying transportation and obstructing road repairs are unfortunate events that have occurred in the two weeks since the cease-fire order took effect.

In any case, these military actions that should no longer have happened are now occurring in various places. However, for the sake of the overall situation in China and for the sake of realizing the plan for peaceful nation-building, we are extremely unwilling to believe that these are actually facts! In this contradiction between fact and hope, we should fully understand the government's painstaking efforts in never announcing such news. However, we cannot find any reason to defend the fact that the Military Mediation Executive Department, which holds great power, has not taken any measures to stop or punish the incidents after sending groups to various places to investigate the facts.

Just looking at the agreement to stop the conflict and restore transportation, it has been delayed for nearly a month and still cannot be fully and thoroughly implemented. Then, when will we have to wait for the reorganization of the Communist troops and the "nationalization of the military"? However, the harmonious and coordinated Political Consultative Conference of more than twenty days was painstakingly held, with people exhausted. If, in the end, the real "military nationalization" cannot be achieved in fact, and the military group continues to delay and perfunctorily cover their ears and steal the bell, and there are still "autonomous troops" in the country who are not subject to government control and dispatch, and who are free and unrestrained, then we will see that "peaceful nation-building" is nothing more than a pleasant empty slogan. What is the value? Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Chinese Communist Party should change its style, sincerely stop street conflicts, restore transportation, and "return the army to the country" as soon as possible.

The most fashionable and popular term now is democracy. Democracy is not military rule, so if you demand democracy but refuse to give up the military, it is still a "military rule" mentality at work. We do not want to believe that there are still parties that worship "military rule" today. Democracy means that all the people are in charge, not that an individual is in charge. Only letting me be in charge is dictatorship and not democracy, so democracy is definitely not "me in charge." If everyone divides up the territory and controls the masses, refusing to hand it over to the whole country and still retains the strange shape of "a country within a country," then it is no different from allowing only one party to rule and not allowing the people to participate in politics, only allowing me to be in charge and not allowing the people to be in charge. We also do not want to believe that there are still parties today that chant democracy but still yearn for dictatorship in their hearts. Therefore, we are not only very happy to see the Kuomintang's generous and tolerant style, but also hope to see the Communist Party, the second largest party, truly change its style and truly compete with political ideas as Zhou Enlai said, and no longer use the method of controlling troops to divide the country. We only hope that we will no longer hear any "harsh" news about the Communist army from now on, and even further hope that we will no longer hear any harsh terms such as "Communist army" from now on! Only in this way will China's bright and brilliant future not be overshadowed again!

### Yan Prefecture's Suffering: People Kneel to Beg for Peace

On the 25th, Colonel Leck, accompanied by Kuomintang and Communist representatives Tu Xuwu and Chen Shuliang, arrived in Yan Prefecture from Ji'nan by special plane at noon. They first met with Wu Huawen, commander of the 1st Column of the garrison troops stationed there, and Ma Guanghan, the magistrate of Ziyang County. According to Wu's report, the Yan Prefecture garrison was in a defensive position, not taking a single step outside, fighting entirely in self-defense. Since January 8th, Yan City had been besieged by the Communist army. The north, south, and west gates of Yan Prefecture were all occupied by the Communist army, but the city walls and the east gate airport were still in the hands of the National Army. When the ceasefire order was received, the Communist army's offensive became even more urgent, as they wanted to capture Yan Prefecture before the 13th. On the 13th, the Communist army fired over a thousand artillery shells into the city, causing 300 casualties among the defending soldiers and over 50 civilian casualties. The Communist army used scaling ladders to attack the city and twice broke into the city, but were repelled each time. On the evening of the 13th, the Communist army ceased its formal attack. It was not until the second focal point order was issued that they withdrew their siege of the north, west, and south gates on the 21st. However, a small detachment still occasionally fired artillery and guns into the city, maintaining an encirclement and prohibiting supplies from entering the city. The following demands were made: (1) Please order the Communist army to abide by the Second Ceasefire Order and withdraw to 60 li outside the city. (2) Stop the blockade and allow people to purchase food and fuel to enter the city. Later, Mr. Leck met with representatives of the people and gave a speech. According to He Jian, he spoke to the two representatives, saying that after the deadline of the ceasefire order on the 13th, military actions would cease and the besieging troops would be ordered to retreat several li from the city. If the Second Order was received, it would be absolutely and continuously obeyed. He now guaranteed that guns would no longer be fired, but as the troops inside the city still occasionally fired outwards, he requested that they also cease firing. As for the people inside the city leaving to purchase food and fuel, they would definitely not be stopped, but the garrison troops inside the city should also open the city gates and allow the people to freely enter and exit. The traffic between Tai'an and Xuzhou would be repaired as quickly as possible to allow traffic to resume. The two representatives, Tu and Chen, reported to Mr. Leck in the city that evening. On the 26th, they planned to return to Ji'nan by telegram. As they reached the gate, they saw several thousand people kneeling on the ground, weeping and begging for peace. Moreover, there were over 50,000 refugees inside the city, lacking both coal and food, and several people had already starved to death. They pleaded for a quick resolution of the city siege to save the people's lives, causing everyone to weep. Leck and Chen Shuliang explained that there would be no further conflicts in the future. Chen also assured the people that the Communist army would definitely not fire another shot. The people dispersed tearfully. However, the weather was unfavorable for flying from the airport due to the cold and snowfall, so they turned back to Yan Prefecture midway. The heavy snow continued all day and night. On the morning of the 27th, the whole city was covered in silver, the sound of guns and cannons was gone, and the atmosphere of war had completely dissipated. They left Yan Prefecture by air at 1:00 PM. When they arrived in Ji'nan, they could not land due to the weather and planned to fly to Beiping instead. However, as they approached Dexian, the weather improved, so they turned back south and arrived safely in Ji'nan at 4:15 PM. The dispute regarding the Communist army's seizure of Japanese weapons in Shandong will be described separately. (Sent from Ji'nan on the 28th)

### Political Consultative Conference Achieved Results - People's Livelihood Hardships Should Be Relieved - Xi Yushu Advocates the Rapid Establishment of a Consultative Council

[Our Newspaper News] Our reporter recently visited Mr. Xi Yushu, a representative of Shanghai Municipality and a member of the National Political Council, and inquired about the prospects of the Political Consultative Conference and municipal issues in this city. Mr. Xi made a statement, believing that after the nation's victory, the people urgently need to find stability in their lives, and solving the suffering of people's livelihood is the only key point in governance. The various items discussed are recorded as follows:

(1) Regarding the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Xi said: What the people across the country are concerned about now is not the dispute over the interests of a certain party or faction, but how to quickly resolve the national

people's livelihood

issue of suffering. For example, the ceasefire order has been issued for a long time, but transportation in various places has still been slow to recover, and compatriots who have suffered in the rear for eight years still cannot return home. In addition, prices are high, life is hard, and public resentment is boiling. Who should be blamed for this? Therefore, we should immediately implement "returning government to the people and returning the army to the state," and we should understand what Chairman Chiang declared in his closing remarks: "We must have true unity in order to have true democracy." Although the consultation has been successful, it is hoped that the agreed points will be earnestly fulfilled without any further excuses, in order to live up to the people. We, standing in the position of ordinary people, demand that

the suffering of the people

be relieved immediately, otherwise everything is empty talk. (2) Shanghai Municipal Provisional Consultative Council. Mr. Xi's opinion: Formal consultative councils have been established in various places, but Shanghai, the third largest international city, has not even produced a provisional consultative council. The need for a representative body of public opinion is more urgent now than at any time or place. However, because the baojia system has not yet been compiled and rectified, we have to go through the process of a provisional consultative council. But if we want to establish one, we should do it quickly and shorten this process as much as possible. We hope that Shanghai can move towards

true democracy

as soon as possible and become a model city of democracy for the whole country. (3) Regarding municipal finances, Mr. Xi said: The expenditures of the city's finances are indeed very serious. Because the original main sources of tax revenue, such as land and business taxes, have been assigned to the central government under the new system, and the funds that the central government should subsidize cannot be issued as scheduled, the difference between the city's treasury revenue and expenditure is now more than half. Citizens should understand and endure the appropriately increased taxes, but it is hoped that

local burdens

will still be used for local affairs, and Shanghai City, which has been struggling for eight years, will be restored. If the central government wants to help the revival of the largest city in the East, it should follow the example of the British and American governments' subsidy system for local governments, stipulate a huge amount of subsidies from the central budget, so that local construction can have a way, and the city's financial problems can be solved as a whole.

### Lu Sen Punished for Armed Extortion

Wei Jimin, director of the Shanghai Office of the Naval Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, arrested and interrogated Lu Sen and other illegal naval officers and soldiers after being dispatched to Shanghai to take over the Shanghai Office of the Naval Headquarters. Details are as follows:

Extortion of Gold

Lu Sen, 21 years old, from Shanghai, was formerly the captain of the guard of the Naval Club. Last year, he led squad leader Sun Huanliang and soldiers Xia Weichang, Wang Genquan, etc., colluding with Wu Qinan, an employee of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and broke into the home of businessman Xu Zhihui with weapons. They falsely claimed to be under orders to arrest Xu Zhihui, detained Xu Zhihui for two days, and extorted seventy taels of gold. Although they ultimately failed to obtain it, their intention to threaten and defraud was against the law. At the same time, Lu Sen and Sun Huanliang colluded to commit fraud, steal and sell naval coal to merchants, and conceal a portion of the stored coal, intending to embezzle it, committing the crime of stealing military supplies.

Looting of Money and Goods

In addition to the above crimes, Sun Huanliang also led soldiers Xia Weichang, Wang Genquan, and Jia Huanzhang on October 30th last year, under the pretext of catching opium addicts, and went to the home of Gan Baishun in Tongchang Lane, Haining Road, with weapons. They coerced and looted cash and jewelry, and arbitrarily detained Gan Baishun for three days. Of the above-mentioned criminals, Lu Sen and Jia Huanzhang have been arrested, while Sun Huanliang, Xia Weichang, and Wang Genquan are at large and are being strictly pursued. The naval court-martial has conducted a detailed interrogation. The presiding judge Xu Bingxian, together with judge Duo Bei, based on the criminal law and the naval, army, and air force criminal law, ruled on January 24th: (1) Lu Sen was sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment for coercing merchants, intending to defraud, stealing military supplies, and condoning subordinates to plunder property. (2) Sun Huanliang was sentenced to life imprisonment for plundering property, coercing extortion, and stealing military supplies. (3) Xia Weichang, Wang Genquan, and Jia Huanzhang were each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for assisting in plundering property and coercing extortion. (4) Wu Qinan will be handled separately in accordance with Article 28 of the Military, Naval, and Air Force Trial Law.

### U.S. Helps China Stabilize Currency - Second Batch of Gold Shipped to Shanghai

In addition, the Ministry of Communications has discussed with the Four Joint Offices to provide loans to the shipping industry to encourage the salvage of sunken ships and the repair of ships. The total loss of the shipping industry during the War of Resistance was 396,330 tons. The shipping industry will soon organize a unified transportation organization to compete with shipping merchants around the world.

"President Pierce" Arrives in Shanghai

The American President Lines' "President Pierce" arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from New York via San Francisco, carrying a large number of goods, mostly foreign wine, milk powder, and other foods, in addition to paper products. It is currently unloading at the Balianjing Pier. It was originally scheduled to sail to Nanyang, Saigon, and the Philippines on the 9th, and then return to the United States via Shanghai. The company received a telegram from the Philippines yesterday stating that the labor movement is very active and has gone on strike, so the ship has cancelled its voyage to Nanyang and will return to the United States from Shanghai on the 10th, sailing directly to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and then to New York.

"Niuzhuang" to Sail to Tianjin

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship "Haisu" has failed to sail due to passenger problems.

### The Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau Discovered a Large Number of Hidden Supplies - Nearly Seven Hundred Cases of Confidential Reports Received

As of now, the investigation team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau has received more than six hundred and eighty confidential reports. The number of enemy and puppet hidden supplies discovered based on confidential reports is very large.

Approximately 50 Million Yuan in Bonuses Issued

The informant can receive a bonus of 20% of the value of the discovered supplies if the value is less than 1 million yuan, 15% for 1 million to 10 million yuan, 12.5% for 10 million to 50 million yuan, 10% for 50 million to 100 million yuan, and 5% for more than 100 million yuan. From the beginning of January this year to yesterday, the investigation team has successively issued more than 44.8 million yuan in bonuses for confidential reports, and a part of it was issued in kind, such as copper skins, refrigerators, vermicelli, water chestnut flour, alum, socks, wool fabric, cloth, shirts, and woolen yarn, which are also of considerable value.

Three More Cases of Escaped Supplies Discovered

In the past ten days, the team discovered three cases of escaped enemy and puppet supplies, among which the more significant ones are: (1) Twelve motorized sailing boats. These sailing boats belonged to the Japanese Navy, but when our navy authorities received Japanese equipment ships, these twelve motorized sailing boats were not listed in the Japanese handover inventory. It was not until November that someone confidentially reported to the investigation team, but the confidential report only knew of five ships, whose hiding place was near Fuxing Island in Yangshupu. The investigation team sent personnel to investigate and seize them, and based on this clue, discovered another seven, totaling twelve. According to the Japanese side, these sailing boats originally belonged to Japanese merchants and were requisitioned by the Japanese Navy during the war. After the surrender, these twelve motorized boats were returned to the original Japanese merchants, so they were not listed in the handover inventory to our side. However, it was found that this was a Japanese excuse. The crime of escaping and hiding ships is that they were indeed owned by Japanese merchants. This is a means of transportation, and it should also be handed over to our side for takeover. It is reported that these twelve motorized sailing boats have been transferred by the investigation team to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for takeover.

Hidden Houses Continue to be Discovered

(2) A Japanese person named Nan Jian entrusted his Chinese driver to take care of five houses located at No. 1502 to No. 1510 (all even numbers) on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi after the Japanese surrender, fearing that they would be confiscated. According to confidential reports and the testimony of the residents of the houses, it was confirmed that the properties belonged to a Japanese person, so they have been confiscated by the investigation team and will be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau for disposal. (3) Deng Ruizhi, a Chinese compradore of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation, hid eleven boxes of copper coins belonging to Mitsubishi Corporation. They were discovered by the investigation team at the end of the Lunar New Year at Deng's home at No. 10 Bailu Lane, Broadway. In addition, the team continued to discover several houses of private property owned by Dong Xiujia, a traitor and former Director of the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau.

### Developing Civil Aviation and Establishing Air Defense - The Shanghai Branch of the Aviation Construction Association is Established - Chairman Chiang's Admonition Encourages Aviation to Build the Nation

The Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government Auditorium at 10 AM yesterday. Over a hundred people attended, including Chairman Qian Dajun, committee members Tao Baichuan, Shen Shihua, Pan Gongzhan, He Dequi, Xu Jilong, Xuan Tiewu, Li Jilan, Ding Guitang, Feng Youzhen, Sheng Shengyi, Wu Yunshi, Xu Yongzuo, Secretary-General Shi Bangfan, and guests from various agencies. Chairman Qian Dajun read the admonition from Chairman Chiang of the General Association, and then gave a speech. Committee members He Dequi and Tao Baichuan then gave speeches successively, and finally, Secretary-General Shi Bangfan reported on the preparatory process. Then, the first meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Branch Committee was held to discuss the meeting's agenda.

Chairman Chiang's Admonition

Science is flourishing and aviation is advancing rapidly. Its power in wartime, the bombing and destruction it causes, makes villages and houses ruins, and its peacetime contribution is to develop transportation and popularize civilization, all of which benefit from it. We have learned from eight years of lessons and experienced the Great War. We believe that without a civil aviation foundation, we cannot talk about building a country, and without air force strength, we cannot be responsible for consolidating air defense! Now that the War of Resistance has been won and the nation is being founded, all of us compatriots should be inspired and refine ourselves, each doing our best, each exerting our strength, either to help build aviation, generously donating, or to actively participate in cloud soaring, laying the foundation for civil aviation, building the revival of the Chinese nation, consolidating air defense, and shouldering the great responsibility of safeguarding world peace! The Aviation Construction Association was originally established to assist the government, guide the people, promote aviation, and build air defense. The establishment of the Shanghai Branch is also based on this purpose, hoping to enable the local people to pool their wisdom and efforts to jointly undertake difficult undertakings, with one heart and one mind, to jointly address the important tasks of construction. It is imperative to awaken compatriots at sea, develop civil aviation, and promote the brilliant culture of our nation; build air defense and permanently protect the great territory of our motherland! Be diligent, be diligent.

Chairman Qian's Speech

Briefly stated: I am very happy that our Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Aviation Construction Association has been established today. Shanghai is the first metropolis in the country, and I hope that aviation construction work can also be the first in the country. This requires the joint efforts of all committee members to promote it, and the efforts of all staff to handle affairs, in order to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by the government and expected of us by the people.

Next, Committee Member He Dequi and Committee Member Tao Baichuan gave speeches, and Secretary-General Shi reported at the end.

### Yongfeng Bank Ordered to Suspend Operations

In order to thoroughly rectify the financial industry in this city, the Ministry of Finance will separately ban financial institutions that have engaged in traitorous behavior during the period of occupation and those with unsound organizations and chaotic accounts. This will bring the financial industry in this city into order and prevent any unfavorable signs from occurring again. Two days ago, Zhongfu Bank was first ordered to suspend operations. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the license of Yongfeng Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road was revoked and ordered to suspend operations immediately. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance stated in its order to the bank: The license was revoked because the bank's shareholders had

evidence of traitorous activities

and the accounts were chaotic. After the bank was ordered to suspend operations, it began liquidation yesterday. According to the bank, which was established in the 30th year of the Republic of China, with Pan Yangyao as the chairman of the board, it was allowed to continue operations after the victory because it had registered with the Ministry of Finance after the war. The Financial Inspection Office went to the bank to investigate the accounts a month ago and found that the bank had issued allocation notes of more than 100 million yuan between April and May of this year, which was too large. The

suspension

of the bank's operations this time may be related to the issuance of a large number of allocation notes. In addition, the bank currently has approximately 1,000 depositors, with deposits of more than 200 million yuan. All depositors have been notified to go to claim their deposits immediately. The main reason for the revocation of Zhongfu Bank's license was that there was evidence of traitorous activities. The bank's general manager, Sun Zhongli, served as the chairman of the puppet Flour and Wheat Committee. During the puppet regime, the bank also lent a large amount of money to the puppet regime. French Concession Water and Electricity Once Went on Strike.

### Tramways Today as Usual

[Our Newspaper News] After the employees of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company went on strike last month due to demands for improved treatment, the Social Affairs Bureau convened both labor and management for mediation, and a result was achieved. However, some issues, such as the trade union's venue, remain unresolved. Yesterday, there was another setback due to the cost of living index. Employees of the machine department began to strike at noon, and all trams, trolleybuses, and buses operating on all lines stopped selling tickets at 4:30 PM. At around 5 PM, the trams on all lines successively entered the factory and stopped operating. Labor and management immediately negotiated at the company, and the Social Affairs Bureau also sent personnel to mediate. The negotiation was successfully concluded at around 6 PM. It was resolved that wages would be calculated at 1062 times the cost of living index, plus a uniform allowance of 5,500 yuan. Those with a base salary of 26 to 35 yuan would receive an additional 1,500 yuan, those with 36 to 40 yuan would receive an additional 1,000 yuan, and those with 41 to 45 yuan would receive an additional 500 yuan. The company allowed the trade union's venue to be set up behind the engine room and would move in on the 10th. All employees agreed to resume work immediately. Three trams on Route 10 were dispatched at 6:15 PM that evening to restore traffic. Tramways and buses on all lines will operate as usual from this morning.

### Locomotives, Railcars, and Trucks to be Shipped from America, Report from UNRRA China Director

[Report from this newspaper] Lieutenant Colonel Olmstead, Director of the China Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), hosted a reception for the Shanghai press corps at the Duchene Hotel on Jiangxi Road yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. Forty to fifty people attended, including senior officials from the UNRRA and reporters from various newspapers. Mr. Olmstead reported on three key aspects of the branch's recent work: The first is the

Yellow River Management

project. He stated that this project is being actively promoted and is expected to be completed within the year. According to investigations, the most serious damage along the Yellow River is the three-li breach near Zhengzhou, Henan. Mr. Todd, Chief Engineer of UNRRA's Yellow River management project, estimates that this breach can be repaired by July of this year. Mr. Todd recently returned from an inspection of the flood damage along the Yellow River, and reported that the damage elsewhere along the river is not as severe as rumored. The plan is to raise the dikes by one to two feet. As for the equipment and materials needed for the Yellow River management, seventeen train cars full were shipped to the area two weeks ago, and further replenishment is planned. Mr. Olmstead expressed optimism about the future of the Yellow River management project. To date, the Yellow River project has employed approximately 20,000 people, and expenditures for the purchase of equipment in the United States have reached US$3 million. The second is the reconstruction of the

Guangdong-Hankou Railway

According to Mr. Du, a member of the UNRRA Shanghai Branch, who inspected the line, over one hundred bridges and culverts have been destroyed by bombing. Although they have been temporarily repaired, they cannot be used for long. Therefore, it has been decided to quickly build new bridges using military-style pontoon bridges. In terms of rolling stock, 20 new locomotives and 3,600 railcars have already been purchased. UNRRA is currently considering purchasing an additional 181 new locomotives for shipment to China. The third is to improve

Water Transportation

Mr. Olmstead stated that UNRRA and the Executive Yuan recognize that relief and rehabilitation work cannot proceed without solving the transportation problem. Therefore, the Executive Yuan is making every effort to improve water transportation. UNRRA is establishing a mission in Washington, D.C., led by Mr. Swanson, head of the organization's management team, to inspect surplus ships in the Philippines. According to the plan, a batch of tugs and barges will be allocated to China for use, including 140 landing craft, which will soon be shipped to China for urgent transportation on the Yangtze River. These ships are mostly equipped with high-speed diesel engines, which will present some difficulties in operation, but it is hoped that within three months, Chinese personnel can be trained to operate them independently. Mr. Olmstead also stated that, according to the planned schedule,

Trucks

amounting to 10,000, will be shipped to China, to be allocated by the Executive Yuan for use on highways throughout the country. The preliminary progress is very good, and it is hoped that this plan can be fully implemented. Mr. Olmstead concluded by expressing his hope that the materials and equipment currently held by UNRRA in Shanghai can be distributed to various locations as soon as possible, so that additional supplies can be requested from the headquarters.

Social Services

### Wuxi Renci Sanatorium Provides Free Treatment for Teachers with Tuberculosis, Applicants Must First Be Introduced by This Column

A letter from Mr. Lu Buzhou states: "Dear Editor, I saw in the January 26th issue of your newspaper's Social Services column that a poor and sick young man named Liu Sangnian is suffering from tuberculosis and cannot afford treatment. I previously established the Renci Sanatorium in Guanshe Mountain on the shore of Taihu Lake in Wuxi. Last year, with the support of friends and relatives, I added free beds specifically for the treatment of tuberculosis. These beds are not yet fully occupied. According to the regulations, they are intended for teachers with tuberculosis, but since Mr. Liu is a young man, an exception can be made. I have enclosed the relevant free treatment procedures, all of which are printed, and would appreciate it if you could pass them on. If Mr. Liu intends to receive treatment at the sanatorium, please have him bring a letter of introduction from your office and contact me at my Shanghai office on Fuzhou Road. Furthermore, there are still vacancies in the free tuberculosis treatment beds for teachers. I respectfully request that your newspaper publish this information and introduce applicants to us. I am most grateful. Sincerely, Lu Buzhou."

(Editor's Note) We thank Director Lu of the Wuxi Renci Sanatorium for sending us the relevant regulations and requesting that we introduce poor and sick teachers to the sanatorium for treatment, which we will of course do. Furthermore, Director Lu is willing to provide free treatment for Mr. Liu Sangnian, even though he is not a teacher, making an exception and showing great compassion, which we deeply admire! We hope that Mr. Liu will contact us first so that we can provide an introduction.
