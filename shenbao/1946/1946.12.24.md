### The Constitutional Draft's Third Reading May Be Completed Today; National Assembly to Close Tomorrow; Chairman Gives Two Instructions Regarding the Constitutional Draft

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] It is learned that the Constitutional Draft's third reading is expected to be completed during the 19th session, scheduled for the afternoon of the 24th. Therefore, the National Assembly can hold its closing ceremony on the morning of the 25th, a historical memorial day.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] National Assembly Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened the 27th meeting at 11:00 AM on the 23rd. The resolutions are as follows: (1) The draft preparation procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, which were decided to be eleven articles at the meeting on the 22nd, had the first and second articles merged at the meeting on the 23rd, resulting in a proposed nine articles. (2) The list of members of the drafting committee for the Emergency Law resolution was determined, totaling twelve people. (3) Sun Ke presided over the 17th General Assembly. In the afternoon, the Presidium held its 28th meeting, chaired by Hu Shuhua. The resolutions are as follows: (1) The General Assembly is postponed for one day and will close on the 25th. (2) General Assemblies will be held on the 24th, both morning and afternoon. (3) The 18th General Assembly will be held at 9:00 AM on the 24th, chaired by Kong Xiangxi.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] At the Central Memorial Week on the 23rd, Chairman Chiang raised two points regarding the articles of the Constitution that had already been passed in the second reading, hoping that all representatives would carefully consider them. (1) The 28th article, passed yesterday, stating that "incumbent officials may not be elected as National Assembly representatives," is considered to deprive officials of their own civil rights. He hopes that all representatives will carefully consider and propose an amendment. (2) Regarding the allocation of seats for legislators in Article 65, if the number passed is followed, it will reach over seven hundred people, making it difficult to convene meetings. He also hopes that this can be carefully studied. It is heard that some representatives have also felt this way for some time and plan to propose an amendment within the next few days for further discussion. A decision may be made at the General Assembly on the 24th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Central Memorial Week was held at 8:30 AM on the 23rd in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Chiang personally attended and delivered a speech, encouraging the Kuomintang National Assembly representatives to work hard to complete the constitutional task. The Chairman stated: The second session of the National Assembly is about to be completed. After the third reading, the constitutional work will be completed. This constitutional drafting is the most important task in history, and it is a great honor for everyone to participate in this great work. The Chairman also stated: Since the opening of the National Assembly, nearly forty days have passed. Comrades of our party and representatives of various parties have gathered together to exchange opinions and discuss together. This kind of democratic spirit has achieved great success. He hopes that everyone will maintain this spirit in the future, and our party will never fail. The Chairman pointed out that Article 65 of the Constitutional Draft stipulates that the number of legislators should be more than 700, which is too many and will make it difficult to hold meetings in the future. Furthermore, the 28th article passed yesterday stipulates that incumbent officials may not be elected as National Assembly representatives, which may also be difficult in practice and it would be best to have some remedy. The Chairman continued to praise that all representatives have been able to fulfill their responsibilities in the constitutional work, which has led to such satisfactory results and is a success for our party. He also stated: Now that the National Assembly is about to close, everyone will return to their original places. He hopes that everyone will continue to work hard with the spirit they had during the meeting. This spirit is that before a resolution, there is open discussion, and after a resolution, it must be strictly followed. The Chairman's speech lasted half an hour.

### The Constitutional Draft's Second Reading is Rapid; May Be Completed in Full Today; This Morning's General Assembly Read to Article 109

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The second reading of the Constitution is progressing rapidly. During the 16th session of the National Assembly today, the morning session read from Article 83 to Article 109. During the 17th General Assembly in the afternoon, it read from Article 110 to Article 139. Except for a few clauses that were amended, all the rest were passed. It is expected that the second reading of the Constitutional Draft will be fully completed during the 18th General Assembly on the 24th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The 16th session of the National Assembly was held at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. At the beginning of the meeting, there were 1,244 representatives present, which later increased to 1,478. Chairman Gu Zhenggang reported on the minutes of the 15th meeting. Then, KMT representative Xie Chengping spoke, requesting that the assembly and the chairman pay attention to the rules of procedure and not allow one person's temporary proposition to affect the meeting's progress. Then, the second reading procedure continued, starting with Article 83, "Judicial," of the seventh chapter. Representative Zhu Songsou and 34 others proposed an amendment to this article, advocating maintaining the original draft's order and wording of this article, so that the powers of the Grand Justices, in addition to interpreting the Constitution and unifying the interpretation of laws and regulations, can also concurrently handle trials. Representative Jiang Yiping, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, then spoke to explain that the Grand Justices are authorities on law, not judges of the Supreme Court, and should not have too many members. Their powers are not limited to the current definition in Article 86 (new Article 83), and whether they concurrently handle trials is not necessarily fixed. Representative Song Qiao also expressed his agreement, believing that the Grand Justices' handling of trials should not be rigidly stipulated. After voting, only 317 votes were in favor of the amendment, and the original text was maintained with 1,026 votes. Article 84 was passed without objection. After this article, Representative Chen Changheng and 36 others proposed a supplementary motion to add an article: "The Judicial Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction." After Chen explained the reason, Representative Chen Qitian spoke against it, saying that the judicial organ should not draft laws, and the judicial administration power belongs to the Executive Yuan according to Article 82. The organization law of courts at all levels does not need to be proposed by the Judicial Yuan. Furthermore, the spirit of the original draft is to make the Judicial Yuan the highest judicial organ, equal and independent of the Legislative Yuan. If it submits legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, it would change this principle and make the Judicial Yuan responsible to the Legislative Yuan. After voting, only 245 votes were in favor of the supplementary motion, and the original proposal was maintained. Regarding the guarantee of judges' duties in Article 85, representatives raised complaints about the suffering of the people from the corrupt judicial system, arguing that there should be provisions for removing protection for corrupt judges. After voting, the original text was maintained with 1,109 votes. Article 86 was passed without objection. However, Representative Ni Bi spoke, saying that he opposed the Judicial Yuan's sole interpretation of the Constitution and requested to reserve the right to speak, to raise this point again when Article 149 is discussed. Article 87 was passed without objection. Chapter 8, "Examination": Articles 88 to 94, a total of seven articles, were all passed without objection. Only Article 90 had an amendment proposed by Representative Bu Wenlin and 18 others. Due to insufficient statutory numbers, Bu also gave up speaking, and it was not discussed.

Chapter 9, "Control": Article 95 was passed without objection. Article 96, regarding the number of Control Yuan members to be elected, stirred up a storm. This article had six amendments: (1) Representative Yao Qinru and 46 others proposed that the allocation of Control Yuan members in each province and region should also adopt a population proportion system, advocating modifying the first paragraph to: "Provinces and cities with a population of less than 5 million shall have 5 members. Those with a population of over 5 million shall elect one additional member for every 5 million people." (2) Representative Zhao Bingqi and others proposed that each province should elect at least 5 Control Yuan members. (3) Representative Bei Zairan and 33 others proposed that the first paragraph should be modified to: "Each province shall have 5 to 7 members." (4) Representative Fu Sinian and 37 others proposed that the standard of 5 members per province after the division of provinces and regions would cause the Control Yuan to have too many people, making work difficult. They advocated reducing the number, modifying the first paragraph to: "Each province shall have 3 members." (5) Representative Wang Xiaolai and 35 others proposed that the second paragraph be modified to: "Each directly administered municipality shall have 5 members." (6) Representative Ba Wenjun and 31 others proposed that, in addition to leagues, Mongolia also has independent banners not affiliated with leagues, advocating modifying the third paragraph to: "The Mongolian leagues (adding one character) banners shall have a total of eight members." After the amendments were read, Representative Jiang Yiping, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, explained that the target of the Control Yuan's control is officials, and the number of officials in each province is the same, so the number of members should also be the same. Representative Chen Qitian, the convener of the Comprehensive Review Committee, continued to explain that the committee decided that the standard of 5 people is an appropriate number, and the Legislative Yuan has already stipulated the number according to population proportion, so the Control Yuan should continue to maintain the balance of each province. Then, the representatives who advocated amendment spoke. Representative Ni Mifang elaborated on the reasons. Several representatives downstairs had a dispute over whether to discuss or not, arguing and shouting angrily at each other: "Fight! Fight!" The order was chaotic for a while. Chairman Gu then urgently struck the gavel twice to suppress the order of the meeting. According to the rules of procedure, he announced the end of the discussion and put it to a vote amidst the opposition of some representatives. As a result, regarding the first paragraph, in addition to proposal (2) by Representative Zhao and others maintaining the original proposal and proposal (4) by Representative Fu and others having been automatically withdrawn, proposal (1) by Representative Yao and others only received 457 votes. Proposal (3) by Representative Bei and others only received 312 votes and were rejected. The first paragraph still maintained the original text with an absolute majority of 1,026 votes. In the second paragraph, proposal (5) by Representative Wang and others was also rejected with a minority of 131 votes, maintaining the original text. In the third and fourth paragraphs, the convener of the Comprehensive Review Committee made a written statement, stating that the character "clan" was an unintentional omission. The amendment by Representative Ba and others was passed without objection. The entire text was passed with 1,201 votes after adding a "banner" character to the third paragraph. At this point, it was 11:10 AM. After a break, the meeting continued at 11:30 AM. The number of representatives present decreased to 1,250. Article 97 was passed without objection. Article 98 had an amendment proposed by Representative Duan Binglin and 44 others, advocating reducing the term of Control Yuan members to three years to match the term of legislators. After voting, it received 428 votes, and the original text was maintained with 704 votes. Article 99 was passed without objection. After this article, Representative Chen Changheng and 35 others proposed a supplementary motion to add an article: "The Control Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction." After voting, it was rejected with a minority of 490 votes. Articles 100 to 106, a total of seven articles, were passed without objection. Article 107 had three amendments proposed by Representative Li Cizong and 36 others, Representative Liu Ke and Representative Lou Tongsun and 33 others, and Representative Gao Yihan and 34 others. Their content was the same, all proposing to amend the article to: "Control Yuan members, except for current offenders (deleting "and those who have been prosecuted" six characters), may not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Control Yuan." After the amendment was announced, Representative Li Zhongli, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, stated that the provisions for the protection of Control Yuan members in Article 107 should be the same as those for legislators in Article 79. After voting, the amendment was passed with 994 votes. Articles 108 and 109 were passed without objection. It was already 12:00 noon. Chairman Gu stated that the Presidium originally planned to complete the second reading on the same day and proposed to extend the meeting by half an hour, but the proposal was rejected by the assembly. Secretary-General Hong then reported that the meeting would be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon and adjourned the meeting.

### Executive Yuan Regular Meeting Changed to the 27th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan meeting, according to the usual practice, should be held every Tuesday. The regular meeting that was supposed to be held on the 24th has been postponed to the 27th. The matter of salary increases for civil servants will be delayed for a few more days.

### Striving to Complete a Democratic Constitution; Ambassador Stuart Praises Chairman Chiang; Hopes That Our Countrymen Will Jointly Avert the Economic Crisis

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] Ambassador Stuart entered the city at 9:00 AM on the 23rd to visit relevant parties. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by American Consul Myers. He returned to the school in the afternoon and attended a meeting of faculty and students at Yenching University at 4:20 PM, giving a speech. At 5:00 PM, he met and talked with Zhang Dongsun.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] At the faculty and student meeting at Yenching University on the 23rd, Ambassador Stuart expressed his deep appreciation for Chairman Chiang's efforts to complete the democratic constitution and called on the Chinese people to jointly devote themselves to the implementation of this constitution. He also said that current prices are high, and the people are struggling to make a living. China's economy is on the verge of collapse. If it is not saved in time, the future is unimaginable. Under this situation, patriots should unite and replace destructive efforts with a constructive spirit to engage in the construction of a new China. Ambassador Stuart also talked about China's difficulties, saying that most of them are due to disharmony in human relationships. Finally, he sincerely prayed that China would be able to make significant progress next year.

### Chairman Invites Ambassador Marshall to Spend Christmas Eve Together

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall will be invited by Chairman Chiang and his wife to spend his Christmas Eve at the Chairman's residence on the evening of the 24th. Furthermore, Zhou Qianchong, a standing committee member of the Youth Party, recently visited Special Envoy Marshall twice and had discussions, exchanging views on the current situation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] A spokesperson for the American Embassy told reporters on the 23rd that Special Envoy Marshall currently has no plans to leave China. The so-called Marshal Marshall will return to the country before the end of the year is absolutely unreliable.

### Sun Ke, Hu Shi, and Twelve Others Draft Resolutions of the Constitutional Draft; General Assembly in the Afternoon Reads to Article 139

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The 17th session of the National Assembly was held at 3:30 PM on the 23rd, with 1,050 people present. Chairman Sun Ke, after performing the formalities, in addition to the Secretariat announcing the minutes of the 16th meeting, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou also reported the list of members of the drafting committee for the Constitutional Draft resolutions, totaling twelve people. The list is as follows: Sun Ke, Hu Shi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, Lin Bin, Jiang Yuntian, Chen Cheng, Hong Lanyou, Lei Zhen. The second reading then continued, starting with Article 110, and discussing until Article 139 by 6:00 PM, all passed, with slight amendments. The discussion process is recorded as follows: In Article 110, the fifth paragraph was "National highways, national railways, national roads, and shipping administration, postal administration, and telecommunications administration." Ling Hongxun believed that national highways and national roads were the same thing, and there was repetition in the text. It should be amended to remove the four characters "national roads." After voting, it was passed. The rest was passed according to the amendment. Article 111 had amendment opinions from Xue Peiyuan, believing that after the twelfth item in this article, an item on land use law should be added, and after the eighteenth item, an item on property law should be added. After voting, it was a minority and was rejected. Furthermore, Leng Shaoquan and others suggested that the third item, agriculture, forestry, industry, and commerce, be changed to "forests, industry, and commerce," and the sixth item, shipping and coastal fishing, be changed to "shipping and marine fishing." The tenth item, water conservancy and canals above two provinces, was changed to "water conservancy and river canals above two provinces, and joint agricultural and pastoral methods." After voting, the amendment was passed by a majority. Leng Shaoquan's amendment opinion on Article 121 was to amend the sixth item, "provincial agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and engineering," to "provincial agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, animal husbandry, and engineering," which was immediately passed. Furthermore, in the article added after Article 120, Leng Shaoquan's amendment opinion was to change the fifth item to "county agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, fisheries, animal husbandry, and engineering," which was passed. Next, Articles 113 to 120 were all passed without objection. Two articles were added after Article 120, one was "The autonomy system of the Mongolian leagues and tribes shall be determined by law," passed without objection. The second was "The autonomy system of Tibet shall be guaranteed." Chairman Chiang had previously announced that the two characters "local" would be removed, which was immediately passed. Then, starting with Article "1111," the entire section on counties was passed without objection. Chapter 12, "Election, Recall, Initiative, Referendum," Articles "129" and "130" were passed according to the original text. Article "131" had an amendment opinion from Qin Liankui, changing the wording of the article "Elections should strictly prohibit threats and enticements. If there are election lawsuits, they must be submitted to the court for trial," where "must be submitted" should be changed to "by." Qin Liankui explained the reason, saying: Litigations are filed with the court. If it is said "must be submitted," then it is submitted to other agencies. After this turn, it will take more time. At the same time, during the tutelage period, election lawsuits were tried by the court. Now, suddenly saying "must be submitted" seems like they were not tried by the court in the past, which will cause misunderstanding. If it is changed to "by" the court for trial, it will be straightforward and clear. After voting, it was passed by a majority. Then, Article "132" was discussed and passed according to the original article. [To be continued]

### Minister Chen Lifu Answers Reporters' Questions; Date of Constitutional Implementation Still Under Discussion; Different Chapters May Be Implemented in Stages Due to Different Natures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Central Organization Minister Chen Lifu, when answering questions at a press conference of the Central Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the 23rd, said: The Chinese Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, emphasizing fulfilling obligations rather than pursuing benefits. Its nature is different from that of political parties in other countries. The Premier once cited Yi Yin's assistance to Taijia as an example, and today's situation is indeed the same.

The Kuomintang Spirit: Freedom and Discipline

Since the Kuomintang is a revolutionary party, its members are willing to sacrifice their lives to fight for anything that is beneficial to the country. The majority obeys the minority, and if the minority opinion is indeed superior to the majority, the majority can adopt it. The Kuomintang's basic spirit is freedom and discipline. Before a decision is made, there can be free discussion. After a decision is made, it must be obeyed. This spirit can be fully seen in this National Assembly. However, the majority obeying the minority is a great danger to democratic politics. Doing it once in a while is acceptable, but doing it again and again will endanger the democratic spirit. The ancients said, "Those who manage small things with great care are happy with heaven; those who manage great things with small care fear heaven," which is sufficient to explain the current situation. A reporter asked what attitude the government would take if the constitution passed by the National Assembly was opposed by the parties participating in this conference. Chen replied: The constitution to be formulated this time was formulated by the national representatives, therefore, this is not a question of what the government's attitude is, but what the people's attitude is.

Elections in Communist Areas Must Be Conducted in Accordance with the Constitution

Another reporter asked how the Communist issue would be resolved after the constitution was passed, and how representatives from the Communist areas would be elected, or whether representatives from the Communist areas were needed at all. Chen replied: The future election law will be based on the constitution, therefore, elections must be conducted in any area, unless the party does not recognize the people in its area as citizens. He believes that "any party should not obstruct the implementation of the constitution." A reporter asked, "I heard that the Communist Party asked the National Assembly to postpone its closing. Is this true?" and asked whether the Communist Party would participate, and what impact it would have if it did not participate. Chen replied: Regarding the former question, he had not heard of it. Regarding the latter, the National Assembly will close in a few days. Even if the Communist representatives come to participate, they may not be able to get here in time, unless they come here by rocket. He explained that the National Assembly has always reserved seats for Communist representatives. Their non-participation is a voluntary waiver, which will not have any impact on the future implementation of the constitution. Chen believes that the constitution is expected to be promulgated in January, but when it will be implemented is still to be discussed by the Assembly. Because the constitution has different chapters with different natures, it may need to be implemented in stages and cannot be exercised simultaneously. For example, Chapter 3, the National Assembly, may be implemented first. As for the term and tasks of the National Assembly representatives, although the task of this National Assembly is mainly to draft the constitution, it is not different from other National Assemblies because of the drafting of the constitution. Therefore, its term will also be extended until the date of the next National Assembly as stipulated in the constitution. After the closure of this National Assembly, although the task of drafting the constitution by the National Assembly representatives will be completed, they will still be responsible for publicizing and urging the implementation of the constitution as scheduled.

Party Affairs Meeting to Be Held After the Closure of the National Assembly

In addition to answering the above questions, Chen also talked about the future status of the Kuomintang. According to reports, after the constitution is promulgated and before the president is elected, the National Government will still have its legal status, because its task will not end until the handover is completed. This point is clearly stipulated in the Founding Program. After the government is reorganized, the status of the various institutions of the Central Party Headquarters will be different from the current one, but it will depend on how the government is reorganized. Chen confirmed that a party affairs meeting will indeed be held after the closure of the National Assembly, but believes that this is only to take advantage of the gathering of responsible persons from various local party headquarters to conduct a routine review of party affairs work. The rumor that a "party-government affairs committee" will be organized is unfounded. Regarding the question of how to raise the Kuomintang's party fees for the coming year, Chen replied that since this year, some of the party's undertakings have been gradually tightened, and the number of personnel in the Central Party Headquarters has been reduced by almost half, and the number of personnel in local party headquarters has also been greatly reduced. In the future, we will not make it possible to support the party by party members. Therefore, he believes that there will be no difficulty with the party fees.

### Martial Law in French-Controlled Areas of Vietnam; D'Argenlieu Flew Back to Saigon Yesterday; Blum Will Reiterate Compromise Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 22nd] Martial law has been declared in the French-controlled areas of northern and southern central Vietnam. The French have used loudspeakers to summon all Vietnamese supervisory troops to their posts. It is reported that anyone without a uniform who is arrested and found to be armed will be shot, and all houses that have not raised a white flag will be searched. Any house from which shots are fired will be attacked. Meanwhile, the French Air Force is currently busy destroying Vietnamese artillery positions. It is reported that in the days of fighting in Hanoi, French casualties have exceeded two hundred. Among the Vietnamese soldiers killed, Japanese corpses have been found.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] An Associated Press dispatch from Saigon reports that fierce fighting has broken out in Hue, the capital of central Vietnam, and the conflict has spread throughout Vietnam. It is reported that most civilians have fled, but some Vietnamese remain in cities inhabited by French people. The French claim that Vietnamese forces appear to be preparing to attack Hong Gai, a coal-producing center about eighty miles east of Hanoi.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 23rd] French armored vehicles and infantry units have been active in the northern Vietnamese military area since this morning, with fighting taking place near the General Post Office building and the power plant. Casualties among the overseas Chinese have not yet been estimated. The Vietnamese military radio station continues to broadcast, apparently from a mobile station. The whereabouts of the Viet Minh government are unknown after its exodus. Some former pro-Japanese Vietnamese republicans have been arrested. Mr. Livry, an official of the French Overseas Administration, has been appointed mayor of Hanoi. In addition, French forces are advancing south of the city.

[Another dispatch] Yesterday, the French civilian casualties were 29 dead, including 11 women, and 8 wounded. At the same time, a search of the Vietnamese police station revealed that 15 overseas Chinese had been brutally murdered by Vietnamese.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 23rd] French High Commissioner to Vietnam Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu flew back here today.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] According to sources close to the government, when Prime Minister Blum reports on the situation in Vietnam to the National Assembly this afternoon, he will reiterate France's determination to engage with the Viet Minh government in a spirit of the broadest possible cooperation, while protecting its legacy with the utmost determination. The Prime Minister may read out the secret telegrams exchanged between the French government and Viet Minh Republic President Ho Chi Minh. After the Prime Minister's report, the Assembly may hold a public debate.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 23rd] According to the French consulate, fighting is ongoing in the Hanoi city area, and many key Vietnamese institutions have been occupied. Ho Chi Minh's private residence and the Municipal Grand Theater have also been occupied by the French. Traffic between Hanoi and Gia Lam is still possible. French aircraft are frequently seen in the skies over Hanoi. Clashes are also taking place in Hue and Xuan An. Haiphong remains calm.

[Another dispatch] The conflict between the French and Vietnamese in Hanoi has affected public safety. The China National Aviation Corporation's scheduled flight to Hanoi today has been canceled and rerouted to Chongqing.

### American Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation; Britain, France, and the Netherlands Face Difficulties; France is Too Weak to Maintain Military Strength in Vietnam

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 22nd] Various newspapers here today commented on the situation in the Far East, unanimously believing that Britain, France, and the Netherlands are all facing difficulties, especially France. The New York Times stated that only the Netherlands has succeeded in achieving a considerable degree of coordination and stability in the Dutch East Indies. Britain itself is currently facing a severe test. But France's policy towards Vietnam is, in effect, "unending warfare." France is too weak to maintain the military strength it needs in Vietnam. Regarding the difficult situation within China, it is difficult to be optimistic, but the Soviet Union may have reason to be pleased about this. In addition, the New York World-Telegram stated that the era when white people could develop colored Asia is coming to an end. France and the Netherlands must be aware of this. As for France, it is currently struggling under very serious political difficulties, and has not made much progress in solving the subtle problems it faces. France is currently trying to replace the French Empire with the idea of a French Union, but Vietnam is unwilling to accept this idea of a federation. British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Burma should be granted independence. The Dutch Parliament also approved a plan to establish a Federation of Indonesia, still subordinate to the Dutch King. It can be seen that France's attitude cannot be compared with that of Britain and the Netherlands.

### Viet Nationalist Party Leaders Have Not Contacted Our Side

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 23rd] Regarding reports that leaders of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party are planning to form a "National Salvation Government" and intend to request mediation by China and the United States in the Vietnamese dispute, several senior Chinese government officials today denied any knowledge of this. Semi-official sources pointed out that any contact between China and any Vietnamese political group would violate the policy of the National Government, as the government hopes that France will protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Vietnam in accordance with the Sino-French Treaty signed in February of this year. At the same time, the Foreign Ministry spokesman told the press today that no leaders of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party in Nanjing have contacted the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The Chinese government has no diplomatic relations with the Viet Minh Republic. The Chinese consulate there is, in fact, only liaising with the Viet Minh authorities to protect overseas Chinese. Our government is greatly concerned about the safety of overseas Chinese. It is reported that Hue, the capital of central Vietnam, has fallen into the hands of the Vietnamese army. What will happen to the more than 10,000 overseas Chinese there? We have not yet received a report. This morning, newspapers here expressed deep concern about the safety of large numbers of overseas Chinese in Vietnam and the peace and order of the Sino-Vietnamese border, and urged the French and Vietnamese authorities to stop the expansion of the conflict and restore peace and tranquility in Southeast Asia.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] It has not yet been confirmed whether French Colonial Minister Moutet will come to Nanjing. However, it is stated that if the French side makes this decision, it will be welcomed by the Chinese government.

### The Case of Wang Shuixiang's Tragic Death: Can it Really End Without a Resolution?

The Accused Police Officer Has Already Been Restored to Freedom

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] The case of Wang Shuixiang being kicked to death has not yet been scheduled for retrial. The suspected police officer, Lin Xingji, has been released on bail of 100 yuan and has been restored to freedom. It is said that the prosecution may withdraw the case due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Wang Shuixiang's mother hosted the Hong Kong press on the 23rd, appealing for justice for the deceased.

### Two Saigon Newspapers Ordered to Cease Publication

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 23rd] "The New Era Daily" here was closed yesterday for publishing words that "incited the people to armed rebellion." "The News Daily" was also ordered to cease publication for publishing "malicious words."

### The Mayor of Zhangjiakou Has Been Internally Appointed

Zhou Jun Will Be Transferred to Director of the Political Department

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] (1) It is rumored that Chairman Chiang has internally appointed Qin Lichuan as the Mayor of Zhangjiakou and will announce it soon. The current acting mayor, Zhou Jun, will be promoted to Director of the Political Department of the Twelfth War Zone. (2) The incident in Chongli, Chahar, was extremely tragic. It is rumored that Chairman Chiang has sent Li Jiezong to Beijing to report the truth to all sectors.

### The Border Between Andong and North Korea is Peaceful; Friendly Relations Maintained Between China and the Soviet Union; Ownership of the Shuifeng Plant Will Be Negotiated

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] Andong has recently gradually become the central area for direct Sino-Soviet military and political negotiations in the Northeast, which has attracted much attention. On the 21st, when the reporter was in Andong, the Soviet military authorities in North Korea sent a letter to the Andong military authorities, informing them that a plane from Pyongyang had mistakenly landed in Pinggui, and they had helped it to fly back. Our side replied with a letter of thanks. At the same time, the Soviet side had previously agreed that both sides should avoid shooting at each other. This may refer to the fact that when our army first arrived in Andong, shots were fired aimlessly from the opposite bank. For more than fifty days, both sides have been able to maintain friendship and tranquility. However, recently the Soviet side seems to be avoiding too close contact with us. When Qu Kai, the Deputy Commander of our Garrison, intended to visit Korea, the Soviet side politely declined, saying that the senior officer was ill and that any matters could be notified in writing. There are currently 1,750 Koreans in Andong, but they cannot be repatriated because they are registered in North Korea. At the same time, people still cross the Yalu River at night illegally. We have captured several people who said that they came here because they could not bear the oppression. The actual situation is unknown. It was previously rumored that about 20,000 Communist troops had retreated from Andong to Sinuiju, but it is said that there were actually only 500 or 600 people, mostly Communist administrative personnel. Also, regarding the request to evacuate the dozen or so Soviet troops stationed at Lagu Outpost on our bank of the Yalu River, more than a hundred miles northeast of Andong City, the Soviet side said that it would decide after consulting with higher authorities. Lagu Outpost is the location of the Shuifeng Dam. Andong City is currently supplied with 3,000 kilowatts of electricity daily from Shuifeng, and it will soon be increased by 2,000 kilowatts, but this is exchanged for food. It is reported that our electricity authorities in Changchun have obtained the Shuifeng contract signed by Manchukuo and Korea in the 26th year of the Republic of China. The ownership of the Shuifeng plant is half each for Manchukuo and Korea, and the validity period is 35 years. Our diplomatic authorities will negotiate with the Soviet Union based on this contract.

### The Soviet Garrison Authorities in Dalian Refuse American Reporters to Land; American Boat Warned for Exceeding Anchorage Time Limit

[Agence France-Presse, From this port] American reporter Newton telegraphed from Dalian that a US Navy landing craft, carrying a diplomatic courier and supplies for the US Consulate in Dalian, arrived in Dalian on the 18th of this month. It was allowed to anchor for 48 hours, but because it exceeded the time limit by two hours, the Soviet military authorities issued a "verbal ultimatum," and the boat left Dalian Harbor on the 20th. In addition to one diplomatic courier, there was also a representative of Mobil Oil, Paul, and two journalists. However, the Soviet authorities had not been notified of these three people beforehand. Therefore, after the boat docked in Dalian on the 18th, the Soviet side only allowed it to anchor for 48 hours and allowed the US naval officer and the diplomatic courier to disembark. Paul and the two reporters were not allowed to land. The US Consul General in Dalian, Penning Holf, applied to the Soviet military commander, Major General Kochernov, to allow them to land, but the commander sent his adjutant to the US landing craft and told them that "if you do not leave Dalian Harbor within 20 minutes, we will not be responsible for the consequences." At that time, the boat had exceeded the time limit by two hours. The boat captain, White, and the diplomatic courier, Powell, were still waiting for the Consul General's negotiation results at the Consulate General. They hurried back to the boat and immediately set sail to leave the port. Regarding the fact that the three were not allowed to land, the US Consul General in Dalian, Penning Holf, had previously negotiated with the Soviet Consul General in Dalian, Petrov. According to the Soviet Consul General, this matter must be applied for with the Soviet garrison authorities, but to allow them to land, it must be requested from Moscow first. As a result, it was not achieved.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The State Department declined to comment on the report from Dalian that Soviet officials there had verbally delivered an ultimatum to an American ship.

### Flying Clothes for Winter; Marshal Ma Does His Best to Help; The Executive Yuan Relief Administration Will Send Personnel to Communist Areas

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] The North China Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration was ordered to airlift over 1,200 tons of emergency clothing to the Communist areas of western and southern Hebei, requiring 80 planes to transport it four times. Although it was scheduled to be handled in early January, the branch has not yet signed a lease agreement with the US military authorities stationed in Tianjin due to some technical issues. When Marshall visited Tianjin last time, he expressed his willingness to do his best to help the Executive Yuan Relief Administration in this endeavor, so only gasoline costs would be charged. The branch is discussing distribution technology problems with Huang Hua, the Communist Party person in charge of the military, and in principle, the Executive Yuan Relief Administration will still send working teams to the Communist areas to personally handle the distribution.

### Rebar Ordered for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd] The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau recently ordered more than 60 tons of rebar under one inch from the Southwest Office of the Resources Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, at a cost of more than 1.1 million yuan per ton. This batch of rebar will be transported to the construction site for use in the near future.

### A Bloodshed Incident Occurred in Suzhou; Conflict Between Wounded Soldiers and City Defense Troops; Trouble Arising from Accumulated Resentment Due to Lack of Tickets for Watching a Play

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 23rd] A major bloodshed incident occurred in Suzhou today. It was a tragedy caused by mutual fighting between city defense troops and wounded soldiers from the No. 102 Rear Hospital. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. The reporter of this newspaper rushed to the conflict area to investigate the truth at the time of the incident. The details are recorded as follows:

Gunfire at the Theater: At about 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd, just as the first showing was about to end at the various theaters in Beiju, a gunshot suddenly rang out in the Suzhou Theater. In an instant, several wounded soldiers and youth army soldiers responsible for discipline clashed in the Youth Club Film Department and the Suzhou Theater. Before long, the guard team of the Guanzheng police area, after hearing the news, rushed to the scene fully armed, led by platoon leaders Zhang Zonghai and Yang Hongying, with more than a dozen troops. However, the wounded soldiers had gathered about forty or fifty people, and the situation was turbulent and could not be suppressed. At this time, the youth army soldiers Yu Gang and Huang Yuzhou, who first participated in the fight, were seriously injured and fell to the ground. Seeing this, the guard cadres were unable to restrain their anger, and the tragedy began. For a time, gunshots were continuous, pedestrians scurried to hide, and the Beiju area suddenly entered a state of war. After the local police station telegraphed the relevant parties, Battalion Commander Yao Depei of the Military Police, Chief of Staff Lei Kaixuan of the City Defense Department, and Dean Zheng Zukui of the Rear Hospital all rushed to the scene one after another.

Many Deaths and Injuries: At that time, the cadres of both sides were still deadlocked. The wounded soldiers believed that four of their companions had been killed, including Ku Zhiming, Luo Zhaojin, and Zhang Qinghan, and one person, Mo Youlin, was seriously injured, causing their emotions to be angered and they swore not to retreat. Battalion Commander Yao Depei took emergency measures and agreed to detain platoon leaders Zhang Zonghai and Yang Hongying to appease the crowd. At the same time, Dean Zheng Zukui also gave earnest explanations and persuaded them to return. The wounded soldiers then lined up and left the scene. Chief of Staff Lei Kaixuan, in order to prevent accidents, issued a curfew order, cutting off traffic in the Beiju area. The wounded were sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, and the Wudi Procuratorate was telegraphed to send personnel to examine the bodies. At that time, it was suddenly reported that Jiao Huanian, a messenger of the Youth Army, had encountered several wounded soldiers at Chayuan Changkou and was seriously injured, and two others were missing. Eight rifles and two Thompson guns were taken. Lei and Zheng then issued orders to their subordinates, respectively, to prohibit them from going out. At the same time, it was also found that Chen Zuer, the owner of a fruit stall in front of the Daguangming Theater, was hit in the right waist by a stray bullet, and his injuries were critical. He was also ordered to be sent to Bohong Hospital for treatment.

Deliberating on the Aftermath: After the various parties made proper arrangements, Battalion Commander Yao invited Lei and Chen to gather at the Beiju Military Police Team to deliberate on the aftermath. It was decided that (1) the bodies would be buried generously, and preferential treatment would be given to the Zheng family. (2) In the future, disciplinary work will be jointly maintained by the military police. (3) The issue of responsibility will be reported to the superiors and await disposition. Reporters from this newspaper separately interviewed the three gentlemen and inquired about the causes of the incident. Chief of Staff Lei Kaixuan replied: The headquarters is responsible for city defense and strictly prohibits military personnel from watching plays without tickets. The intention is to sympathize with business difficulties, which has caused a lot of resentment with the wounded soldiers for more than half a month. In addition, on the 21st, two wounded soldiers strongly demanded to watch a play without tickets. After being detained by the inspection team, the wounded soldier hospital was telegraphed to take them away for control. The fuse lies here. Before the incident, the headquarters had learned that they were planning to cause a major riot, so it had already ordered the inspection soldiers not to interfere any more in order to ease the situation. Unfortunately, the tragedy still broke out. However, according to reports from various parties, the wounded soldiers did have firearms and snatched weapons, and first shot and wounded the headquarters soldiers. Also, an hour after the incident, gunshots were also found on Pishi Street, which was definitely not done by the youth army units. Moreover, the total number of wounded soldiers in Suzhou reached more than a thousand people. Looking at today's momentum, the number of people dispatched was around two hundred. Next, Dean Zheng Zukui stated: It is extremely difficult to manage wounded soldiers, because they are loyal to the country, but their current lives are difficult, which affects their emotions and makes them irritable. The detention of the two wounded soldier leaders by the youth army the day before yesterday was the main reason for the tragedy. I had heard rumors in advance, so after 2:00 p.m. today, I went to the various theaters to observe and advised the wounded soldiers watching the play to return to the hospital. Seeing that the situation was calm, I returned first. However, I heard the police in the middle of the road and rushed to the scene. I only saw about forty or fifty wounded soldiers. They have now all returned. As for having firearms and snatching weapons, I don’t think the wounded soldiers would have done this. Battalion Commander Yao Depei stated: The tragedy happened suddenly, and the military police were unable to stop it, which is indeed regrettable. Fortunately, it has now subsided, and there is absolutely no problem in maintaining law and order. The public can rest assured. The two detained platoon leaders will be sent to the city defense department for interrogation.

State of Martial Law: Finally, Chief of Staff Lei stated that Zheng Chenjun, Deputy Director of the Youth Army Division, stated that he would do his best to maintain the security of Suzhou. The reporter asked when the curfew order would be lifted. He said that after the examination is completed and the bodies are encoffined, traffic will be restored. At about 10:00 p.m., the Beiju area was still under curfew. Because Commander Cao Yongxiang of the City Defense Command was away on official business, it is still difficult to determine how the aftermath will be handled.

### The Main Culprits in the Wanbaoshan Incident, Hao Yongde, etc., Have Been Concluded After Investigation; The Changchun District Prosecutor's Office Has Filed a Public Prosecution

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] The main culprits in the Wanbaoshan Incident, the prelude to the "September 18th" Incident, Hao Yongde and others, were reported by the Changchun Garrison Command in June of this year and handed over to the Changchun District Prosecutor's Office. The investigation has now been completed. The defendants Hao Yongde and others have confessed to organizing the Changan Rice Company, arresting Koreans, relying on Japanese power, and oppressing landlord Sun Yongqing and other facts. The District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution with the Changchun District Court. The content of the case is that the defendant Hao Yongde bribed the deceased Changchun County Magistrate Ma Yiyuan in March of the 20th year of the Republic of China to organize the Changan Rice Company. The defendant Zeng Yanshi acted as guarantor to lease more than 500 acres of land in the Majia Shaokou area of Changchun County and sublet it to Koreans to grow rice. Because the defendants Bian Xiangren, Li Zaohe, Liu Longhua, and Lin Zhentai had led 188 Koreans to dig ditches to divert water there, it caused a dispute between the local people and the Koreans on July 1. At that time, our side, according to the Gando Convention of September 4, 1909, which "prohibited Koreans from residing and renting land," negotiated with Japan, but the Japanese side did not show the convention and sent police to protect the Koreans in digging the ditch and fired at our people. At the same time, Japan expanded its propaganda, resulting in a Chinese exclusion massacre in Korea. Later, the water diversion ditch in the area was finally dug under the protection of the Japanese police. The incident was not resolved until the "September 18th" Incident.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Donates Public Funds to Aid Xiaguan Refugees

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] Madame Chiang Kai-shek recently donated all of her allowances as a National Assembly delegate, including food and lodging expenses, totaling over one million yuan, to the refugees in Xiaguan for relief. The matter has been handled on her behalf by the General Affairs Office of the National Assembly.

### Traitor Luo Junqiang's Third Trial Postponed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 23rd] The third public trial of traitor Luo Junqiang, originally scheduled for the 26th, has been postponed. It is reported that although the document from the Anhui Provincial Government concerning the investigation of Luo's crimes, as requested by the High Court, has arrived, it only states that personnel have been dispatched to the Sixth District Administrative Office in Wuhu to investigate. The public trial and commencement of arguments can only proceed after the results of the investigation arrive, thus inevitably delaying the trial.

### Female Traitor Ke Jinfeng Escorted from Shanghai to Hankou

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 23rd] The notorious female traitor Ke Jinfeng, also known as Tan Xiaojiao, has recently been escorted to Hankou from Shanghai. Ke is the adopted daughter of the traitor Chu Minyi. She colluded with enemy forces to kill our underground workers in Hankou.

### Editorial: Concerning the Situation in Vietnam

We are deeply concerned about the recent developments in Vietnam. As of this writing, news from Vietnam and about the Vietnamese situation is quite confusing. All we know is that armed conflicts are taking place throughout northern Vietnam, and the bloodshed has not stopped. However, another publication reports that the French government has ordered French troops in Vietnam to surrender to the Viet Minh government to prevent a massacre of the French in Vietnam. Contrary to this news, Reuters reports that the 25th Parachute Division of the French army stationed in Tunisia has been ordered to reinforce the French defense forces in Vietnam. It is reported that the armed conflict has spread to Hanoi, Tonkin, and even throughout Cochinchina, with many casualties on both the French and Vietnamese sides. It is currently difficult to determine the true situation in Vietnam; however, according to news released by the French, the conflicts in Hanoi and Tokyo have gradually been quelled. But whether this is a true reflection of the development of the situation is difficult for us to judge at this moment.

At this time, three aspects of the reports are worth our attention: (1) Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Tunis reported on the 21st that the Governor of Vietnam, Vice Admiral d'Argenlieu, who was passing through on his way to Vietnam, told reporters that he was deeply sorry that the recent events in Vietnam occurred during his absence; therefore, his knowledge of the situation in Vietnam was very limited; (2) French Colonial Minister Moutet has left France for Vietnam to investigate the Franco-Vietnamese conflict and will come to Nanjing in the future "to pay a courtesy visit to Chairman Chiang and to request that China faithfully adhere to its promise to maintain neutrality in the Vietnamese conflict." (3) According to an AFP report, the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, former Foreign Minister of the Viet Minh Republic, Ge Yingtongdan, is now in Nanjing and told AFP reporters that the Vietnamese "National Front Government" has been formed and will announce the location of the new government at an appropriate time, which the AFP reporter speculates is likely to be in Nanjing. Its four major policies are: (1) The United States and China should mediate to initiate negotiations with France and ensure that any agreement reached will be immediately implemented; (2) The Viet Minh must become a truly free state within the Vietnamese Federation and the French Federation, with its territory including all three parts of Vietnam; (3) The Viet Minh must have a proportionate number of representatives in the Vietnamese Federal Council; the chairman of the council will be French, but his powers will be similar to those of a British commissioner in Australia; (4) French troops may occupy certain specific locations within the Viet Minh, but must withdraw from these locations within five years. All economic and cultural interests of the French in the Viet Minh will be faithfully guaranteed by the Viet Minh government.

From the above, we can see that the French governor in Vietnam knows very little about the recent turmoil in Vietnam; although this may be a formality, it is not objectionable in itself. We do not know whether AFP's report on the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party has other intentions; however, we are surprised by the moderate attitude they hold in the four major policies of the so-called Vietnamese "National Front Government" it released. Today, India is demanding independence, Burma is demanding independence, and even the Dutch East Indies are demanding independence; but Vietnam can be satisfied with a position that is roughly equivalent to a "dominion" within the British Empire, that is, a so-called autonomous region, which seems quite thought-provoking. To say that the Vietnamese people have no national awakening, there are many patriots who have sacrificed themselves for their country, and many have been exiled by the French authorities in Vietnam to barren areas full of epidemics and miasma, such as Devil's Island in South America and desert islands in the Pacific, for Vietnam. They do not hesitate to endure humiliation to death for the righteousness of their motherland. If the Vietnamese nationalists are aware of the real environment of the current international political situation and therefore do not make far-reaching demands based on ideals, then we do not understand why the enlightened Fourth French Republic government does not adopt these moderate demands, but instead has to create bloody incidents.

However, what we cannot help but say is about the visit of the French Colonial Minister. This minister is coming to the East to investigate the Franco-Vietnamese conflict and will also come to China "to pay a courtesy visit to Chairman Chiang," and "intends to ask China to abide by its promise to remain neutral in the Vietnamese conflict." We do not want to question the truthfulness of this report; what we cannot help but state here is that regardless of the government's attitude, the Chinese people's attitude in the Vietnamese conflict is not neutral. We do not deny where our sympathy lies. Our government has the right to weigh and decide on its attitude towards the Vietnamese incident, and we do not want to say much about it here. But the Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are as close as brothers, and we are naturally very concerned about their welfare. We seem to have experienced the experiences of the Vietnamese people in the past few decades; therefore, the Chinese people understand the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people most and have great sympathy for them. Therefore, we feel regret for the French army's attempt to use force to defeat the national movement of the Vietnamese people, for the sake of France itself.

When the New York People's Voice Forum newspaper discussed France's policy in the Far East, it said: "The era when whites can develop the colored people of Asia is about to pass; France must know this; in terms of France, it is currently struggling hard in a very serious political difficulty, and has not yet made significant progress on the subtle issues it should resolve. France is now trying to replace the French Empire with the concept of the French Federation, but Vietnam does not want to accept this concept. Judging from British Prime Minister Attlee's announcement in the House of Commons that Burma should be granted independence, and the Dutch Parliament's approval of the plan to establish the Indonesian Federation, which still belongs to the King of the Netherlands, it can be seen that France's attitude cannot be compared with that of Britain and the Netherlands." This is indeed a fair judgment. If the Vietnam issue is not properly resolved, it will leave future troubles for peace in the Far East. Therefore, we must urge the French government to properly handle the Vietnam issue; otherwise, the Vietnamese situation is related to the international situation, and all nations that care about world peace cannot allow this situation to continue to drag on.

### The Old Course of the Lower Yellow River Has Not Been Dredged; The Breach at Zhongmou Must Be Quickly Blocked To Avoid Catastrophic Disasters for Dozens of Counties in Shandong Province; The Shandong Provincial United Association of Fellow Villagers in Jinan Petitions Again

[Our Jinan Dispatch] Shandong Province is located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and has long been known as a dangerous area. The northwestern counties, from Jiyang to Lijin County, where the river flows into the sea, are the tail end of the Yellow River, with many dangerous works. Since the breach at Zhongmou, the Shandong section of the Yellow River has existed in name only, and the river water is almost dried up. Since the victory, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has been engaged in blocking the breach and restoring the dikes. However, because the section from Jiyang to the estuary is the "Liberated Area" of the Communists, the restored dike bodies are loose and thin, and the estuary has not been dredged. The Shandong Northwest Counties Fellow Villagers Association in Jinan is concerned that once the Huayuankou breach is blocked and closed, the Yellow River will return to its old course, and the main stream will flow eastward, which may lead to danger. They have petitioned the Provincial Assembly, requesting that the blocking of the Zhongmou breach be temporarily delayed until the riverbed and dikes are fully excavated and repaired and the estuary is unblocked. The Shandong Provincial United Association of Fellow Villagers in Jinan, following the demands of the people, has again telegraphed the central government, requesting consideration for the lives and property of the people in dozens of counties downstream, and that the blocking of the breach be temporarily delayed until the dike restoration project is completed and consolidated. They also plan to present a petition in person, preparing to petition all relevant parties, the Yellow River Breach Blocking and Dike Restoration Engineering Bureau, and the inspection personnel of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission when they arrive in Jinan. The petition roughly states: The old course of the Yellow River, and the dikes in the lower reaches of Shandong, have been extremely damaged during the war. The river excavation and dike repair project from Jiyang to Lijin was handled by the so-called Liberated Area's Labor Mobilization Office, and the dike bodies are extremely loose. The excavation of silted riverbeds is also very narrow, and although the two banks are vertical and the shape is beautiful, using them as the Yellow River waterway is prone to scouring and collapse. Once water is released eastward, the main stream will scour, and danger may occur soon. These hasty projects may be effective for defense works, but it is doubtful whether they can withstand the turbulent Yellow River, and there is a risk of causing danger and submerging the lives and property of millions of people in dozens of counties downstream. Furthermore, in river management, dredging the estuary is the most important. If the estuary is not clear, no matter how wide the river is, it is difficult to accommodate the Yellow River, which originates thousands of miles away. Since the Yellow River changed its course from Tie menguan into the sea in the fifth year of the Qing Xianfeng reign, the estuary has shifted more than ten times before the war, all because the iron plate sand at the mouth of the river was silted up and the water flow was not smooth. The riverbed is prone to overflowing, and there are often dangers of breaching. The estuary must naturally change its course at any time and overflow into the sea. There are no formal estuaries in the two to three hundred miles above the estuary, allowing it to overflow freely, and there are no dikes to confine the water and scour the sand. This time, the Yellow River restoration project in the so-called Liberated Area's river excavation and dike repair project is extremely hasty, and no attention has been paid to the main project of dredging the estuary. Once the Huayuankou breach is blocked and closed, not only will there be danger on both banks of the river, but the silting of the estuary will easily cause accidents in the entire river. The counties in northern and southwestern Shandong are close to the Yellow River and have a greater stake in it, facing major dangers, so they cannot remain silent. To prevent future dangers, and for the safety of the lives and property of millions of people, they jointly petition, requesting that it be forwarded to the central government to show compassion for the people of dozens of counties: (1) Temporarily delay the blocking of the Huayuankou breach. (2) Excavate and repair the riverbed dikes from Jiyang to Lijin thoroughly and carefully. (3) Build solid dikes on both sides of the estuary, extending directly to the coast, confining the water and scouring the sand, and widening the excavation of the estuary. (4) Prepare ten dredgers to be used after the water is released to continuously dredge the silted riverbed and estuary all year round, once and for all. After the above four items are completed, the Huayuankou breach will be blocked and closed, etc.

### Tax Collectors in the Countryside of Wuxi Engage in Embezzlement and Malpractice; Collude with Remnants of Traitors and Illegally Set Up Branch Checkpoints

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The County Tax Collection Office recently received a confidential report, learning that more than ten of its license tax collectors dispatched to Huangbudun, including Li Haoqing and Shen Qingyuan, were extorting license fees from boatmen and colluding with former inspectors from the enemy puppet period to illegally set up branch checkpoints at Huinong Bridge, Qingming Bridge, etc. In addition to collecting the prescribed fees from passing boatmen, they also overcharged fees four or five times higher than the original rate, which they pocketed privately or divided among themselves. After an investigation by dispatched personnel confirmed the facts, a request was submitted to County Magistrate Xu, who ordered the dispatch of political police to the destinations, and Li Haoqing and other ten people were arrested one after another. On the 21st, they were all transferred to the Procuratorate of the local court for interrogation. Prosecutor Shen opened the court and questioned them one by one. Li and the others all confessed to illegally setting up branch checkpoints and overcharging taxes. As a result, the court ordered them all to be detained pending review.

### Eight Criminals Executed by Firing Squad in Nantong Murder and Robbery Case

[Our Nantong Dispatch] The murder and robbery case at Jiangjia Bridge East, which shocked the city of Nantong, was solved on November 6. The chief of the Eighth District, Meng Jie, presented the murderers Yang Xuegao and others to the county government, who were then transferred to the First Pacification Headquarters for interrogation. According to the confessions of the criminals, they conspired to block and strangle cloth merchants Yuan Fengen, Qiu Deyan, Guo Zhaokang, Fan Shilin, and other four people. A total of sixteen male and female suspects were arrested in the case. The main criminals Shi Fengzhang and Qian Zongyi were at large and have not been apprehended after searching. The case has been finalized by the First Pacification Area Headquarters.

### Elementary School Textbooks Are Being Improved

Regarding Mr. Yu Jingfen's article "Elementary School Textbooks Urgently Need Improvement" published previously in this newspaper, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau has sent a letter stating: (1) Poor Paper and Blurry Printing: The Ministry of Education has stipulated paper and printing conditions for the current series of elementary school textbooks to ensure clarity and avoid damaging children's eyesight. The Shanghai United Supply Office also pays attention to this. Therefore, the names of the printing houses are listed in the lower right corner of the copyright page of each book, such as "Commercial Press," "Zhonghua," and "Zhengzhong," to facilitate identification and show responsibility. In addition to informing the seven joint supply offices to improve the cover by using thicker paper and striving for excellence, it is hoped that schools will compare the paper and printing of the books printed by various publishing houses when adopting textbooks and choose the best ones to promote competition among the publishing houses and strive for improvement. (2) Too Many Typos and Different Editions: The elementary school textbooks supplied by Shanghai in the autumn of last year and the spring of this year were the standard editions during the Anti-Japanese War. The editions supplied in the autumn of this year should be the revised standard editions after the victory. Most of the anti-Japanese war materials have been deleted and replaced with nation-building materials. Schools should pay attention to the "Revised Standard Edition" printed on the cover of the textbooks when selecting books to avoid buying old versions. The revised standard edition was rushed in Shanghai during the summer vacation. Due to time constraints, there were many typesetting errors. In addition to publishing corrections in Shen Bao, a dedicated errata sheet has been printed and submitted to provincial and municipal education bureaus for distribution to schools for correction to avoid misleading. The seven United Supply Offices have also been notified to modify the printing plates to ensure that there are no more errors in the books printed in the next edition. (3) Outdated Content: The Ministry-compiled textbooks covered the five years leading up to and during World War II, during which domestic and international situations changed significantly. Therefore, the elementary school general knowledge curriculum has been revised four times in five years, which is largely able to adapt to the times. Regular revisions and up-to-date teaching materials are one of the advantages of the Ministry-compiled textbooks. However, the situation is different for geography textbooks. Their revision must wait for definitive data before it can begin. Therefore, although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly ordered revisions, only partial corrections have been made to the original book, and it has not been submitted for typesetting and printing. For example, regarding the division of Northeast China into nine provinces mentioned by Mr. Yu, although there are names for the nine provinces to date, the provincial boundaries, area under jurisdiction, and population of the nine provinces have not been determined. (The descriptions of the division of the nine provinces in Northeast China published in various newspapers are not official announcements, and textbooks must be included after the central government publishes them.) It cannot be included. The bureau is in constant contact with the Ministry of Interior. However, as of recently (the official letter from the Ministry of Interior still states: "Regarding the provincial boundaries of the provinces in Northeast China, this Ministry has drafted a revised plan for the new province regions of Northeast China and submitted it for approval, which will be announced upon approval," etc., so the revision of this point still requires some time. In addition, the boundary lines of Outer Mongolia, the borders of European countries, and the jurisdiction of islands in Africa and the Pacific have not been determined and can only be temporarily postponed. For all these changes in current affairs, it is hoped that teachers in various schools will supplement them temporarily during teaching to make up for the lack of teaching materials. The above points are of concern to more than just Mr. Yu. Please develop them and inform the educators.

### Bevin Delivers Radio Address, Emphasizes Lasting World Peace

Says China with its Long History will surely be unified, Britain Located between US and Soviet Union has a Positive Strength

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a radio address tonight, strongly stating his deep conviction that China will surely be unified. With its long-standing philosophy and experience, it will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the world's restoration. He said: "I believe we have entered the first stage of establishing coordination and harmony among the powers. What is the reason for this? First, we have reached an agreement on the first batch of peace treaties, namely the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. Second, we are forming an organization that will enable the United Nations to follow in their mutual relations and to maintain peace. Although we have won the victory, the cost has been enormous, with heavy losses in manpower and material resources, which are difficult to estimate. However, we are now clear about the shortcomings of the old League of Nations and have organized the United Nations to take its place, which is a pleasant thing after the war. Although the United Nations organization is not yet perfect, it should be gradually improved in the future. As far as Britain itself is concerned, we have decided to base our future relations with the world on the resolutions of the United Nations. There are three main conditions for the current policy: first, to make the armaments of all countries unnecessary; second, to achieve a state of peace that allows human thought to turn to economic and cultural development; and third, to enable all countries to enjoy all the natural resources of the world."

Regarding the Trieste Free Territory problem, the special zone is where the Latin and Slavic peoples meet. The Five Powers have done their utmost to minimize the number of Italians under Slavic rule. Conversely, the number of Slavs under American rule has also been minimized. The establishment of an international area should create a meeting point.

As for the German question, we will create a situation in Germany that allows the German people to regain their original self-esteem. But the German people must know that it will take a considerable amount of time for this situation to arise. The situation in Germany has been affected by Hitler's rule. It may take decades to restore it to normal. The next meeting of the four foreign ministers has now been scheduled for March 20th in Moscow, where the future of Germany and Austria will be discussed.

Regarding economic systems, countries are different. For example, the United States is a country of free enterprise, while the Soviet Union has developed a different economic system. Unfortunately, it suffered terrible losses due to German aggression, which almost completely destroyed the great achievements it had made since the October Revolution. As for France, it has been invaded three times and can still demonstrate its permanent principles of freedom before the countries of the world, which is commendable.

As for China, it has resisted for the longest time, and even today, internal strife continues, which is regrettable. But China will surely be unified, and its long-standing philosophy and experience will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the world's revival. There is no doubt about this. The United States and the Soviet Union have gained an advantage because of World War II. As for Britain, it is located in the middle. All these developments are sufficient to prove that the policies adopted by Britain after the end of the war have a positive force. Some aspects have criticized Britain's relationship with the United States as being too close, while its relationship with the Soviet Union is not close enough, which may lead to a third world war. You must have heard of this argument. In fact, Britain has not allowed itself to be bound by any country. Britain is sincerely willing to extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to all countries in the world. I believe that the Soviet Union fully understands that all countries in the world are prepared to cooperate with Britain and are willing to see the Soviet Union develop its system in its own way. We are not only creating peace for the people of today, but also creating peace for future generations, so we must proceed slowly and strive for perfection. I hope the people of the whole country will be patient and not impatient."

### Truman's Christmas Message: May the People of Our Country Continue to Work Hard and Strive to Enable the People of the World to Share Peace

[United States Information Service, Washington, 22nd] President Truman issued the following Christmas message to the worldwide American armed forces: "I am very pleased to take this opportunity to congratulate you on the Christmas holiday. We are now engaged in a great struggle to create a just and lasting peace for all countries and nations in the world, today and tomorrow. To accomplish our mission, we need our armed forces, both men and women, to have the same contributions and the same lofty ideals as you have always shown. Peace-loving people all over the world prayed for victory in the war in the dark past, and now they are praying for harmony and tranquility on earth. Their prayers will surely succeed. I want to express the nation's deep gratitude for the role you have played, and I hope that our gratitude can compensate you for the regret of being away from home and spending this Christmas abroad. May you all have a Merry Christmas."

Aimed at Preventing War, Not Engaging in New Wars

At the same time, Secretary of the Army Patterson and Chief of Staff Eisenhower also sent telegrams to American troops around the world, the content of which is as follows: Patterson telegraphed: "On this Christmas holiday, I would like to express my sincere greetings and regards to all military and civilian personnel around the world, and thank you for your faithful service over the past year. This has been a difficult year, but you have gloriously completed this arduous task. You have shown the courage, wisdom, and dedication of soldiers, which has made you famous on the battlefield and has earned you praise and respect. Your work at home and abroad still upholds the best military traditions."

Eisenhower telegraphed: "You are all soldiers, and you are all engaged in a certain mission, engaged in establishing and maintaining a certain situation to promote the spirit of Christmas so that it can be widely spread throughout the world. No matter where you are stationed and what kind of work you are engaged in, you are all maintainers of peace. Because of your efforts, we can fully celebrate this Christmas and the Christmases in the future and be spared the horrors of war. Although past achievements show that you must be perfect in technology, discipline, and spirit, your basic goal should be to prevent war, not to engage in war. I would like to express my sincere greetings and regards to all personnel belonging to the armed forces of this country."

### Britain and the Soviet Union Conclude Agreement to Open Trade in Occupied Zones

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd, United Press] British authorities here announced that Britain and the Soviet Union have signed an agreement to open trade in the occupied zones of the two countries, and the American occupied zone will automatically participate. The validity of this agreement is said to be the spring of 1947. British authorities also specifically stated that although the American authorities did not participate in the signing, they assisted in the completion of this agreement and approved it.

According to the agreement, the British and American occupied zones will transport 130,000 tons of steel, 15,000 sets of tires, and 500 horses to the Soviet occupied zone. The Soviet Union will weave 42,000 tons of potatoes, 34,000 tons of wheat, and 9,000 tons of sugar to the British and American occupied zones.

### Turkey Launches Organization, Middle East Peace Group, News from London is Ambiguous, Soviet Union has Paid Close Attention

[United Press, San Francisco, 22nd] Turkish people in London quietly confirmed that Turkey is exploring the possibility of Arab countries and Turkey forming a Middle East peace consultation country. Although the rumors are slow and unclear, they have been difficult to escape Moscow's attention. The Communist Party's "Pravda" immediately criticized Turkey, accusing Turkish leaders of pursuing dangerous policies, wanting to expand the scope of dangerous activities, and falling into the trap of foreign imperialist forces. The Soviet Union's rapid response is obviously a warning to Turkey to mind its own business. Whether Turkey's plan can be realized is another question, but "Pravda" believes that Turkey is trying to form a group of Arab countries, with the non-Arab Turkey as its leader.

### Our Country's Female Scientist Discovers New Fission of Uranium

Results of Hard Work by Qian Sanqiang and his Wife

[British Information Service, London, 23rd] The science editor of News Chronicle wrote: "A Chinese female scientist, working at the Curie Laboratory of the French University of Paris one night, discovered a new fission of uranium, which has attracted the close attention of atomic physicists. She discovered a new atomic phenomenon under a microscope, that is, the uranium atom splits into four parts instead of the original split into two parts. So far, it has been generally recognized in the research of atomic bombs that there are two-part splits. The significance of this new discovery is still in progress, but it has opened up a new way for scientists engaged in research. This discovery was made by Dr. Powell at the University of Bristol, who made a photographic plate to reveal the shape of atomic molecules. He Cifeng's husband, Dr. Qian Sanqiang (son of Qian Xuantong), spent a month in Bristol studying the technology for the discovery of "four-part split." After Dr. Qian returned to Paris, he used a specially made photographic plate rich in silver. He coated the photographic plate with uranium salt and caused it to explode with neutral electrons of atomic molecules. Under a high-power microscope, he found traces in the fragments split by neutral electrons on the left side of the photographic plate. Dr. Qian said: "On the evening of November 22, my wife discovered that a photographic plate was quite different. When placed under a microscope, it was found that there were four black lines from one point. Two of the lines were longer and two were shorter. The next day, the equal black lines were confirmed. After careful study, the equal poles were satisfied, because the performance of the four molecules was actually equal to 100 million watts."

### Second Christmas Message After the War: May Peace Reign Throughout the World

According to United Press reports, at least ten countries are still bleeding in a war-torn world...

[United Press, London, 22nd] The second Christmas of Jesus after World War II in the 20th century, peace on earth is still an unrealized ideal. Even though the United Nations organization is striving for lasting peace, according to a report from United Press, at least ten countries are still bleeding. The war between the Iranian government forces and the autonomous forces of the Azerbaijan province supported by the Soviet Union has not been stopped for long. The following is the latest situation in various countries in Europe and the Near East:

Greece In fact, the civil war is still going on in northern Greece. Guerrillas, who the government side refers to as communists, attack in groups, each group ranging from one hundred to one thousand people. Their weapons include mortars, heavy machine guns, and automatic rifles. They attack mountain police teams and sentinel posts and villages, and government forces also retaliate against them. Communist newspapers call this movement "resistance to monarch fascism," which is completely out of the spontaneity of the people and has nothing to do with foreign countries. The Greek government, which has the closest relationship with Britain, said that these bandits are receiving supplies and instructions from Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania, but Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania categorically deny it.

Poland The Polish interim government, which leans towards the Soviet Union, still has an underground army trying to overthrow it, and the domestic war is intermittent. In addition, Ukrainian nationalists occasionally attack at night, and the government side deals with it. The two largest anti-government underground organizations in Poland, one is the "National Armed Forces" and the other is the "Freedom and Independence Army," have a strength of about 15,000 to 100,000 people. They have announced that their purpose is to use sabotage, looting, armed attacks on government agencies, assassination of government officials, and Soviet soldiers to overthrow the current government. According to an official announcement from Poland, more than 8,000 officials have been killed in a year. Since liberation, the number of casualties among the Polish government forces has been nearly 4,000. The number of casualties on the underground organization side is much higher. The underground troops mostly use forests as their haunts. As for the Ukrainians, they saw that Poland had signed an agreement with the Soviet Union last year, stipulating that 434,000 Ukrainians in Poland would be moved to the Soviet Union, and the vacated land would be inhabited by Poles, which aroused the opposition of the Ukrainians. At that time, about 2,000 Ukrainians rode on horses and motor vehicles and broke into Poland at night, burning, killing, and looting, causing 141,000 Poles in the San River area to become homeless.

Palestine The British garrison's conflict with Jews and Arabs has made Palestine a troubled area. More than 350,000 people have been killed this year, and property losses are estimated at more than 10 million US dollars. The Jews mostly want to establish a Jewish homeland. The Arabs mostly want to establish an independent country and enjoy the rights of the majority. Britain also wants to maintain peace and maintain the military stronghold in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Jews ignore immigration restrictions and try to enter Palestine, causing conflicts with the army. The Jewish secret terrorist group buried landmines on the highway, attacked cars, and blew up public buildings, trapping the British army.

Egypt Nationalist demonstrations oppose the continued stationing of British troops in Egypt. Students and other demonstrators have sporadic clashes with the military police. This spring's demonstrations caused clashes with British troops and overthrew a government. At the same time, grenades were thrown at police stations and British troops' taverns and restaurants. The number of Egyptian troops is estimated to be between 60,000 and 80,000. The British troops stationed in Egypt are much larger than this number. British troops have agreed to withdraw from the Suez Canal area before March 1947. According to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance, Britain may station a limited military force in Egypt until 1956, but according to the pending new proposal, British troops should withdraw from Egypt completely before September 1, 1949.

### Encroaching Upon Enemy Property: One of the Major Cases Transferred by the Investigation Team, Wang Zhuchen Initially Interrogated, Testimony Inconsistent with Letter from Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, Judge Lian to Personally Investigate and Collect Evidence

[Our Newspaper Report] The case of Wang Zhuchen's suspected encroachment upon automotive materials from the enemy Changdao Foreign Firm, after being transferred by the investigation team to the District Procuratorate for investigation, was prosecuted on the 21st of last month on charges of encroachment. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Lian Zhenbang of the District Court conducted the initial hearing, first summoning the defendant Wang Zhuchen. Wang was wearing a black overcoat and a dark grey western suit. He was burly and composed. Judge Lian only inquired about his age and native place before adjourning the hearing. Then the informants Wu Tianxiang and Du Donglin were summoned. Wu stated that before the war, he opened the Sino-American Xiangji Automobile Company at 2 Beihaining Road. He moved his entire family to safety when the Anti-Japanese War broke out. 2 Beihaining Road was subsequently occupied by the enemy Changdao Foreign Firm, which continued to operate an automobile factory there. After the victory, the premises were received by Wang Zhuchen. After Wu negotiated with the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the Police Bureau, etc., he was granted permission to recover the property, but Wang consistently refused to return it. Wu learned that he was actively smuggling automotive parts left behind by Changdao Foreign Firm, so he informed the investigation team and requested the return of the property. After Wu finished his statement, Fan Rongchun of the Central Machinery Factory was summoned as a witness, as the Central Machinery Factory was suspected of receiving automotive materials stolen by Wang. Fan stated that he did not know Wang. The batch of automotive parts deposited was temporarily deposited upon the instruction of Deputy Chief of the Police Sub-bureau of Zhedao Road, Gao Yongxi. At that time, he did not know their origin. Later, an employee, Yuan Dingyi, saw a report on August 13th and learned that the case of Wang Zhuchen's encroachment had been discovered. He then knew that the batch of goods was related to Wang's case. Fearing implication, he immediately reported to the military police for inventory and sealing. They remain in the original place and are guarded. He knew nothing else. Zhang Peichun was then summoned as a witness. Zhang stated that he was originally an employee of Wang, but had resigned in early July and established the ZhongSheng Repair Shop on Chuan Gong Road. The shop premises were also owned by Wang. On July 15th, he signed a lease with Wang, paying a deposit of 2 million yuan, with a monthly rent of 1 million yuan. Therefore, he had no relationship with Wang. Subsequently, Luo Boren, a Russian from the Aoduo Automobile Company, and Haishen Baoxi, a German, were summoned as witnesses. Both Luo and Ha were close friends of Wang Zhuchen. Luo had accepted automotive parts deposited by Wang Zhuchen, and Ha had served as a technical advisor at Wang's newly established XinYou Company. Their testimonies were very ambiguous. After all the witnesses were examined, Wang Zhuchen was summoned again. Wang stated that he was a graduate of Tongji University, had studied in Germany, and after returning to China, served as a mechanical engineer and a colonel-level factory director in the Air Force. In the winter of 1943, he returned to Shanghai to mourn his father's death. Afterwards, he partnered to establish the FuZhong Company on Chuan Gong Road in the city, engaging in the automotive materials business. After the victory, FuZhong was dissolved, and he established the XinYou Company with his own funds. Through his brother-in-law Yu Wei, he met Li Ji and Lan of the Garrison Command to negotiate a special contract for automobile repair, with a total capital of 20 million yuan. Initially, he planned to manufacture automobiles, but this did not materialize. In April, he moved to 2 Beihaining Road. Although the Changdao Foreign Firm had left behind automotive parts piled up in two rooms, they were all broken and unusable. Moreover, automotive materials have different ages and styles, and many Japanese relics were not applicable. The court questioned him about the parts that informant Wu Tianxiang reported he had transported away. He replied that they were transported by the Garrison Command on May 15th, a total of five trucks. At that time, when he negotiated with Chief Li of the Garrison Command, he considered using old cars to offset repair costs. However, fearing that their origin was unclear, he refused. Afterwards, the Garrison Command transported parts to offset the repair costs. He repaired a total of five vehicles, including one three-wheeled truck, and continued to repair more than twenty smaller vehicles. He also repaired a Japanese fishing boat docked in front of the Russian Consulate, but because it required more than 4 million yuan in wood, it was not completed and remains docked in the original place. The court further asked why the transportation of goods was done at night. Wang replied that they were transported day and night, not intentionally at night. The transported parts were deposited in three places: (1) the factory on Chuan Gong Road, (2) the Central Machinery Factory, and (3) the Aoduo Automobile Company. The court further asked about the letter of proof from Chief Li of the Garrison Command, stating that only two cars were repaired. Wang replied that he did not know what Chief Li meant. He actually repaired more than two vehicles. Finally, the court ordered that the case still needed to collect materials and adjourned the hearing to another date. It also stated that the court would personally conduct an inspection.

### Deferred Conscription, Ministry of National Defense Explains Meaning

Regarding the meaning of deferment of conscription and whether police should be conscripted, the Municipal Government yesterday approved a public letter from the Ministry of National Defense replying: Active-duty aged (reaching the age of 20) men who, during active-duty conscription, should not be conscripted due to public travel abroad, uncompleted studies, criminal offences, etc., may be granted postponement of conscription in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 of the current Conscription Law, referred to as deferment of conscription. However, they will still be subject to conscription when the reasons for public travel abroad and criminal offences cease to exist. Students from high schools and above who have graduated should also be conscripted into the military to complete reserve officer education. During wartime mobilization, reserve and national soldiers who are irreplaceable employees (specialized technical employees) serving in national defense industries, school teachers, those suffering from illnesses that render them unfit for combat missions, those facing livelihood difficulties, and those who should not be conscripted due to criminal offences may be granted deferment of mobilization conscription in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the Conscription Law, referred to as deferment of mobilization conscription. However, they will still be subject to mobilization when the above reasons cease to exist. Police only bear the responsibility of maintaining local order, do not have the status of active-duty soldiers, and are not eligible for deferment of conscription or deferment of mobilization conscription according to law. However, graduates of central police academies at all levels who are registered with the Central Military Schools Graduates Investigation Office, and those who have graduated from high schools and above and obtained military training certificates may be regarded as reserve officers and will no longer be conscripted. Approved letter forwarded, in addition to this Ministry jointly notifying the Ministry of the Interior to be informed and followed, please note for future reference.

### Prefabricated Steel Houses, Whether They Can Be Imported, Still Under Negotiation

[Our Newspaper Report] The Mobile Golden House Investment Company shipped 25 prefabricated steel houses from the United States two weeks ago. Some of these steel houses were purchased by the company itself, and some were ordered by private individuals. The projected price is US$2,900, including customs duties and freight. The current market price for steel houses is US$5,000. Calculated at the official exchange rate, it is approximately 17 million yuan. It is understood that when these steel houses were imported, customs duties were levied at 20% according to the regulations for unnamed metal goods. The company believes that these goods should be taxed at 15% according to the regulations for building materials. However, the "Import Provisional Management Committee" believes that these steel houses should be included in the list of prohibited imports. Therefore, the company's second batch of orders has not yet proceeded. However, recently, the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to alleviate the housing shortage, contacted the company to order steel houses. Whether the steel houses can be imported will depend on further negotiations between the Customs, the "Import Management Committee," and the company.

### American Ships Arrive in Succession, Large Batch of Goods Loaded

### China National Aviation Corporation, Develops Northwest Air Transport, International Routes Under Preparation

In order to develop air transport in the Northwest, the China National Aviation Corporation has changed its original route from Shanghai to Beijing and Hankou to fly from Shanghai to Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and then to Xi'an. It will be implemented as soon as radio and other equipment are ready.

According to the person in charge of the company, the China National Aviation Corporation has already signed air agreements with Britain and other countries, and there is news that air agreements with France and other countries are also about to be signed. Therefore, it is actively preparing for future international routes. It plans to establish two air routes: one from Shanghai to San Francisco, via Taiwan, Midway Island, and Guam. The other from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Haiphong. However, the giant six aircraft ordered by the China National Aviation Corporation from the United States have not yet arrived in Shanghai, so the opening of international routes will be difficult to achieve in the short term.

### Huang Jiade Safe and Sound, Death Report Was a Misunderstanding

[Our Newspaper Report] It was mistakenly reported in a certain newspaper a few days ago that Huang Jiade, Associate Dean of St. John's University and editor of the Western Wind Monthly, died in a China National Aviation Corporation plane crash. Huang has already published a notice in this newspaper denying this. The reason is that two weeks ago, Huang met with dentist Dai Shugu, who unfortunately died in the crash. The two exchanged business cards, and Dai happened to have Huang's business card in his pocket when he boarded the plane, leading to the misunderstanding. Huang Jiade is actually safe and sound.

### Southern Hunan and Northern Guangdong, People Without Smiles, Liu Hongsheng Returns from Inspection, Talks About the Heavy Disaster Situation in the Two Provinces

[Our Newspaper Report] Liu Hongsheng, Executive Director of the 행정원救濟總署 (Relief Administration), has returned to Shanghai last Saturday after visiting Suzhou, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong to inspect post-war relief work and the internal affairs of the branch offices. Liu reported on the trip to reporters at the Relief Administration at 3 PM yesterday, and his impressions were as follows:

(1) Regarding the internal work of the branch offices, Liu stated that his colleagues were very hardworking, but there was one shortcoming: the branch office colleagues did not understand the Relief Administration's entire plan and its difficulties. The branch offices all believed that the Relief Administration's materials and financial resources were extremely abundant, enough to cover regular expenses, so they spared no expense and also adopted work-relief methods, unaware that although the Relief Administration had a lot of materials, the amount was very limited after distribution. Therefore, it was necessary to select the essentials and implement them urgently. (2) The Yuehan Railway was allocated 18 locomotive heads, 1,200 boxcars, 70 kilometers of railway tracks, and 250,000 railway ties by the Relief Administration. Based on the above materials, the railway construction work should have been quite successful, but after inspection, it was greatly disappointing. However, Liu stated that the Relief Administration must assist in completing the Yuehan Railway because it was the most convenient route for transporting materials to Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and other places. If the transportation was rotated through rivers, it would be time-consuming and costly. (3) When Liu inspected Hunan and Guangdong, from Changsha to Qujiang, there were refugees everywhere without clothing or food, "even infants in arms had no smiles on their faces." The houses in Hengyang streets were almost completely destroyed. Along the way, only thatched sheds like matchboxes were seen. Seeing this situation, Liu strongly advocated that although post-war work was important, relief work should not be stopped and should be extended for three months. (4) The reason for the fire in the Kowloon Relief Administration Highway Transportation Team was said to be electrical. However, the details are still under investigation. Finally, Liu also advocated that the expenses of each office should be used more for transporting materials and less for personnel.

### If Commodity Prices Fluctuate Excessively, the Social Affairs Bureau Will Implement Full Control, Director Wu Kaixian Answers Reporter's Questions

[Our Newspaper Report] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau met with a reporter from this newspaper yesterday and provided the following answers to inquiries:

Q: The end of the year is approaching, and commodity prices are fluctuating quite a bit. Will the Social Affairs Bureau take effective measures?

A: The current stimulus for rising commodity prices is secondly due to the seasonal increase in demand. In addition to hoping that the Central Bank can suppress gold prices, the Social Affairs Bureau will strictly control various daily necessities. For example, in the case of briquettes, I have discussed with the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee to supervise the manufacturing of briquettes in coal yards. Only in this way can we effectively stabilize coal prices.

Q: If commodity prices in general fluctuate, will you implement full control?

A: If commodity prices fluctuate across the board, the Social Affairs Bureau will also take full control. Items that occupy a position in the cost of living index will be considered first. The principle of control will still be price negotiation by various industries, approved and implemented by the Social Affairs Bureau.

Q: Has the year-end bonus issue been completely resolved?

A: The year-end bonus issue has been largely resolved. In this event, both labor and management were able to be open and honest, which helped to resolve the issue.

Q: There have been many factory closures in the past week. What is the director's view on this?

A: This situation is truly regrettable. I believe that large-scale industrial and commercial enterprises must be maintained. The Production Loan Committee has now been formally established, and the amount of loans is very large, which will be a great help. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the labor side can understand that the biggest beneficiaries of the loan are the workers, followed by the factories. Do not think that factories and businesses can demand bonuses. The government has a responsibility to maintain industrial and commercial enterprises, and the labor side also has a responsibility. If the management makes good use of the loans and the labor side works hard to produce, then the difficult end-of-year period can be safely overcome.

Q: Does the director have any comments on the dispute at the Sino-American Hospital?

A: This matter has not been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling. The staff of the Sino-American Hospital are public servants in nature and it is a charitable cause, so it is regrettable that such an event has occurred.

### All 27 Defendants in the Ohrdruf Case Must Be Sent Back to Their Countries from Shanghai, US Military Court Prosecutor Firmly States

[Our Newspaper Report] The list of the second batch of German expatriates to be sent back to their countries in February of next spring was announced by the authorities some time ago, and six of them were soon removed. Among these six, Stoll and Heisig are defendants in the Ohrdruf case, a spy case being tried by the US military court. Although Stoll has been acquitted, he is still detained by the US military. Heisig has not yet been sentenced. The US military authorities previously stated that all defendants in the Ohrdruf case, whether guilty or not, must be returned to their home countries for execution. Now that Stoll and Heisig have been removed from the deportation list, does this indicate that the method of dealing with the defendants in the case has changed? The reporter specifically inquired about this to Major O'Connor, the chief prosecutor of the US military court, yesterday. According to him, he was unaware of the Chinese government's removal of Stoll and Heisig from the list of German expatriates to be deported. The US military's position remains to insist that all 27 defendants in the Ohrdruf case must be sent back to their countries. The reporter further asked whether there would be negotiations with our government. O'Connor, in addition to reiterating in a firm tone that all 17 people must return to their countries, did not make any definite statement.

### Chenjiabang Off-Site Vegetable Vendors Petition to Continue Operating

[Our Newspaper Report] The authorities originally intended to ban tens of thousands of off-site vegetable vendors in the city, but out of consideration for their livelihoods, they were allowed to continue operating in designated areas. On the 17th of this month, more than a thousand off-site vegetable vendors in the Chenjiabang area on ShanhaiGuan Road and Chengdu Road were suddenly expelled by the New City Police Sub-bureau. However, they argued that they had set up stalls in designated areas by the authorities and had not violated any regulations. They had been living in peace with the on-site vegetable vendors for more than ten years and had not hindered their business. Therefore, they separately submitted petitions to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Police Bureau, the New City Sub-bureau, and other relevant agencies, appealing to be allowed to continue operating in order to maintain their livelihoods. It is heard that Mayor Wu has expressed that they can continue to set up stalls as long as they do not obstruct traffic.

### Munitions Depot Explosion Case, Interrogation Work Comes to an End, Formal Public Trial Today

The interrogation of personnel related to the explosion case at the first sub-depot of the Jiangwan Second Munitions Depot continued all day yesterday. In the morning, transportation soldier Lao Youjian and others were still summoned at the Shanghai East Inspection Office. In the afternoon, Chief Military Judge Bao summoned Yan Pu, the squad leader of the transportation team, at the Yuyuan Road reception center. According to Bao's statement to reporters yesterday afternoon, the interrogation work in this case has come to an end. He has reported the interrogation situation to Vice Minister Qin and plans to formally try the personnel related to the case by the military court at 2:00 PM tomorrow, which has been reported to Vice Minister Qin for a final decision. Therefore, the formal public trial of the case should be this afternoon.

### Flooding in the 13-Story Building Area Expected to Be Reduced

[Our Newspaper Report] The ChangLe Road and MaDang Road area of this city, also known as the 13-Story Building area of the former French Concession, is flooded with tides every time there is a high tide. Designed by the Public Works Bureau, tide gates will be installed in the ditches and pipes adjacent to Nanshi, and a dam and pumping station will be built at the Zhaojiabang Rihui Port in West Shanghai to control the tide. In addition to the dam, which was completed on October 3rd, the pump station has also been completed and will be concreted as soon as the weather improves. The three large pumps used in the pumping station, each capable of pumping 60,000 gallons of water per minute, have been contracted by the New Tong Trading Company and will be installed as soon as the factory building is completed. Currently, the tide at Rihui Port is being controlled by the dam and pumping station and can no longer backflow. Therefore, there has been no flooding in the 13-Story Building area in recent months. After the pumping station is completed, the pumps can be activated and the water can be pumped outside the dam in the event of heavy rain and flooding, and the flooding can be gradually reduced.

### At the Municipal Government Memorial Week, Qian Jianfu Reports on Income and Expenditure

[Our Newspaper Report] Qian Jianfu, Chief Secretary of the Finance Bureau, gave a comprehensive report on the city's financial income and expenditure and the improvement of the accumulation levy system at the Municipal Government Memorial Week this morning, stating that the tax revenue for this year has been increasing month by month, and so has the expenditure. The average rate of tax revenue in the first half of the year is approximately 36%, and the rate of increase in expenditure is approximately 21%, so the difference is extremely small. In the second half of the year, up to November, the rate of increase in revenue was 20%, and the rate of increase in expenditure was 24%, and the average rate of profit and loss difference between the two reached 55%, and the difference also increased. The biggest key lies in the adjustment of treatment in June and August, and the fact that the central government's subsidies have been stopped, and the newly allocated land business tax cannot be levied immediately.

### Ding Guitang Case, Summon Informant

[Our Newspaper Report] In the case of Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Director of the Shanghai Customs Bureau, who was accused by Shen Bokang, a former customs employee, of ten major crimes including collusion with the enemy, engaging in private gain, oppressing the innocent, and shielding personnel, the High Procuratorate summoned the informant to court yesterday for detailed questioning and ordered a change of date for further questioning. Investigation will continue within days.

According to informant Shen Bokang's statement to reporters, Ding's ten major crimes are: (1) After the victory, Ding falsely accused him of being a traitor, resulting in his imprisonment for three months. Ultimately, he was not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. However, Ding himself had also held a puppet position, which clearly constituted a crime of oppressing the innocent and falsely accusing him with malice. (2) When Ding was the secretary of Customs Commissioner Melolo of the Jianghai Customs in 1928, customs employees had requested higher treatment and preparations for the recovery of customs rights, but Ding sabotaged this due to his flattery of foreigners. (3) In 1942, when the Japanese enemies hijacked the Shanghai Customs, the Chinese Department was expanded into the Chinese Affairs Office, with Ding as the director. At that time, all instructions that betrayed the central government, excluded the British and Americans, and enslaved the Chinese people came from his hand. (4) Regardless of legal principles, he appointed Lu Shouwen, the deputy commissioner of the puppet customs, as the deputy commissioner of the Tianjin Customs. (5) He retained Yuan Jin, the deputy director of the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department of the puppet regime, as the tax collector of the Jianghai Customs. (6) He appointed Ye Yuanzhang, the director of the statistics office of the puppet customs, to an important position to receive enemy and puppet materials. (7) After the takeover, he secretly instructed Chen Qiongpei (who was appointed by Ding as the tax collector of Hankou after the victory, the protagonist of the major fraud case recently discovered by the Control Yuan) to exchange 100 million yuan of the puppet reserve coupons inventoried after the takeover at a market price without any standards, profiting from it. (8) (9) (10) He mixed the declaration of patriotic donation money and monopolized wharf transportation, with crimes of abuse of power, engaging in private gain, and dereliction of duty.

### Fuxing Island Gold Hiding Case, The Secret Figure Behind the Scenes May Be Discovered Soon

[Our Newspaper Report] In the suspected gold hiding case on Fuxing Island, the District Procuratorate summoned Shen Xizhi, an employee of the Relief Administration, again yesterday. Because everyone summoned previously stated that Shen was the informant "Yang Yaxin", after the prosecutor Gu examined his handwriting and repeatedly questioned him, Shen did not seem to be the informant. The focus of this case is currently on finding the informant, from which clues may be obtained about the case. Prosecutor Gu is making the greatest efforts in this regard and has already made progress. This mysterious figure behind the scenes is likely to be discovered in the near future. In addition, Ohara Tetsuo, the acting chairman of the Three People's Principles Research Association established by Japanese people in Shanghai, requested the release of Japanese people Hirai Hideki and Otagako on bail. The District Procuratorate is considering whether to approve his request.

### Mayor Wu's Speech at Great China University: Reasons for the Economic Crisis; After the Implementation of Industrial Loans and Foreign Exchange Controls, the End of the Year May Be Passed Safely

[Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu Guozhen, at the invitation of Great China University in Fanhuangdu yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, gave a speech during the university's weekly memorial service on the causes of the economic crisis in the city. The gist of his speech is recorded below:

When I took office in May of this year, I immediately convened the heads of various industries to exchange views on economic issues. At that time, most people believed that the wage problem was the most pressing, but I believed that the unemployment problem was even more serious.

There are four factors that have caused the economic crisis in this city:

(1) High-interest loans: For example, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory recently borrowed 2.1 billion yuan, with an interest rate of 15% per month, which means it has to pay 300 million yuan per month, making it difficult to sustain.

(2) High wages: In the old days of imperialism, workers were indeed exploited by capitalists, but after the war, wages have generally increased. For example, the wages of workers in the textile industry have exceeded four times the pre-war level. If workers make further excessive demands, the unemployed will still be workers after the factories close down. Therefore, I hope that the workers themselves can understand this, and I also hope that people from all walks of life will sympathize with the government. If China wants to achieve rejuvenation and national construction, the first thing to do is to compete for the market. The Nanyang market is what we should strive for, but now Japanese yarn sells for only 80 yuan per piece in Nanyang. This shows that Japan has seen our weaknesses and is using low-wage yarn to sell well in Nanyang to compete for the market.

(3) Dumping of foreign goods: We welcome imported goods that we need, and we can reject those that we don't. Cotton is a necessity for yarn manufacturing, and we rely on the United States for it, with a considerable amount, totaling 200 million US dollars per year. China is an agricultural country, so why can't we produce it ourselves? We must work hard.

(4) Inconvenient transportation. I am a member of the Kuomintang, but you should know that I am a liberal, and now I have become a reactionary. When Mr. Luce, the publisher of the American "Life" and "Time" magazines, came to China, I told him this. I have been in Shanghai for six months, and I deeply feel that the freezing of the economic situation lies in the inconvenience of transportation. The reason for the inconvenience of transportation is the sabotage of the Communist Party. If the civil war is prolonged, transportation will not be able to recover, and the economy will not be able to improve. People attack the government because of unstable living conditions. I am determined to make Shanghai better, but I encounter obstacles everywhere. Take the price of meat as an example. I have been to many meat stalls to ask about the reason for the soaring meat prices, and their answer to me is: "Mayor, this is something you cannot control. The source of meat is Northern Jiangsu, and transportation is difficult, coupled with the heavy taxes and levies along the way, so we have to sell it at this price." In short, the prerequisite for suppressing prices and stabilizing living conditions is peace. If the civil war continues, the people will no longer be able to live.

Everyone is worried about the upcoming end of the year, thinking that the two ends of the lunar and solar years are the most difficult times for us, but I believe that after the implementation of industrial loans and foreign exchange controls, we may be able to get through it safely.

You are all young people, and young people are pure, but in the current complicated political situation, while taking action may not be necessary, studying politics is necessary. You must understand the root of the economic crisis, and I hope you will never forget the pure thoughts of your youth.

### No All-Night Dancing Allowed on Christmas Eve; Petition Rejected Again

[Our Own Correspondent] According to the latest news from the Police Bureau: All entertainment venues in the city are strictly prohibited from operating all night on Christmas Eve today. Representatives of the Dance Hall Industry Association went to the Police Bureau yesterday to petition, requesting that dance halls be allowed to extend their closing time to 2:00 AM at the latest. However, the Police Bureau resolutely rejected the request due to the importance of winter defense. It also issued a notice to all its branches to step up patrols of entertainment venues after 12:00 AM tonight.

### A Sad Sight, Unbearable to Recall: A Wild Christmas Eve Can Only Be Found in Dreams

[Our Own Correspondent's Special Feature] This year's Christmas feels a little indescribably bleak and shabby. Walking on the street and looking at the Christmas trees in the windows, it just doesn't feel right: they just hastily stick on a small piece of cotton, and that's supposed to be decorating for Christmas. You don't know how many streets you have to walk to see a single Santa Claus. Shanghai has simply become a ruined household.

But if you want to buy some gifts for people, you have to be a tycoon yourself. A pair of woolen socks that are pleasing to the eye is priced at 45,000 yuan. A pipe costs 50,000 yuan. A toy jeep that looks like a matchbox costs 15,000 legal tender!

Talking about having fun. The revelry of Christmas Eve can only be sought in memories. The world is difficult, and even having a good time is no longer possible. Dance halls must close at 12:00 AM. The police bureau is uncompromising. If you still want to join in the fun, you have to calculate your wallet first. Without 300,000 to 500,000 yuan, be careful of blushing when you stare at the bill.

Just spend Christmas Eve at home, buying a turkey costs 110,000 to 120,000 yuan, and brandy costs 60,000 yuan a bottle, not to mention anything else. In these years, a happy Christmas (a materially happy Christmas) is originally expensive!

There are nearly a hundred large and small Christian churches in this city, each with its own celebration program, but no matter what, it will not be as lively as the expanded Christmas concert at the Grand Stage last year. There are not many Allied personnel in Shanghai, and they did not distribute a hundred and one brilliantly decorated Christmas trees to various units as they did last year. Only the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA has scheduled celebration programs from the 15th to the 28th. Today (the 24th) is a gathering for the youth group. In addition to the usual programs such as worship, dinner, games, music, and exchanging gifts, a special dance is added, which is not available on other days. The YMCA has also hung up New Year's lanterns these days, which are decorated brilliantly and dazzlingly, making you want to visit even if you are not a Christian.

### The Enemy Property Disposal Bureau Concludes Its Work; The Most Difficult Issue Is Staff Reduction; The German Property Clearance Office Denies That It Will Close at the End of the Year

[Our Own Correspondent] According to Mr. Shen Guanya, chief secretary of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions, the most difficult issue in completing the bureau's work is the staff reduction problem. The Disposal Bureau has already reduced staff several times. The current number of staff is only 800. Now it has been decided to cut three-quarters of them, leaving only 200 people. After the Disposal Bureau reduces its staff and shrinks its size, it will be merged into the Central Trust Bureau in the next year, and an "Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearance Office" will be established within the bureau to take over the unfinished matters of the Disposal Bureau.

It is reported that the German Overseas Property Clearance Office will also be merged into the Trust Bureau. However, Mr. Chen Guanqiu, deputy director of the office, denied the news that the office would close at the end of the year. The current German property held by the office is worth approximately 20 billion yuan, most of which are dyes.

### Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents; Many People Have Responded to the Call for Submissions

The Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Document Exhibition, hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Museum on Sichuan North Road, is being organized at the request of the Shanghai Municipality to celebrate New Year's Day. Preparations have been underway for nearly three weeks. Public and private institutions and collectors from all over the world have been organizing exhibits and sending them to the exhibition.

It is also reported that the Municipal Party Committee, in order to assist the exhibition, has issued orders to its subordinate district departments to solicit exhibits, and has invited the assistance of the Literary and Art Movement Committee and Messrs. Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaoshu, and Wu Rencang to solicit exhibits.

### Two Captured New Fourth Army Soldiers; The District Court Decides Not to Accept the Case

[Our Own Correspondent] New Fourth Army soldiers Zhao Xiaogui and Xu Caixing were captured last year during the attack on the Zhongjiu Army in Qibao Town. They were transferred and tried by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, the High Prosecutor's Office, the District Prosecutor's Office, and the High Court. The High Court tried them as a case of internal disorder. Recently, they were transferred to the District Court for trial again. After a detailed study by Judge Cao Zusi, it was determined that there was no need for a substantive trial of the two men, and the charges were insufficient to establish a case. Although the High Court had tried the case as one of internal disorder, there was no appropriate legal provision to punish them. Therefore, it is reported that the District Court has decided to dismiss the case and will announce the verdict today. If the prosecutor's office does not object within ten days after the judgment is delivered, the two men can be released.

### The Old Case of Tang Yuhan Is Reopened; The District Court Will Issue an Arrest Warrant

Tang Yuhan, the husband of Chen Yunshang, was formerly the director of the Sino-Belgian Radium Therapy Hospital. In May of last year, Yang Wangshi, the sister of Wang Jinwen, had a tumor in her abdomen and a uterine tumor. She went to the hospital for treatment and died. At that time, her family filed a complaint with the puppet local prosecutor's office, accusing Tang of negligent injury causing death. However, the Japanese invaders surrendered soon after, causing the case to be shelved. Now the case has been reopened by Prosecutor Ding Tongjun of the District Prosecutor's Office, who believes that Tang is guilty of negligent homicide due to medication errors and has formally filed a public prosecution. However, Tang is still suspected of being a traitor, so he fled without a trace after the victory. The District Court may issue an arrest warrant to bring him to justice for questioning.

### Restricting Electricity Use for Ordinary Households Is Ineffective; Doubts Arise About the Effectiveness of the Public Works Bureau's Implementation; A Subcommittee of the City Council Raises Questions

The Regulations Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held its sixth meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Ten councilors attended, chaired by Ma Junshuo. Officials from the Land Administration Bureau, the Tax Bureau, and the Public Works, Civil Engineering, and Social Affairs Bureaus were all sent to participate and review several regulations. The draft of the Shanghai Municipal Measures for the Management of Municipally Owned Real Estate and the draft of the Shanghai Municipal Measures for Rewarding the Development of Public Land were both passed or amended and passed. At the meeting, Ma Junshuo questioned the Public Works Bureau about the effectiveness of the electricity restriction method. The original question was as follows: Recently, I have heard from two citizens that they believe that restricting electricity use for ordinary households is unnecessary. Their reason is that electricity use by ordinary households accounts for at most 15% of total electricity use, of which those using less than 20 kWh account for 9%. That is, the restricted users account for 6% to 7% of the total. Then the electricity saved is only 1.8% of the total electricity use, which is very small and ineffective. Moreover, ordinary households mostly turn on their lights from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Since there is no time limit, it is actually impossible to save electricity. It is also reported that the raw material used by the power company is diesel, not coal. Diesel can be supplied continuously by the United States, and the generator is being repaired. Then is it currently necessary to restrict electricity use for ordinary households? This is a question. Please ask the Public Works Bureau and the Chief Secretary to ask Director Zhao to answer in detail. Chief Secretary Yuan then stated: Today, because I did not bring the materials to the meeting, I will answer next time.

Complete the Pudong Avenue

[Our Own Correspondent] The Municipal Council quickly received proposals from the councilors for the second conference. As of last night, there were eleven. Councilors Zhong Wangliang, Qu Yue, and Zhu Wende proposed the "Complete Pudong Avenue" case, stating that: "Pudong is more than thirty miles away from the city center, and transportation relies only on waterways, which still cannot facilitate travel, especially since there are many factory workers in the suburbs. The exchange of agricultural products and commodities cannot be smoothly carried out without the development of land transportation. The original roadbed of Pudong Avenue starts from Donggou and connects to Shanghai. The southern route has already been completed. The section north to Wanqiao in this district, which is twelve li, should be built quickly to facilitate transportation."

### "Killing the Chicken to Get the Eggs"; Heavy Taxes and Levies Should Be Reduced; The City Council Will Discuss It Soon

Municipal Councilors Lu Huimin and others suggested that the city's house tax, municipal construction tax, and all taxes are being increased, which does not seem to reflect the difficulties of merchants and residents. Moreover, foreign goods are pouring in, making it impossible for domestic industry and commerce to compete, and they are declining rapidly, even going bankrupt. Although there are many reasons for this, heavy taxes and levies are an important factor. Ordinary merchants cannot develop in legitimate commerce and have to resort to high-interest loans in order to survive. Now that the city's land price tax has been collected in November 1946, and the municipal expenses have been settled, there is no need to continue collecting it, which is like "killing the chicken to get the eggs." Therefore, it is urgent to adapt to reality and reduce the tax rate to provide relief and alleviate the people's difficulties. Therefore, it is specifically suggested that municipal expenses should be paid from the land price tax. If there is a shortage, please ask the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds to subsidize it. The Secretariat of the Council has already submitted this proposal to the second conference for discussion.

### Shenhe and Labor Disputes; A Settlement Record Was Established

(3) The year-end bonus will be one month's salary, which will be calculated before the end of the solar year and paid before the end of the lunar year. (4) Starting from January of next lunar year, salaries will be paid on the 5th and 20th of each month. (5) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason or pretext. If a worker is dismissed for misconduct, it must be approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. (6) Workers in both factories shall not engage in strikes, except in cases where the machines malfunction or there is a shortage of raw materials.

### The French Electric Tram Company's Year-End Bonus Has Been Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for Mediation

This matter has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, and it is feared that the company's accounts will be investigated.

### Should the Exclusive Operating Contract of the British Electric Tram Company Be Recovered After Expiration? Awaiting a Decision by the City Council; The Executive Yuan Has Already Replied to the Water Supply Issue by Telegram

[Our Own Correspondent] The exclusive operating contract signed between the British Shanghai Electric Tram Company and the former Public Concession Bureau stipulated a validity period of thirty-five years, from October 10, 1905, to October 10, 1940. Before the contract expired, the former Public Concession Bureau did not notify its termination, and it was automatically extended for seven years. According to this calculation, the contract will expire again on October 10 next year. According to the contract provisions, the company should be notified six months in advance of the decision to terminate it in order to assess the purchase price. It is reported that the municipal government intends to submit the case to the City Council for a decision. Therefore, whether the business will continue to be exclusively operated by the British Shanghai Electric Tram Company or be taken over by the municipal government will depend on the decision of the City Council. If it needs to be taken over by the municipal government, according to Mr. Bullock, the manager of the British Electric Tram Company, it will cost approximately US$6 million.

[Another News] The exclusive operating contract of the British Shanghai Water Company in this city is about to expire on January 1 next year.

Now the Executive Yuan has replied by telegram, stating: "The contract of the British Shanghai Water Company in Shanghai has expired. In principle, it should be taken back by the Shanghai Municipal Government and operated publicly. Even if there are temporary financial difficulties and funds are not easily available, the extension should not be too long, at most five years, so as to maintain room for flexibility and to prepare a proper plan for taking it back as soon as possible. It has been ordered that the Shanghai Municipal Government comply and implement it."

### Huang Liewen, Who Killed Martyr Du Gang, Is Sentenced to 15 Years

The Case of Fifteen Murders Is Retried; Zou Baoshen Acts As If Nothing Happened; Chen Amu Doesn't Know What He's Talking About

[Our Own Correspondent] Huang Liewen, the former puppet Qingpu County Magistrate, secretly reported Du Gang, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, to the enemy, resulting in Du's death. Yesterday morning, the High Court sentenced him to fifteen years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for ten years, and confiscation of his property, except for a reasonable amount left for the living expenses of his family.

[Our Own Correspondent] Zou Baoxian, the former puppet Xi'an Township Chief of Qingpu County, and Xue Shunde, Chen Amu, Yang Ada, Yu Kesheng, and others, who were accused of killing fifteen people, were tried on the 13th. Yesterday morning, the Second Criminal Tribunal of the High Court continued the trial. Zou Baoshen had a new haircut and was wearing a gray-patterned cotton robe. He was calm when answering questions and denied directing the killing of fifteen people, saying that he was attending a meeting at the Qiaoqu Township Office that day. The guarantor, Lu Zongzhao, was then summoned. Because the murderer, Yang Ada, had fled, the guarantor was ordered to find him within a time limit and was guaranteed by Xiao Fumin. Another defendant, Chen Amu, had a shaved head and was in a very pitiful state. He gave irrelevant answers. The court hearing was adjourned and the defendants were taken back into custody.

### Sha Jingchuan and Yu Zhongru; Preliminary Hearing

[Our Own Correspondent] Sha Jingchuan (i.e., Sha Keliang) and Yu Zhongru were accused by the Resources Committee of secretly reporting the case files and materials that the Resources Committee and the Public Works Bureau had left in Shanghai for safekeeping to the enemy and puppets. Sha and Yu then joined the puppet Public Works Bureau as clerks. The High Prosecutor's Office prosecuted them for suspicion of being traitors. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. The defendants requested to review the files of the puppet Public Works Bureau that were received by the municipal government and to summon witnesses. The court hearing was adjourned.

It is reported that Sha Jingchuan is 40 years old and Yu Zhongru is 37 years old. Both are from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. Before the war, they both worked in the Accounting Section of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau. After the outbreak of the "August 13" Shanghai War, they were ordered to disperse. At the end of 1939, Sha served as a clerk in the Hong Kong Purchasing Office of the Resources Committee. He took leave to return to Shanghai in May 1941. On August 8 of the same year, Sha and Yu jointly submitted a request to the puppet Public Works Bureau to resume their positions. They were immediately appointed as clerks in the bureau and secretly reported the Hengli Company, a material purchasing agency secretly set up by the Resources Committee at 515 Cishu Building in Shanghai, and the case files and materials left in Shanghai for safekeeping by the former Public Works Bureau to the enemy and puppets, resulting in all the equipment and funds of the bureau being confiscated. In addition, 40 boxes of public goods stored in the First Warehouse of the Shanghai Bank on Suzhou Road were also seized by the puppet Public Works Bureau. Sha Jingchuan received a bonus of 3,000 puppet currency for this, and Yu Zhongru received 1,000 yuan. After the victory, Sha and Yu continued to work for the municipal government. Now, after being reported by the Resources Committee, the High Court held a hearing in the afternoon. The two defendants confessed that they took up puppet positions because they were forced by livelihood. They did not remember whether the confiscation of case files and materials of the Resources Committee and the Public Works Bureau by the enemy and puppets was due to their secret reports. They requested the court to review the files of the puppet Public Works Bureau. The court also summoned witnesses Ying Yeci and Jiang Zihua to testify about the circumstances of Sha and Yu's defection and secret reports. Because further investigation was needed, the court hearing was adjourned.

### Social Services Reader Consultation

Legal Queries

(1) Roman Injury

Jiang Biyuan asks:

A child, while playing with several companions on the lawn in front of neighbor Mr. Jia's house, was severely injured by a horse raised by Mr. Jia (the left eye is now blind). At the time of the incident, the horse was tied to a tree. After the incident, the child's parents demanded that Mr. Jia compensate for all losses, a considerable sum. Mr. Jia, a commoner, cannot afford such a large amount of compensation. According to the law, how should this matter be resolved?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] According to the circumstances described in the letter, if Mr. Jia has done everything he can to prevent this accident, Mr. Jiang's side will not be able to claim compensation.

(2) Re-dealing with Old Debts

Huang Yan asks: Before the war, Mr. Jia borrowed 100 yuan in legal tender from Mr. Yi, with a written loan agreement stating an interest rate of 1.7% per month. However, Mr. Bing's name was listed on the loan agreement as a guarantor, but in reality, Mr. Bing was the creditor. During the war, Mr. Jia went to another place to make a living. Now, Mr. Yi sent someone to demand repayment of the debt, requesting that the price of rice at the time of the loan be used as the standard. It is said that the price of rice at that time was 10 yuan per dan, so they want to recover the current price of 12.5 dan of rice, plus interest. Is Mr. Yi's request legal? Please advise: (1) If the loan agreement does not specify rice as the standard, can Mr. Jia refuse his request? (2) What is the legal way to repay? (3) The annual interest of 20 yuan and 4 jiao has not been paid for seven years. How much should be paid? (4) Or should the principal be repaid a thousandfold; is this an already promulgated law?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] (1) Yes, Mr. Jia can refuse the request. (2, 3) According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration, if, after a legal act is established, due to reasons not attributable to the parties, circumstances change, and the changes are beyond what could have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect of the act becomes obviously unfair, the court should make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment. (4) There is no such law.

### Woolen Fabric Industry Crisis on All Sides Only Seeking to Get Through the New Year

With the New Year approaching, most of the woolen fabric industry is facing an awkward situation. Except for a few conservative old shops, all are facing crises on all sides. Generally, the responsible persons are worried. Because of the difficulty in lending and recovering money, the wind of defaulting and closing down is prevalent. High-interest loans must be repaid. At the same time, inventories are decreasing, and food expenses are increasing. Taxes and donations are heavy, and foreign goods are frequently transported in. Trying to cut prices for cash is extremely difficult. The current actual sales are that local customers are all subject to the mutual entanglement of high-interest loans, and the market is falling. Therefore, although there are various stimulating news of favorable purchases, the woolen fabric industry has never been able to recover. Both buyers and sellers only hope to get through the two New Years, which is considered lucky.

### Hardware Only Has Asking Prices

Hardware prices are stimulated by foreign exchange and rise again. Chaos reigns, and most shops are closed and not selling. In reality, actual sales are still sluggish, resulting in only asking prices and no transactions.

### Sugar Price Surge Is Fierce

Yesterday, the sugar market was still squeezed down by spot goods, and due to the gold relationship, it was even more crazy. Shantou initially opened at only 115,000 yuan, with a turnover of more than 200 bags.  Starting at 112,000 yuan, it rose straight to 130,000 yuan, accounting for 300 bags, a sharp increase of 230,000 yuan. Guangdong brought 40 bags of Hainan red, 149,000 yuan, a similar increase. Bo Pian Jiao 140,000 yuan. Xinghua Gang opened with high-quality powdered white at 177,000 yuan, followed by 172,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan,  Red at 162,000 yuan, more than 100  tens of bags,  A few dozen bags of Diaocheng, initially 115,000 yuan, then 120,000 yuan to 125,000 yuan. The Association's settlement also fluctuated by tens of thousands of yuan. Medium sugar, white and raw sugar were all in chaos. Only when Taiwan Sugar can ship goods, there is hope for stability.

### Northern Goods Also See Price Surge

Northern goods have been sluggish for a long time, and have recently turned upwards. Among them, goods of   are even more tight, such as large-flake hall houses, which have risen to 310,000 yuan, Xianglian 580,000 yuan, wood ear 750,000 yuan, ordinary golden vegetables 256,000 yuan, and special high-quality called 300,000 yuan.

### Rice Market Mostly Without Formal Transactions Edible Oil Surges Unprecedentedly! Soybean Cake and Miscellaneous Grains Are All Popular

The rice market saw a total arrival of over 9,000 stones from the north and south. Northern japonica rice was scarce in supply, resulting in little trading. Indica rice was also lacking in both arrival and storage, and there were no formal transactions. However, southern japonica early rice and goods from the Suzhou-Wuxi area were still being received, and transactions were all conducted at reviewed prices. White yuan had no changes, and Yinyuan also saw little glory or disgrace. The oil market, due to the reported price increase in Qingdao, saw shops with strong appetite and competing to receive goods, resulting in another dramatic surge. Raw oil surged by 16,000 to 17,000 yuan, soybean oil also surged by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, clear oil and sesame oil both surged by over 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake, due to strong demand in Taiwan and inquiries from Shantou, saw market prices suddenly rise by 1,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were absorbed by local oil factories and the mainland, resulting in abnormal popularity, and continued to rise by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. Mung beans followed suit and rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were also actively traded, rising by another 2,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were selling briskly, and continued to rise by 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also being purchased more strongly by Guangdong, and prices were gradually increasing, continuing to surge by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Corn also rose by 1,000 yuan. Wheat remained firm. Flour supply remained scarce, and the market situation became more prosperous, continuing to rise by 300 to 500 to 1,000 yuan. Bran saw active rural sales, rising by another 600 to 700 yuan.

Also, according to Director Ji of the Food Section of the Social Bureau, the city government currently controls more than 420,000 dan of rice in Shanghai. If the situation becomes tense, it can be sold to give speculators a fatal blow. However, this phenomenon is unlikely to occur when new grains are on the market. The monthly consumption of rice in Shanghai is 450,000 dan, so a supply of 15,000 dan per day is considered normal. Also, Ye Xinming, director of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, went to the Social Bureau yesterday to discuss the supply and management of rice in the city in the future. The Economic Administration Department of the Social Bureau dispatched three staff members yesterday, together with personnel from the Police Bureau and the Finance Bureau, to conduct a strict review of businesses dealing in rice, sugar, and cotton cloth to prevent speculative behavior.

### Yarn Allocation Issues The Fifth Phase of Yarn Allocation Will Be Temporarily Suspended New Measures Are Being Drafted

Since the Cotton Yarn Re-Allocation Association has been handling yarn allocation, it has been through seven phases. Initially, the member associations receiving allocations numbered only six. Later, after factories in other locations stopped participating in the allocation, the remaining balance was participated in by three associations, including camel velvet, canvas, and webbing, and the number of units increased, and the work became more complicated. Repeated yarn allocations have resulted in various disputes due to the different situations of each industry, such as the allocated yarn not matching the count, incomplete types, uneven quantities, or occasional power outages and machine shutdowns. Although these technical difficulties have been discussed several times, they are still difficult to resolve. The association is now aware that the current trend of cotton yarn is that the authorities have the intention of "exchanging yarn for cotton" and restoring free trade. However, no matter how it changes, the re-allocation work will not be abolished. Since the fourth phase of the fourth yarn allocation is about to be completed, whether the fifth phase of yarn allocation will be implemented according to the new measures is still being studied by the authorities. Therefore, before the new measures are announced, the yarn allocation work may be temporarily suspended. Currently, the association has not clearly understood the yarn allocated to various industries and its uses. In order to improve future difficulties, it plans to take advantage of this slightly idle situation to investigate what counts of yarn are needed for what kind of finished products, one by one, so as to compile statistics and contribute to the relevant authorities for reference.

### Factory Yarn Sees More Fierce Increases

Rayon Goods Follow Gold Prices Up and Down

Yesterday morning, gold yarn saw another fierce increase, causing the silk market to be extremely chaotic. In the afternoon, gold yarn fell back, and the silk market also softened. 120-count Dongyang Youguang rayon was trading at 760,000 yuan in the morning, and was asking 650,000 yuan in the afternoon. Gaoshan was trading at 700,000 yuan in the morning, and was asking for at least 500,000 yuan in the afternoon. The result was still a gain of 100,000 yuan compared to around 600,000 yuan last weekend. The prices of other counts of goods also increased by tens of thousands of yuan. The finished silk market was even more turbulent. Grade C was asking over 5.67 million yuan in the morning market, ordinary retail high-end goods were trading at 5 million yuan, and thousand goods were asking 3.78 million yuan, but none of them were traded. In the afternoon market, gold and banknotes fell sharply, and asking prices followed suit. The final price was not much different from last weekend. The situation of satin goods was the same. Quilt covers were asking over 950,000 yuan, and ge crepe broke through the 9,000 yuan mark. Huajin crepe was trading at 3,850 yuan in the morning, but because buyers were discouraged, the result was flat with last weekend.

### Yarn Prices Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market rose with gold prices, and customers' buying interest remained sluggish. However, those in the industry held on tightly due to the high gold prices and did not easily sell off. Therefore, 20-count yarn rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and 42-count double-strand yarn also rose by as much as 100,000 yuan. In the morning, Shenxin Yarn Factory had 300 pieces of 20-count Tiannv Sanhua on offer, with a price of 2.25 million, all of which were absorbed by yarn dealers.

### Hong Kong Goods Orders Calculated Based on Gold

According to authorities in the import and export industry, the number of major merchants in Shanghai who have moved to Hong Kong in recent months has been increasing day by day, and speculative funds from all over have gradually concentrated in Hong Kong. As a result, many Hong Kong firms ordering goods from Shanghai have recently calculated the price by converting to national currency based on gold, which is also one of the factors stimulating the recent rise in gold prices.

### Tianjin Yarn and Cloth are Decontrolled Industrial and Commercial Downturn Has Begun

### Downturn Strikes Again Chen Da Silver Shop Stops Exchange

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, it was widely rumored in the market that Chengda Silver Shop on Sichuan Middle Road in this city had declared bankruptcy. After inquiry by reporters, it was learned that the shop had once failed to balance its accounts at the bill clearing house on the 14th of this month. Although it was cleared up on the 16th, deposit runs occurred on consecutive days in the past week, totaling 700 million yuan. The position felt short. After various efforts, it was still able to balance. However, a deposit run of 200 million yuan occurred on Saturday alone, causing the shop's account at the clearing house to be unable to balance again. Finally, the clearing house announced yesterday that it would stop the exchange and suspend business. According to a person in charge of the shop, the shop has a total deposit of 1.1 billion yuan, and the loan amount reaches 1.7 billion yuan, so there is still a surplus after offsetting income and expenditure. However, because the loan is more excessive, it is now being pursued. Once the clearing house's position is balanced, it will continue to operate. It is reported that the shop's head office is in Chongqing, and a branch is being prepared in Hong Kong. The Shanghai branch was only opened on September 16 this year.

### Zhengjiao Manager Wang Zhixin Talks About the Economic Situation in the Northeast

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Zhixin, general manager of the Securities Exchange, flew to Shenyang, Changchun and other places on the 12th of last month to investigate the economic situation in the Northeast. He spent more than 30 days and gained a lot. The reporter paid a special visit yesterday and received the following remarks:

Any Chinese citizen who arrives in the Northeast will have a deep sense of national concept. Although my trip was short, I felt a lot. The first is excitement. The richness of the Northeast is truly like gold everywhere. In terms of agriculture, there are soybeans, sorghum, and wheat, which are sufficient for food and more. In terms of mineral deposits, there are coal, iron, copper, manganese, and gold, and the reserves are all used in the country. The mountains are full of forests, and wood cannot be used up. Animal husbandry is very developed, and there are rich fishery benefits. In terms of power, it is also uniquely endowed, with many places where hydropower can be used. Railways run through the entire territory, accounting for more than one-third of the country's railways. There is also a very long coastline. Rivers that can be navigated run vertically and horizontally. What should be especially pointed out is that the Northeast not only has rich resources, but also has a diligent and hardworking people. In short, the Northeast has the resources and manpower to achieve our country's prosperity and strength. China can be proud to have the Northeast! But another feeling is grief and indignation and vigilance. After the Northeast was occupied by the enemy on September 18, they actively developed and exploited it, and promoted the Second Five-Year Plan, including the invasive development and expansion of various economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, minerals, industry, electricity, and international trade. They also planned to supplement it with extensive immigration measures. The depth of the plan and the scale of the plan all show the enemy's premeditation. Taking the Shenyang city area as an example, there are more than 1,300 enemy and puppet factories taken over by the government. The scale of heavy industry in other places can be compared with that of Britain and the United States. In addition, the construction work in cities such as Changchun and Shenyang is also magnificent. All these were gradually carried out in a short period of time before the Pacific War. Since September 18, the enemy has regarded the Northeast as a base for larger-scale aggression, so its urgent excavation of resources and the cruelty of enslaving the people are unprecedented. As a result, the people of the Northeast worked hard all year round but could not get enough to eat and keep warm. Those who witness the real situation in the Northeast, how can they not be grieved and indignant? However, their strength in management is indeed worthy of our vigilance and learning. The third feeling is anxiety. The economic construction of the Northeast has taken shape under the enemy's aggressive ambitions. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government recruited outstanding talents from all over the country to prepare to take over. Unfortunately, it was restricted by the double forces of international and domestic forces. All the important equipment of the factories was repeatedly dismantled and destroyed one after another. The fruits of victory were lost. To this day, there is still a partial military stalemate. Transportation is difficult, and all economic recovery and industrial construction are extremely difficult. If this continues, the military cannot end as soon as possible, transportation cannot be restored as soon as possible, and politics cannot enter the right track as soon as possible. The seriousness of the situation in the Northeast and the suffering of the people, how can we imagine, deeply feel anxious. Moreover, not only anxious, but also worrying, the Northeast has a vast area and abundant resources, a large piece of good land, bordering a strong neighbor, it is inevitable to be coveted by others. In the past, it was ruled by the enemy for more than ten years. Today, the country is restored, if we still cannot be aware of the lessons of history, cannot turn hostility into friendship, and cannot quickly make politics clear and rebuild the economy to consolidate national defense and improve people's livelihood, then the tragedy of September 18 will be difficult to repeat! Combining my personal feelings, I hope that people across the country should pay attention to the Northeast, stabilize the Northeast, defend the Northeast, and build the Northeast.

The reporter then asked Wang about the future plans of the Securities Exchange. He said: It is hoped that all sectors of society can make full use of the securities exchange mechanism to issue new stocks or corporate bonds to achieve the goal of a true capital market. On this point, Wang specifically cited two examples: (1) Enemy and puppet industries received by the government, or large-scale state-owned enterprises that will be returned to private management, the Securities Exchange is eager to help when they need to raise funds. (2) Currently, the scale and capital of general industrial and commercial enterprises are not enough, and they will need to be expanded in the future. It is hoped that the funds needed can be raised through the Securities Exchange mechanism. Finally, Wang said: I hope that the Securities Exchange can play a role in assisting the country's economy.

### East Mongolia in Reconstruction

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Northeast China, Han Qingtao

Shenyang, 10th (Air Dispatch)

In the narrow, elongated western region of Northeast China, there lives a nomadic people. There are leagues and banners, princes and nobles, and honest people. There are herds of cattle and sheep, and also people who have transitioned from nomadic life to farming. This is the well-known location of the Mongolian Banners in Northeast China, or what has recently been referred to in newspapers and magazines as "East Mongolia."

Glimpses of the Evolution of East Mongolia. East Mongolia refers to the area east of Inner and Outer Mongolia. It is roughly equivalent to Jehol Province, encompassing three leagues and two tribes, comprising thirty-eight or more banners. The Jerim League encompasses eleven banners, with seven in Liaobei Province, two in Nenjiang Province, one in Jilin Province, and one in Songjiang Province. Next are the "Josutu League" and the "Joo-oda League," both in Jehol. The Josutu League has seven banners, and the Joo-oda League has nine. The two tribes are the "Hulunbuir Tribe" and the "Butha Tribe." The former has six banners and the latter has five, both located within Xing'an Province.

Before the September 18th Incident, the people here obeyed orders, were governed, diligently herded livestock, firmly believed in Buddhism, and rarely caused problems. During the era of Manchukuo, except for Jehol, this area was divided into four provinces: Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest Xing'an. Later, for the sake of so-called "high-level national defense" and "border province" considerations, the three provinces of East, South, and West Xing'an, along with Liguo County of Longjiang Province, were merged to form a single Xing'an General Province, with the General Provincial Office located in Wangye Temple. The General Province was divided into several areas, each with a regional administrative office. As for North Xing'an Province, due to its proximity to Outer Mongolia and other special circumstances, it remained as it was, with the provincial office located in Hailar.

After the restoration, East Mongolia underwent changes and encountered problems. On August 12th of last year, the Soviet army arrived in Wangye Temple. Young people, under the leadership of Hafun'a, issued a declaration and established a so-called "East Mongolian People's Republic." In Hailar, people established their own "Autonomous Government," while in Qiqihar, there were other plans.

The National Government, the Chinese Communist Party, the Soviet Union, and Outer Mongolia were the targets of allegiance for East Mongolian politicians. Soon, the Communist forces entered East Mongolia. Hafun'a, a young man in his forties, had the closest relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and became the darling of the era. The Communist army followed, singing praises of supporting the East Mongolian Autonomous Movement. In politics, they established the "East Mongolian Autonomous Government," and militarily, they had the "East Mongolian People's Self-Defense Army." Cleansing and struggle began to unfold here, and everything began to change.

Distribution of Leagues and Banners

The province with the largest number of Mongolian Banners in Northeast China is Xing'an Province, which includes the "Hulunbuir Tribe" and the "Butha Tribe." The former includes the New Barag Right Banner, (adjacent to Qi Bin), the Old Barag Banner (adjacent to Hailar), the Ergun Left Banner (adjacent to Shiwei), the Ergun Right Banner (adjacent to Qigan), the Solon Banner (adjacent to Hailar), and the Butha Banner (adjacent to Jingxing and Zhalantun), among other six banners. The latter includes the Achai Banner (adjacent to Solon), the Morin Dawa Banner (adjacent to Buxi Bureau), the Bayan Banner (adjacent to Nenjiang), the Xizaga'er Banner (adjacent to Solon), and five other banners.

The ten banners under the Jerim League are scattered across the provinces of Nenjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, and Songjiang. Within Liaobei Province, there are the Khorchin Left Front Banner (adjacent to Kangping, Faku, and Zhangwu), the Khorchin Left Middle Banner (adjacent to Liaoyuan, Tongliao, Zhanyu, and Lubei), the Khorchin Left Rear Banner (adjacent to Kangping, Changtu, and Liaoyuan), the Khorchin Right Front Banner (adjacent to Tao'an and Tuquan), the Khorchin Right Middle Banner (adjacent to Tuquan and Zhanyu), the Khorchin Right Rear Banner, and the Jarbent Banner (adjacent to Tailai and Jingxing). Within Nenjiang Province, there are the Ikemin'an Banner (adjacent to Fuyu) and the Shulbert Banner (adjacent to Anda and Taikang). Within Jilin Province, there is the Gorlos Front Banner (adjacent to Qian'an, Changcen, Fuyu, and Nong'an). Within Songjiang Province, there is the Gorlos Rear Banner (adjacent to Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Anbei, Hulan, Fuyu, and Shuangcheng).

Jehol Province has the Josutu League, which governs seven banners: the Kalachin Left Banner (adjacent to Jianping), the Kalachin Middle Banner (adjacent to Lingyuan), the Kalachin Right Banner, the Tumed Right Banner, the Tumed Left Banner (adjacent to Chaoyang), the Tumed Middle Banner (adjacent to Chaoyang), and the Kulun Banner. The Joo-oda League has the Bairin Left Banner (adjacent to Lindong), the Bairin Right Banner, the Ongniut Left Banner, the Ongniut Right Banner (adjacent to Chifeng), the Aru Khorchin Banner (adjacent to Tianshan), the Naiman Banner, the Jarut Banner (adjacent to Kailu), the Keshigten Banner (adjacent to Linxi and Jingpeng), and the Aohan Banner (adjacent to Jianping), among nine banners.

The above designations and affiliations represent the current system in the Mongolian Banners of Northeast China. According to a survey by the Northeast Headquarters Mongolian Banner Reconstruction Committee, Butha means the "Hunting Tribe" and is a geographic term, not an ethnic term. The Butha region is inhabited by tribes such as the Mongolian Daur, Solon, Gorlos Chun, Manchu, Chile, and Marneke. Before September 18th, East and West Butha were located in Heilongjiang Province and were not administrative units. During the Manchukuo period, most of the people of the eight banners of East and West Butha were relocated to West Butha. Currently, a portion of East Butha remains in Nehe County, Nenjiang. In addition, in Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, there are approximately 30,000 Mongolian Suyike Banner herders who provide cattle and sheep for sacrifices at the Yong, Fu, and Zhao Mausoleums.

The Three Zones of East Mongolia

Someone who inspected the Mongolian areas reported that: The southern part of East Mongolia is the Jin-Re area, where most Mongolians have been assimilated by the Han Chinese, are accustomed to farming, and their habits are no different from those of the Han Chinese. Some Mongolians even do not speak the Mongolian language. There are instances of intermarriage between Mongolians and Han Chinese. Although Lamaism still exists, it is on the decline, because the entire society has been fully integrated into the Han Chinese. Therefore, even with Japanese instigation, it will not generate any significant impact.

The northern part is the former Xing'an Province area, where there are very few traces of Han Chinese. Mongolians still live their primitive lives. During the Manchukuo period, very few received Japanese education, and their minds are closed. They have no political demands.

The central part, south of Wangye Temple and north of Sira Muren, is the base of the East Mongolian Autonomous Movement. The situation is extremely complex. Except for the four counties of Kailu, Linxi, Tongliao, and Liquan, which are entirely Han Chinese, all other banners are inhabited by both Mongolians and Han Chinese. Indigenous Mongolians, because they are not accustomed to farming, live a nomadic life in undeveloped areas. In the developed areas, there are Han Chinese and Mongolians who have migrated from the Jin-Re area. Although this group of Mongolians has been sinicized, their ethnic consciousness has re-emerged, and they consider themselves the advanced elements of Mongolia. These are the people who have recently engaged in the East Mongolian Autonomous Movement. Indigenous Mongolians are merely led by them.

In East Mongolia, except for the southern part and a portion of the youth, Lamaism is still fervently believed by most. It is the destination of their spiritual life. Everyone fantasizes about the future where "one monk attains enlightenment, and nine generations ascend to heaven." Today, the advancing Mongolians plan to bring them to a world of high autonomy.

National Reconstruction of Leagues and Banners

The National Army, approaching the Mongolian Banners from the south and east, has already welcomed the Khorchin Left Banners in Liaobei Province into its embrace. Other Mongolian Banners are also rushing over. Now, let's introduce the Khorchin Left Front, Rear, and Middle Banners below.

The Khorchin Left Front Banner, also known as Binkang Banner, is one of the most culturally developed banners in East Mongolia. It is bordered by the Khorchin Rear Banner to the east, Faku and Zhangwu in Liaoning to the south, the Kulun Banner to the west, and the Left Middle Banner to the north. It covers an area of 90 li from east to west and 180 li from north to south, making it the smallest banner in the Jerim League. It has a population of approximately 116,000, with about 69,000 Han Chinese and 47,000 Mongolians. It is semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral. The agricultural production methods of the Mongolians are also very advanced. The banner government is located in Zhanggutai, and Uubao is the acting banner chief.

The Khorchin Left Rear Banner, also known as Bowang Banner, borders Liaoning Province to the east. It covers an area of approximately 180 li from east to west and 250 li from north to south. It has a population of 96,000, with 15,000 Han Chinese and 81,000 Mongolians. It is located in the Liao River basin and has many fertile lands. It is one of the earliest banners in the Jerim League to be cultivated. The banner government is located in Jiergalang, and Xige is the acting banner chief.

The Khorchin Left Middle Banner, also known as Darhan Banner, borders the Left Rear Banner to the south. It covers an area of 180 li from east to west and over 800 li from north to south. It has a population of approximately 250,000, with 50,000 Han Chinese and 200,000 Mongolians. The cultivation situation is quite good, and most people are engaged in agriculture, followed by animal husbandry. The banner government is located in Bayantala, and He Xiyelletu Moergen is the acting banner chief.

Finally, the Gorlos Front Banner of Jilin is located at the confluence of the Nenjiang and Songhua Rivers. It covers an area of 180 li from east to west and 300 li from north to south. It is the most agriculturally developed and fertile Mongolian Banner in Northeast China. The banner government is located in Nong'an, and Da Dimulin Dorji is the acting banner chief. The banner has a population of 170,000, with 125,000 Han Chinese and approximately 35,000 Mongolians.

The Kalachin Right Banner, Left Banner, and Middle Banner, the Tumed Left Banner, Right Banner, and Middle Banner, the Naiman Banner in Jehol, as well as the newly recovered Mongolian Banners in Nenjiang Province, will be introduced to you in the future.

How the Problems Arose

During the late Qing Dynasty, Han Chinese successively migrated into the Mongolian areas. During the Republic of China, immigration was promoted several times, and the influx of Han Chinese increased day by day. In the 29th year (of the Republic), Manchukuo, due to the complexity of the Mongolian-Han land issue and for the purpose of land registration, issued an order to Han Chinese farmers to pay 25 years' worth of rent in advance as the purchase price to obtain ownership of the land. This amount was deposited in the Manchukuo Central Bank, and the interest was allocated to the Mongolians. The Mongolians organized the Yusheng Association to serve as funding for Mongolian production and education. After the restoration, the Mongolians suffered losses and had no recourse for compensation. They could only demand rent from the Han Chinese farmers, who were unwilling to bear the rent twice. This caused great friction between the two parties.

In areas where counties and banners coexisted, Mongolians were governed by the Mongolian Banners, while Han Chinese belonged to the county government. Minor disputes would be taken by Mongolians to the Mongolian Banners, while Han Chinese would appeal to the county government. The county and banner were loosely connected and unable to resolve the issues. Consequently, each would escalate the matter to higher-level authorities, adding embellishments and exaggerations, making it impossible to resolve. Emotions gradually became alienated and deteriorated.

The Manchukuo – or, to be more direct, the Japanese officials – paid considerable attention to Mongolian education, but the purpose of education was different. Seeing that the educational policy they formulated included the following: "The basic policy is to separate the previously joint Han-Mongolian education, and on the one hand, improve Mongolian secondary schools in order to cultivate key personnel," one can already understand the general idea.

Japanese officials used a two-pronged approach of education and politics to alienate the relationship between Han Chinese and Mongolians, dividing them into three classes politically: Japanese, Mongolians, and Han Chinese. Japanese and Mongolian were used in schools, and Japanese and Mongolian were spoken. Here, Mongolians were treated better than Han Chinese. These policies played a significant role in division and isolation. It is said that those who were dissatisfied with everything were mostly students from the "Xing'an Normal School" in Zhalantun and the "Xing'an College" in Wangye Temple.

What Mongolians Need

The Northeast Administrative Office established a "Mongolian Banner Reconstruction Committee" to handle the reconstruction of the Mongolian Banners. They are assisting the provincial governments and Mongolian Banners in the localities of the Mongolian Banners to intensify the reconstruction work. They are conducting registration of Mongolian talents and sending many work groups to the Mongolian Banner areas. Their policies can take the opinions of Mongolian people into account regarding the issue of human rights in the future Mongolian civil administration, so as to avoid repeating the past mistakes of division and appeasement.

Fellow Han Chinese compatriots in the Mongolian Banners of Northeast China have established a "Northeast Mongolian Banner Committee" in Shenyang. They have organized several Northeast Mongolian Banner Self-Defense Forces to assist the government and the National Army in receiving the Mongolian Banners. They have also organized a military work group to advance with the National Army, engaging in pacification and propaganda work. They also plan to publish a "New Mongolia Guide," and they are currently preparing and raising funds in order to compile and print news in both Chinese and Mongolian, as well as engaging in writing and theorizing to break down barriers. This is the only public organization of Mongolians in Shenyang.

The general opinion is that attention should be paid to the livelihood issues of Mongolians in the future, and the main thing is to call on them to stabilize their lives. If it is possible to improve their animal husbandry by using scientific methods based on the Mongolian living environment, establish pastures in different areas to prevent the spread of animal diseases, and increase their wealth calculated in cattle and sheep on a daily basis, and then select sites to establish leather and woolen textile industries, then the living standards of Mongolian compatriots will inevitably improve day by day. As for restoring and constructing transportation and popularizing education, these can be carried out successively. Once the economic foundation is established, the political status and local autonomy can be smoothly completed. Some people also advocate that since people of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups live together, banners and counties can still coexist, but legal mutual governance must be implemented, and at the same time, policies to protect animal husbandry must be implemented to prevent the over-cultivation of good pastures. Ethnic minorities need reasonable survival and development, and there is no need to specialize.

Currently, many Mongolian representatives, at the "Temporary University" conference, as well as expressing appeals to all sectors of society, hope that the interests of ethnic minorities should be taken into account in the constitution, and the banner system must also obtain a reasonable status in the constitution. The general opinion here is that if there is a good solution, although the banner system is a remnant of the feudal era, the Mongolians are accustomed to it, and it may be okay to let it exist for a while. Of course, the government should pay extra attention to the interests of ethnic minorities.

### Journey to Taitung (II) The Warm Current of the Pacific Ocean

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Jiang Muyun

Two Harbors: Karrulan · Shinkō

Taipei, 12th (Air Dispatch)

As the only lifeline of eastern Taiwan, it is the warm current of the Pacific Ocean (Kuroshio). This current flows from the North Equatorial region, passes through the Philippines, runs along the coast of Taitung, and flows directly into the Sea of Japan. It nourishes the remote eastern Taiwan, and the people of the east regard it as a deity, relying on this warm current to maintain their lives. Because this warm current is most able to attract the clustering of fish, the fishermen are now no longer poor. Adventurous hunting and catching of floating fish enable them to cope with the high cost of living. They are grateful for the warm current, and they depend on it for their lives.

Streams Impassable by Boats, Water Management is Especially Important

The inspection team and his party still took the original car along the county road northward on the morning of the 7th. This is a county road, and some parts have not yet been completed. We passed through the Taitung Bridge, which the Japanese admired as the "No. 1 in the Orient." This is an iron cable bridge. The Japanese loved this kind of architecture the most. Director Ren said that claiming to be the "No. 1 in the Orient" is inevitably boasting, but it can be regarded as a representative of the architecture of island bridges.

Fei Hua, Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Li Ye, two chief engineers, excitedly told reporters about the water conservancy problems in the northeast. Generally speaking, the ratio of the east and west coasts of He Wan to the watershed of the Central Mountain Range is one to two. The west already feels that the slope is too steep and difficult to manage. Not only is the slope of each stream in the east twice as large, but when entering the Taitung Rift Valley, it makes a sharp 90-degree turn and flows into the sea in the north and south. The large amount of gravel from 2,000 to 3,000 meters high is unable to enter the sea and all remains in the longitudinal valley. The end map is blocked, and the middle silting is increasing day by day. It is really like the water of the Yellow River coming from the sky, so building dams to block sand is not a solution, but it is necessary to attack the silt in the eastern stream and reduce the turbulence in order to maintain traffic safety and protect the existing cultivated land.

In the streams that are impassable by boats, the Japanese did not have the strength to repair the existing damaged dikes during the war. This year, the funds they have spent on building dikes have been considerable. The southern breakwater is about 600 meters long. The soil wall of the Xiuguluan River Yuli Dike was washed away. The dike in the lower reaches of the Xinwulu River, which is 2,450 meters long and protects 20,000 mu of cultivated land, was severely damaged by floods this year. Residents have requested speedy repairs, otherwise the aborigines will collectively go to the mountains. It has now been decided to repair it, with a construction cost of approximately 4 million yuan.

In the past, the Japanese forbade the aborigines from entering the mountains and tried their best to give them convenience to cultivate in the plains. The main reason for this was to prevent them from freely burning mountains and felling trees, which directly affected afforestation and further deepened the disasters of floods. Now the bureau is rushing to repair and build, hoping to protect their cultivated area and life.

Natural Harbor Karrulan, Decided to Maintain Traffic

There are several natural harbors in eastern Taiwan. The Japanese cooperated with the southward policy and used Taiwan as a base for aggression. Most of these harbors were used for military purposes.

After passing through the Taitung Bridge, we arrived at Karrulan Port. This is a natural harbor. The Japanese had already prepared to develop it here, and a part had already been built. The war forced them to stop. There is a large bay in the south of the harbor and a flat area in the north, which may become an excellent harbor. In the past, some ships docked here, and sugar and transport companies had warehouses. The first year's construction plan has a construction cost of NT$2.63 million. We looked into the distance on the embankment, and Huoshaodao was right in front of us. The warm current presents distinctly different colors near the shore and in the blue sea. Near the shore, rocks accumulate to form shallows. After inspection by Director Xu and Lin of the Port Affairs Bureau, it is not suitable for boats to stop, and it must be further developed. What is currently being considered is the value of building the port. There is no large amount of sugar and rice in this area. What can be used is when the Port of Taitung cannot stop operations, this place can provide a refuge during the windy season. Director Ren agreed to consider County Magistrate Xie's request to build Karrulan Port. At this time, he decided to open another eastern route starting next year, from Mulong to Suao, Hualien Port, Shinkō, Taitung, Huoshaodao, Hongtouyu, and even Kaohsiung. He said that this route will be temporarily scheduled for two flights per month, which is obviously a loss-making venture, but developing the east and facilitating and maintaining traffic is the first priority.

Eastern Taiwan seems to form another world because of the difficulty of transportation, the lack of travelers, the lack of regular ships, the lack of restored highway cars, especially during the windy season. Taiwan's two specialties are its masterpieces in the east: typhoons and earthquakes. Most typhoons land in the east, averaging more than three times a year, with the maximum wind speed being 61 meters per second. There are the most micro-earthquakes, with more than 1,000 sea earthquakes per year in the province, and more than 630 in the east. When the typhoon lands, it is followed by mountain floods, difficulty in water supply, and traffic disruption. The struggle of the people of eastern Taiwan and the local administrative agencies with nature is worthy of praise, especially the restoration of traffic at any time is even more worthy of admiration, and the decision on the traffic in the east, in addition to the highways that have been opened to traffic, the sailing of shipping is even more good news for the people of Taitung!

Taitung Fishing Port Shinkō is About to Revive and Grow

Taitung County governs three districts, sixteen townships, and one hundred villages. Shinkō, which is 51 meters northeast of the county seat, is a district and town. In the past, the Japanese praised it as representing the county. This is the only fishing port in the east. Originally, it was hoped that a port of 30,000 tons would be built. Fourteen years ago, the Japanese spent more than 800,000 yuan to build it into the current port, which can accommodate 80 fishing boats. There are two ship repair shops. In the past, it could manufacture fishing boats under 300 tons. Now, like the freezing yard, it is stagnant because the power is less than 200 K·w. Currently, there are 17 fishing boats. They drive into the warm current in the early morning and return to the base, which is three meters deep, at high tide. These fishermen were recruited by the Japanese every year, and in the first four years, they reached 250 people. More than 80 ships went to the sea to fish every day, with the highest annual output reaching more than 100,000 kilograms.

Appendix: In this article (1), the number of members of the Taitung Inspection Team should be corrected to 15 units, of which Zhu Gangfu, a specialist from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, was omitted, and the song character of Li Chunsong was mistakenly written as the sheng character. Merged and corrected.

### A Fulfilling Married Life

— Pan Weiqin

Love is a beautiful love poem, but real life is a ledger. I have never seen a love poem that writes, "Rice is 60,000 yuan a stone, vegetables are 500 yuan a pound." Nor have I ever seen a ledger record, "In the silent, quiet moments, our hearts connected." This is the difference between love and real life.

Most young people in love are indulging in fantasy. They are thinking: "What kind of ceremony should we have when we get married? Where should we spend our beautiful honeymoon? How should we decorate the room? What color should the furniture in the room be painted?..." These questions are often discussed in low voices by the water's edge and under the shade of trees by almost every pair of lovers who are ready to get married. They all imagine a fulfilling married life. They believe that they will definitely enjoy a lot of happiness after marriage; however, in reality, marriage brings a series of practical problems.

Marriage is a lesson in life, and it cannot be built on those beautiful dreams. Marriage is the beginning of a family, and a family needs real life. Those who marry should first consider how to live after marriage? How will the income and expenses be managed after marriage? How to prepare for the cost of having a child... This series of problems cannot be avoided after marriage and requires you to answer them, unless you are a fellow who depends on inheritance and has no self-reliance. If you want to build a family on your own, but you have not deeply considered these many problems, and you get married rashly, then these many problems will stand in front of you, and the daily necessities of life may become the material for your quarrels. But before marriage, these many questions do not exist, just strolling in the park, watching movies, and saying sweet words. As for the things of daily necessities of life, they will not enter their minds at all. So we have only ever heard of "couples focused on daily necessities," how often have we heard of "lovers focused on daily necessities"? "Other people's wives are better," precisely because other people's wives will not come to nag you about those daily necessities. If other people's wives become your wives and also nag about daily necessities next to you, then your feeling will not be good. This is the change before and after marriage, and it is also a main reason why marriage makes love disappear.

However, the world is so big, and the scope of "marriage" and "love" is so broad that a simple answer like this will certainly not satisfy people. Is the breakdown of feelings between husband and wife only about daily necessities? Of course not. What is said above is only a more common phenomenon. Although many people do not have problems with their lives after marriage, and do not have to worry about daily necessities every day, it is inevitable that couples will gradually expose their shortcomings after being together for a long time, and sometimes they are unwilling to tolerate each other. As a result, the feelings before marriage and the original good impression of each other gradually fade, fade, and eventually disappear. Originally, what they saw of each other before marriage was mostly just an outward appearance, because on the one hand, they were deceived by emotions, thinking that any point of the other person was lovely and beautiful; on the other hand, both sides tried their best to conceal their shortcomings, leaving a good impression. But after marriage, becoming permanent partners, these shortcomings are difficult to conceal, and the power of emotional deception will eventually disappear one day. Therefore, "old couples" are mostly not as intimate as "newlyweds," and this is the reason.

There is also a type of man who thinks that after marrying a woman, this woman is "his," and he can do whatever he wants with her. Although when pursuing her, he was so humble, not hesitating to use all kinds of flattering means. But once married, he puts on the face of a "master of the house." They think that "fragrant bait is only used when the fish has not been caught." If this concept exists in the minds of men, it is the misfortune of women. I hope that women will pay more attention to this type of man.

In short, life after marriage requires mutual understanding and mutual help from both sides, so that the previous feelings can continue, and marriage will not become a tomb of love.

### Winter Children's Clothing

— Zhao Ying

The purpose of clothing is to protect the body temperature of people and prevent it from being dissipated. Therefore, in winter, it is appropriate to use materials that are not easy to conduct heat, and soft woolen fabrics such as flannel are most suitable, followed by cotton clothes made of cotton cloth. Silk fabrics cannot protect body temperature in winter, and are not very suitable for hygiene except for their beauty.

Children's clothes should be loose and large, and should not be tightly bound to their bodies to prevent their development. Moreover, when clothes are too small, it takes a long time to change clothes, which can easily lead to colds and the risk of breaking hands and feet. Belts or buttons that are tightly bound to the body should also not be used, as they can easily injure the skin and hinder blood circulation, which can easily lead to various diseases. Tightly binding the lungs and causing difficulty in breathing is even more harmful.

The material of children's clothing should be soft and pliable, and coarse and hard materials that can easily scratch the skin should not be used. For the color, the lining must be white, so that any slight dirt can be seen. Even if not, light colors should be used. Dark and fading colors should not be used for either inner or outer clothing.

The thickness of children's clothing should be appropriate. It is not advisable to be too thin, and it is also not advisable to be too thick. Common people think that children's bodies are delicate and easily catch colds, and often dress them in clothes that are too thick. In fact, children's colds are more often caused by clothes that are too thick than by clothes that are too thin. This is because those who wear clothes that are too thick will definitely sweat a lot. When this large amount of sweat evaporates, it takes away a large amount of heat from the skin (physically known as heat of vaporization), causing the skin to suddenly feel cold and catch a cold. Moreover, those who sweat too much will gradually weaken their bodies, so the harm of clothes that are too thick is greater than that of being too thin. Just look at the children of the poor, who are naked all year round, and their bodies are extremely strong. This is because they have become accustomed to it, and the resistance of their skin has been enhanced, so there is no fear of catching a cold. It can be seen that strengthening the skin will enhance resistance, which can not only prevent colds, but also prevent various diseases, but the method of strengthening must be gradual, and if it is done too quickly, it will be harmful.

When children are indoors, there is no need to wear hats except in winter. Because the head is already protected by hair, if you wear a hat, it will be too warm, and there will be too much blood in the brain, which can easily cause headaches, brain swelling, and other diseases, and it will also hinder the development of intelligence. Therefore, Western men do not wear hats indoors, regardless of winter or summer. Therefore, from an early age, it is advisable to develop the habit of not wearing hats indoors. However, newborns need to wear hats in the first winter because their heads are not yet covered in hair, but in the second winter, they do not need to wear hats indoors.

Children's winter hats should be knitted with wool, which is light and soft, and should not be decorated with too much gold, silver, or other decorations, which would increase the weight.

Children's clothes and hats should be newly made. If old items have to be used, they must be boiled, sun-dried, and disinfected before they can be used.

### Common Sense for Housekeeping

— Shun Ding

The glass chimney of kerosene lamps is most prone to cracking. When the glass chimney is newly purchased, it should be placed horizontally in a pot, filled with cold water, and the water must completely submerge the lamp chimney. Boil it, and stop after the water has boiled for a while. Wait for the water to cool and take it out, then the quality of the lamp chimney will be improved and it can be durable, and it is not easy to burst when used.

To prevent the paste from turning sour, add a little alum when making the paste.

After using the kerosene lamp chimney every day, it should be wiped with a piece of rough straw paper with a drop of kerosene sprinkled on it, so that it will be bright and luminous.

After the paper wall is pasted for a long time, its surface will inevitably be covered with dust, which is quite unsightly. If you use a piece of steamed bread, wiping the paper wall, it will be free of any dust and as bright as new.

When washing clothes, if you dissolve a little borax in hot water and soak the clothes you want to wash in this water, and then take them out, they will be as clean and white as new.

If a little salt is placed in the water of the vase and stirred, it will not crack even in severe cold.

If pears are stored with grapes in between, do not let them touch each other, and they can be kept from rotting even after a year.

### Women and Subjectivity

— Liu Manyun

Even with more than four thousand years of patriarchal social life, thought patterns, and concepts still accompanying us, we still feel that subjectivity is inappropriate.

Women's superstitions, the erroneous concepts of educating children, etc. all come from subjectivity. Here, let's talk about the subjective results of their trivial daily lives:

First, let's talk about their attitude towards their husbands. Whenever their husbands come home late at night, their minds are always filled with these thoughts: "Maybe he met a girlfriend and is talking to her," "Maybe he is dancing with a dance hostess in the ballroom," "Maybe he is..." These many guesses brew her resentment, sadness, and grief, and she is very sure that he is doing this. So when her husband comes back, she has an iron face, first darkening the air, then quarreling... Even after her husband's explanation, she cannot eliminate her preconceived notions.

When she sees a relative or friend coming to borrow something, she is absolutely certain that he is coming to borrow money or seek a job... So she first gives people an embarrassing coldness, even if he just came to talk and relieve boredom.

She occasionally encounters a stranger with a tender face who will involuntarily blush, and always thinks that he must have done something guilty, so she guesses and misunderstands...

After hearing the neighbor's report: "The daughter of a certain family has been going out at night recently," then she will blurt out: "I wonder what kind of person her boyfriend is?" "Maybe she will get married soon?" "Perhaps she is already..." These subjectively-based stands that we are exposed to every day make us often unaware of our own mistakes. From this subjective attitude, misunderstandings, discord, and even tragedies may arise.

Even a criminal in court must go through investigation, collection of evidence, and debate procedures, let alone these people who may not actually have committed a crime?

Living in this era, everything must be observed and considered from a purely objective standpoint. If you observe accurately and judge fairly, then success and happiness will be yours.

### The Origin of Christmas

— Dan Lin

The annual "universal celebration" of Christmas, many people, even some Christians, think that December 25th is the day Jesus was born. In fact, that's not true. However, what is the true date of Jesus' birth? That has become a historical mystery. For more than 1,900 years, no one has been able to answer it. We cannot find any definite and strong evidence from the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament to the Book of Revelation, and from church history and world history. Even if we ask the bishops, priests, missionaries, and other missionaries to answer, we cannot get the correct date, because there is absolutely no description of the date of Jesus' birth in the New Testament Bible.

So why do Christians all over the world, and even non-Christians, use December 25th as a memorial to Jesus' birth? This is just a kind of "customary law" in church history, or it can only be said to be a "memorial" day. According to the explanation of Christmas in the "Bible Dictionary" (Note):

"This festival began to be observed in 300 AD. The Western Church designated December 25th as the day. The Eastern Church designated January 6th as the day. However, this is only the day designated by the Church, and there is no evidence for it. And no one observed this festival for hundreds of years after Jesus' birth, and it was only gradually implemented later that it began to be observed.)

Also, the "Encyclopedia of Ethics and Religion" (Note) says of "Christmas":

"...By the fourth century, the Church decided that Jesus' birth should be commemorated, and thereafter it became the common practice of the Church. The Gospels do not record the month or day of Jesus' birth, and we do not know what the ancients based their claim that December 25th was Christmas on. Some say that the Jewish religion originally had a festival on this day, so the ancients used it as the birthday of Jesus."

According to this, we know that December 25th is not the correct date of Jesus' birth, but only a "common practice of the Church" after the fourth century AD.

Originally, during the Roman era, after the Christian Church suffered great persecution from outside the church, the number of believers not only did not decrease, but instead increased sharply, the faith became more firm, missionary work became more effortful, and general undertakings were expanded many times over. As a result, churches in various places suddenly became prosperous. During this period, some enthusiastic believers were thinking of finding a suitable opportunity to commemorate the birth of Jesus once a year to show their respect and gratitude. However, there was no history to consult and no legacy to rely on, so there was no way to start. At that time, the clever missionaries took advantage of the environment at the time and replaced the local "Saturnalia" with Christmas Day, adopting the customs of the Romans celebrating the festival to represent the joy of Christians commemorating Jesus' birth. This day is now the commonly used Gregorian calendar December 25th.

Speaking of the Gregorian calendar, this year is 1946, but according to historical calculations, there is a difference of four years. However, the world has been using it for a long time, and there is no way to change it. This is something that anyone who studies Western history can know.

Exchanging Christmas cards is a recent thing. Around 1862, an English painter named William de Ryther created a kind of colored picture that was exceptionally beautiful and sent it to relatives and friends everywhere, attracting social attention. As a result, for decades, it has become a kind of souvenir that is exchanged to celebrate Christmas, and the post offices of various countries have stipulated dates for receiving and delivering mail during the winter every year.

Other things, such as lighting candles, are commonly used in Jewish holidays; hanging mistletoe and holly leaves in houses is a custom practiced by ancient British churches; burning firewood is a custom of worshiping natural objects in Europe, transplanting trees in courtyards, and hanging colored objects is a way for European people to have fun; dressing up as an old man with a happy face and giving gifts to children is an old custom of European people. Jesus' birth is close to the winter solstice festival in Western Europe, so many of the customs of the winter solstice festival have been incorporated into Christmas.

Note: The "Bible Dictionary" and the "Encyclopedia of Ethics and Religion" are both compiled and printed by the Shanghai Guangxue Society and are reference dictionaries for Christian missionaries and theology researchers.

### Window of Winter

— Shusun Ruying

Snow

You came so quietly, after the red glow, after the delicate rain, after the northwest wind. The cold current from Siberia brought us the cold weather, but it also brought you. You, you, I have been yearning for more than a year!

You didn't forget my narrow courtyard, my holly tree, and my decaying grass; thank you for your visit, thank you for your stay, thank you for scattering snowflakes all over my roof.

You give me the confirmation of cold, the model of whiteness, the example of holiness, and the unprecedented joy of comfort.

You decorate the mountains and fields of winter, and you disinfect the seedbeds of plants for the coming spring. You serve the season and also mark the season. You give inspiration to poets and also become the subject of poets. You give the farmers who lack clothing the threat of severe cold, and also give them the hope of a bumper harvest next year.

If winter has no snow, just like spring has no flowers, summer has no thunderstorms, and autumn has no fallen leaves, how desolate this world will be!

Sunshine

The field worms cowering in the cracks in the wall welcome you, the birds flying on the branches welcome you, the green bamboo welcomes you, and the crucian carp in the pond welcomes you. All the creatures troubled by the cold are welcoming you from the bottom of their hearts, sunshine!

May you shine warmly. From the corner of the house in the west to the corner of the house in the east; from morning to dusk; from the slight cold in November to the severe cold in late winter; from the withering of chrysanthemums to the budding of plum blossoms.

You, sunshine, are the rebellion of cold, the source of warmth, the guarantee of growth and joy, the spring in winter, and the smile on the face of the angry.

You, sunshine, are most glorious in the darkness, warmest in the cold, withdrawing hope before despair, and bringing joy after pain.

You, sunshine, despise the crowd hiding by the water's edge, despise the lazy people who are greedy for quilts. You are with the farmers in the fields, with the youth in the open spaces, with the heroes fighting for freedom and justice, and with the innocent children.

You, sunshine, are like a mother's heart, like a military band on the march, like a high song during labor, like a belief during a decisive battle, and like a torch in a tunnel.

If it weren't for you, how would we get through this winter?

Window of Winter

Breathe on the window of winter, and white mist will stick to the glass on the window.

In this vast whiteness, what can you see?

Maybe you see cold, you see hunger, you see the icebergs of the Arctic and the snow on Changbai Mountain. Maybe you see the snowman you sculpted in your childhood, maybe you see the snow lamp lit by your grandmother's trembling hands, and you see her aging face, waiting for omens of good and bad luck. Maybe you see tomorrow, you see the rising sun, you see a flat road, you see a magnificent hall. Maybe you see your joy and your misty dreams.

However, maybe you see nothing at all, and the change of seasons cannot arouse a bit of your nostalgia and reverie.

Then, let you decide whether to stay or leave, in front of this winter window, in front of this grain of sand in the turbid current of life.

But I stand under the winter window, wanting to take a look at myself.

### A Mock Love Letter—Imitating Ovid of Rome

— Holy

First Letter

The autumn sky is so vast, yet my heart feels a strange shrinking and sorrow, an immortal infatuation deeply and persistently eroding my present life.

Can you ignore a young boy confessing such primal affection to you?

Perhaps you'll be indifferent to my *love at first sight*, but from late spring to early autumn, in the not-so-short, drawn-out summer, I've been struggling in the pond of my soul. I can't believe I've become so timid, secretly burying my unrestrained and eager sincerity and passion with my own hands. For countless long nights, I've cast distant reveries towards the Vatican, silently blessing your eternal youth.

Goethe praised a kind of one-sided, sublime yearning, and Turgenev tacitly approved of a pure and dormant love's anticipation. For these past few months, I've lived in this atmosphere of quietude. But why did you so carelessly stir up my surging emotions? A while ago, you wanted to "repay," and yesterday you breached the dam that I had fortified in my heart. I really should have written to you sooner, because I can no longer hold on: these magnificent years seem to be rushing past me so quickly.

If possible, tonight I earnestly await you at ××, hoping you will tread upon the blank spaces in my life.

The autumn night is like water, and it's time for me to silently pray for you again.

Second Letter

It is a stream of quiet warmth that has unfolded my life's yearning with such gentleness and solemnity…

In the autumn sun, I reverently recited your few consoling words that burst forth from your youth. The world seems to have molded a complete realm of imagination for you, and the shadow of the Garden of Eden tenderly covers my heart.

Like a martyr offering his life to truth for his faith, I have decided to present before you the sincerity of my earnest and flawless life; the life on the battlefield of these few years has entrusted me with my unrestrained love, which is my profound love of life. Away from a life of fighting, love will be hurt by the dust of the years, so, holding a kind and good expectation, hoping for the cultivation and inheritance of this love, therefore, I bravely and resolutely pour out my heart's desire and request to you.

However, you have always sealed my yearning with indifference. Is it that your health, like the deep melancholy of this late autumn, dwells in your heart? Tell me! This muted note shatters my heart into fragments in a silent melody! Can you gently repeat to me, "In autumn, there is our spring"!

I have already dissolved the shadow of my entire life into expectation, waiting for you to smile again, this smile will uncover the worries of my buried century!

Third Letter

I really dare not try to use trembling hands to extract the gold dust from so many settled memories, because I have already been sealed off from the most sublime passion by a cruel and bitter reality.

Yesterday I began to sip this rare bitter wine in life. In the autumn wind, with a childlike heart, what city is there left? I feel like I am galloping in the vast ocean. You should know that this is a ruthless persecution of a kind soul!

I still have to chew on the scraps of life you discarded to me. This century, this world, I have nothing to miss; I need stories, outpourings from your mouth, which will be the magnificent record of my whole life. I need poems, the soaring melodies composed by you, which will be the eternal rhythm of my longing life!

I have forgotten the joy and sorrow of the past few months, like a tired traveler on a journey trudging towards a post station, waiting for the "tomorrow" you give me!

Can you bear to let an innocent love languish and moan in the mire? I earnestly ask you.

Brief History of Musicians

### Haydn (P.J. Haydn)

— Heaven

An Austrian, one of the "Three Masters of Vienna," he was extremely accomplished in creating "instrumental style." He was amiable and easygoing, so his works are also full of interest and cheerful colors. To this day, it can be said that there is no woman in the West who does not know "Papa Haydn." The word "Papa" describes Haydn's kind and gentle nature. Born in 1732, died in 1809.

### One Inch of Territory, One Inch of Blood 131

— Ye Jingfeng

Tsurumi planned to go to Konoe's villa that night to search for the "Seven Secret Letters," so as soon as he arrived at Anzaka's Chicken Farm, he immediately called Yano to rush to Tokyo as soon as dawn broke, ordering Number 012 to mobilize all personnel to prepare for action upon command; he ordered Yuanko to arrange internal support work, providing information about the villa every one to two hours. The morning information could be collected and sent by Yano; the afternoon information was to be transmitted to Anzaka by Number 012 on time. In addition, he called Yano to order "Number 03" and "Number 011," the two action commanders, one principal and one subordinate, to arrive at Anzaka Chicken Farm before 1:00 PM to listen to the plan and receive action orders. Regarding the future work trends of the China side's Changxindian Headquarters, he called Yano to instruct "Number 012" to handle it according to the approved requests on the information.

After Yano left, Tsurumi rested at Anzaka's place until about 9:30 AM. A car rushed to Tokyo, and he changed into his grade uniform at the apartment, ran to the General Staff Headquarters, and went to see his immediate superior, explaining that he had to rush back to the mainland that day; he inquired about the location, flights, and times of the military aircraft. Seeing that the last military plane was at 9:00 PM, he decided to take this flight to depart, and after the usual consultation with his superior, he took his leave.

With Tsurumi's departure date set, he went to the Black Dragon Society's action headquarters, nominally called "×× Club," to see several resident executive committee members, flattering them obsequiously, and asked for advice on future actions. Tsurumi was an employee and did not participate in local actions, so the committee members only said some official words of serving the country and loyalty to the society, and asked a few questions about Tsurumi's future movements, considering it a formality. Tsurumi made several farewell calls at the headquarters, one to Tsurumi Kiyoshi and one to Pingzi.

Tsurumi spent two hours rushing to complete the items that should be arranged in the secret plan before hurrying back to Anzaka's Chicken Farm.

Since Tsurumi was a person of interest to Tokyo's various secret societies, could it be that no one was monitoring or tracking his actions in these few hours? It was impossible! Please see this passage in the afternoon newspaper of that day, titled "Flying Here and There, Actions Unpredictable…; Minor Dignitary Tsurumi Tamashi Goes to the Mainland!" A subtitle read, "Re-enlisting, A Hero Comes Forth in His Youth!... The Late-Night Imperial Army Special Aircraft Takes Off, Departing at 9:00 PM, Wishing Victory with Success…!"

Since the news of Tsurumi's flight back to the mainland had been discovered, it was logical that someone should have followed him to Anzaka Chicken Farm, wasn't it? However, this was a bit difficult to do: because Tsurumi's actions at this time were all planned; in other words, he deliberately revealed his movements for what he wanted people to know, and of course, he used extraordinary and ingenious methods to extricate himself from the part he did not want people to know.

Moreover, at this time, the only ones who could match Tsurumi's cunning were the Fifth Column in general. However, the Fifth Column had to be controlled by Konoe. Since Konoe, the old fellow, had played that trick on Tsurumi the night before yesterday, thinking that he had tamed this unruly horse, he did not pay much attention to his actions. The hunting dogs of the Fifth Column, seeing that their master had let go of the reins, naturally did not interfere.

When Tsurumi rushed back to Anzaka Chicken Farm, there were already three people waiting there; one was Yano, one was Number 03, and one was Number 011.

Number 03, Ueno Bunsei, was a press photographer. After being expelled from a public orphanage at the age of sixteen, he wandered around the country for four years. Later, he went to various parts of Europe via Okinawa, Taiwan, Singapore, India, etc., working as a traveling beggar all the way, for ten years in total. By the time he returned to the homeland, he had become a very capable photographer, and he was also a member of a certain special secret society. Some people speculate that this secret society is a radical anarchist group. His acquaintance with Tsurumi was due to Anzaka's introduction.

### Christmas

— Shao Fu

Hark! the herald angels sing,

Glory to the newborn King;

Peace on earth, and mercy mild,

God and sinners reconciled!

This song will fill every corner of the world today. Even non-Christians will feel a warmth and joy when they hear this song!

According to the Bible: Jesus was born in a manger in the town of Bethlehem. This humble place gave birth to the most sublime figure. We can verify Jesus's later saying, "For those who exalt themselves will be humbled," which can very well illustrate that humble origins are not enough to limit a person's achievements.

Traditionally, on this day, Santa Claus carries a heavy sock filled with all kinds of gifts, coming down from the chimney to visit every home.

The gifts in the sock have now become candies, cookies, toys, and even daily necessities. They are certainly in line with human nature and very practical, but they are too vulgar. In our opinion, the legendary sock may represent the meaning of infinite hope; coming down from the chimney explains warmth; and the white-haired, white-bearded old man represents kindness.

A few days ago, a New York dispatch from the US Information Service said that this year, the advertisements of various companies and stores show Santa Claus flying in an airplane, and his gifts are dropped by parachute, which seems to be progress. After reading this news, to be honest, we felt a little bit of horror, because that killing atmosphere will completely drive away this little bit of joy in the world.

### Bad Luck Befalls My Family

— Ah Hui

In recent months, the food at home has been getting worse and worse, not as good as before. I think the biggest reason is that vegetables have become more expensive. Let's not talk about that for now. A month ago, my wife suddenly asked me for pocket money. I knew my wife was very frugal. She doesn't go to the theater, doesn't play cards, and is reluctant to eat well. She always manages to save some private money from the food budget, usually around four or five hundred thousand. She doesn't even trust putting it in the bank for interest. Where did all this money go? It really puzzled me.

Later, she told me that she had joined a "three-legged rotating credit association," each share being 100,000 yuan:

"They'll all mature next April. Each share will yield 1.5 million, three shares will be 4.5 million. Think about it, almost five million. How many years would you have to work to earn that!"

I smiled. She was very excited. I didn't want to dampen her enthusiasm. However, if the monthly payments were to be taken from the food budget, it wouldn't matter for me, but I couldn't bear it if the children didn't get enough to eat. So I told her: I'll try to scrape together the monthly payments. Don't cut back on the food anymore. I also told her that if there were any more credit associations in the future, she couldn't join them again. Otherwise, the whole family would have to go hungry.

"Don't worry, five million, we'll have five million next spring, isn't that enough?"

I smiled. Five million, it's really tempting.

The day before yesterday, my wife came home with a very bad complexion. The day before, she sat in the room staring blankly, not even cooking dinner. The children said they hadn't had lunch, just some biscuits. Mom had been sitting there, and the little ones were scared and cried.

I knew something had gone wrong with the "rotating credit association." I asked her, and she threw herself on the bed and sobbed. I comforted her with a smile:

"Forget it, we still have three million left, isn't that a big sum?"

She choked back sobs and replied that two legs had already collapsed the day before yesterday and yesterday, and another leg was about to break.

I kept comforting her, telling her that the children were important, that when they grow up, five million or ten million wouldn't matter. I told her to go cook dinner right away. At the same time, I felt relieved in my heart that I didn't have to "rack my brains" to scrape together the monthly payments anymore.

Yesterday, the dishes were better than usual. The children were eating happily, and my wife lowered her head and didn't say a word.

Just before going to bed, she calmly told me:

"The last leg has also collapsed."

### Opposing City-County Boundary Division for Fear of Heavy Taxes and Levies

— Kang Shi

The newspaper on the 19th carried a "correspondence from Minhang" regarding the issue of dividing the boundaries between Shanghai City and County. Inspector Cheng Jing and others from the Ministry of Interior came to Minhang for inspection. Local groups and the public unanimously advocated retaining county governance, even to the point of forming processions to petition, posting slogans, and shouting slogans. This is indeed a topic worth discussing!

I returned to Minhang several times between summer and autumn and heard something about the division of Shanghai City and County. It is said that the proposal to incorporate Minhang Sanlin and other villages belonging to Shanghai County into Shanghai City had been brewing intensely since this spring. This time, Inspector Cheng and others from the Ministry of Interior came to Minhang precisely for this issue. Therefore, at that time, various groups and the public petitioned to retain county governance and oppose incorporation into the city.

From an objective point of view, upgrading a county to a city would naturally promote gradual progress in transportation construction and other aspects, which is indeed fortunate for the local area. However, the local public is instead petitioning to retain county governance and oppose incorporation into the city. What is the reason for this? The reason is that within the county, all kinds of taxes and levies are lighter than in the city. If it is incorporated into the city, then all taxes and levies will naturally be treated the same as in the city, even if the difference is reduced compared to the city, it will still be higher than in the county. Therefore, everyone is panicking, so they petition, post slogans, and shout slogans to seek to retain county governance!

As my hometown is located there, I am relatively clear about the commercial situation in Minhang, and I feel that this matter is of great importance, and I can't help but feel something. Since the victory, all industries have declined. In Minhang, due to the farmers' purchasing power being in a slump, various businesses have had no sales. If it is incorporated into the city, all business taxes, municipal taxes, etc., will inevitably increase. In these days of commercial hardship, how can people not panic?

Therefore, considering the people's interests and drawbacks, I hope that the authorities will plan the overall situation, so that the administration and the people can both benefit, that is "fortunate for governance."

### Tang Monk Meets a Swindler

— Jian

The owner of the Baekel Road ×× cigarette shop, whose surname is Tang, is called Tang Monk because he is vegetarian, believes in Buddhism, and is kind by nature. The store employs three clerks and one apprentice. With small capital, they operate frugally, and the business is gradually developing. Recently, an apprentice about fifteen or sixteen years old often comes to buy cigarettes. When the store clerks are not busy, he likes to chat and joke around. The store clerks, because he is a regular customer, do not treat him coldly and often engage in casual conversation.

One morning, not long after the door opened, this apprentice came hurriedly with a small suitcase in his hand. He took out a check for 80,000 yuan from ×× Bank dated for that day from his pocket and said to the store clerks with concern: "I received an urgent letter from home last night saying that my father is seriously ill and I need to return home immediately. I asked the store owner for two months' salary in advance for expenses, but the store doesn't have enough cash, so they signed this check for me to use. However, the bank hasn't opened yet, and it's not a short distance to get there. Plus, the ship home is about to depart. Can you help me out and exchange it for cash?" He handed the check to a clerk to show that it was not counterfeit.

However, the cigarette store clerks are all shrewd and capable and know that bad checks are common nowadays. Those who are deceived are often heard of, so they flatly refused to do so and handed the check back. After receiving the check, the apprentice hesitated for a moment and said: "Well, then I'll just have to go myself, but it's tiring to carry this suitcase back and forth. Please do me a favor and keep it for me temporarily. I'll be back to pick it up within an hour." As he spoke, he put the suitcase on the counter. At this time, Tang Monk had come down from upstairs. Seeing the apprentice's pitiful situation, he agreed to his request. A clerk surnamed Xu casually put the suitcase on the ground inside the counter. The apprentice thanked him repeatedly and hurriedly bid farewell.

That day, the apprentice never returned. The next day, in the evening, two people dressed as fake military police came to ask about the apprentice's suitcase. They said: "That apprentice is not an apprentice, but a robber named Li Biao. He has now been arrested and interrogated. He confessed that Tang the owner is his accomplice and that there is a suitcase containing a pistol in the store," and so on. Upon hearing this, Tang Monk was panic-stricken and explained the situation of keeping the suitcase, strenuously clearing himself. At the same time, he handed over the suitcase. They pried it open to check. It contained several suits of worn clothes, but no pistol. However, there was a business card of Li Biao pasted inside the lid. At that time, the people came in a fierce manner, saying that Tang must be an accomplice and that they had to hand over the pistol and arrest him. At this time, the store clerks advocated reporting to the police, but Tang Monk did not want to cause trouble and only wanted a peaceful resolution. As a result, he offered 200,000 yuan, and the storm subsided. It can be seen that it is not easy to be a good person in Shanghai.

Young man: "I don't need a house. I was born in a hospital, studied in a school, proposed in a car, got married in a church, and divorced in a court. I sleep in a hotel in the morning, drink tea in a cafe in the afternoon, and spend the night in a club. When I die, I'll be embalmed in a funeral home. All I need is a garage."

### Inside Story of Kidnappers

— Jian Hua

Kidnapping is a variant of banditry, but they do have a strict organization and strong capital. For example, disguised rickshaw pullers, drivers, maids, etc., choose and observe certain families in advance. They secretly communicate information; such as finding and raising people who provide cars, guns, and watch the hostages; also such as the provision or lease of cars, pistols, hiding places, etc.; must be designed, directed, and capitalized by a leader. However, the above points are not the difficult problems of kidnappers. As long as the leader has flexible funds, and the talents of the gang are concentrated, it is not difficult to solve them and choose the fattest target to devour.

Finally, one thing

Their most difficult hurdle is the final stage of receiving the ransom after a deal is struck and a sum is agreed upon. Because kidnapping is a surprise secret action that takes advantage of people's unpreparedness, and it usually does not go wrong on the battlefield. As for contacting the ransom, it is done by telephone or communication, which is also an indirect action, and there is no worry about solving the case. Only receiving the ransom requires designating a location and sending someone to pick it up. This completely uncovered, blatant action often falls short, and there is a risk of all members being caught.

Therefore, they use all their ingenuity to design meticulously, with methods such as "drilling knife circle", "fishing for goldfish", and "catching garbage", in order to break through the crucial gate and get the ransom. For example, after the victim receives the letter from the kidnappers, when they are still watching and indecisive, or if there is a tendency to report to the police, they have their own informants to notify them, and they simply make a direct approach, pretending to be police officers, and enter the kidnapped person's home directly, explaining that your kidnapping case has been detected by the police, ask why you do not report and handle it privately, and secretly inform the ransom location and ransom amount, instructing them to prepare the full amount and go to arrest them on the expiration date, and that they must keep it secret and not let the bandits know, etc. If the victim is completely convinced, then when it comes to the time of payment, the same person is still sent, disguised as a rickshaw puller, to take the person paying the ransom to the designated location to carry out the handover, which is called "drilling knife circle". In case this plan is seen through by the other party, they use tearing up the ticket to threaten and take other methods

Fishing for Goldfish

The so-called "fishing for goldfish" is that the kidnappers notify the kidnapped person's family, asking them to seal gold bars in a cloth bag and throw them into a certain section of the Huangpu River. This method is easy to understand. Their main point is to make it difficult for the police to cope. After the gold bars are thrown into the Huangpu River, their gang has "water rats" lurking to retrieve them, but the time to retrieve them is impossible to guess. The bottom of the water is not like the ground, and it is impossible to wait for a long time, so it is also the most difficult to arrest.

Previously, a certain police station received a report from the victim, saying that the kidnappers had agreed on a certain day and time to take the ransom to a certain lane and throw it into the trash can (there was only one trash can in that lane), requesting to arrest them. At the appointed time, the police officers ambushed around, ready to catch the bandits, waiting for the victim to throw the money in. After a long time, there was no movement, and no one came to pick up the money. The police officers could not bear it any longer. Upon inspection, the bundle of ransom in the trash can was gone. Upon careful observation, they realized that a wall in the lane was connected to the trash can, and a hole had been drilled through it, so they could reach into the room and take things out of the trash can. As a result, the second landlord of the house being watched was arrested and punished by the police, and the kidnappers had already snatched the "special trash" and left the room empty.
