### Chen Cheng and Zhou Enlai Discuss Ceasefire; Many Difficulties Arise in Northeast Mediation; Group Traveling to Siping Returns Midway

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] It has been reliably confirmed by our correspondent that the Military Three-Person Committee in Chongqing has not reached an agreement on a detailed plan to resolve the Northeast issue.

[United Press, Chongqing, 8th] Prior to today's meeting of the Three-Person Committee to discuss developments in the Northeast situation, Lieutenant General Gillem conferred with Chairman Chiang. Zhou Enlai met with General Chen Cheng yesterday to discuss ceasefire issues. Reports suggest the Three-Person Committee is stalled, but other sources believe that after the Executive Headquarters establishes a foundation for a ceasefire in the Northeast, the Three-Person Committee may form another agreement and travel to the Northeast themselves. Meanwhile, much of the work to halt the civil war has fallen on the shoulders of General Beall, director of the Executive Group of the Executive Headquarters.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] According to official sources, a central group in Shenyang is sufficient to command other groups, making it unnecessary to establish an executive branch.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] Today, Executive Group No. 28 traveled north along the Changchun Railway to the Sipingjie area, while Group No. 29 traveled south to the Benxi area. However, whether they can be effective remains unknown, as the discrepancies in opinions among the three parties are significant, and numerous difficulties stand in the way of mediation efforts. Issues such as restoring transportation, which is linked to the ceasefire, the takeover of areas from which Soviet troops are about to withdraw, and the transfer of local political power are extremely difficult to resolve. Unless these issues are thoroughly resolved, the groups will be unable to effectively carry out mediation work. Therefore, although the groups have departed in different directions today, their work is still in the symbolic and preparatory stages.

[Associated Press, Shenyang, 8th] Two groups from the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters set out this morning to the northern and southeastern parts of the Nine Eastern Provinces to investigate the deployment of troops. Each group is equipped with six to eight trucks and jeeps, fitted with radios. The group heading north includes representatives from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States, as well as several journalists, led by Colonel Collier. The group heading southeast is led by Lieutenant Colonel Thiele.

[United Press, Shenyang, 8th] The executive group heading to the Fushun coal mining area is proceeding smoothly and has not encountered any incidents. Another group dispatched to Sipingjie was obstructed by a bombed bridge (twelve miles north of Shenyang) and returned to Pan [Shenyang] this afternoon. According to the group leader, Colonel Collier, while the group was stranded on the side of the road discussing how to cross the river, Nationalist soldiers came out and warned that there were armed Communists ahead who might carry out a surprise attack, and that it would be dangerous to proceed. However, the Communist representative of the group, Major General Kong Biao, assured the other members of the group that the Communist army would not cause trouble. At the time, the Nationalist representative, Lieutenant General Wang Zhaogong (transliteration), suggested that it would be a good idea to establish a guard before continuing forward. Collier insisted that they must continue to carry out their mission and cross the river if possible, but it proved impossible, and the group returned to Pan[yang]. After returning here at half past two this afternoon, the group immediately began preparing all matters for departing by train on the 9th.

[Another dispatch] The chief of staff of the Northeast Communist Army Commander Lin Biao, Major General Wu Xiuguan, suggested during his first reception of reporters today that Nationalist and Communist troops should jointly take over areas withdrawn by Soviet troops, believing that this is the most appropriate way to stop the war in the Northeast. He also stated: "The time is not yet ripe for General Lin Biao to come to Shenyang. In fact, it is more likely that General Lin Biao will meet with General Beall or other American representatives at his Communist headquarters in his command area."

### Soviet Troops Withdraw on Three Fronts; Dong Yanping Flies Back to Changchun from Shenyang Yesterday

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 8th] The speed of the Nationalist troops departing from Shenyang to take over areas withdrawn by Soviet troops has exceeded what has already been announced in newspapers, but recently, due to melting ice and snow, muddy roads, and the increased obstruction by Communist troops, the speed of advancement has slowed down.

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 8th] Soviet troops here are currently withdrawing in three directions: north to Heihe, east to Suifenhe, and west to Manzhouli. It is reported that Soviet troops will completely withdraw from Harbin before April 26th.

[Another dispatch] Today, another 3,000 Communist troops left Shuangcheng County and moved into Banlachengzi, west of the city. The situation in Harbin is becoming increasingly serious, but so far, no incidents have occurred in the city. Mayor Yang Chaoan is calmly dealing with everything. Yesterday, he met with the person in charge of the Communist army, and both sides expressed their determination to resolve all issues peacefully in accordance with government instructions.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] Dong Yanping flew back here from Shenyang at noon on the 8th, accompanied by representatives from the Mongolian banners of Xing'an Province, Ma Mingzhou, Chen Tingrui, and Han Yuru, as well as their staff.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, has been in good spirits recently. He has had two examinations by doctors since being discharged from the hospital. It is said that although he has recovered, he still needs to rest. However, it is heard that Mr. Du believes that Northeast military affairs are important and will fly to Shenyang by special plane in ten days.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] The defense of Changchun is gradually being consolidated, and all streets are filled with obstacles, which can be sealed off at any time in the event of an emergency. The restless elements who used to strut around have recently disappeared, which greatly increases the sense of security among the general public. Some sensitive military personnel believe that with the defense of Changchun becoming increasingly solid, it is unlikely to be attacked. Even if there is a disturbance, it can be quickly subdued. Their most powerful argument is that the city has been peaceful for the past five days, and the public has been safe, which proves that those seeking an opportunity have become wary. However, the views of some political figures are the opposite. They believe that the current peace and quiet is the calm before the storm. Changchun is the political hub of the Northeast, and the Communist army will never let it go.

[Another dispatch] Amidst the Soviet troop withdrawal, the city's security team and police have launched a citywide inspection, with sentries densely deployed in the streets and alleys. Suspicious vehicles, horses, and pedestrians are also inspected. On the 7th alone, multiple boxes of handgun bullets, multiple mortar shells, and machine gun bullets were seized.

### Protecting the Property of Soviet Nationals; We Are Determined to Fulfill Our Responsibilities

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] During his last meeting with Soviet Army Chief of Staff Trotsenko, Dong Yanping, Mr. Trotsenko mentioned the issue of protecting Soviet nationals and their property after the Soviet troops withdraw from Changchun. It is said that Marshal Malinovsky's political advisor will soon provide a list of Soviet nationals and an inventory of their property to our side, hoping that we will protect them. At that time, Mr. Dong replied that he would fulfill his responsibilities, but stated that he could not predict whether Changchun would fall into a state of war in the future. Before the Nationalist takeover forces arrive, Changchun's security forces are very weak, and there may be inadequate protection. Mr. Trotsenko said that he currently does not have sufficient information to judge what kind of state Changchun will be in, but if war breaks out, accidental losses cannot be demanded from China. However, he said that what he requires is that the Chinese government not harm Soviet nationals and their property, as in the case of Shenyang. Mr. Dong said that he is absolutely responsible for this, but for the sake of protection, Soviet property will be surrounded by barbed wire, as was done in Shenyang, and if necessary, Soviet nationals will be concentrated in one place. Mr. Trotsenko accepted this. Finally, Mr. Dong reviewed the inventory of property sent by the Soviet side and expressed doubts about its ownership. He has notified the Soviet side, reiterating his intention to be responsible for protection, but declaring that he would reserve the right to all items of property.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Summons Councillors from Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] At 10:00 AM today, Chairman Chiang summoned all city councillors of Chongqing at the National Government Auditorium and gave a speech, saying that the government and the people of the wartime capital have shared joys and sorrows for eight years, making great contributions to the War of Resistance. Now that the government is about to return to Nanjing, he would like to entrust the city councillors with two matters: (1) the welfare of the people and (2) local security, hoping that they will continue to shoulder this important task. The Chairman also took a group photo with all city councillors to commemorate the occasion.

### National Conference of Business Groups Scheduled to be Held in Beijing on the 28th of This Month

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] The first national conference of business groups to be convened after the victory is scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 28th of this month. The conference is convened by the Ministry of Social Affairs, but because commercial groups in the recovered provinces and cities are still in the process of being reorganized, the conference is temporarily named "National Chamber of Commerce Friendship Association." It is heard that chambers of commerce from all provinces and cities across the country will send representatives to attend, and chambers of commerce from the Northeast provinces and cities have also received notices and will enthusiastically participate if there are no transportation problems. The quota of representatives is more than 100 people, and registration will begin on the 20th of this month. The nature of the conference is to promote emotional ties and exchange opinions, but relevant government departments also want to take this opportunity to listen to the opinions of commercial leaders from various places on post-war business development for reference. Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang and others will participate at that time.

### Zhang Zhizhong Takes Office; Optimism Regarding the Yining Issue

After the sentence was pronounced, the court instructed that if he disagreed, he could apply for an appeal within ten days.

### National Military Grand Review; The Military Training Department Revised the Plan and Submitted It for Approval

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] According to Major General Wei Heling, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department of the Military Training Department, the military demobilization conference held in February of this year decided to hold a national military grand review on a regular basis. This resolution has now been revised by the Military Training Department, and after being submitted to the highest authorities for approval, officers with reviewing experience will be assembled and undergo rigorous training. This training has already begun. The review will be divided into the Southeast Region, Southwest Region, Central China Region, South China Region, Northeast Region, Northwest Region, and Taiwan Region, and a chief reviewing committee member will be established. The selection of personnel will await the decision of the highest authorities. The review period will be approximately two weeks, and the period is scheduled for around June. In addition, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, our army fought the enemy extremely fiercely. In order to make the people of the rear and people from all walks of life understand the heroic battles of the National Army, a large-scale land and air exercise is planned to be held when the National Assembly convenes. The exercise subjects are (1) an attack on the enemy's solid defenses (formed by artillery, air, transportation, and various arms of service), (2) night-time village defense (airborne supply), (3) battlefield psychological exercise, (4) camouflage and concealment exercise. The location is selected outside Cangbomen in this city, and the 74th Army stationed in this city will be the base unit for the exercise troops, and other elite troops will be dispatched, and the air force will participate. The uniforms for the exercise of the underground troops will all be newly made to ensure uniformity, so as to receive the representatives of the National Assembly. It is also learned that the 74th Army Headquarters is preparing for the exercise, and Qiu Weida's division of the army has begun various preparations and there will be exciting performances when the time comes.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 8th] It is heard that the Nanjing Army Headquarters will be closed in the short term, perhaps by the end of the month. Tang Enbo came to Beijing today to visit Commander-in-Chief He to report on his duties.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] According to reports, people close to the National Government say that the National Government proposes He Yingqin or Zhang Qun to be appointed as Minister of National Defense, while the Central Government proposes Li Jishen and Zhang Zhizhong.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] Senior authoritative sources say that President Chiang is currently considering the approval of the entire reorganization plan for the Supreme Command of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as proposed by Lieutenant General Wedemeyer and Brigadier General McAuliffe. Wedemeyer and McAuliffe claim that the plan aims to merge the many existing military organizations and their redundant branches into two main institutions: (1) the General Staff Headquarters, and (2) the Ministry of National Defense. The plan is modeled after the American system but is even simpler. China's future General Staff Headquarters will include all air force, army, navy, and supply affairs, just like the U.S. Department of the Army. China's future Ministry of National Defense will only become a department in the cabinet that liaisons with the military. The wartime supreme military organization, the Military Affairs Commission, is not involved in the plan proposed by Wedemeyer and McAuliffe. The current Aviation Commission will become an Air Force Command under the future General Staff Headquarters. Once the reorganization plan is approved by President Chiang, it will be implemented immediately. The new plan advocates the abolition of the existing redundant military organizations, including the Military Affairs Commission, the Department of Military Operations, the Military Training Department, the Political Department, the General Logistics Headquarters, the Ministry of Military Administration, and the Aviation Commission.

### Jinan Group Reaches Agreement to Establish a Materials Exchange Committee

Request Instructions to Stop Conflicts

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 6th] The Jinan Group has recently heard of frequent conflicts occurring in various places and has issued the following telegram, requesting Commander Wang Yaowu and Commander Chen Yi of the CCP's New Fourth Army to investigate and report back for handling. The original telegram is as follows: Order He Zi No. 6 has been promulgated and urgently needs to be implemented. However, it is reported that small-scale conflicts, troop movements, intensified fortifications, and arrests of personnel are still occurring in various places. This seems to affect the implementation of the order. However, without investigation by the group, it is difficult to determine right and wrong. We hereby telegram you, Commander and Commander, to immediately and strictly order your subordinates to immediately cease conflicts, cease construction of fortifications, cease blockade policies, and cease arresting personnel. If troop movements are due to troop rotation or transportation, they must also be approved by the Executive Headquarters or the Executive Group before implementation, pending the implementation of Order He Zi No. 6. If any of the above-mentioned events are found to be true after investigation, they will be reported to the Executive Headquarters as a violation of the truce agreement. We respectfully request that you investigate and handle accordingly. Jinan Group Government representative Tu Xuwu, American representative Colonel Lake (Lieutenant Colonel Nap substitute), CCP representative Kuang Rengnong, 6th.

Agreement Signed to Implement Order

[Another Telegram] (Delayed) The representatives of the Jinan Group held an informal meeting with the military and political authorities here on the morning of the 6th and exchanged views on various urgent issues to be resolved. At 2:30 PM, the three representatives of the Jinan Group held a formal meeting and signed the following agreement regarding the implementation of Order He Zi No. 6: (1) Both parties agree that Attachments (1) and (2) of Order He Yu No. 6 should be immediately communicated to the senior commanders of both sides, and the relevant materials should be prepared promptly and sent to the group as soon as possible for processing. At the same time, the group will go to various regions in advance to implement the order according to the order. (2) Both parties agree that the group's actions will proceed in the order of Eastern Shandong, Western Shandong, Southern Shandong, and Northern Shandong, to various regions for implementation. Regarding the Liaocheng issue, both parties should immediately notify the local military commanders that they must not further increase the difficulty of resolving the issue. (3) Both parties agree that before the group arrives in a certain area, both parties should notify the local garrison commander to prepare relevant matters so that the group can immediately proceed with the resolution upon arrival. Government representative Tu Xuwu, American representative Colonel Lake (Lieutenant Colonel Nap substitute), CCP representative Kuang Rengnong, April 6, Year 35.

Road Repair and Postal Service Still Unresolved

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 8th] The work of repairing railways in North China has almost come to a standstill due to the CCP's insistence on dismantling bunkers. CCP personnel believe that dismantling bunkers is as important as restoring traffic, and they refuse to repair the roads unless the bunkers are dismantled. The Military Mediation Department is holding daily meetings on this issue but has not yet reached a resolution. Currently, the gap from Qinglongqiao to Huailai on the Ping-Sui Railway is still being blocked by the CCP, and the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are also at a standstill. Although the Pinghan Railway can be repaired from Yuanshi to Gaoyi, the issue of repairing south of Gaoyi has not yet been agreed upon. Regarding the issue of restoring the normal state of postal services, the responsible personnel of both the government and the CCP have been in contact here. The CCP insists that all postal personnel in the CCP-controlled areas should be hired by the Ministry, while the government believes that the national postal service is unified, and all personnel should undergo screening, with no exceptions for postal personnel in the CCP-controlled areas. This issue has also not been resolved.

Communist Army Continues to Attack the Tangshan Area

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] The Communist army's attacks on the area east of Tangshan have not stopped. In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops have invaded the vicinity of Lutai, threatening to attack Lutai.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] Government representative Zhang Xiqin, who went to Zhongyang to inspect the situation a few days ago, immediately proceeded to implement Orders He Zi No. 2 and No. 6 after arriving in Zhongyang, and negotiated solutions for lifting the siege and withdrawal.

[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 7th] A division of the Communist army has recently moved from Ji-Cha-Re area to the vicinity of Gaoyang in northern Shanxi. The original regiment in Gaoyang has increased its presence to the area east of Datong, including Julebao, Thirty Mile Shop, and Twenty Mile Shop, intensifying the encirclement of Datong. Recently, the Communist army has been actively constructing fortifications along the line from Fushengzhuang Tianyu in eastern Suiyuan to Sutai, as well as along the line from Dongximengou to Chenjiayingzi.

### National Assembly Meeting Unlikely to Be Postponed; Legislative Yuan to Discuss National Assembly Organization Law Tomorrow; Executive Yuan Regular Meeting to Move to Nanjing After the 16th

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] There are widespread rumors in Nanjing and Chongqing that the "First National Assembly of Representatives," originally scheduled to be held on "May 5th," may be postponed to July 7th. However, according to those who came to Nanjing from Chongqing today, the current transportation difficulties are not the main reason for the postponement of the National Assembly. The people of the country now deeply understand the government's determination to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposal to convene a National Assembly and hope to convene the National Assembly after the realization of unity and unification. If there is a postponement, the main reason should be here.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on the 10th in the National Government Auditorium. At that time, the National Assembly Organization Law will be discussed.

[Another Telegram] All agencies are currently handling the return to the capital. The regular meeting of the Executive Yuan will still be held in Chongqing twice, and then it will be moved to Nanjing after the 16th. The Yuan is currently discussing the salaries of the personnel returning to the capital. Starting from April, they will be paid according to the Nanjing standard. The family members of the officials returning to the capital who remain in Chongqing will receive a monthly face allowance of 10,000 yuan each for May and June.

[Another Telegram] This month's personnel returning to the capital are particularly crowded. In terms of air transport, in addition to the transportation of representatives of the National Assembly and senators to Nanjing, which is about 1,000 people, a total of 4,200 personnel from the central party and government agencies are returning to the capital, and they will fly to Nanjing successively starting from the 10th. The allocation of seats is as follows: 500 from the Central Party Headquarters, 100 from the Supreme National Defense Council, 280 from the National Government Secretariat and Accounting Office, 120 from the National Government Military Affairs Office, 200 from the Youth Corps, 600 from the Legislative Yuan, 120 from the Judicial Yuan, 250 from the Examination Yuan, 120 from the Control Yuan, and 1,700 from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan and its subordinate agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Food. 200 are from diplomatic missions. The rest of the ordinary personnel returning to the capital will inevitably be slightly restricted. Due to the lack of housing in Nanjing, only 50 mobile houses have been transported. Each agency will take care of its own office space in Nanjing, and the family members of the officials will remain in Chongqing for the time being. If they need to go to Nanjing first, their housing problems should be handled first.

### Vice Minister Xu Arrives in Nanjing to Preside Over the Return to the Capital

It is reported that Deputy Minister Xu will be stationed in Nanjing to preside over the department's return to the capital.

### Pinghan Railway Derailment Case: More Than 200 Killed and Injured

[Our newspaper, Hankou, 7th] Another reason for the derailment of the Pinghan Railway freight train was that the engine parts failed, and the driver did not replace them, resulting in the tragedy. According to a detailed investigation afterward, a total of eleven cars derailed. Out of more than 400 passengers, 200 were killed and more than 50 were injured. Two of them died from their injuries after being taken back by the rescue train.

### Security Council Faces New Difficulties: Soviet Union Makes Another Request; Asks Not to Discuss the Suez Incident Anymore; Britain and the United States Oppose Adding the Spanish Question to the Agenda

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th, broadcast: After the United Nations Security Council decided to postpone the discussion of the Iranian issue to May 6th, it was expected that the matter would come to an end, but new problems have arisen. Three new developments in the past two days are noteworthy: (1) Although the Security Council has decided to postpone the discussion of the Iranian complaint, the Soviet Union is still not satisfied. Soviet representative Gromyko sent another letter to UN Secretary-General Lie yesterday, stating that last week's Security Council resolution was illegal and contrary to the UN Charter. He also said that since Iran and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement, the Soviet Union firmly insists that the Iranian case should be removed from the Security Council's agenda. The current relationship between Iran and the Soviet Union poses no threat to peace and security. (2) The Iranian Prime Minister announced that armed forces are plotting a rebellion in the Maku-Terre province, which has been evacuated by Soviet troops, and the Iranian army has been ordered to immediately go to the area to quell the rebellion. (3) The contents of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company agreement have been published (see yesterday's newspaper), but today Moscow Radio claimed that the 50-mile-deep corridor along the Iranian-Iraqi-Turkish border does not belong to the jurisdiction of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company. Personnel and equipment for developing the northern Iranian oil fields are ready and can start work soon.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] UN Secretary-General Lie said today: I have not yet received the Polish proposal on the Spanish issue. At the same time, the Soviet radio station announced that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko has sent a letter to the Security Council requesting that the Iranian issue be removed from the agenda. UN personnel here were surprised to hear this and said that, according to custom, any document must be released at least two hours after it is submitted to the Security Council. This action by the Soviet Union is a violation of custom. The announcement of Gromyko's letter and the decision by the Polish representative to raise the Spanish issue to the Security Council occurred at the same time, indicating that the Soviet Union may launch a diplomatic offensive again. It is reported that Security Council Chairman Guo Taiqi has requested that Molomi Ko's letter be translated immediately.

[United Press, New York, 7th] Poland proposed that the Spanish issue be raised for discussion by the United Nations Security Council this week. According to reliable sources today, the United States and Britain are prepared to oppose this proposal. The United States and Britain claimed that Poland accused the Franco government of endangering world peace. Unless it can submit an unexpected emergency report, each government will respond to Poland in the same way as it responded to France last time.

### Beauties Need Not Panic: When Testing Atomic Bombs, the Explosion is Limited to a Local Area; Experts Issue Statement Again

[United Press, Washington, 7th] American atomic experts Drs. Taylor and Bethe, serving as consultants for the Pacific atomic bomb tests, declared today to dispel the growing panic in the American psyche: During atomic bomb tests, the explosion is completely limited to a local area. It will neither destroy the world nor evaporate the oceans. This type of explosion will absolutely not cause the seawater to undergo progressive decomposition, thereby causing an atomic explosion of the earth. When an atomic bomb explodes underwater, the temperature of the surrounding seawater is not very high, around one million degrees, while the center of a star reaches two million degrees. Such stars contain elements similar to those in seawater, but without a high-speed chain reaction, they do not explode or self-consume.

Editorial

### Refuting the Specious Argument for a Coalition Government

Chongqing United Press, 7th. General Zhou Enlai warned today that if it is necessary to undertake the work of establishing democracy and rebuilding the country, China's coalition government should exercise its power within six months. In an hour-long meeting with United Press Far East Manager Vaughn, United Press reporter Ravenholt, and Los Angeles Times reporter Treick, Zhou outlined what he considers the most important prerequisites for the recovery of coastal cities and the prosperity within the liberated areas. He insisted that only a united government can overcome "the most serious crisis facing the country today, namely the urgent need for economic stability in China." Zhou Enlai and other CCP figures have consistently emphasized the necessity of a so-called coalition government before foreign journalists, but the so-called coalition government needs to be explained. Using terms without a clear definition not only easily leads to confusion but also invites discrepancy between name and reality.

Abroad, the term coalition government refers to a situation where the original government is overthrown, and no single party has a majority in parliament to independently form a government. It is necessary to unite with other parties with somewhat similar political views to jointly take responsibility and form a government, hence the name coalition government. Another scenario is when a country has just undergone a revolution, and the strengths of various parties are evenly matched, with no single party having the power to independently form a government. It is necessary to join hands with other parties with similar political views to form a so-called coalition government. Therefore, the main premise for the organization of a so-called coalition government is the overthrow of the original regime and its replacement with a new regime. Moreover, this new regime is formed by various parties with largely similar political views that are responsible to the parliament. This is the general form of a so-called coalition government. Furthermore, this form of government is indeed not the norm for democratic constitutionalism.

Since the National Government convened the Political Consultative Conference, it has hoped, under the principle of maintaining domestic peace, that all parties and factions can jointly participate in the central institutions of actual politics, thereby giving the National Government a broader foundation. This is fundamentally different from what is generally referred to as a coalition government in other countries. Because the main aim of the Political Consultative Conference's agreement is to strengthen the National Government, not to weaken or overthrow it. This is very simple. First, the Chinese Kuomintang has been dedicated to the national liberation movement for nearly fifty years. Based on the progress of the revolution, there are three stages: military administration, tutelage, and constitutionalism. Before the War of Resistance, there was an original intention to implement constitutionalism, but it was later suspended due to the war. However, now that the War of Resistance has been won, the government is sticking to its original intention and preparing to implement constitutionalism. Moreover, before the National Assembly has exercised its powers and our country has not yet formally entered the constitutional stage, in order to concentrate national will and increase national strength, it is inviting all parties and factions to participate in the government and jointly assume the responsibility of actual politics, based on the current legal system. Therefore, the participation of various parties and factions in the government at the current stage, before the constitutional era has formally arrived, is still based on the laws of the tutelage period. This is still a government centered on the Kuomintang, but for the sake of objective facts, necessary reorganization and expansion are being carried out based on the existing scale. This fundamentally cannot be called a coalition government. Second, a coalition government takes the overthrow of the original regime as a prerequisite and must be responsible to the people or the people's representative body. Currently, the one responsible to the people should clearly still be the National Government, which is given power by the Provisional Constitution formulated by the National Convention twenty years ago. Therefore, the participation of various parties and factions in the government under the current circumstances is not to overthrow the current regime but to enrich the current regime. This is fundamentally not a form of coalition government. If Zhou Enlai and other CCP figures are still knowingly ignoring this and repeatedly emphasize the organization of a coalition government, whether their intention is to overthrow the current regime and replace it with a new so-called coalition regime, we do not need to speculate. But we want to declare: China does not need the organization of a so-called coalition government. According to the policy of the Chinese Kuomintang and Chairman Chiang's proclamation, we can only allow necessary enrichment of the government under the existing system. And apart from the constitution to be formulated by the future National Assembly, no one person or organization can have the power to cancel or amend the Provisional Constitution, nor can any one person or organization overthrow the legitimate National Government before the future democratically elected government!

We must remember that the Chinese Kuomintang seized power with revolutionary force, and returning power to the people is the ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's rule. When the National Assembly is convened to formulate a constitution, and when the people's power is exercised based on this constitution, that will be the beginning of constitutional governance. Before that, including the current stage, it is still the tutelage period. At this time, first inviting all parties and factions to jointly participate in the government is precisely a manifestation of the Kuomintang's long-held aspiration of "the world belongs to all." As yesterday's editorial in this newspaper said: "Originally, a country's military and political orders should be absolutely unified. Within a country, allowing parties to have armies, and even further recognizing the Communist army as a unit, and carrying out mediation between the Communist army and the government army, from the standpoint of strict military discipline, is already a ridiculous joke." Similarly, constitutional governance has not yet formally begun, a formal representative body of the people has not yet been established, and it is not yet known whether the people want to elect another party other than the Kuomintang to govern. At this juncture, the National Government first automatically invites all parties and factions to participate in the government. From the standpoint of a serious national revolution, this is also already a ridiculous joke. However, the Chinese Kuomintang sticks to its long-held aspiration of "the world belongs to all," and in order to allow the people to recuperate and recover after the war, there was the convening of the "Political Consultative Conference" and the invitation for all parties and factions to participate in the government. However, some people regard this as the organization of a coalition government, attempting to deceive people without any political common sense.

In short, China, after a long period of war, certainly needs a stable order so that the people have an opportunity to recuperate and recover. Moreover, the international situation does not allow us to have political disputes that would cause political instability in our country. The Chinese Kuomintang, as the ruling party at present, is deeply aware of this domestic and international situation and sincerely hopes that all parties and factions, for the sake of national interests, will work together to participate in actual politics. The term coalition government, which undermines the existing legal system, is close to provocation and is not what the Chinese people, who are yearning for good governance, expect. We hope that all parties and factions will put national interests first, so that the people will see more heartfelt cooperation and fewer eccentric and provocative arguments!

### Eleventh Council Unanimously Passes Motion to Protect Personal Freedom; Requests City Government to Instruct Military and Police Agencies to Comply; Advocates Inviting Representatives from Central Agencies to Attend and Report

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Provisional Council held its eleventh general assembly and memorial week at 9:15 a.m. yesterday. Thirty-three councilors were present. Secretary-General Xiang Changquan reported that the telegram from the council to Chairman Chiang had been replied by the Office of the Civil Secretary of the National Government. Councillors Yu Zhijing, Yan Yu, and Xu Guomao, who recently reported, were included in the Second Review Committee.

General Assembly Passes Motion to Build Martyrs' Shrine

The general assembly began with Xu Shihao reporting on the investigation of whether the materials from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration were fully used to relieve the people. According to Liu Hongsheng's response, they were indeed used to relieve the people and were not allocated for office expenses. Subsequently, Speaker Jing sought the opinions of the general assembly on the proposals reviewed by the First Committee. A total of three proposals were passed: (1) Request the municipal government to build a Martyrs' Shrine to those who died in the War of Resistance, establish a memorial tower to the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, and establish a public cemetery for the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance; (2) Request the central government to increase the number of worker representatives in the local representation quota; (3) Request the Health Bureau to establish a health research and guidance institution to study issues and methods related to national health, guide implementation, and earnestly promote it in schools and factories to improve national health, strive for production, and complete construction. The municipal government is requested to adopt the principles, deliberate on methods, and earnestly implement them. Shen Chunhui explained the above proposals in detail. In addition, Zhou Xuexiang, the reviewer of the work report of the Labor and Police Bureau, reported on the review process. The Secretary-General read the original report, and the councilors proposed that the review results be submitted to the general assembly for a decision, rather than a discussion.

Emergency Motion: Protecting Personal Freedom. Vice Speaker Wu reported that more than two-thirds of the councilors had signed an emergency motion to the general assembly on the issue of legally protecting the people's personal freedom. The municipal government is requested to inform the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, and other relevant agencies to strictly abide by the following legal procedures: (1) The detention or arrest of people shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 77, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Except for cases of flagrant offense, an arrest warrant must first be issued by the prosecutor or the judge; (2) The criminal suspect who is arrested or detained must, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period, be transferred to the judicial organ within 24 hours; (3) When transferring a criminal suspect, it must be done actually and not just by transferring the case while continuing to detain the suspect. The councillors unanimously approved the proposal. However, there were different opinions on the procedures. Wang Genzhong proposed that this case should be established separately. Pan Xulun argued that in order to strengthen the resolution, a fourth point should be added: If the enforcing agency violates the above measures, it shall be severely punished. Xu Shihao expressed that there are already rules in the law for cases where stipulated articles are not legally enforced, so there is no need to add another item. Finally, Shen Chunhui proposed that this case be handed over to the Freedom Protection Association, which will be organized by the Lawyers Association, for handling.

Dispatching Representatives to Report Sparks Heated Debate

The issue of inviting representatives from relevant central agencies to attend and report sparked a heated debate among the councilors. Lü Entan asked why the request made by the last general assembly for relevant central agencies to attend, report, and answer inquiries had not been answered to this day. Speaker Xu immediately reported that a report from the Enemy Property Management Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs had been received. If other agencies do not respond, it would seem disrespectful to the council. It was decided to ask the municipal government to notify them. Zhao Banfu immediately stood up and said: Losing face is a small matter. What does it matter if the council loses face? If we feel that we do not have the formal authority to ask them to report, then we can ask them to give us guidance. Zhan Wenhuan expressed that the Provisional Council is about to end. After spending so much money, time, and energy, have we solved the most serious problems facing us, such as prices, housing, and post-war relief supplies? Are we worthy of the citizens? He wanted everyone to reflect on this. As for directly asking the central government to send representatives to report, he fundamentally disagreed. We should use tactics, ask the Mayor and the heads of various bureaus to attend and report. If they cannot handle it, then we should ask the central authorities to attend and discuss. He proposed that time be set aside for two general assemblies for reporting. Ju Xuefan expressed his agreement and requested that relevant central agencies attend and report, especially paying attention to issues such as housing history, warehouses, supplies, and prices. In the end, Traditional first made a conclusion: "Everyone does not need to discuss, we must ask the central government to send representatives to report." Vice Speaker Xi proposed that the persons in charge of the municipal government report on Wednesday morning. Wang Genzhong asked how other units would attend if they had not received the report from the Property Bureau. Fan Cai said that the Food Department, the Fuel Committee, and the China Textile Construction Company should not be omitted. In the end, the Speaker reported that some of the other units had cancelled the report, and the Japanese Resident Management Committee had its own supervisor, so it was not a consultant. The Speaker asked: "Now we are voting, do we want to attend and report or not?" Everyone raised their hands. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. The fourth group review meeting was held in the afternoon.

All Members to Hold Picnic Today at Noon

The agenda of the general assembly has been slightly changed. This morning is the twelfth general assembly, this afternoon is the fifth group review meeting, and tomorrow morning is the thirteenth general assembly, where the municipal government will request that representatives of specially dispatched central agencies report. In the afternoon is the fourteenth general assembly to discuss the declaration and hold the adjournment ceremony. At noon today, all the councillors will hold a picnic at the Shanghai Branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League on Jin Shenfu Road. Newspaper reporters have also been invited to attend.

Cao Yaoting (1) Cao Yaoting, 47 years old, a local, served as a clerk in the Nanshi District Court and a recorder in the Second Special District Court before the war. He joined the puppet regime immediately after the war broke out, served as a liaison officer in "76," coerced judicial personnel to betray the motherland, and appointed himself as a puppet prosecutor. After the victory, he was prosecuted by the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office according to law. The case has been tried several times. He was interrogated again yesterday. The defendant denied everything except claiming that he was forced to become a puppet prosecutor, insisting that he was falsely accused and inviting Guo Xiaoxian and Chen Yiming to testify.

Xu Jichuan and Xu Yuanlai (2) Xu Jichuan, 47 years old, and Xu Yuanlai, 43 years old, from Hai'ning, Zhejiang, are brothers. During a recent household registration check in the city, the police station found that Xu Jichuan had served as a counselor in the Puppet National Government's Civil Affairs Office, and Xu Yuanlai had served as a secretary in the Puppet Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Bureau. The Higher Court Prosecutor's Office investigated and believed that they had violated the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and initiated public prosecution. Yesterday, the defendants claimed in court that during the 32nd year of the puppet regime, a self-defense force was organized in Shanghai, and they had to take turns on guard duty. At that time, there were rumors of conscription. In order to avoid service, their father forged names and falsely reported to cover them up. In reality, one was an antique appraiser, and the other worked at the Bank of Communications. They had never participated in puppet positions at all and requested the court to investigate, they said. They also hired lawyers such as Qin Shouzhang to defend them. The court ordered that the above two cases would be investigated further and adjourned for another hearing. The defendants were remanded.

The collegial panel continued to hear two cases in the afternoon:

Zhou Chunyu (1) Zhou Chunyu, 43 years old, from Ningbo, was once invited by Yuan Gude to serve as the Secretary-General of the Puppet Rice and Grain Control Council. Later, in November of the 33rd year of the puppet regime, he was accused of dereliction of duty and sentenced to five years in prison, which he is currently serving. After the victory, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office re-interrogated him and believed that he had violated the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors and initiated public prosecution. The defendant confessed that he had held a puppet position but claimed that he had tried his best to promote the distribution of household rice. Later, he was arrested and sentenced because of a conflict of opinion with the Japanese, he said. The prosecutor indicted him for colluding with the enemy country and collecting military rations on their behalf. The defendant hired lawyer Huang Nengren to respond.

Huang Junjie (2) Huang Junjie, 29 years old, from Nanhui, served as a member of the reconnaissance team of the Puppet Shanghai Security Command in August of the 32nd year of the puppet regime. On February 2, of the 34th year of the puppet regime, he arrested underground anti-Japanese workers Yang Zhizhong, Yang Yuguang, Jiang Shoulai, and others at the Xingzhou Hotel No. 2 and sent them to the headquarters for sentencing. After being reported by the victims, the Higher Court Prosecutor's Office completed the investigation and initiated public prosecution. However, the defendant firmly denied that he had held a puppet position and arrested Yang Zhizhong and others. He also hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to defend him.

The debate in the above two cases has concluded, and the court announced that the sentencing will take place at 2:00 PM on the 15th.

### Sealing Up Former Japanese Residences - Handled in 15 Groups - New Regulations for Handling These Vacant Houses to Be Promulgated

In order to handle the vacant houses left behind by former Japanese residents, the municipal military and political authorities have organized a joint agency composed of the municipal government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Third Front Army, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau to jointly investigate and handle the matter. It is estimated that there are more than 8,000 houses in the former Japanese concentration area. Since the 5th of this month, they have been temporarily sealed off after the Japanese residents returned to prevent disputes. The personnel responsible for the investigation and sealing are all dispatched by the relevant agencies and are divided into 15 groups to carry out the sealing work separately. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, these 15 groups of workers held a work review meeting at the Prisoner of War Management Office. More than 40 people, including Chief Wang Gongxia of the Garrison Headquarters, attended, and Zou Renzhi, Deputy Director of the Prisoner of War Management Office, was elected as chairman. First, each group reported on the investigation and sealing situation, and then the difficulties of the work were discussed. It is understood that all of the more than 8,000 vacant houses left by Japanese residents in the city need to be investigated. Once the new regulations for handling these vacant houses are promulgated, they will be handled in accordance with the new regulations. In the past, in the former Japanese concentration area, many unscrupulous people illegally occupied the houses because the Japanese residents had moved away. In order to provide accommodation for public educators who came to Shanghai from the Great Rear Area and to protect the rights and interests of the owners, the authorities decided to jointly manage the remaining vacant houses of the Japanese.

### Mobile Homes - Approximately 2,000 Units - To Be Shipped to Shanghai

In order to alleviate the housing panic, the government authorities have ordered 10,000 mobile homes from the United States and Canada, which will arrive here in the near future. 8,000 of them are planned to be used in Nanjing to provide housing for government employees. 2,000 units are for Shanghai.

### Two Fires

[Report from this newspaper] A fire broke out at 10:11 AM yesterday morning at the Air Force No. 23 oil and bomb warehouse on Qimei Road in Pudong. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade after two hours of rescue, and two bungalows were burned down.

Also, at about 1:12 AM this morning, the Yuanfeng cigarette and paper shop at No. 118, Lane, Guangxi Road, caught fire due to carelessness, spreading to cotton quilts, mattresses, furniture, and other items. The Central Fire Department dispatched vehicles to rescue the fire and extinguished it at 2:30 AM. The loss was said to be minor.

### Worth Over Ten Million Yuan - 80 Boxes of Pigments Stolen from Warehouse Late at Night - Shipped Away by Boat, Police Intervene, Thugs Escape, Stolen Goods Recovered

[Report from this newspaper] At 2:40 AM yesterday morning, more than 30 thugs wearing military uniforms and plain clothes suddenly entered a warehouse at No. 944, North Suzhou Road, which was managed by the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau. They tied up several petitioners and workers with ropes, covered their heads with quilts, and forbade them from making any noise. They carried 80 boxes of pigments worth over ten million yuan out on their shoulders. At that time, a patrol leader of the security team came forward to investigate but was brutally beaten. The thugs secretly transported the goods to the Suzhou River in the south, loaded them onto a boat, and sailed west. At that time, two patrolling police officers from the North Station Branch Bureau spotted them. One police officer urgently reported to the branch bureau by telephone, while the other police officer blew his whistle and chased after them. When they reached the west side of the Central Market near the New Garbage Bridge on Xizang Road, the police officer reported to the Zhabei Branch Police Station stationed nearby and joined forces to arrest them. At the same time, Lu Bihou, director of the North Station Branch Bureau, and Li Jiachu, chief of the criminal section, led a number of armed police officers in a police car to the scene. Because it was late at night and extremely dark, the thugs on the boat finally escaped to the shore. All the stolen goods, along with three boatmen and a boat, were seized, and the boatmen were taken back to the branch bureau for investigation. When the incident occurred, a petitioner's firearm in the warehouse was robbed but was later found in the house.

### Election of Representatives in the 36th Bao of the 11th District - Opposition Arises - Illegal Meeting Resembles a Farce

The 36th Bao of the 11th District of the city held a bao people's congress at Jingde Elementary School on Da Tong Road on the afternoon of the 6th to elect district people's representatives. The bao office stipulated in the notice that the meeting would start at 2:30 PM but was delayed until 2:40 PM before it began. It only lasted for five minutes, and the election was completed. The ballot count showed a total of more than 350 votes. At that time, the citizens present questioned that today only took five minutes to hastily complete the ten items on the agenda, which shows that this election was purely a package deal and raised questions: (1) This bao has a total of 28 jia, each jia should have at least 20 households, which should have 560 households. If each household has one person, there should be 560 people. Calculating the majority attendance, there should be more than 280 people. Only 227 people attended today, which is obviously less than the legal number of people, so the meeting cannot be held according to law. (2) The number of election tickets received exceeds 50% of the number of people present. There are also many underage children, who of course have no election qualifications. (3) There was only one ballot box at the time of voting, so why are there two ballot boxes at the time of counting? Neither of them had been checked and sealed by the election supervisors in advance. (4) The election supervisors Wang Nancong and Chen Yangzhou, sent by the district office, did not check the number of attendees before distributing the election tickets, and they did not check the number of tickets received during the counting. There was also a lack of compliance in the procedure. And the election supervisor Wang Nancong actually replied that the 36th bao were all ignorant and uneducated, and turned his head and left without looking back. The meeting was held in the open air that day, and the chairman did not arrive. An "unknown person" served as a representative, sitting high on the steps. The citizens present said that it was no less than staging an open-air farce. Because the election of district people's representatives is important, it was actually held in the form of a changing-empty-box drama. The result of this election cannot be effective according to law, and so on.

### Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company - Holds Board of Directors Meeting

The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously took over textile factories, including cotton, wool, linen, silk, spinning, and textile machinery repair factories, all of which have been transferred to the China National Textile Corporation for management. Then, when President Song came to Shanghai last time, he ordered that part of the textile machinery repair factories be handed over and changed to the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company. State-owned factories use their own factory real estate as shareholders, and private yarn factories share the share amount based on the existing number of spindles in each factory, with each spindle valued at 10,000 yuan in national currency. Currently, the state-owned part accounts for 300 million yuan, and the private part also accounts for 300 million yuan. Peng Xuepei has been elected as the chairman of the company, and Huang Boqiao has been elected as the general manager. China National Textile Corporation has successively transferred the Far East Steel Wire Cloth Factory, the Japanese Machinery Manufacturing Factory, the East Asia Iron Factory, the Youxin Iron Factory, and the Toyota Automobile Factory to the company. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a board of directors meeting was held in the China Bank Building.

### Killing of American Pilots Case - Sawada Shigeru Blames Tokyo

Today Will Be the Final Court Session

Today will be the last day of the trial of the killing of pilots belonging to General Doolittle, which has lasted for four weeks. Yesterday, Lieutenant General Sawada Shigeru, commander of the 13th Army, Captain Wakou Isamu, judge of the Shanghai Jiangwan Court, and prosecutor Okada Ryuhei, defendant defense lawyer Tatsuta Gaitsujiro, and others were questioned again in court. Sawada Shigeru was questioned for as long as four hours. According to the 59-year-old commander of the 12th Army, he had served in the military for 40 years and had been sent to Turkey, Poland, Brazil, and other countries as a military attache. He had also traveled to England, the United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries twice. From 1941 to 1945, he was sent to Shanghai to command the 13th Army. He has a wife and two children, all in Japan. Sawada Shigeru blamed the Tokyo government for the killing of the Doolittle pilots, saying that he had no right to execute them because Tokyo had an instruction that this case was serious and everything had to be instructed by the Tokyo government. But he admitted to signing the judgment. Wakou Isamu, a judge of the Japanese military court, was also questioned. When Prosecutor Okada Ryuhei was questioned, he admitted that he had opened the trial without meeting with the criminals and that he only knew the bottom line of the three pilots from their confessions. The plaintiffs' defense lawyers believed that they did not investigate the case clearly and pronounced the sentence, which was illegal. Finally, Tatsuta Gaitsujiro was called to the stand. This person's hair was already mottled and he had a short beard. When questioned, he changed his answers repeatedly. At 5:00 PM, the presiding judge announced that the trial would continue today.

### China National Textile Corporation Staff - Suspends Group "Leave" - Salaries Paid as Usual, Cost of Living Index Issued

The employees of the factories affiliated to the State-owned China Textile Corporation believe that their treatment is still meager compared to that of private yarn factories. A request was made some time ago: (1) Increase basic salary, (2) Provide subsidies according to the municipal government's cost of living index, otherwise, a group "leave" would be taken this morning.束雲章, general manager of the company, specially summoned the persons in charge of each factory yesterday morning to have a heartfelt conversation, encouraging them to recognize the overall situation and work hard to increase production. After the representatives of each factory explained to their respective employees, the result was that the proposed measure was cancelled and no disturbances occurred. According to China Textile Corporation, the salaries and allowances of its employees will be paid in accordance with the cost-of-living index of the municipal government, with a maximum of 300,000 yuan, from February onwards, as decided by the board of directors, fearing that the superior treatment of private yarn factories would affect production.

### Central Printing Plant Received the Press Yesterday

Explanation of the Labor Dispute

[Report from this newspaper] In order to clarify the settlement of the labor dispute in the factory to all sectors of society, the Central Printing Plant held a reception for the press in the city at the Kang Le Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday. About 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Gao Jie, the director of the factory, gave a report, stating: The factory is a state-owned currency printing institution. After the victory, it was ordered to come to Shanghai to take over the former puppet Central Reserve Printing Office and has been printing banknotes for half a year. The factory knows that production efficiency must be coordinated with workers' treatment. Therefore, in the past six months, workers' treatment has been adjusted monthly. Recently, rules for technical hygiene rewards and punishments have been promulgated. If workers can work hard to follow them, male apprentices can earn more than 60,000 yuan per month, second-level technicians can earn more than 80,000 yuan, first-level technicians can earn more than 100,000 yuan, and senior technicians can earn more than 120,000 yuan. If they work overtime for three hours a day, they can earn 50% more. This standard is higher than that of general counterparts, but the workers are still dissatisfied and suddenly went on strike on March 25 without any reason, without sending representatives or submitting a written report in advance. Although the factory repeatedly posted notices to resume work, and the Social Bureau sent people to mediate, all efforts were ineffective, resulting in the suspension of work in the factory for four days. After the factory investigated, it was found that the strike was obviously manipulated by a small number of people. Therefore, on March 30, a notice was issued, strictly ordering all workers to resume work immediately, otherwise, they would be fired. At the same time, the list of about 125 people who were the minority was found and announced to be fired. Most of the workers came to the factory to resume work after hearing the news that day. By April 1, all of them had resumed work. The bottom salary and the reinstatement of the fired workers are decided by the Social Bureau's arbitration method, and will be followed accordingly. Finally, he explained that the factory is a state-run organization and there is no situation where the capitalists exploit the workers. He hoped that all employees of the factory would be able to overcome difficulties together to achieve success.

### Vice Minister of Finance Lu Peizhang Passed Away Yesterday

Lu Peizhang, Vice Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai last month to treat his long-standing stomach cancer. He was admitted to the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on the 27th of last month for surgery, which went well.

### Relief Food Arrives in Large Quantities - Distribution Methods Still Under Discussion

The food supply to the city has been abundant in the past week, especially the relief supplies transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), of which food accounts for almost two-thirds. Ships that have arrived in Shanghai in recent days and have begun unloading include the Jefferson, with 6,367 tons of wheat, the Sammon, with 5,243 tons of wheat flour and rice, the Urton, with 3,135 tons of wheat and milk, and the New Zealand, with 3,170 tons of wheat flour.

### All Reserved Seating - Cinemas in Great Difficulty

[Report from this newspaper] According to an employee of the city's Cinema Business Association, if the municipal police department's measures for managing cinemas are fully implemented, the city's cinemas will be forced to close. In particular, the police department recently stipulated that all 15 first and second-run cinemas must implement all reserved seating starting on the 19th of this month. This makes it even more difficult for cinemas to cope. The seating in the main halls of the cinemas has never been reserved. Now, it is necessary to print reserved seating tickets separately, which is not only costly in terms of printing but also results in wasted tickets if they are not sold, which only increases intangible losses. In addition, the cinemas must hire a large number of ushers, which puts a heavier burden on salaries. And most of the audience will hold reserved tickets, so they will rush to the theater only when the movie starts, which will affect the order of the cinema. The industry has suffered a sharp decline in business since the authorities levied a 50% entertainment tax. Although the highest ticket price has been doubled to 1,080 yuan, it is only 540 times the pre-war highest ticket price of two yuan, while the expenditure of various expenses in the cinema business has been 2,000 to 3,000 times that of the pre-war period, so it is difficult to maintain. Sometimes, it is necessary to show four movies a day to make up for the losses. However, the police department's regulations only allow four shows on Sundays or holidays and limit the number of shows to three on other days, which will have a greater impact on the operating income of the cinemas.

### Robbery in Menghua Street, Nanjing

### Yarn Prices Plummet; Textile Construction Increases Auction Frequency

Yesterday, New York's American cotton futures rose by 16 to 27 points. Spot prices were calculated at American dollars 28.19 for near-term, 28.51 for far-term, and Meitling spot at 28.79. Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was average. Affected by the sharp drop in yarn prices, the market was also soft, down 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Textile Construction Corporation and most private yarn factories took no action. Only Chongming Fuan Yarn Factory had a slight appetite for American Pengjiapo cotton.

### Siamese Teak Shipped

The timber market is sluggish. It is reported that Siamese merchants have shipped teak, totaling over 40,000 feet, and the asking price is quite low, which may affect the market prices of teak and Lauan in Shanghai.

### Large Batch of Hardware Imports, Totaling Over 5,000 Tons

The British ship Samson, managed by the shipping manager of Tiansiang Foreign Company, arrived from New York yesterday at Wusongkou. It is expected to enter the port today and dock at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. The ship carries a large amount of hardware of various sizes from the United States, totaling 5,000 tons, all of which is general cargo.

### Coal and Firewood Prices Continue to Fall

The coal market continued its previous decline, showing a weak trend, with sellers following one another. The number of buyers was minimal, and the price cutting was severe, leading to a general decline in market prices. Firewood from all routes arrived in large quantities. Due to the continuous decline in market prices, traders were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach. Due to financial constraints, customers preferred to sell at reduced prices, which further depressed prices.

Coal Briquette Factories Resume Production

According to coal briquette industry sources yesterday, major mechanized coal briquette factories in Shanghai, such as Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, Lingfang, Jinghua, and Xinfu, have recently installed machinery and obtained sufficient coal dust and electricity for briquette production. They have gradually resumed production, significantly increasing the output of coal briquettes. It is said that these factories have obtained raw materials at relatively low prices, which has lowered production costs. Those who use hand-operated machines to make briquettes are unable to compete and are seeking alternative solutions, such as expanding their operations or ceasing production.

### Confiscated Yarn and Cloth Case: Processing Bureau Refuses Return; Victims to File Administrative Appeal According to Law; Resolutions of the People's Political Council in Five Points

The various guilds, such as Shanghai's dyeing and weaving factories, cotton cloth dealers, and yarn dealers, have repeatedly published reports requesting the return of the remaining yarn and cloth forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes. It is now learned that the guilds previously held a hearing at the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Conference, which ruled that the yarn and cloth had already been moved and sold, making it impossible to verify and liquidate, and dismissed the request. Later, based on legal principles and facts, the guilds submitted a petition for reconsideration to the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau, which issued a response with Shanghai Sanzi No. 18913, stating, "The puppet regime purchased the yarn and cloth in August and September of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943]. At that time, the method of paying for the purchase was extremely generous, and a deposit was paid. Unless merchants intentionally hoarded yarn and cloth, there was no loss. Based on legal principles, the purchase of yarn and cloth had contracts and warehouse receipts, which were also delivered, and the sales process was completed. Therefore, there is no basis for returning it." According to the persons in charge of the three guilds, the members of the guilds believe that the handling by the Enemy Property Processing Bureau damages the rights of the people. They have issued letters of authorization, entrusting the persons in charge of the guilds to file an administrative appeal according to law, and are currently engaging lawyers to prepare for the process. They also stated that the guilds previously appealed to the People's Political Council to request a lawful handling and return of the yarn and cloth confiscated by the enemy and puppet regimes. The People's Political Council resolved, "This case is approved and handed over to the government for investigation and proper handling." The five resolution measures of the People's Political Council are extracted below: (1) Victims whose yarn and cloth were forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet regimes and who have not received the purchase price shall be returned the yarn and cloth based on the quantity purchased and supporting documents. (2) Victims who have received a portion of the purchase price for the yarn and cloth purchased shall be returned a portion of the yarn and cloth based on the portion of the price not received, based on supporting documents. (3) If the remaining yarn and cloth is insufficient to cover the portion of the price not received by the victim, the remaining yarn and cloth shall be issued to the victim first based on supporting documents. The government shall compile the cases for the insufficient amount and seek compensation from Japan. (4) If the yarn and cloth forcibly purchased from victims after the government's takeover and for which the price was not received has already been sold by the government for public purposes, the amount received at the time of the sale shall be issued to the victim based on supporting documents to offset the loss. (5) If the yarn and cloth for which the purchase price was not received by the victim still exists and the government deems it necessary to retain it for use, the Enemy Property Processing Bureau shall, in conjunction with the local chamber of commerce and the relevant trade association, assess the price and purchase it.

Permanent Campus Site Designated by Ministry Order as Jinhua

[Our Correspondent, Yongjia] Since moving to Wenzhou, the student self-governance association of National Yingshih University has published the Yingshih Review newspaper, and the school authorities have dissuaded them from interfering in school administration through their remarks. Students believe that the school is implementing high-pressure tactics, so they incited unrest. Principal Du resigned to the Ministry of Education because of the thorny handling, but it was not approved.

### A Few Opinions on Higher Education in the Future

— Dong Qijun

Education and culture are the lifeblood of a nation, and higher education in particular is sufficient to determine a nation's future. During the war, higher education suffered from many pathologies, which is undeniable. Now that various schools are about to reopen and construction is about to begin, I would like to offer some humble opinions on the future of higher education for the consideration of the authorities and for discussion with the social elite:

(1) The Issue of Relocation: During the war, most universities and specialized schools moved inland. After the victory, cultural restoration will naturally take place. Although the central government has a clear plan regarding the issue of relocation, the various schools have not only created a rift with the central government, but also caused internal disputes and disagreements. I believe that the issue of school relocation is of great importance to the future of a nation's culture, and the government must have a comprehensive and rational plan to implement it.

Before the war, most institutions of higher learning were concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, while during the war they were mostly concentrated in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and their vicinity. We cannot endorse either of these distorted phenomena before or during the war. I believe that schools should not be concentrated in a distorted way, but should be developed universally. We have made the mistake of uneven distribution before and during the war, and we must not repeat it after the war. Now we should set up a university or specialized school in every city with a population of more than 400,000, based on population ratios; every provincial capital should have a university and a normal college; and cities in remote provinces with a population of more than 200,000, although less than 400,000, also need to set up universities and specialized schools in order to promote culture due to their low cultural standards. This is not only "tailoring measures to suit the people" but also "tailoring measures to suit the land." For example, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, as famous commercial ports in the country, need to establish commercial universities in addition to ordinary universities. Other examples include the Northeast, which is rich in mineral resources, should set up mining and metallurgical schools; the Taihu Lake basin should set up sericulture schools; the Northwest should set up agricultural schools; and the coastal areas of Zhejiang should set up fisheries schools. These are all necessary measures tailored to local conditions.

After the war, various schools are seeking to reopen, while the education authorities are seeking the universal development of education and culture. Under a reasonable and comprehensive plan that has already been decided, they should resist all opinions and keep some of the universities and specialized schools in the rear. (To be continued)

### Two or Three Things About the Frontier of Kang and Tibet

— Kangding Correspondence, March 28th, Deng Zhongjian

Like a riddle, the frontier region finally had its mysterious veil lifted for us during the War of Resistance. Now, the reporter will try to describe the once mysterious Kang-Tibetan border region to give the readers of this newspaper a taste.

Deng Tong Starved to Death, Zhuge Liang Made Arrows

During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, there was a diviner who was good at physiognomy. Emperor Wen ordered him to examine his favored courtier Deng Tong. The diviner said that he would surely starve to death. The Emperor thought, "How can I let my favored courtier starve to death?" So he deliberately enfeoffed him with the copper mountain in Sichuan, meaning that his money would never be exhausted. Once, the Emperor suffered from sores, and Deng Tong licked them with his tongue, and he was healed. At that time, Prince Jing was still the Crown Prince, and Emperor Wen sighed and said, "Even a prince, is not as good as a subject." This aroused the jealousy of Prince Jing. When he ascended the throne, he put Deng Tong in prison, and he eventually starved to death, as the diviner had said. It is said that Rongjing County in present-day Xikang Province is where the copper mountain was located, and Kangding, an important town in present-day Sichuan and Xikang, is where Zhuge Wuhou ordered the general Zheng Ying to build a furnace to make arrows during his southern expedition. Therefore, it is also called Dajianlu (literally "arrow forging furnace").

Faces Covered in Black, Resembling Monsters

Most people traveling to Kang and Tibet pass through Kangding, through Ganzi, Changdu, and arrive in Lhasa. Many of the people you encounter on the road cover their eyes with gauze or smear their faces with black oil, making you confused, like seeing ghosts in broad daylight. But please don't be afraid, this is just their protective measure against nature. Because the terrain in Kang and Tibet is too high, the mountains are all over 10,000 feet above sea level, and snow accumulates all year round, while the valleys between the mountains evaporate quickly and become semi-dry valleys covered with a thin layer of white salt or soda. If you don't wear a piece of gauze when you go out, you will feel that the sunlight reflected from all directions is very dazzling, and you may even suffer from color blindness. During the windy season in Kang and Tibet, the wind blows wildly, and the skin cracks. Folk songs say, "In the first, second, and third months, the snow seals the mountains; in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the mud covers the feet; the seventh, eighth, and ninth months are good for walking; in October, the skin cracks." So when you go out, you smear a layer of black grease on your face to avoid skin cracking.

Calling People to School, Like Conscripting Soldiers

Surprisingly, many public elementary schools can be found in the remote villages in the eastern part of Kang Province. Some are located in temples, but although there are many schools, there are very few students. Each school has only a dozen students, and many of them are bald-headed monks. All students are on public funds, but parents are still reluctant to send their children to school. The government has no choice but to order the distribution of ten people per pao (a kind of administrative division). Therefore, there is a name of "school official," and some are willing to pay someone to take their place. This is because the land is barren and the population is sparse, and even children have to participate in production. Also, the textbooks are too far from their living standards.

Lama World, Heavenly Buddhist Kingdom

In Kang and Tibet, an average of three or more people per family become monks, which shows how many lamas there are. They are divided into four major sects: Yellow, White, Red, and Black, all of which are respected. Some even take pride in drinking their urine, and others use their feces as medicine. Because there are so many lamas, there are naturally many temples. There are more than 40 temples between Yushu and Kangding alone. Each temple has hundreds of people at least and one or two thousand people at most. The temples are spacious and grand, with amazing capacity. There are also magical legends and sacred sites. The three major temples near Lhasa are the Zhebung Monastery, with 120 large pillars in one hall, which is spectacular. The monastery houses 9,000 lamas. The Taizhao Temple was built when Princess Wencheng married, and contains a statue of Sakyamuni Buddha from India. It is said that half of this Buddha statue is man-made and half is natural. This hall can accommodate 3,300 people. The Sera Monastery has 5,500 monks. Lamas are the masters of political and economic power, and their power is very great. In addition, in remote and desolate places, there are evil cultists who kill people. They believe that killing people who have not reached the end of their lives can代享其未来之福 (a Buddhist idea about reaping the benefits of the dead's good karma).

In Kang and Tibet, even a mountain, a cave, a river pool, and a lake are full of magical legends. The famous high mountain in southern Tibet, Mount Pibi La, although there are wild people, is considered to be the most supreme密宗法輪 (esoteric Buddhist Dharma wheel) . Therefore, going around the mountain once can bring thirteen billion功德 (merit) for the six-character mantra, and going around the mountainside once can bring thirty billion merit for the six-character mantra. Therefore, tourists are endless. In addition, the sacred shrines and the聖母海 (holy mother sea) in southern Tibet are said to be able to reflect all wishes and the results of one's life, like a karma mirror in the underworld. It is said that the Thirteenth Dalai Lama was found after being reflected from this sea. In short, such myths are readily available, making the entire Kang and Tibet no less than a heavenly Buddhist kingdom.

One Wife, Many Husbands, Matriarchal Society

In our China, polygamy is commonplace, but polyandry is probably only seen in Kang and Tibet. So-called polyandry means that, for example, three brothers in a family marry one wife. No matter who gives birth to the children, they all belong to the eldest brother, but to outsiders, they are called: "Children of so-and-so woman," and the second and third brothers are regarded as uncles. If one is a farmer, one is a lama, and one is a businessman, they share the joys of the family when they return home. When one brother sleeps with her first at night, he hangs a Buddhist rosary at the door. Those who come later touch the door and quietly leave when they see the rosary, never causing conflict. In Dajianlu, Ganzi, Darjeeling, and other places, there are even those who share the love of their wives with close friends, like the Eskimos, which is truly unique. Kang and Tibet also have a prevailing custom of sons-in-law living with the wife's family, so the family is centered on women. Women have the final say in all matters, both internal and external. Tibet also has so-called temporary marriages. Those who trade in Kang Province often come from far away in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and each trip lasts three to five years. They temporarily marry local women, and leave when they go. The two parties agree in advance that they will not pursue each other.

Cremation, Water Burial, Sky Burial, Animal Burial

The funerals in Kang and Tibet are also very peculiar, divided into four types: cremation, water burial, sky burial, and animal burial. It is said that the sky burial was created by Lord Yue (Yue Zhongqi). When Yue was in charge of Tibet, he saw dragon veins everywhere and was deeply afraid that the descendants of the Tibetans would harm China. Therefore, he advised them to feed the vultures after death instead of burying them. Also, the origin is that lamas believe that feeding birds after death is the most direct way to leave the underworld and be reborn. The method of sky burial is to tie the corpse's knees to the sides of the forehead and wrap it in a coat to transport it to the burial ground. The lamas who escort the funeral procession call and beckon the eagles and vultures along the way. Then, thousands of vultures, led by black vultures, circle around with the funeral procession. When they arrive at the burial ground, they remove the clothes and cover the head. First, the relatives and friends of the deceased cut the corpse into a swastika shape, and then the密宗 (esoteric Buddhist) lamas blow the tibia bone喇嘛 (lama flute) to summon the crows to eat. If the birds do not come down for a long time, it means that the deceased had committed sins during his lifetime. Then the esoteric Buddhist lamas try to attract them in various ways, or even cut them into pieces with a knife and feed them. The birds begin to come down. At this time, relatives and friends sit aside drinking alcohol and tea. After about an hour, the flesh is gone and the bones remain. Then the bones are crushed into powder and mixed with tsampa, and then fed to the vultures. Finally, the skull is crushed and still mixed with tsampa to make pills for the crows to eat, until nothing is left before returning.

Machine-Made Houses in 24 Hours

In order to alleviate the housing shortage, the Peoria Building Company in Illinois, USA, has invented a new method of building houses with machines. The giant machine is mounted on a wheeled vehicle. When needed, the vehicle can be driven to the foundation, and concrete can be poured in. A two-bedroom house can be built in 24 hours.

Housing Problem for American Veterans Solved

The picture below shows a glimpse of the housing at the former Coast Guard training station in the Brooklyn area of New York. These houses, formerly inhabited by Coast Guard women, have been renovated and refurbished to house veterans and their families after the war. In addition, a large number of new houses are under construction under New York State's emergency housing regulations.

### Joint Appeal Regarding the Current Situation in the Northeast

(I)

We recently heard that the Military Mediation Execution Group will be sent to the Northeast to resolve the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the nine provinces of the Northeast. Upon hearing this news, we are filled with bewilderment! Before the restoration, there was no activity of Communist troops in the Northeast. After the restoration, a large number of illegal armed forces infiltrated and roamed around, burning, killing, looting, and disrupting the local area. Such bandit behavior should not be recognized by the government as any organized army. Moreover, according to the spokesperson of the Chinese Communist Party, there are no Communist troops in the Northeast, as is known to all Chinese people. According to the order to cease conflict on January 10, the National Army entered the Northeast without any restrictions, which was also agreed to by the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, according to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, after the Soviet troops withdraw, they will hand over the Northeast to the National Government. Therefore, the takeover of the Northeast is purely a Sino-Soviet issue, not an issue between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as is even more universally recognized by the Chinese people. Therefore, the National Army's takeover of the Northeast is a responsibility that should be fulfilled, and should not be subject to any further obstruction. However, the illegal forces scattered throughout the Northeast not only obstruct the advance of the National Army, but also continuously attack the provinces and counties that have been taken over by the National Army, destroying transportation and disrupting public security. All kinds of illegal acts are outrageous! The Chinese Communist Army, which claims to be the people's army, cannot take actions that undermine unity and endanger peace. However, the Chinese Communist authorities recently falsely claimed that the National Army in the Northeast is expanding the civil war and attacking the Democratic Allied Forces, which led to the request to extend the order to cease conflict to the Northeast and to increase the dispatch of the execution group to mediate the conflict. This measure is clearly contradictory to the statement by the Chinese Communist Party spokesperson that there are no Communist troops in the Northeast and the agreement that the National Army's entry into the Northeast is unrestricted. Moreover, the results of the Political Consultative Conference have already decided to exclude the Northeast. The one army of the Communist Army in the Northeast recognized in the troop reorganization plan is another issue. This provision cannot be invoked now to carve up the Northeast. Therefore, the situation in the Northeast can only be regarded as the obstruction of the takeover by illegal armed forces, and there is no so-called Kuomintang-Communist conflict. Therefore, the arrival of the execution group in the Northeast is not only unnecessary, but also tantamount to tacitly acknowledging the legal status of the Communist Army in the Northeast, which is truly perplexing. We, the common people of the Northeast, have been occupied for the longest time and have suffered the deepest pain. This victory and restoration is only to seek national unity and complete sovereignty. Therefore, we all long for the National Army to smoothly take over as soon as possible, so as to see the light of day again. If we allow the illegal forces to obstruct and the execution group to mediate, then almost the entire Northeast will be occupied by illegal forces. Even if we seek a political solution, the Northeast may ultimately become special, and the victory of the War of Resistance will be completely erased. Although the government understands the plight of the compatriots in the Northeast who have suffered miserably and is willing to make any concessions in order to restore peace as soon as possible, temporary appeasement will cause long-term harm. It is better to strive for peace with sacrifice than to hope for peace and not get it. Therefore, the compatriots in the Northeast firmly oppose the arrival of the execution group in the Northeast and dare to request that the dispatch be immediately stopped and that the takeover be carried out with the military force of the National Army as soon as possible. Then the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate! Urgent telegram, hoping for your consideration! Provisional Council, Farmers Association, Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Women's Association, and Student Union of Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, respectfully kowtow. (Maodong Shen Telegram)

(II)

We lived through fourteen years of suffering under the enslavement and rule of the Japanese puppets. We prayed for liberation and to return to the embrace of our motherland and to see the majesty of our motherland at every moment. The Japanese puppets finally collapsed and surrendered, and we should be able to see the light of day again. However, the Soviet troops have been stationed here for a long time without withdrawing, and bandits have taken the opportunity to run rampant. Our lives, property, and freedom are all without protection. We are still trapped in deep water and scorching fire, living a life of hell on earth.

Fortunately, the Soviet troops are gradually withdrawing, and the National Army is gradually stationed. Wherever the National Army arrives, it becomes a land of light and prosperity. Bandits disappear, and people's lives are stable. However, today, most of the rural areas and remote counties in the Northeast are still rampant with banditry and people are living in misery because the National Army has not yet arrived. The spring plowing season has arrived, and farmers are suffering from displacement. Recently, the Soviet troops are about to completely withdraw as planned. In view of the urgency and complexity of the current situation, we hereby put forward the following appeals based on the mood of the whole country:

First, we demand that the National Army quickly and massively station in all parts of the Northeast to protect the people's lives, property, and freedom.

Second, we demand that the National Army quickly station in any location where the Soviet troops withdraw to stop the bandits from exploiting the people and disrupting public security.

Third, we demand that the National Army quickly suppress the bandits to stabilize social order and prosper the people's lives.

The above three demands are not only the unanimous wishes of the two million people of Shenyang, but also the sincere prayers of the three million compatriots in the Northeast for their early realization. We believe that the sooner the National Army can be stationed, the sooner the people's suffering can be alleviated. If the Soviet troops withdraw completely before the end of April, and our National Army cannot be stationed in large numbers in time, then after April, the people of the Northeast will once again suffer a great catastrophe. Now we are facing a critical moment of our own survival, and we hereby put forward the above urgent appeals. We ask Chairman Chiang and the National Government to give us quick and effective rescue. We hope that the people of the whole country and the just people of the world will give us sympathy and great assistance.

### Shame

— Xiaoshan

The two words "shame" have a very complex and subtle psychological explanation. According to Professor ____, "shame" and "reaction" are in the same category. It is a representative word, representing singular or plural potential faults and sins, but the "outbreak" (or "execution") of this representative is semi-passive or even purely passive. It is aroused and manifested by ____ kinds of agitation, reflection, and comparison.

In short, shame is a finger, pointing to your dark layer, and you have a certain corresponding performance.

This is the essence of shame.

Let's look at the performance of shame:

We know that in the structure and use of Chinese characters, "shame" (慚) and "guilt" (愧) are different. Shame is "external," guilt is "internal."

To put it bluntly, what is performed on the face is called "shame," and what is performed in the heart is called "guilt." A rush of heat, redness on the face, that's shame! The thumping, chaotic panic in the heart, that's guilt! In other words, the color on the face is called shame, and the lawsuit in the heart is called guilt.

According to normal psychological state, a person with sinful qualities and a criminal record should be self-aware, without necessarily doing any "reaction method." Even if the feeling is a little late, as long as you hear a sarcastic word, your face should react. Or else, give you a direct "question" or "exposure," then your conscience should speak up?

Or, to go further in the opposite direction: flatter you a few words, pat you a few times, and see if your face gets hot! Simply give you an award, and see if your heart can take it?

The problem lies here: it seems that all psychologically normal people have already "passed away"? The living are all "mentally ill patients - extreme psychological deviants" in the mouths of mental health professionals, without the essence and function of shame at all, so how can they have the performance of shame?

No matter if you say I want money, pervert justice, or violate public opinion, we are a face of flesh and a twisted heart!

Come on, flatterers, come on, high hats, come on, we are unashamed to take them, deserving of them!

Therefore, you only see so much "Hahaha!" and hear not the slightest "Sob sob." "Thick-skinned" and "black-hearted" are in power, shame can only go bankrupt!

### For the Sake of Living

— Cong Jun

"For the sake of living," many people use this phrase as a cover for lewd and shameless deeds. "For the sake of living," many others are inspired to improve their lives and complete solemn and sacred work.

Gorky, in a novel, wrote about two people with different personalities, both of whom could be said to be "for the sake of living." One person, in order to solve the problem of living, willingly degenerated and wandered down the wrong path. The other person, also in order to solve the problem of living, was motivated by the idea of "life" and resolutely took on the responsibility of fighting for human survival. The two characters formed a perfect contrast.

In today's society, people with weak wills, especially pure young men and women, are unable to withstand the impact of the turbid waves of society. Many young people, in order to satisfy their desire to survive, are involuntarily swept into the turbulent waves, and from then on, they flow into the vortex of depravity. For the sake of living, everyone can forgive them, because survival is the greatest desire of mankind. However, it is also for the sake of living that no one can forgive them, because there are many ways to survive, and they must not blindly follow the crowd and be willing to fall.

Some people say that prostitutes who sell their smiles are selling their bodies to earn a living. I say that those who use any means, using "for the sake of living" as a grandiose excuse, and indulging in the dark side of society, are selling their souls to earn a living. Many traitors who sell themselves for glory are willing to act as accomplices of tigers, disregarding the nation and the country. Their motivation for joining the enemy is also "for the sake of living." Of course, there are also many people who are able to maintain a minimum standard of living who lose their way because they hope to obtain higher material enjoyment. However, why don't they think that "for the sake of living," there are many paths to take? Why collude with the enemy? Why be used by bandits? No matter what, the phrase "for the sake of living" cannot cover up their crimes. Survival is important, but maintaining a noble ideal and personality is even more important. If a person loses their ideals for living, or if their personality is lost, even if they are still alive in the world, they can only be regarded as walking corpses, without a soul.

The great thinker Romain Rolland said: "Why do we live in the world? Our life is not for ourselves, but for mankind." The strong desire of mankind to survive proves that the individual should bear a heavy responsibility to society—sacrificing one's own happiness for the survival of others. Individuals are destined to die sooner or later, while the entire human race continues endlessly. If we want to make human society continue to evolve and make social life not perish with the individual, we must transform the "small self" into the "big self," and contribute all personal wisdom, talent, and energy to society, and cultivate the growth and development of the "big self." The meaning of life lies in improving the lives of all mankind, and the value of life lies in continuing the lives of all mankind. It is definitely not just to live in the world to solve the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation.

"For the sake of living," we have to work, which is very true. But there is something we must consider first: I want to live, and others want to live too. Does living for myself affect the lives of others? Does my own benefit hinder the benefits of others? Individuals live in groups, and the development of individuals must take into account the group. People who truly understand the meaning of life not only do not harm the interests of others, but even sacrifice their own interests for the happiness of others. Inspired by the phrase "for the sake of living," they first endure all kinds of hardships and sufferings in life, fight with life, and constantly improve their awareness of life. Along with "for the sake of living," they also think of "for mankind."

"For the sake of living," we do not seek life, nor do we covet life. On the contrary, we must also value the value of life, but if we must sacrifice our own lives for the happiness of mankind, we do not covet life either. We would rather die to preserve our personality than live with our personality stained with filth. A shameful life is not as good as a glorious death. Living in peace is not as good as dying in struggle.

Also, there are many people in society who, because they lack a good upbringing in life, only care about satisfying their desire to survive, and neglect the highest ideals of life. The degeneration of some people is due to the fact that their standards of living enjoyment cannot be lowered for a while, which leads to their hearts being obscured and their actions being flawed. The power of possessiveness that drives people to the path of depravity is indeed great. The lives of ordinary people belong to sensation, and they only pursue sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes, lacking the element of will. People who are independent and unique in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, face the real society with a spirit of perseverance and an unyielding will. Failures and difficulties are not enough to shake their determination. They always use their belief in life to carry out their ideas. As a result, they succeed and achieve final victory in the battle of life.

"For the sake of living," we should cultivate a belief in life and live our own lives. On the one hand, we must enrich our knowledge and skills in application so that we have the ability to adapt to various aspects of life. On the other hand, we must recognize the greatest meaning of life, understand the relationship between the individual and the group, and complete the task of self-education through hard training, and realize the highest ideals of life.

Driven by a strong desire to survive, we can take many paths. However, be aware and don't let our need "for the sake of living" cause our personality to suffer the slightest flaw.

"For the sake of living," we must choose a correct path!

### Songjiang in Mud and Slush

— Chen Mianyu

If you are an outsider, the first impression you will get when you step into Songjiang these days will be the muddy and slushy roads. The roads are made of loess, which turns into mud in rainy days, and because they are uneven, there are many puddles. Occasionally, a truck drives by, and you have to try to avoid it, otherwise arrow-like mud will splatter all over your coat. Therefore, everyone always curses the road on rainy days, but after the weather clears up, everyone puts this matter behind them. In fact, the road is also flawed on sunny days, especially when the summer climate is very dry and the northwest wind is very strong in winter. Sometimes you will wonder if you are in a heavy fog. There is so much yellow dust that you can't comfortably open your eyes on the road, and it's strange if sand doesn't blow in.

Secondly, everything, including drinks and washing, relies on the river. The water is always yellow, and vegetable peels, foreign bottles, and rags can be used for an exhibition. Especially after the tide recedes, a stream of black water flows trickling like a sewer. I'm not lying, sometimes there really is a nauseating stench.

Recently, someone launched a project to dredge the river, which seems to give people a glimmer of hope. The dredging fee of 4,000 yuan per person for each store has been collected almost entirely, and then the slogan has gradually faded away. The hot summer is coming soon, and I am really worried about the people of Songjiang. When epidemics run rampant in the hot weather, what kind of threat will the turbid and filthy river water pose to their health? It is imperative to start construction quickly now.

The city houses of Songjiang are almost as dilapidated as the river. From the west gate to Malu Bridge, even the most prosperous section is not neat. Here, you can see three-story buildings, but you can also find low-rise houses with protruding eaves and bald roofs. There are many Western-style facades that resemble screens, and the high and low buildings conceal the simplicity, but they are dangerous when there is a fire or wind.

Therefore, some people say that roads, rivers, and houses are the three movements of Songjiang's dilapidation, which is indeed true.

Speaking of the business district of Songjiang, it is only a short section outside the west gate. The city was bombed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, leaving only dilapidated walls. It is still the same now, with only a few residences and several institutions trying to create a lively atmosphere. Therefore, it can be said that Songjiang is really only a section outside the west gate, and only Malu Bridge to the west gate is relatively lively, which is the essence.

But the urban area is quite vast, stretching three or four miles from east to west. Therefore, rickshaws have their place under these conditions. At least until there is a means of transportation that is simpler and more convenient to replace them, they will not be eliminated. However, the rickshaws here are by no means as neat as we imagine. Not only does the body of the car shake from side to side, but the wheels are also covered with a lot of broken ropes and rags, which is also uncomfortable for your eyes. Less than one-tenth of them are pleasing to the eye.

Even the electric lights in Songjiang are not very satisfactory. It is true that the lights are dim and often malfunction. If the coal runs out, the movie theater will have to take a temporary "five-minute break." Usually, kerosene lamps and vegetable oil lamps are used as backup, otherwise you will inevitably suffer.

Comparatively speaking, education is still lively. In the morning and evening, there are many students walking on the road. However, this is limited to one class. The knowledge level of ordinary merchants is very low. The most complete bookstores here are "Spring Ends and Dreams Break" and "Sanmen Street," although there are also a few copies of "Midnight" to make up the numbers.

A bookstore clerk told me that in the past, only three or four copies of ×× Poetry Journal were sold in Songjiang each issue. How pathetic! It is no wonder that the bookshelves have become the world of ×× Weekly and ×× Weekly, which have the style of past tabloids.

Currently, there are three local newspapers: Rong Bao, Youth Daily, and Daguanming Daily. They are all printed by printing houses, but the degenerated supplements and the narrow news network have not achieved any significant results. Among them, the Youth Daily is still a more respectable newspaper. The only other publication is the Youth Monthly, which supports the literary scene in Songjiang, but it is thin in quality, only four pages wide, and has a small circulation. Moreover, it has no distinct style. Originally, there were two publications with little difference: Vocational Youth and Female Youth, but they died recently due to two fatal injuries: rising paper prices and high printing costs.

The so-called literary scene is like the road here on rainy days, mired in mud and slush. In fact, where in Songjiang is not muddy and slushy? Half a year after the victory, everything remains the same. Open your eyes, where is not stuck in mud and slush?

### Banknotes Flying Everywhere

— Jin Ding

On the road, you can often see small-denomination legal tender and counterfeit banknotes with a face value of 5,000 or 10,000 yuan, trampled on by people. Even the "rickshaw pullers" ignore them. "Banknotes flying everywhere," who says people are living in misery? Or that there is widespread suffering?

In the streets and alleys of the countryside, we can also often see the same situation. Some people use five-yuan and ten-yuan CRB notes as toilet paper, or as decorations for wallpapering. "Banknotes flying everywhere," who says rural areas are bankrupt and need relief?

Everywhere shows the scene of "banknotes flying everywhere." Is this not picking up lost things? Or is it the land of gentlemen?

### Answering Readers

Da Shuan asks: A friend of mine, Mr. So-and-so, used to live in Nanshi. He was bombed in October 1944. Mr. So-and-so has an elder brother who lives in the former French Concession and is also a second-hand landlord. He has spare rooms but refuses to take him in. Mr. So-and-so discussed this with me. I valued friendship and resolutely let him live with me. At first, I did not expect that Mr. So-and-so's wife was a madwoman. She has a loud voice and sings wildly, or hits metal objects like drumming. She scolds people for no reason, day and night. Although her mind is confused, her speech seems clear. The neighbors are suffering, but Mr. So-and-so ignores it. What should I do?

Lawyer Duanben Kai answers: Since it interferes with the tranquility of residence, you can ask him to move out.

Zhou Jin-gen asks: My late father passed away nineteen years ago. At that time, he left 30,000 yuan in cash and a piece of farmland. Before my late father passed away, he told my uncle: the cash should be given to the eldest son, and the farmland in a certain place should be given to the youngest son (i.e., me). Who knew that my uncle (now deceased) actually induced my elder brother to sell the farmland that I was supposed to get to someone else? At that time, I was working as an apprentice in a factory, so I didn't know about it. Now I plan to apply to the court for (1) the invalidity of the sales contract; (2) my elder brother is responsible for all the losses of the buyer; (3) I don't know the buyer's address, can I apply to the court for a public announcement to serve as public notice?

Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers: If there is sufficient proof, you can claim the invalidity of the sales contract. If the location of the buyer is unknown, you can apply to the court for public notice.

### Letter from Gongji Hospital

"Regarding the news of a poor pregnant woman in our hospital giving birth to triplets, since it was published in your esteemed newspaper, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have inquired and donated money, for which we are deeply grateful. These triplet twins have many difficulties in raising them, so they are still being cared for in our hospital, with doctors and nurses taking good care of them. We plan to have their family members take them back after they are one year old. All expenses within the period will be borne by our hospital. However, we still hope that enthusiastic people will donate clothing. We are deeply grateful for this. As for cash donations, our hospital will not accept them. Please contact the family members of the triplets directly. We hereby inform you of this and wish you well."

### Symbol Stolen and Voided

Editor: I am from Yuyao and work for the Jinshan County Government. I came to Shanghai on official business. This morning (7th), at the entrance of the Dashin Company, my team leader symbol, a self-defense armband, and a dispatch order of Xiangxiang team, Zhangyan District, Jinshan County Self-Defense Brigade were stolen. There were also two important letters. In addition to applying to the Jinshan County Government for re-issuance, if any kind person picks them up, please notify the Military Section of the Jinshan County Government. I will be very grateful. Qi Zu
