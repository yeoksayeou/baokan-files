### Chairman Holds Reception Today: Comforting Elders After Eight Years of Separation; Long Conversation with Wedemeyer Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Chairman Chiang's arrival in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, the entire city's populace has been ecstatic. Yesterday, flags continued to be hung in tribute. To understand the suffering of the citizens, the Chairman has established a Secretariat at Qiqi Road to receive official letters and petitions from all sectors. He is scheduled to host reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and representatives of comrades who suffered hardship at the City Hall Auditorium this morning. This afternoon, the Chairman and his wife will hold a reception on Route de Ghis similar to the one at Huairentang in Beiping, to comfort the city's elders whom they have been separated from for eight years.

Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the Chairman and his wife traveled by car directly from their official residence to the Soong Family Cemetery on Hongqiao Road to pay respects at Madam Soong's tomb. The Chairman wore a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, over which he wore a black wool overcoat. Madam wore a grey-colored velvet overcoat. Yu Jishi, Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, rode in the same car. Qian Dajun, Zhang Daofan, and aides-de-camp followed behind in four cars. Upon arriving at the cemetery, the Chairman and his wife stepped out of the car and walked to Madam Soong's tomb, where they stood respectfully. After Huang Renlin presented a wreath, they bowed three times in respect, lingered for about twenty minutes, and then returned to their residence by car. At 11:50 AM, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Forces in China, accompanied by his secretary Wu Hanmin, paid respects to the Chairman to hold an important discussion on military issues within China. The Chairman and his wife also invited Mr. Wedemeyer to lunch at their residence. Mr. Wedemeyer and his secretary departed at 3:33 PM.

### The New First Army Has Been Secretly Sent Off from Guangdong, Via Kowloon, to the Northeast; No Definite Date Yet for the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops

[United Press, Hong Kong, 12th] It was revealed here today that the Chinese New First Army began yesterday to depart from Guangdong to the Northeast via Kowloon. The departure of the New First Army, and the possible arrival of General Marshall and Zhou Enlai in Guangdong this week, further suggests that the fighting within Guangdong has, in fact, come to an end. The New First Army has been stationed in Guangdong since November of last year, awaiting U.S. transport ships to go to Japan to participate in the military occupation of Honshu. After this plan was cancelled, the army was scheduled to go to the Northeast.

Cannot Receive the Northeast Without Making More Concessions

[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] A certain senior Chinese official who recently returned to Chongqing from the Northeast expressed his opinion today that although the Soviet side appears to be assisting China on the surface, China may not be able to receive the Northeast unless it makes more concessions to the Soviet side.

Economic Concessions

It is recalled that when Chairman Chiang met with reporters on February 5th, he acknowledged that he was engaged in informal negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding economic concessions beyond the publicized terms of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The day after Chairman Chiang's reception for reporters, a certain Chinese official spokesman stated that the Chinese side had not requested that the deadline for the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast be extended beyond February 1st.

Assassination Incidents

The Chinese official who returned to Chongqing stated that Chinese people in Changchun and Harbin are subject to a curfew after 5:00 PM. Outside of the two main thoroughfares, personal safety is not guaranteed, and assassinations still occur from time to time. Chinese newspapers in these cities also frequently report on assassinations. The official Central News Agency issued a dispatch from Changchun on February 9th stating that Zhang Xinfu, special envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the Northeast, and four other personnel were killed in the Fushun coal mining area north of Shenyang by over three hundred armed bandits. A certain senior Chinese official accused that these bandits were, in fact, Soviet troops under the command of a certain major general who was in charge of the Fushun area. The nominally independent "World Daily" also had a similar report on February 5th, stating that seven people were missing and one person escaped. "The Nationalist Gazette" stated on February 9th that officials sent from Chongqing to the Northeast were frequently assassinated.

Training Troops

The Chinese official who returned to Chongqing said that the Soviet army in the Northeast has trained and equipped 400,000 local troops, some of whom are puppets of the Communist Party, but most of whom are guerrillas who fled to the Soviet territory during the Japanese occupation. He also stated that there were 200,000 troops from Yan'an who, under the orders of the Soviet side, entered the Northeast after the Japanese surrender. The official revealed that no withdrawal action by the Soviet army can be expected before May. He stated that the barracks and military installations have been repaired, and the Soviet army's demobilized soldiers in the Northeast have all returned to their country, replaced by new troops. The official said that only empty houses remain of the important heavy industrial factories, and the main equipment and installations have been transported to the Soviet Union. He stated that important railways and other means of transportation are still under the control of the Soviet army, as reported by the Central News Agency.

When to Withdraw

It is understood that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has twice invited Soviet Ambassador Petrov to his office to discuss when the Soviet army will begin to withdraw. The Soviet Ambassador replied that he must cable Moscow. Recent newspaper reports have emphasized the difficulties of the situation in the Northeast. Chiang Ching-kuo, Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in the Northeast, has traveled to the Northeast several times, and Madame Chiang has also recently traveled to the Northeast. "Peace Daily" stated that officials of the National Government who are to take over the provinces in the Northeast are currently stationed in Changchun and Harbin. Some newspapers said that there is currently no conflict between the government forces and the communist forces in the Northeast. "Central Daily News" published today: Chiang's Northeast Headquarters has established a Sino-Soviet Joint Military Police Inspectorate to be responsible for maintaining order in the area near Fushun, Shenyang.

Thorough Investigation of the Zhang Case

[United Press, Chongqing, 12th] The "World Daily," an independent right-wing newspaper, published an editorial today calling on the government to thoroughly investigate the truth of the assassination of Zhang Xinfu, Special Envoy to the Northeast, last month, because "this case is not only a murder case, but also an important event affecting China's sovereignty in the Northeast." The editorial stated that this incident has sullied the reputation of the Allied nations and threatens the future peace of Asia. The newspaper pointed out: Fushun is located within a coal mining area and is guarded by Soviet troops. No armed forces other than the Soviet army are allowed to enter. Who would believe that Zhang Xinfu was killed by three hundred bandits? The editorial concluded that China has refused to accept any conditions that would harm the Soviet Union and that China also believes that the Soviet Union would not deliberately violate its promises and damage its reputation.

### Construction of the Sichuan-Xikang Road Included in the Five-Year Plan

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] It is learned that the Ministry of Communications' plans for the construction of the Sichuan-Xikang Railway have now been included in the Five-Year Plan.

### Military Demobilization Conference to be Held in Nanjing Mid-Month; Generals from the Southeast Invited to Attend

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The first military conference held in Nanjing after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan will open in the near future. Most of the commanders of units at the division level and above stationed in the southeastern provinces and along the Yangtze River will come to Nanjing to attend. The conference is clearly not nationwide. It is reported that the central issues will include the reorganization, education, and supply of the military, and reports from the attending generals will also be heard, submitted for review, and then discussed. Countries around the world are competing to discuss demobilization and disarmament after the war. China cannot be an exception. However, people in Nanjing today believe that the difficulty of China's demobilization and disarmament can be said to be unique. It is believed that this conference will focus on discussions on military aftermath. Chairman Chiang will attend in person to preside.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] According to reliable sources, the military authorities believe that demobilization work needs to be promoted urgently. A military demobilization conference will be convened in Nanjing to discuss it in detail. The date may be the 15th of this month. General He Yingqin will preside. It is heard that senior generals from the southeastern provinces have been invited to attend. Chairman Chiang may come to Nanjing to preside over the opening ceremony and deliver instructions in person.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 12th dispatch] To alleviate the people's distress, the Ministry of Finance has already issued a clear order to exempt the land tax in the recovered territories for one year.

### Future Negotiations on Vietnam Issue to Proceed Through Diplomatic Channels; Lu Han Says Surrender Acceptance Work Largely Completed

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 11th dispatch] Commander Lu Han of the First Front Army stated: "My stay in Vietnam this time will last several weeks. The work of accepting the surrender here has been largely completed. According to plan, over 30,000 Japanese prisoners of war and Japanese residents in Vietnam can be repatriated to Japan starting April 1st. This work is relatively easy. However, the transportation of weapons and materials surrendered by the Japanese army will take longer, as the quantity is considerable and requires 200 ships." The rumor that our army has begun to withdraw from North Vietnam is inaccurate. The current troop movements are for the purpose of rotation. However, now that the military period is coming to an end, future issues concerning Vietnam will be handled through normal diplomatic channels. Therefore, China and France have agreed that all future negotiations will be held in our capital, rather than discussed locally. Over 4,000 French troops stationed in Yunnan have been permitted by our country to enter Vietnam, and this batch of troops will be stationed in Laos. Lu also stated: "The future of the Vietnamese independence movement depends on the strength of Vietnam itself. According to the general trend of international affairs, France will also be willing to grant the Vietnamese a higher degree of autonomy." Lu also believes that France and Vietnamese revolutionaries are already in negotiations.

### Optimism Remains for Transportation Recovery; Organizations in Beiping and Tianjin Suggest Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th dispatch] Relevant authorities here have not yet received formal notification of the four points of agreement on restoring transportation, as stated in the 10th Communiqué released by the Military Mediation Department in Beiping on the 11th. According to a certain gentleman who recently returned to Nanjing after inspecting the transportation situation in North China, the people of North China now believe that nothing is more urgent than transportation. The industrial and commercial organizations in Beiping and Tianjin have suggested to the Military Mediation Department ways to resolve the disputes: (1) Request the Communist Party to abandon its prejudices against participating in railway management, so that transportation can be restored first to save the refugees. (2) Request both armies to first reach an agreement on maintaining railway freight, so that goods can flow smoothly to stabilize prices. (3) Request that the dispute over transportation management rights be left to be discussed and resolved after the National Assembly, when the government is reorganized. It is reported that the representatives of both sides in the Military Mediation Department, because the government insists on quickly restoring transportation to save millions of refugees in the recovered territories, are willing to discuss the rest at length and have been making every effort to adopt parallel proposals. Optimism remains for the recovery of transportation.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 11th dispatch] The Executive Group received an urgent telegram from Zhang Jingyue, commander of the Zhangdian Security Division, stating that the Communist army was gathering, with over ten thousand troops, declaring they would attack Zhangdian immediately. At 10:00 PM on the 10th, 800 Communist troops in Zhangzhuang, northeast of Zhangdian, fired into the city of Zhangdian with grenade launchers. I followed orders and did not retaliate. Please send someone for mediation quickly.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 11th dispatch] The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has specially dispatched the Taian Group to take special responsibility for mediating the Taian issue. The American representative of the group, Lieutenant Colonel Napp, and the head of the government representative group, Lu Xiang, flew to Jinan by special plane from Beiping on the 10th, and are scheduled to go to Taian with the Communist representative today. In order to conduct effective mediation, the group will be stationed permanently in Taian. Regarding the issue of puppet troops, government representative Lu Xiang said that the Executive Headquarters has already agreed on a solution and has telegraphed it to various places for compliance. According to news from military and political authorities here, the situation in Zhangdian and Zhoucun is becoming tense again. The main forces of the 9th Division of the Communist Army, Qian Jun, and the 4th Division, Liao Rongbiao, are advancing north from Boshan, making conflict very likely. However, the Communist representative in Jinan denied this. However, Colonel Lake and others in Beiping have learned of the tense situation in Zhangdian and are scheduled to return from Beiping on the 11th to Zhangdian for mediation.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th dispatch] The Xuzhou Group of the Executive Headquarters flew to Zaozhuang on the 11th to inspect the mining area and is scheduled to fly to Haizhou on the 12th for inspection.

Mediation in Taiyuan Stalled; Communist Party Representative Has Not Yet Arrived

[Associated Press, Taiyuan, 11th dispatch] Shanxi, a mountainous province bordering the Yellow River, possesses the richest coal and iron deposits in China. The Military Mediation Executive Headquarters will face a serious test here, as the ceasefire and transportation restoration orders in the province are still in a delicate state of stalemate. There are over 400,000 enemy troops in the entire province of Shanxi, including one division of the Central Army, 260,000 regular troops under Yan Xishan, 40,000 Japanese troops, and an uncertain number of Communist troops, estimated to be over 100,000. Although no large-scale battles have occurred, troop movements are frequently reported. According to Yan Xishan, who has governed Shanxi for over 35 years, there is an 80% hope that the ceasefire order can be implemented smoothly, but others are more pessimistic. The three-person group sent here by the Executive Headquarters from Beiping includes Colonel Holle of the American side and Major General Zhou of the Central side, but the Communist Party representative has not been assigned, for strategic or other reasons. The reporter witnessed the two being at a loss. Holle arrived here from Datong on the 3rd of this month. In Datong, the Holle Group concluded a broad mediation agreement on the 6th, which earned the praise of Special Envoy Marshall, who called it "perfect work achieved in a very difficult situation." Although the Executive Group here has no work, complaints have been filed by all parties. According to Yan, since the ceasefire order was announced on January 13, the Communist army has occupied more than four counties. Of the 106 counties in Shanxi, 39 are in the hands of the Communist army. The commander of the Japanese First Army, Kakuta, frankly admitted that since the end of the war, his troops had had countless contacts with the Communist army. After January 13, three Japanese soldiers were killed, six were injured, and twelve were captured. The group has also received reports that the cities of Taiyuan and Datong are both under food blockade. The reporter did not feel a shortage of food in Taiyuan. The rumor that the city's food supply is only enough for 230,000 residents for four days is not credible, judging from the shops filled with goods. It is even possible to buy American coffee in the shops, although the price is extremely high, requiring 6,000 French currency per pound. In the major cities under Yan Xishan's control, donkey carts and camel teams are allowed to transport supplies to the outside of the city, which seems to be the case, but they return empty. Although telephone communication is being vigorously restored, Communist soldiers with bayonets are obstructing it in the countryside. The traffic between Datong and Taiyuan was only open for three days, and it is reported that it was interrupted again due to the burning of a railway bridge somewhere in the middle. These situations occurred after the issuance of the ceasefire order and the establishment of the Datong District Mediation Agreement. According to the observation of the representatives of the group here, there are obstacles between the signing of the agreement and its actual implementation that could endanger the entire mediation and ceasefire issue.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 12th dispatch] Currently, the PingSui Railway is passable from Beiping to Qinglongqiao. The PingCheng Railway is passable to Miyun. The Shijiazhuang to Zhangde section of the PingHan Railway has not been repaired. From Zhangde to Kaifeng, travel east is unobstructed.

Then the French representative, Pide, spoke, advocating that the Indonesian issue should be resolved in accordance with the review method of the Greece issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin did not attend and was represented by Jadja.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 12th dispatch: The Security Council meeting today made no decision and adjourned until 9:00 PM tomorrow.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 12th dispatch: The Deputy Governor-General of the Netherlands East Indies, Van Mook, continued to negotiate with the Indonesian Prime Minister on issues related to Indonesia today.

[United Press, London, 12th dispatch] Ukrainian representative Manuilsky stated in the United Nations Security Council today that General Mallaby, commander of the British troops in the East Indies, was killed by Japanese special agents "because the British army failed to disarm the Japanese army in the area." Manuilsky's bomb-like statement contradicted the British Foreign Secretary Bevin's claim that he was killed by Indonesian extremists. General Mallaby was assassinated in early autumn last year. When Foreign Secretary Bevin first argued the East Indies issue to the United Nations agency, he used the case as an excuse for the British army to temporarily use the Japanese army to maintain order before it arrived in the East Indies.

[Reuters, London, 12th dispatch] The head of the US delegation to the United Nations agencies, Stettinius, stated in the Security Council last night that he opposed the Council sending a commission to Java. This was the first statement by the United States on the Indonesian dispute. Before Stettinius spoke, the Council had been debating for two hours whether the Ukrainian delegation had the right to submit a formal resolution proposing a commission to investigate on the ground. The debate on the Indonesian stalemate continued until this morning, but the Council has decided to allow Ukraine to make a proposal, while the Australian and American representatives have spoken out against sending a commission. During last night's debate, only the Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, did not formally oppose the Ukrainian proposal. Stettinius said: "There is no need for investigation. Any action by the Council will hinder Batavia's argument." However, the Council should express its hope that the terms of the surrender of the Japanese army will be "implemented immediately." He is confident that the Council hopes that negotiations will succeed to "meet the legitimate desire for autonomy of the Indonesian people." Chairman Makin, representing Australia, said: "The British army in Java does not threaten peace, and the Council has no reason to interfere. But if a commission is sent, Australia also wants to send a representative to participate."

### Gu Weijun Speaks, Declaring China's Position; Does Not Oppose Sending Investigation Team

[Reuters, London, 12th dispatch] Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, expressed his views on the Indonesian issue during the Security Council debate yesterday, stating that he does not object in principle to the Ukrainian representative's proposal to send an investigation team to Indonesia. Gu said: "We are not advocating investigating this case, but since some governments sincerely hope to obtain more information about the situation in the area, we believe that an investigation team may be able to contribute. The Chinese delegation, based on this reason, and not due to a lack of trust in the United Kingdom, will not oppose the Ukrainian proposal." There are over two million overseas Chinese in the Netherlands East Indies, most of whom live in Java. Since the military action began in September last year, many Chinese have been killed and injured. In Surabaya alone, 500 overseas Chinese were killed in the past four months. These reports are not yet final reports. Regarding the Indonesian national movement, the Chinese in Java have tried their best to avoid involvement, but their sympathy is naturally with the side that is striving for autonomous government. The Chinese people, as well as all peace-loving and freedom-loving nations, including the Dutch people, have deep sympathy for the Indonesian people. The Chinese delegation believes that this matter may be postponed for discussion to see the results of the direct negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands.

### Special Committee Passes World Capital Address; Accepts Survey Team's Recommendation

[Associated Press, London, 11th dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly Special Committee today voted 22 to 17 to accept the recommendation of the Permanent Headquarters Survey Team to locate the world's capital in the Greenwich-Stamford area between Connecticut and New York. However, with a difference of only five votes, it is expected that there will still be fierce debate when the case is submitted to the General Assembly for a vote. France, backed by some Latin American countries and all Arab countries, advocated postponing the vote and advocated that the permanent headquarters be located in San Francisco Bay. China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom all advocated choosing the Greenwich-Stamford area. The United States did not vote. Philippine representative Lopez said: "If the Greenwich-Stamford area is elected, there will be a day when we will encounter pickets holding signs saying 'Do not put the United Nations agency here.'"

[Central News Agency, London, 11th dispatch] The US delegation, with the special approval of the Canadian delegation, submitted a proposal to the Economic and Social Council tonight regarding the convening of an international trade and employment conference in the second half of this year to address employment and trade barriers, and discrimination.

### Several Countries Still Concealing War Criminals; Two Committees of the General Assembly Resolve to Increase Arrests

[Associated Press, London, 11th dispatch] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, arguing that some countries, including a few members of the United Nations agencies, are still hiding war criminals, advocating that all countries should take all necessary measures to arrest all war criminals.

### Secret Speech on Currency Exchange Arouses Questions from British Members of Parliament

[Associated Press, London, 11th dispatch] Former British wartime Prime Minister Churchill recently sold three copies of his secret speeches in the House of Commons during the war to the American Life magazine. Labor Party members of parliament questioned Prime Minister Attlee today whether he had the right to sell these secret speeches to magazines for publication. Attlee replied that the speaker has the right to publish his speeches. He was asked again whether the copyright belongs exclusively to the speaker. Attlee replied that he would consult lawyers before replying to this matter.

### US Distributes Memorandum Condemning Argentina; List of Misdeeds Too Numerous to Mention

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th dispatch] The US government distributed a memorandum to the envoys of various South American countries stationed in Washington (excluding Argentina) and US envoys to various South American countries tonight, publicly condemning the Argentine government for almost establishing a "dictatorial government" in the Western Hemisphere, and directly accused the regime led by Colonel Peron of "actively assisting" the Axis powers, attempting to undermine the Pan-American system through "smoke screen tactics." This document will serve as the basis for Pan-American consultations, and the various misdeeds of Argentina listed therein are too numerous to mention.

### Restricted by Anglo-Siamese Treaty; Stagnation of Overseas Chinese Rice Industry in Siam; Economic Situation Inconceivable if This Continues

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 11th dispatch] The delegation sent by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce recently visited Siam to investigate the commercial situation of overseas Chinese. After completing the task and returning, they said: "The business situation of overseas Chinese in Siam, especially the rice industry, is really disappointing. The economic situation of overseas Chinese is very poor." The reason is that during the Japanese occupation period, most of the rice industry engaged in by overseas Chinese was stagnant. Furthermore, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese during the occupation period were too heavy. Due to the newly revised provisions of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty, the rice industry in peacetime should be controlled by the Siamese government, so rice must be sold to a government. This is different from the free foreign trade of Chinese merchants before the war. According to the delegation, if this situation continues, the economic situation of overseas Chinese will be inconceivable.

### Wei Daoming Has Arrived in Washington; Will Visit US President

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wei Daoming has returned to his post after returning to China for debriefing.

### The Brains of War Criminals; US Asks for Research Use

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th dispatch] According to the US Army Institute of Pathology: "If the United Nations International Tribunal sentences the main German and Japanese war criminals to death, the Institute will request to obtain the brains of each person after the execution for pathological research by US Army doctors, so that we can know more about the causes of criminal tendencies in human nature. After the research is completed, the collected brains may be put on public display."

### Sino-British Trade Has Begun; Britain Hopes for Stability in Our Currency

[British Information Service, London, 12th dispatch] British goods have been shipped to China in a steady stream. According to London business circles, since the New Year, five or six British merchant ships have loaded goods in British ports and sailed to China. In addition, two British ships are planned to continue transporting British goods to China in the near future. However, at present, the goods are only enough to load one ship per week for shipment. There is reportedly no such difficulty in shipping goods from China to the UK. Ships can also be prepared quickly. British people who are interested in Sino-British trade believe that the purchase of Chinese goods has been shelved due to the uncertain exchange rate. Therefore, the statement issued to the press by Chinese Finance Minister Yu Hongjun that the Chinese government has resolved the issue of foreign exchange and that measures to stabilize currency and prices have been decided has been warmly welcomed in London. Once the scheduled steps are implemented, Chinese goods will be shipped to the UK in a steady stream, which will benefit both China and the UK.

### Affected by the Disciplinary Instruction; Japanese Cabinet to Be Reorganized Again; There is a Saying That the General Election Will Be Postponed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] Well-informed political observers stated today that since the serious significance of MacArthur's instruction was made public on Saturday, the Shidehara Cabinet is bound to be reorganized again. Of the important cabinet members affected by this instruction, Nakamoto and Kobayashi have already been affected. Government officials, professional soldiers, and people in financial and industrial institutions, all those with extreme nationalist tendencies, are all affected by this instruction and may not serve as public officials. And this instruction must be further clarified, which will make the Shidehara Cabinet face another reorganization challenge.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch] According to a continued sales news report: The Japanese general election was originally scheduled to be held on March 31, but since the Cabinet strictly interpreted MacArthur's purge instruction, the preparation for the election has been disrupted. People in the political world, in view of this, suggested postponing the election date. The reasons are: (1) The Cabinet did not explain MacArthur's purge instruction early; (2) The Cabinet wanted to hold the election before the Democratic Front was established; (3) The people are now paying attention to the issue of people's food and have no time to care about other things. The Yomiuri Shimbun also said that the Shidehara Cabinet is now using the current unstable political situation to maintain its power.

Japanese Communist Party to Hold Congress; Proclaim New Party Program

[Associated Press, 1st dispatch] The Japanese Communist Party is scheduled to hold a national congress on the 23rd, lasting three days.

### Germany: Lower Rhine Region Still Severely Flooded; Waters Near Essen Reach Above Head Level; Residents Isolated in High Buildings Awaiting Rescue

[Reuters, London, 12th] The Frankfurt Radio stated yesterday that the Rhine region is experiencing its worst flooding in thirty-five years. Many cities in the British sector are isolated, power is cut off, and the railway between Berlin, Bremen, and Frankfurt has been severed. The Hohenzollern Bridge is the only safe crossing point over the Rhine. The Weser and Elbe rivers are also experiencing floods, with water advancing at speeds exceeding eleven miles per hour.

[United Press, British Army Headquarters on the Rhine, 11th] The Emscher Canal overflowed its banks near Gelsenkirchen today, causing a flood ten feet deep. Two thousand residents of the town are isolated in high buildings. British Army amphibious vehicles and small boats are delivering milk and emergency supplies to households. Traffic on the Rhine River has been halted, and the bridges in Cologne are impassable. However, the water level on the Rhine is reportedly receding.

### Giant Airship: Carries 100 Passengers, Weighs 120 Tons; Landing Resembles a Car Pulling into a Station

[British News Service, London, 12th] Britain is assisting in the construction of a civilian airship that is larger than the 100-ton R.101 currently being built in the United Kingdom. It can carry 100 passengers, has a range of 5,000 miles, and a speed of 300 to 350 miles per hour. It weighs 120 tons. Overseas Airlines will invest £10 million to order twenty of these airships for use on British civilian air routes.

[Further Dispatch] The renowned British aircraft manufacturer, Roe Aircraft Company, has invented a new device that makes airship landings as easy as a train pulling into a station. Airship landings are generally much more inconvenient than airplane landings. After an airship reaches its destination, it must moor to a pontoon, and passengers must transfer to a motorboat to reach the shore. This inconvenience has been solved by Roe Company's invention of an automatic cable connector. The new method uses several pontoons to support the cable at the waterline. After landing, the airship approaches the cable, attaches to the automatic connector, and is then towed to the station by a winch. The reverse method allows for a smooth take-off.

[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] Iranian Prime Minister Saed has ordered the lifting of the ban on political party gatherings, which has been in effect for six months. The new Deputy Minister of Politics and Director of Propaganda, Fayyaz, broadcasted yesterday, stating, "I will not allow anyone to disrupt public order and security, and violators will be severely punished."

### Local Dispatches

Kunshan

Six Hundred Opium Addicts Sent for Rehabilitation in Batches: The county authorities, in order to eradicate opium addiction as soon as possible, have ordered the police to send the 415 opium addicts who surrendered themselves in the county for rehabilitation in batches. The 228 opium addicts who were reported are being detained and sent to the military court for forced rehabilitation. Those who have quit on their own must apply to their respective district offices for verification by the county and further investigation by the village chiefs to ensure that no opium addicts who have not surrendered or been reported are overlooked.

Suzhou

Employing Japanese Prisoners to Repair the Stadium: Wen Huanqing, Commander of the Fourth Regiment of the Pacification Department, recently observed that the county's public stadium has not yet been restored to its pre-war condition and urgently needs repairs. He has approved the request from Director Wang of the Wuxian Education Bureau and Director Cheng of the stadium to dispatch Japanese prisoners to repair the stadium grounds. Deputy Deng Xinke of the regiment contacted the Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, and 100 Japanese prisoners were dispatched to work, expected to complete the repairs within a few days.

Wuxi

Supporting the Original Draft of the New Company Law: Xue Mingjian, Chairman of the Sunan District Branch of the China National Industries Association, believes that after the new Company Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan, the Supreme National Defense Council deleted the words "business" from Article 2 and Article 292, which would benefit the development of bureaucratic capital and violate the principles of economic construction. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, stating: "Having learned that the new Company Law has been passed by your esteemed Yuan and that the Supreme National Defense Council has deleted the words 'business' from Article 2 and Article 292, this association has studied it and believes that the deletion will not only benefit the development of bureaucratic capital but also violate the principles of the economic construction program. If foreign companies are not required to operate in their home countries before being allowed to establish branches in China, all domestic companies will become disguised foreign branches, which will not only harm Chinese-owned industries and businesses and reduce national tax revenue. We urge your esteemed Yuan to support the provisions of the original draft to benefit industrial and commercial enterprises." (Remainder omitted)

### Structures 70 Feet Below London: The Secret of the Underground Headquarters; Churchill's Military Facility for Planning Strategy and Winning Battles from Thousands of Miles Away

—Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department

Seventy feet beneath London, the British built a series of underground air-raid shelters. It was here that wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his cabinet decided the fate of the nation.

The underground cabinet was protected by sixteen feet of reinforced concrete, with gas-proof doors and steel mesh against bombs. It was built as early as 1938. Its location is beneath the government buildings, extending from "Whitehall" to "St. James's Park."

Managed by the Royal Navy: Internal Structure Mimics a Battleship

The underground headquarters contained a total of one hundred and twenty-seven rooms. The low-ceilinged corridors resembled the interior of a battleship, like the narrow passages within a warship. It was equipped with ventilation ducts, air regulators, and pipelines, all built in the style of a battleship and managed by the Royal Navy.

The heart of the underground complex was the "War Room," staffed by personnel of at least the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

In his office (see Figure 1), Churchill delivered most of his important speeches. The map on the wall of his office (i.e., bedroom) (see left corner of Figure 1) marked the hypothetical defense locations during the German invasion of Britain.

The Attlees Also Lived Here Together

During the Blitz, Churchill and his wife lived there permanently. The current Prime Minister Attlee and his wife lived in another small room.

Mrs. Churchill's bedroom contained soft and comfortable sofas and beds, and antique mirrors with gilded frames. Churchill's daughter, Miss Mary, also lived there with them from time to time.

The Cabinet's "War Room" had two or three dozen green baize-covered desks, with Churchill sitting in a round-backed chair in the center. Most of the major military actions were decided here.

Three Thousand Crates of Food for Emergency Use

Churchill's private dining room was adjacent to his bedroom, small and simple, with four seats. Churchill often entertained the King and other dignitaries there. The underground kitchen, equipped with electric stoves, was also managed by the Royal Navy. Three thousand large crates of beef, biscuits, tea, and ham were stored here, in case the exits of the underground complex were blocked by bombing, to serve as an emergency supply.

Transatlantic

The transatlantic telephone (see Figure 2) connected directly to Washington, D.C., used exclusively by Churchill and the White House (then President Roosevelt) for communication. It was equipped with a headset for stenographers to listen and record conversations. In the corridor, naval personnel posted weather reports from the surface on cards in a fixed location, so that anyone wishing to leave the underground complex could know the outside weather conditions at any time.

### "Two-Plane Wing" Tactics Expert: Chennault in Kunming; Special Dispatch from This Newspaper's Kunming Correspondent, Zhang Jun

"China's Lafayette"—General Chennault, bid farewell to China amidst enthusiastic farewells six months ago, and returned to Kunming amidst enthusiastic welcomes half a month ago. Although only one hundred and fifty days have passed from his departure to his return, many changes have taken place in the country he has served for eight years. On the morning of August 8, 1945, a drizzly morning, this Flying Tiger General boarded a special plane to return to his country, carrying the umbrella of "Meritorious Service in China" and the golden key engraved with the words "Chongqing." A reporter asked the General before his departure: "Will this trip be a farewell or a long parting?" The General hesitated for a moment before answering in a very frank tone: "I don't know yet what will happen, but time will tell." It is not difficult to understand the General's state of mind at this time. Those who saw him off at the airport in Kunming had their eyebrows hanging with drizzle, and their hearts seemed to have lost a close friend. When they waved their scarves to bid farewell to each other, they were especially reluctant.

### Newsboys Shout: "Read Chennault's News!"

The good news of General Chennault's return to China suddenly spread throughout China in early January. People in Kunming have some selfish and optimistic views on this news. Some people say that General Chennault will train the air force in Kunming, and the unemployed don't have to worry about finding a way out. Some people speculate that the price of eggs in Kunming may not fall sharply. On January 18, the General arrived in Kunming from Chongqing. On the third day, newsboys shouted on the street: "Read Chennault's news!" Only then did the general public know that on the evening of January 19, military and political leaders of Yunnan warmly welcomed General Chennault at the Aowen Bank. The five hosts were Chairman Lu Yongheng, Commander-in-Chief Huo Songshan, and others.

General Chennault has lived in Kunming for most of his eight years in China. People here not only know about his past military achievements but also know his private life well. It is said that in his spare time, he likes sports, hunting, sometimes bridge, sometimes drinking, and his life is simple and his work and rest are regular. He does not pay much attention to personal security. The doors and windows of his bedroom are not locked at night. At midnight on January 25, a scholar broke into the General's bedroom, but fortunately, no incident occurred. In the past, when he was in Kunming, Chinese and American security personnel, fearing that unexpected incidents would occur, strengthened outdoor security and often secretly investigated nearby residents to prevent criminals from mixing in.

General Chennault is 56 years old this year and has been engaged in aviation work for more than 20 years. He came to China in 1937 and his hearing is not good due to too much flying. He is kind and sympathetic. The General never bombed the commercial and residential areas of Shanghai and Peiping with his air force. According to his old translator, he believes that Peiping is the essence of China and should be preserved as much as possible. Shanghai has too many people, and the result of bombing is inevitably inhumane.

Special Commentary

### Releasing Concerns for Foreign Companies

— Sun Jiulu

Since the imminent victory of the War of Resistance, the relationship between our country and the United States has grown increasingly close. American officials and the public have not only provided military assistance to our struggle for final victory but have also declared their intention to assist us in completing post-war reconstruction economically. Consequently, the government decided on the first phase of economic construction principles in November of the year before last, announcing to both domestic and foreign parties that the operation of our country's economic construction endeavors must adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. This requires a planned implementation to gradually achieve the Three Principles of the People's economic system through the development of a planned free economy. Regarding operational methods, we should encourage private enterprises as much as possible without violating the principle of capital control. As for the utilization of foreign capital, it can be accepted based on the spirit of equal and mutually beneficial international economic cooperation, provided that it does not hinder sovereignty or the implementation of plans. The goal is to stimulate the development of economic enterprises through entrepreneurial freedom and complete the construction plan.

Based on these first-phase economic construction principles, many current commercial laws are no longer entirely applicable. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan began to research and revise them last year, starting with the Company Law, which serves as the basis for organizing all economic enterprises. Our Company Law, promulgated on December 26th, 1929, has been in effect for over fourteen years. Its content is based on European continental legal principles, adopting interventionism and strict controls, unlike American law, which takes a liberal approach to companies. In this era of international economic cooperation, it is naturally outdated. Furthermore, to encourage the concentration of national capital in production and to broaden the convenience of obtaining foreign capital for cooperation, it is necessary to lean slightly towards liberalism. In addition, the abolition of unequal treaties, the equal treatment of Chinese and foreign enterprises, and the equal treatment of government and private capital are all the main themes of this revision of the Company Law.

The Company Law has been revised five times during the process, which can be considered very careful. All opinions have been adopted under the principles of safeguarding our national sovereignty, developing our industry and commerce, and facilitating Chinese and foreign economic cooperation. It took five months to complete. Although it has not yet been promulgated by the government, both domestic and foreign parties have already grasped the general outline of the version passed by the Legislative Yuan in its third reading. However, some foreign business circles have expressed concerns about the requirement that foreign companies must establish and register in their home countries before they can establish branches in China. I would like to address these concerns for insightful friends from friendly nations.

Some believe that such a provision may hinder the investment and commercial development of friendly nations. It is true that American company law adopts liberalism, unlike our country's strict control over companies, but it provides greater legal convenience and tax reductions for companies operating in China. It should be noted that this is actually under the special protection of the "China Trade Act" promulgated in 1922. This act not only stipulates that companies operating in China do not need to have operations in their home countries but also simultaneously amends the tax laws, granting such companies operating in China all preferential rights. However, if they simultaneously conduct business in their home countries, they cannot enjoy this privilege. This act provided American merchants in China with significant benefits, allowing them to compete with merchants from other countries under the preferential conditions of tax reductions and exemptions. They were also protected by the consular jurisdiction at the time and were not subject to the jurisdiction of the Chinese government, making it impossible for Chinese industry and commerce to compete with them. As a result, those operating in China with strong financial resources undoubtedly reaped huge profits under the protection of this privilege. Even a few speculators with empty resources took advantage of this privilege to loot and leave. The incidents of the American-Feng Bank and the American-Feng Trust Company are the most prominent examples of this. All these facts have become historical relics. After the conclusion of equal new treaties between China and various countries, various laws are being revised to welcome foreign investment, in line with the spirit of equal opportunities and mutually beneficial cooperation in economics. Especially under the call of economic democracy by the great American President Roosevelt, insightful friends from our friendly nations should not stubbornly adhere to their traditional concepts of privilege and harbor doubts.

Some may say that such regulations will affect some foreign enterprises already existing in China. Please allow me to explain further. International trade begins with the exchange of goods. If country A transports and sells manufactured goods to country B, or country A needs to purchase certain manufacturing raw materials from country B, then companies in country A engaged in such businesses must request permission from country B to establish branches. There is no reason for them to have no business in their home country A but to operate such businesses out of thin air in country B. Therefore, any foreign company that already has operations in its home country can request permission from our government to establish branches in China. Moreover, according to international private law, the internal affairs of such companies can be handled according to their home country's laws. Those who have no business in their home country and only operate in China, except for individuals or commercial firms, can, of course, organize a company according to the Chinese Company Law. The revised Company Law does not restrict the nationality of any company's shareholders, nor does it specify the proportion of Chinese and foreign investment. Even if foreign capital accounts for 99%, it is still permissible. Since the shareholders of a company can be of any nationality, the equal treatment of Chinese and foreign capital is self-evident. Even when government capital is used as company capital, its rights and obligations are exactly the same as those of other shareholders. Secondly, except for the chairman of a limited liability company or a joint-stock company, or the director representing the company, who must be of Chinese nationality, any important positions within the company can be held by foreigners. As for the provision that half or more than half of the shareholders of an unlimited liability company or a limited liability company, and the directors of a joint-stock company, must have a domicile in the country, this is actually for the sake of sound company management, not to force any shareholder to have a domicile in the country. The Company Law has provided so much convenience for Chinese-foreign joint ventures to organize companies, so why can't foreign companies that have no business in their home country but only operate in China reorganize according to the revised Company Law? Let me give an example: The business of a news agency involves receiving and sending telegrams between two countries, which is international in nature. Any foreign news agency wishing to establish a branch in China naturally meets the conditions for a foreign company. If it independently establishes a newspaper office in China, it is reasonable to organize a Chinese company to operate according to the revised Company Law. For other industries such as banking and insurance, if they have operations in their home country and establish branches in our country, there is no question that they meet the conditions for a foreign company. If they have no business in their home country and operate solely in China, then based on the principle of equality and reciprocity, the Chinese government cannot allow them to absorb low-interest funds from our society without any supervision. They should be subject to the same treatment and management as Chinese banks and insurance companies, without a doubt.

Furthermore, in the past, many of our country's companies and firms would register in foreign countries without having operations there, and then enjoy foreign privileges to operate in China to evade the control of the Chinese government. This was called "hanging a foreign flag." There were countless companies and firms in major commercial ports relying on the protection of foreign privileges. The reasonable restrictions on foreign companies in the revised Company Law are precisely to crack down on Chinese people borrowing names and using foreign privileges to evade the management of the Chinese government. No country wants its citizens to evade legal and tax obligations, and this is no different for the Chinese government. Although Chinese people can also organize companies in foreign countries and then operate in China, if there are no special and superior conditions, then why bother doing so?

In short, the legislation of a country has its own objective environment as its basis. Even with the Company Law, the forty-eight states in the United States each have their differences. China, after the conclusion of equal new treaties, is in a time when Chinese-foreign economic cooperation is needed. We only seek equal opportunities for the development of our fragile industry and commerce. We sincerely accept all foreign investment to help us develop and build, without any intention of restricting it or treating it unequally from domestic capital. The provision in the revised Company Law that foreign companies must have operations in their home countries is merely to eliminate the vestiges of privileges from the era of unequal treaties and to restrict the erroneous concept of Chinese people borrowing names to evade legal and tax obligations. If foreign industries and businesses operating in our country do not have operations in their home countries, then unless it is for the sake of maintaining their traditional enjoyment of privileges, why not organize Chinese companies according to our revised Company Law? Moreover, our foreign-related legislation treats all friendly nations equally and cannot be designed solely for any one country. If any foreign industry and business operates in our country with a special and superior position, then our industries and businesses, which are weak in all conditions, will inevitably find it difficult to gain a foothold. This would be contrary to the original intention of equal opportunities and mutually beneficial cooperation in international economics, and even more so, it would deviate greatly from the economic democracy of the late American President Roosevelt.

Chennault, the Flying Tiger General, Reputed After Eight Years in China

### Signing Autographs and Collecting Funds, Donating to Homeland Relief Association

During General Chen's seven years in Kunming, many Chinese and foreigners asked him for autographs. The General had a set price for autographs, which was one US dollar per signature. A designated person was responsible for collecting and registering these funds. After the end of the month, a portion was sent to the United States to donate to wartime relief associations, and a portion was handed over to his old translator, Colonel Shu Boyan, who exchanged it for legal tender at the black market exchange rate of US dollars. The Central Bank of Kunming then remitted it to Chongqing free of charge to donate to our country's wartime children's welfare association. It is said that this income amounted to more than one hundred US dollars per month.

During his command in Kunming, the General created a new tactic, which was to use "two planes linked wings" for combat, which proved very effective. People in the American Air Force called it "Chennault's Pursuit Tactics 1" and he was also known as a "pursuit tactics expert." At the same time, the General was also experienced and interested in civil aviation. Therefore, in his several public speeches after returning to China, he particularly emphasized the development of China's civil aviation. He said: "In the future, civil aircraft should be as convenient and cheap as trains. China has transportation difficulties and should pay more attention to this. He is willing to do his best to assist China in carrying out this work."

"The Chinese Air Force has grown from infancy to maturity, and has been able to fight bravely and gradually build itself up, thanks in no small part to General Chen's assistance." (Words of Dean Long Yun) The people of Kunming have been with General Chen for seven years and know him well. Every holiday, they must express their condolences and respect to the General. General Chen once said: "I love China, especially Kunming." Perhaps one of the reasons is here.

### Startling News

Half a month before Japan announced its surrender, startling news flew into China from beyond the Hump. On the afternoon of July 14th, 1945, the newly appointed Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces in the China Theater, Lieutenant General Stratemeyer, suddenly issued a statement at headquarters in Calcutta stating: "Due to the decision of Lieutenant General Chennault to retire, the U.S. Army Air Forces will lose an outstanding officer." The next day, General Chen announced in Kunming that he had requested Lieutenant General Wedemeyer to resign from his current active duty and prepare to retire from the U.S. Army. On the 16th, General Wedemeyer made a statement in Chongqing, first saying: "I accept General Chennault's request for resignation and express my deep regret." Finally, he said: "I would like to represent all American officers and soldiers in the China Theater in wishing him a safe and happy future."

After the news spread, his achievements were highly praised and regret was expressed for his resignation. The Yunnan Provincial Provisional Council first sent a letter of condolence and retention on July 16th, followed by the Kunming Chamber of Commerce. The Chongqing Political Participation Council also expressed the same sentiment on the 19th. However, the results were all in vain. On the afternoon of the 20th, General Chen held his last press conference in Kunming, first expressing his deep gratitude for the condolences and retentions from all walks of life. He then said that after this retirement, he would take his beloved dog and return home to live in seclusion.

### Farewell Gathering, The General Flies Away with Honors

On the evening of the 26th, the Yunnan local community held a farewell gathering at the provincial party headquarters to bid farewell to General Chen. More than 300 people attended, including Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin and Deputy Dean Zhou Wei-Yue. Although there was no dance party that night, there were old dramas such as "Eight Righteous Men" and "Water Floods Seven Armies" to add to the fun. On the evening of the 27th, the officers and soldiers of the Fourteenth Air Force Headquarters held a farewell party. General Chen held his last medal ceremony at the meeting, awarding medals of merit to three officers of the team. On July 28th, the General flew to Chongqing. Chairman Chiang immediately held a medal ceremony at 8 pm on the 30th, personally pinning the Blue Sky and White Sun Medal, our country's highest honor, on General Chen's left lapel. At 8 pm on August 2nd, 102 units from various agencies and groups in the capital held a grand farewell meeting for General Chen in the New Transport Model Area Plaza. Tens of thousands of people inside and outside the venue watched. Ms. Zhang Ai-Zhen, representing all circles in the capital, presented a specially made gift, including a couplet personally written by Dean Yu, which read: "Fighting for Freedom" and "Returning with Honors."

On August 3rd, Chen flew to Xi'an to visit the Northwest Air Force Base and say goodbye to the American Air Force soldiers. The next day, he flew to Chengdu, where Chairman Zhang Qun hosted a banquet at the Lishi Society and presented a silver tripod. Director Deng also presented a very valuable ancient porcelain teapot. On August 6th, the General flew from Chengdu to Kunming, and left Kunming on the morning of the 8th to return to the United States.

"China's Lafayette" revisited Kunming for two weeks and left Kunming on February 1st. The people of Kunming hope this is "goodbye" and not "fearful parting." Kunming, with a climate similar to Hollywood, is where the General indulged in hunting in his spare time. (Sent from Kunming on March 1st)

### Magnetic Mines, How to Sweep Them, Behind the Scenes of the War Stage

— Written by Dr. Goodhew of the British Admiralty, Translated by the Translation Office of this newspaper

In his introduction to "Sweeping Magnetic Mines" (see the newspaper on the 1st of this month), Dr. Goodhew of the British Admiralty said: "The most prominent in technical warfare, a fierce battle, is the victory in radio, therefore, scientists and technicians must work behind the scenes of the war stage." This is a continuation of the previous article for readers' reference. (Editor)

German scientists have made many improvements on the old design. One method is to plan a clever clock that automatically measures on the spring and determines a force for placing the mine, a force necessary for the magnetic attraction force on the steel rod within the latitude line.

On that famous night of November 24, 1939, the analysis of the first German magnetic mine began. This analysis not only exposed its mechanical movement but also identified its technically correct outline: that is, the range of magnetic attraction needed to deploy the mine, and the duration of its effectiveness. If these steps could not be found, it would be very difficult to study countermeasures. That night, technical warriors all participated in the analysis.

After the entire story of this technical war was published, many plans were adopted and implemented. Many kinds were tested, they tied flounders to iron rods, airplanes tied with huge wire loops, and so on, in various ways. The first exploded mine caused extreme impulses. All methods, like a race, were repeatedly tested. Finally, a countermeasure was discovered, and the result of its application made the threat range of the mines much smaller than at the beginning of the war.

This sweeping method uses two minesweepers at the same time, each with a long tail of self-floating seabed electric wire trailing from the stern, and the current is emitted from inside the ship, temporarily stored in the battery. This current passes through the submarine cable at the stern like a surging wave. The current passes through the electrodes and enters the sea water, and in this way, all magnetic mines under the sea of more than ten acres will explode. Two minesweepers advanced in parallel lines, continuing to deploy its second sweeping circle, and under such sweeping methods, the clearing line continued to extend, and a safe route was finally opened up in the English Channel.

On a cold winter night at the end of December 1939, two ships, each loaded with car batteries, dragging those "python"-like sweepers, sailed from the port of Heiness and began the first comprehensive planned test. This test confirmed the scientists' accurate calculations of the magnetic attraction range of the current entering the seabed.

That night, the British Admiralty issued an order to apply this great plan for one last improvement, while equipping ships and training personnel, these steps were all materials used in tests taken in advance before the anticipated success, and later replaced with self-floating submarine electric cables, designed and manufactured by Britain's two largest electric cable manufacturers.

### Company Registration in Recovered Areas, Regulations Have Been Stipulated, Enemy and Puppet Shares Should Be Reported for Confiscation, Increase Capital with Puppet Currency Converted into Legal Tender, Those Who Fail to Comply Will Be Dissolved and Liquidated

The "Measures for Handling Company Registration in Recovered Areas" approved by the Executive Yuan have attracted considerable attention from the industrial and commercial circles in this city. The following are the main points:

Registration Method

(1) All types of companies in the recovered areas whose headquarters were once occupied shall submit their licenses and register with the economic authorities. (2) Licenses submitted that were issued by legitimate agencies in the past shall remain valid. After being stamped with a blue verification mark, they will be returned. If the licenses bear any annotations by the enemy or puppets, they shall be surrendered for replacement. (3) Licenses issued by puppet agencies shall be destroyed. Those who were previously registered and whose registration was altered by the enemy or puppets shall re-register the changes. Those who registered with the enemy or puppets shall re-register the establishment. (4) Joint-stock limited and joint-stock unlimited liability companies that need to re-register the changes shall convene a shareholders' meeting before June of this year to resolve to ratify the changed registration matters and resolve all relevant issues during the occupation period. Enemy and puppet shares shall be reported for confiscation, and enemy and puppet personnel shall not be allowed to attend.

Capital Conversion

(5) If the company's capital has increased compared to the original registration, the originally registered capital shall still be listed at the original legal tender amount. Those that have been converted to puppet currency shall be restored to legal tender. Capital increased after the original registration, if calculated in legal tender, shall remain the same. If it is puppet currency, it shall be converted to legal tender at the statutory ratio. The property purchased after the capital increase shall be priced according to the proportion of legal tender and calculated based on the old and new shares. The share obtained by the new shares shall be the shares of the new shareholders, and the remainder shall be used as a reserve fund. (6) After the reorganization of the new and old shares, if the originally registered capital has a deficit, it shall be supplemented to the original capital amount or a resolution to reduce the capital shall be made. (7) After the reorganization of the new and old shares, if the new shares are more than twice as much as the old shares, the old shareholders must still occupy two-fifths of the seats on the board of directors and supervisors. (8) Unlimited liability companies and limited liability companies shall handle the change of registration in accordance with the above methods. However, when convening a shareholders' meeting, an unlimited liability company must have three-quarters of the shareholders present, and a limited liability company must have three-quarters of the unlimited liability shareholders and more than half of the limited liability shareholders present to be valid. (9) Those who do not submit their licenses for verification or do not re-register the changes in accordance with the regulations, the changed matters will not be recognized. (10) Companies that need to re-register the establishment, in the case of joint-stock limited and joint-stock unlimited liability companies, shall convene a shareholders' meeting before June of this year as an inaugural meeting, pass the articles of association, elect directors and supervisors, and the directors and supervisors shall investigate the share payments and handle the establishment registration in accordance with the law. (11) All shares shall be calculated in legal tender. If they are paid in puppet currency, in addition to converting them into legal tender in accordance with the regulations, the property valuation provisions of these measures shall also be applied. (12) Unlimited liability companies and limited liability companies shall convene a meeting of capital-contributing shareholders before June of this year, re-establish the articles of association, and handle the establishment registration in accordance with the previous procedures.

Dissolution and Liquidation

(13) Those who do not submit their licenses for verification or re-register the establishment in accordance with the regulations shall be dissolved and liquidated. (14) Companies that were forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets, or cooperated with the enemy and puppets, or were managed and operated by the enemy and puppets shall be dealt with in accordance with the measures for dealing with enemy and puppet properties. If their shareholders have moved to the rear or can prove that they have not cooperated with the enemy and puppets, they shall still be allowed to exercise their shareholder rights. (15) Companies established in the recovered areas that have been registered to move to the rear during the occupation period shall convene a shareholders' meeting before June of this year to resolve internal issues and change matters, and shall also handle the change of registration. (16) Companies established in the recovered areas that have suspended business or withdrawn shares during the occupation period but have not yet been approved for dissolution shall be registered by the legal directors and supervisors after reorganizing the original shares. If they no longer operate, they shall apply for dissolution and surrender the original license.

### Citywide Household Registration Check Begins on the 16th

The organization of the baojia in this city has been completed in most sections after sectional compilation and inspection. According to the original plan, after the completion of the baojia organization, the household registration check will be continued. It is now learned that the preparatory work has been largely completed, and it has been decided that the household registration check will be started uniformly throughout the city on the 16th and completed on the 20th. At that time, the baojia chiefs in each district will stipulate the dates and times of the door-to-door investigation and notify each household, so that someone can wait at home to be checked and reported. In order to make it easier for citizens to identify them, all investigators will wear symbols or badges to prevent confusion and show prudence. It is expected that all the work, including the registration of citizens, can be completed by the beginning of March.

### High Court Continues Trial of Traitor; Gan Deyun's Sentence Undecided

The case of Jiang Yougen, the traitor, along with Zuo Ming and Shen An, has been investigated multiple times. Yesterday morning, the High Court summoned witnesses again for a final investigation. During the War of Resistance, Jiang Yougen recruited 185 laborers for the Japanese San-kyu Company to build and repair ships for the enemy navy in the Philippines. According to workers who escaped and returned, "Jiang Yougen was not in charge of the recruitment." Witness Heitian Dingzao stated, "Upon the order of the Japanese Navy Department, I recruited workers and entrusted Jiang Yougen to handle it, paying him 10,000 yuan as remuneration." However, Jiang Yougen completely denied this. At this point, the court declared the investigation closed and will convene a meeting to adjudicate the case.

### Ten Years of Wrongful Imprisonment; Yang Wendao to be Released on Bail Today

[Our Report] Yang Wendao, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, who suffered ten years of wrongful imprisonment due to the case of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, will walk out of the iron gates of Shanghai's Tilanqiao Prison safely this afternoon. Tang Huaiqun, Yang's pro bono lawyer, told reporters last night with extreme excitement that the Shanghai Prison had telephoned him, stating that the High Court had ruled that Yang Wendao could be released on bail for one million yuan in cash, but the ruling document would only be delivered this morning. Yang's son, Hanxiao, said he would find someone to post bail overnight so he could rush to Tilanqiao this morning to welcome his father. According to Yang Wendao, he told reporters in prison that after the victory, the prison authorities had specially allowed him to go out for a walk around the prison walls for a week, which was the first time in ten years that he had been allowed to breathe fresh air outside the prison. This afternoon, Yang Wendao will not only be reunited with his youngest son and grandson, whom he has never met, and his family, but will also see Shanghai for the first time after the Japanese surrendered.

Zhang Bingheng

Zhang Bingheng and his nephew, Zhang Yizhi, who ran the Yantai Copper-Tin Shop at 376 Huajing Road, were arrested on suspicion of buying copper coins for the enemy. Judge Liu simultaneously summoned witnesses Chen Chuantai and Zhou Guijun. However, they both answered "I don't know" to all questions. The court adjourned the trial for another day.

Gan Deyun

The trial of Gan Deyun, a Guangdong native (originally a British citizen named Gan Wei), began at 2 p.m. Gan once practiced law in Shanghai. During the War of Resistance, he joined a puppet organization and served as a member of the puppet Legislative Yuan. He was reported and arrested. The High Court has concluded the trial. The sentence was originally scheduled to be pronounced yesterday afternoon, but Gan's lawyers, Tang Huaiqun and Qin Shouzhang, argued that Gan was originally British, although he had joined the Chinese nationality, he had not obtained a naturalization certificate from the Ministry of Interior, so he could not be considered a Chinese citizen. Therefore, the crime of resisting his "own country" could not be established. They submitted a petition to the High Court requesting a dismissal. After the debate concluded, the case was scheduled for sentencing yesterday afternoon. Judge Cao Jun opened the court alone to announce the dismissal of the debate and scheduled a reopening of the debate. Defendant Gan Deyun requested bail. The court ruled to wait for a written application for further consideration.

Dong Jinfu

The case of Dong Yufu, a major secretary of the puppet 37th Army, accused of being a traitor, was also scheduled for judgment yesterday afternoon. Judge Cao temporarily announced a dismissal, ending the debate and scheduling a reopening of the joint court debate. Judge Cao then summoned Zou Zhigao, a technical official of the puppet Ministry of Justice Administration, and Wang Peisheng, a self-defense force instructor from the puppet Jinshan County. Both cases were adjourned for further trials.

### "Hai Xiang" Ship Received Yesterday

The China Merchants Bureau's sixth victory ship, renamed the "Hai Xiang," Captain Zhu Shaogang, was ordered yesterday morning to lead all crew members to receive it. All procedures and flag-changing, etc., were simple ceremonies and were completed by noon. The "Hai Zhong" Liberty ship is scheduled to be received today. This ship is the first Liberty ship to be handed over. The American ship "Huisi Fulakeshi," renamed "Hai Kang," has Captain Guan Pengling appointed, and will be received on the 16th.

### Production Quantity of All Yarn Factories Under China Textile Corporation Gradually Increases; Expansion to 500,000 Spindles Within One Month

The twelve enemy yarn factories successively taken over by the China Textile Construction Corporation, namely Neiwai, Toyota, Nichiho, Shanghai, etc., initially had a total of just over 250,000 spindles open. Currently, production has exceeded 370,000 spindles and is expected to expand to around 500,000 spindles within one month. If transportation in cotton-producing areas in the Northwest and Henan is smooth, and there are no concerns about the supply of raw materials from home and abroad after the foreign exchange rate is announced, then production will be even greater. Currently, the factories can produce an average of 300 bales of yarn and 8,000 bolts of cloth per day.

Received Yarn and Cloth to be Sold at Low Prices Soon

The Enemy and Puppet Industry Review Council met yesterday morning. It was reported that the processing bureau received a large quantity of yarn and cloth stored by the puppet Sino-Japanese Trade Federation, and will sell a portion of it to the market at a low price. A large batch of Qingdao peanut oil arrived the other day and will also be sold by the bureau at a low price. It is also reported that three batches of tobacco leaves stored in Qingdao have arrived one after another, and will be supplied to all cigarette factories, which may have a positive impact on cigarette prices in the future.

### Technical Association Formed to Study Reasons for Telephone Disruptions

Due to the lack of expansion of telephone exchanges in the city, citizens cannot install telephones, and those who have telephones often feel that calls are not smooth. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities consulted with the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company, and each dispatched two senior technicians to form the Shanghai Municipal Telephone System Technical Committee. It is expected that a practical solution will be submitted to the relevant agencies for adoption by the end of May this year.

### Agricultural Relief Funds Total Two Billion Yuan

The Administrative Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration places primary emphasis on agricultural relief in its work this spring. It is reported that the Administration has instructed the eight sub-administrations in Su Ning, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, and Guangxi to proceed first, and has approved that each sub-administration should allocate at least 40% of its February-April budget for agricultural relief. The monthly budget of each sub-administration is at least 20 million yuan and at most 50 million yuan. In total, the special funds for agricultural relief work for the eight sub-administrations should be at least 2 billion yuan or more. The funds are intended to purchase seeds and fertilizers nearby and distribute them free of charge to poor farmers in heavily affected areas. The areas will be jointly reviewed and implemented by the agricultural technicians of each sub-administration and the representatives of the Joint Relief Association. It is reported that the Joint Relief Association may ship 1,500 tons of small hand-held agricultural tools for free distribution in March.

### Trade Association Elects Directors and Supervisors

The Book Trade Association has been reorganized. A general meeting of members was convened, and fifteen people, including Fan Xiren, were elected as directors, and seven people, including Zhang Chuanru, were elected as supervisors. The entire board of directors and supervisors were sworn in yesterday, and Ye Suzhou, Li Bojia, Yao Wei, Xu Boxin, and Zhang Yiqu were elected as standing directors. Li Bojia was elected as chairman of the board.

### US Military Continues Trial of Japanese War Criminals; Four Witnesses Testify; Lawyers for Plaintiff and Defendant Repeatedly Debate

[Our Report] The US Military War Crimes Tribunal, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, held its fifth trial of the eighteen Japanese war criminals who killed three American airmen in Hankou. Lieutenant Colonel Weisituo, representing the plaintiff, first cited witness Zhang Jiayuan to answer all questions.

Burning Bodies and Throwing Ashes into the Water

Zhang was originally the administrator of the crematorium of the Japanese Civil Regiment in Hankou, responsible for miscellaneous tasks. On December 16, 1944, he saw Japanese military police escort three American soldiers to the crematorium in a car. They were tied up. After the three were taken away, he noticed bloodstains on the ground. The Japanese military police also instructed him to light two cremation furnaces. The next morning, Japanese soldiers told him that "what was burned in the two furnaces was bad stuff" and ordered him to throw it into the water. Song Wenjin helped him shovel out the ashes and noticed that the ashes in furnace number one were more than those in furnace number two. The two then buried the ashes in the west garden, marking them. No one else knew. After the victory, when the US military authorities came to investigate, he informed them. Lieutenant Beici of the US Missing Persons Investigation Committee was also called to present the belt buckles, fingernails, and other documents left behind by the three American airmen as evidence.

Witnessed Various Crimes of Japanese Soldiers

The plaintiff's lawyer then called Song Wenjin as a witness again, describing how he accompanied US military authorities last autumn to point out the location where the ashes were buried and helped to move them out. He also proved that he was in the photographic photos presented by the plaintiff's lawyer at the time. He also testified about the experience of Zong Feiing, totaling seven pages, and personally saw Kato Takumi sign. After the questioning, Luo Jingwen, who used to work underground in Hankou and is now a detective in the Hankou Currency Inspection Bureau, was called as a witness. Luo described in detail how he witnessed Japanese military police parading three American soldiers on the streets of Hankou and being severely beaten by Japanese soldiers. One of the American soldiers was injured in the nose and covered in blood.

Unintentionally Confessed; Loud Laughter

He also pointed out that Japanese Sergeant Fujii Junichi, Sergeant Takeuchi Yoshiyuki, and Sergeant Tsukada Takayoshi were present in the courtyard at that time. The next witness was Kida Saburo, a police officer from the Japanese Consulate in Hankou, responsible for intelligence work. He also described the parade of the three British soldiers and said that he had seen Takeuchi Yoshiyuki beat the three. The plaintiff's lawyer ordered him to point out if there was anyone among the eighteen war criminals. When Kida was about to point, Takeuchi stood up first, causing loud laughter in the courtyard. The defendant's lawyer was helpless.

Rehearing to Be Held This Morning

Lieutenant Colonel Zhang then asked Major Mona Jia to prove that his investigation found that the organizational chart of the Japanese Sixth Army included the names of the responsible personnel of the 34th Army, which were several of the eighteen war criminals. Next, Lieutenant Colonel Endo, the liaison officer of the Japanese 34th Army, was called as a witness, saying that on December 15, 1944, he was informed by Kato Takumi that a parade would be held, and later heard that three American airmen had been killed. The trial reached 5:00 p.m. The court announced that the rehearing would continue at 9:00 a.m. today. The hearing was held from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. yesterday, and began at 2:00 p.m. When the plaintiff's lawyer questioned the witnesses, the defendant's lawyers, Lieutenant Colonel Hakins and Major Li Wen, repeatedly and vehemently criticized and rebutted. The court only listened to the complaints in the initial trial and reserved all documents.

### Agreement Reached on All Key Points; Electricity Workers' Strike Resolved; Mediation Records to be Signed Today

The city's electricity workers' strike has been deadlocked for a long time. Yesterday, Director Wu presided over the mediation again, and from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., a full resolution was reached. Regarding the dismissed employees, Feng and Qu, the employer agreed to reinstate them, but only for three months, and the continuation of their employment would be determined based on their performance. Regarding dismissal matters, the employer agreed to notify the employees and the union as requested by the workers, and to suspend work during the union's investigation. Wages would be paid as usual during the strike. The workers will not be allowed to strike or go on strike in the future. The employer will fulfill all items in writing. The mediation records are scheduled to be signed today.

French Water and Electricity

All employees of the French Water and Electricity Company previously made nine requests to the employer. In addition to the annual bonus, which has been resolved, the Social Bureau continued negotiations yesterday. As a result, the employer expressed acceptance of the various requests made by the workers, such as adjusting basic salaries and allowances, and also agreed to give priority to the reinstatement of former employees. A satisfactory resolution was reached.

Hongzhang Dyeing Factory

More than 700 workers at the Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Factory at 381 Huaian Road submitted sixteen conditions on the afternoon of the 9th to improve their treatment. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Social Bureau went to mediate together, and a resolution was reached at 3:00 a.m. on the 12th.

Barge Workers

The Zhejiang Reclamation Company received more than 110 wooden barges, with nearly 1,000 barge workers. Due to rising prices, they requested that their wages be calculated based on the cost of living index. The Social Bureau sent personnel to mediate, and a resolution is likely to be reached.

Cooked Goods Employees

The cooked goods industry in the city was in dispute because employees requested improved treatment and the issuance of annual bonuses, but the employer refused and dismissed workers. Yesterday, they petitioned the Party and government agencies.

### The Entire Pujiang Wharf; the Public Works Bureau is Actively Promoting

The Structural Department of the Municipal Public Works Bureau is now actively repairing the city's bridges and wharves, and the dredging of other rivers and the construction of embankments are also carefully planned and promoted step by step. It is reported that regarding the wharves, the bureau has completed repairs to the Bund numbers 3, 5, 7, 12, 13, and 15, etc. The observatory wharf near the Bund of Zhongzheng Road is currently repairing the dry bridge seat. The wharves in the Nanshi area that have been repaired include numbers 4 to 8.

### Construction of Low-Income Housing; Completion Limited to One Month

The Municipal Public Works Bureau commissioned the construction of low-income housing and the Tangjiawan market at the end of last month. More than 20 manufacturers responded. The results were announced yesterday. The bureau approved three companies and submitted them to the municipal government for approval. They will respectively undertake the construction of the Tangjiawan market and the low-income housing on Pushan Road, Xietu Road, and Qimei Road. It is also reported that, in addition to the low-income housing on Pushan Road, which must be completed within 75 days, the completion of other places is limited to one month.

### Silk Factory Robbed; Many Packages of Factory Silk Stolen

[Our Report] At around 9:00 p.m. last night, six bandits suddenly arrived at the Qiwenci Silk Factory at 58 Rongchang Lane, Dongyuhang Road, in the jurisdiction of the Tilanqiao Branch of the Hongkou Police Department. They drew guns and threatened the workers. As a result, 19 packages of factory silk were robbed and taken away. When three bandits shouldered twelve packages of factory silk and passed Baoding Road, they were spotted by officers of the Second Platoon of the Second Brigade of the Security Team and the patrol team of the Tilanqiao Branch. They were ordered to stop and interrogated about the source of the goods. The bandits stammered, and were taken back to the branch. The owner of the Qiwenci Silk Factory reported the robbery. The stolen goods were identified. The three bandits confessed their names as Xu Yongzu, Wang Xiaoquan, and Li Changbing. Three accomplices are still at large with seven packages of silk. The branch is currently pursuing them.

### Zheng Xigu Publishes Opinions on Shanghai Middle School Restoration Plan

[Our city dispatch] Zheng Xigu, Principal of Provincial Shanghai Middle School, recently published the following opinions on the planning of the Shanghai Middle School restoration: Provincial Shanghai Middle School was established in 1927 through the reorganization of Jiangsu Provincial Commercial College and Provincial Second Normal School. The school was originally located in the Nanshi district of Shanghai and moved to Caohejing in the southern suburbs of Shanghai in 1934, where new school buildings were constructed. All buildings and facilities were gradually completed according to the latest standards. Libraries, science museums, gymnasiums, and other facilities were fully equipped. Student internship sites included banks, cooperatives, farms, and mechanical factories. The total school area was over 500 mu, with over 2,000 students. Over 90% of graduates in each class were admitted to science and engineering departments of national universities, making it one of the most complete middle schools in the country. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, it was first destroyed by the enemy, with over half of the school buildings damaged and the internal facilities completely gone. The magnificent buildings have become ruins, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is urgent to restore the old appearance. However, the repair of houses and the addition of equipment will cost more than 80 million yuan. At this time when recovery has just begun and resources are difficult to obtain, it is not easy to raise this huge amount of money at once. It has been decided to temporarily make do and make slight repairs in order to勉能start classes and lessons. This alone requires 170 million yuan. This time Tonghe returned to Shanghai specifically to raise funds for the restoration of the school, so that it can return to normal as soon as possible. In addition to applying to the government for funding, he is currently in consultation with various parties, intending to raise donations from the public and students' parents to provide support.

### Between Men and Women

— Xie Dongping

The greatest difference between men and women, of course, is that one is male and the other is female. This includes physiological differences and certain psychological differences arising from physiological differences, but I believe that this should be the only difference.

Historical artificiality and factual ruthlessness often lead people in society to hold preconceptions and prejudices about men and women, as if there were natural differences in ability, wisdom, and personality.

Humans live in a realistic cocoon. A person who neglects reality too much, occupying only time and losing space, is simply unable to live. But reality is ultimately sinful. A person who is overly realistic will only create sin.

I believe that the person with the deepest prejudice against men and women is the "sage" Confucius. His famous saying, "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," has been recited by all men for generations and is the greatest basis for all men to take a contemptuous attitude towards women.

In fact, or perhaps it is true that "only women and petty men, though raised," but putting women and petty men together, and saying that women and petty men are equally difficult to deal with, is artificiality of male society. It is a sinful marker manifested before people have truly become self-aware. Confucius's famous saying, "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," is a conclusion based solely on the errors of reality.

Why can't women do the same things as men, do men's jobs? This is entirely a matter of system. Men have always confined women to the home, always treating women as playthings, for thousands, tens of thousands of years. Therefore, once some men want to invite women to come into society, not treat them as playthings, they think that those men are deliberately teasing her, demanding her, and abusing her.

One day, suddenly there is a big change in the world, and all the things that were originally done by men are handed over to women, and all the things that women do are called men to do (except for having children). After a hundred years, a thousand years, see if it will still be: "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with," I am afraid it will become: "Only men and petty men are difficult to deal with." From the question of men and women, to explore that people must truly become a person, they must overturn the case of history. Many other questions in society must also overturn the case of history to make them all reasonable.

If one wants to seek liberation, for people to talk about equality, then the first thing that should be thoroughly broken is the prejudice and preconceptions between men and women.

### Floating World

— Xu Jiatang

The two words "floating world" are not good, because they sound a bit detached from the world, making people feel that this world is floating in a kind of ethereal desert, and has the same short and vague feeling as duckweed.

Well, despite being not good, it still often appears in the writings of literary people, because it is beautiful, because it is poetic. The two words contain endless emotion, and no longer need to be modified, no longer need to be carved, it is an extremely beautiful phrase.

In Japan, I heard that there is a very famous kind of ukiyo-e, I have not seen it, so I dare not comment. In China, I have seen people write things like "The Sadness of the Floating World" and "Scattered Notes on the Floating World." The people who write this kind of article have very beautiful writing, and there is a little bit of faint sorrow in the light and indifferent. In fact, this is a different starting point. If there is no "floating world," then sorrow may become anger.

For example, let's say: we depict a poor teacher, receiving his meager salary for a month from the school's accounting department, silently walking out, feeling a little self-pity in his heart. On the way, he hears a student say: "Recently, Mr. × is not putting in the effort." He says this lightly. This is a bit of "the sadness of the floating world," but what good does it do? The poor teacher still silently takes that pitiful salary, teaching listlessly. For the person writing the article, it is inevitable that there is a bit of "the sadness of the floating world."

People are somewhat fond of playing with emotions! Anything that can bring him a little vastness, a little bit of slight sorrow, he will grab hard, commenting that it has a sense of beauty. Because it just lets his tears turn in his eyes, without flowing down, without wailing. As for what role these tears play? He does not think about it, nor need he think about it. This way, he is somewhat fond of the two words "floating world." But he loves it too passively, without turning to look at the back. On the back there is a mirror. Looking at the back, you see: you complain that this world is too ethereal, too short, but in fact, in these light tears, you have already wasted the shortness of this floating world.

If we have lived on barren soil, and if we really like the two beautiful words "floating world," we can describe the extremely beautiful "sadness of the floating world" in the three words "household rice." However, it is somewhat too detached from reality. We have to anticipate what is behind the three words "household rice." There is also a mirror there: it is the anger of being a slave.

Gentlemen who pay attention to aesthetics all like this, willing to search out a sense of joy in tragedy, saying that people are so cruel. I have a silly idea, thinking that these gentlemen are not only fond of playing with emotions, but mostly also a bit fond of playing with words, right?

I myself have such a narrow view. In fact, I don't feel ill will towards the gentlemen who write things like "The Sadness of the Floating World" and "Scattered Notes on the Floating World." However, there is one opinion that I must express, feeling that life is too difficult now, paper is very expensive. These beautifully decorated words are not necessarily useless, but we have to wait until after the reign is peaceful before we talk about them. As for now, it seems that we are still in a chaotic world, the days are short, we must not waste ourselves and then waste others. So, floating world, etc…

We still have to wait a few days before we have the time to fill in lyrics.

### Ode to Purple

— Shi Jimei

I once loved the delicate red of the morning glow. In the beautiful childhood of the morning glow, therefore, to this day, there are still a few innocent and unforgettable old dreams hidden in that fragrant peach forest...

Later, I gradually came to like the quiet blue color. Blue skies and blue sea water were often praised by me. I even prayed that there would be a blue angel, applying some light and pale micro-blue to the green leaves and red flowers. I looked forward to there being a lovely blue kingdom in the absolutely beautiful world of nature.

I don't know when I suddenly felt the loveliness of purple, this beautiful and sad color, like a lyrical music boy, the setting sun at dusk, a Western oil painting covered with dust, a beautiful woman as gorgeous as peach blossoms and as cold as ice, constantly calling out "Better to Return" like a cuckoo.

The purple redbud tree, the purple lilac, the light purple radish flower… Golden dreams come true, but why doesn’t the almighty creator let every tulip flower also turn purple? I always feel that only purple is worthy of this flower with the name of a tulip.

If I had that magical magic ring from the "Arabian Nights," then just a never-fading, rich purple tulip would satisfy my current desire.

### Inscription on Painting of Oranges

Chen Zhongtao

The sleeves are completely without trace. Heavenly flowers fall and fly. Skillful in poetry, capable of being unrestrained. Understands the law, revealing profundity. The moon is missing, the sparse wutong is quiet. The transverse stars are cold, the pistil is plump. Stringed zither,　heart appreciation. Mountains and rivers are full of pure brilliance.

The four seas fill heavenly will. I hum and gaze at this cup. Holding a brush to pursue Chu's splendor. Stroking the event, feeling Qin's ashes. Double well country fragrance praise. Dong'a Luo fu talent. Night light can illuminate the ride. Throw into the dark or startle suspicion.

Happy feelings follow dreams shallow. Poetic mood enters spring and revives. Old swallows are like acquaintances. Secluded birds understand and call themselves. Good deviation from worldly affairs illusion. Dwelling in solitude, the guest's heart is lonely. Falling　intentions. Does the world understand?

### Double Flight (13)

— Zhao Qingge

Old Man Weng laughed again!

"Haha... a newborn baby invariably 'coos' for a while. Crying is that sound, laughing is that sound; singing is that sound, shouting is that sound; how can you determine that she is crying to you? Maybe she's smiling at you; singing to you; shouting to you!"

Old Man Weng's words left Old Man Mo speechless. He pondered for a while and felt that Old Man Weng's explanation made a lot of sense. So he turned his sorrow into joy and said with a smile:

"Indeed, you are smarter than I am! I couldn't figure it out this morning, and the more I thought about it, the more confused I became, simply unbearably annoyed. Now, after your explanation, I suddenly understand! However, I dreamed that the boat I was on was sunk by wind and waves, which is probably not very auspicious, right? And that inexplicable leaflet, the piece of reform theory on the leaflet—"

Although Old Man Mo got an answer to his question about the birds, he remembered the shipwreck and the words on the sudden leaflet, and he couldn't help but feel worried again.

Old Man Weng felt that the latter two problems were even less worthy of consideration. He said:

"You took a boat to a place upstream on the Yangtze River, which of course means returning to Jingzhou! But you stubbornly turned around and went downstream, your intention being to go to Beijing again. However, the imperial family in Beijing has been overthrown by reformers and revolutionaries, which is why we are in this state! So the wind and waves are a metaphor for the reformers, and the sunken boat is a metaphor for our present situation. Brother, I advise you to think it through! Don't keep dwelling on the past, dwelling on it too much will give you nightmares. We are old, why are we still dreaming?" Old Man Weng was also a little sad at the end. His meaning was double-edged. He was advising Old Man Mo not to dream anymore, which was also advising Old Man Mo not to have any more superfluous fantasies.

Old Man Weng's earnest advice aroused Old Man Mo's infinite sorrow. Old Man Mo understood Old Man Weng's meaning, so he drained a glass of wine and said melancholically:

"I haven't thought about anything for a long time, I only hope to close my eyes soon! Living to this state, it's better to die quickly!" As he said this, Old Man Mo's eyes were a little wet. If he hadn't been afraid of being laughed at by Old Man Weng, he really wanted to cry.

"Hehe!" Old Man Weng chuckled twice from his nose, then took a puff of his cigarette and said, "It's better to be alive than dead. I'm not as bookish as you are! In this day and age, you can't take things too seriously, just live one day at a time. Drink today's wine today, smoke today's cigarette today!"

How to Embark on the Path of Light Editor: We are all young people with occupations, but we feel that society is too dark. Please give us some guidance on how to embark on the path of light. Readers: Cai Yan, Wang Ying, Ding He, Zou Bin, Fan Qing, Gu Qiu, Same as above.

(Answer) Thank you all for your kindness in asking me to point out the path of light. This question is indeed too broad to be answered in a few words. I hope that you all will do your best in your respective roles, always with a kind heart, to persuade people to improve and encourage them to walk towards the bright road, seizing opportunities and doing your best. If everyone can persuade each other and strive for progress, in the long run, there will be results. If it is said that society is dark, everyone has a responsibility, and no one can be blamed. In other words, to lead people to the path of light, we must work together and catch up head-on. Do you all agree?

Examination for Government-Funded Students to Study in the UK and the US Having read your newspaper's special dispatch from Chongqing on the 8th, the Ministry of Education will hold an examination for government-funded students to study in the UK and the US in May, selecting approximately one thousand students. I would like to know the qualifications for this examination, the subjects to be tested, and the registration locations, etc. Please provide detailed information so that I may follow the instructions. Respectfully, Zhang Xingjian.

(Answer) The examination will be held in May, so the points you inquired about have not yet reached the announcement stage. Please pay attention to the education news in this newspaper in the future, and you will understand.

I used to live in Zhabei, but due to the outbreak of the war, I was forced to move. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and the land has been restored, I would very much like to move back. However, the house was occupied by others during the period of occupation. I don't know what procedures I can follow to achieve my goal. Hua Zhixian.

(Answer) You were forced to move during the war. You can negotiate to recover the house based on the original lease contract. Please apply to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee at the south end of the Sichuan Road Bridge.
