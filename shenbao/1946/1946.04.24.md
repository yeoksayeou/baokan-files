### Intensified Peace Talks: Marshall Calls on Chairman Chiang Yesterday; Also Meets with Zhou Enlai to Exchange Views

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] General Marshall met today with Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative on the Military Three-Person Committee, for two hours of "free exchange of views." Marshall then received General Xu Yongchang, who signed the Japanese surrender agreement on the USS Missouri in Tokyo, and subsequently met with Chairman Chiang. Marshall will meet with Chairman Chiang and Zhou Enlai again on the 24th, but officials have made no indication when he will convene a meeting of the Three-Person Committee. Reports say that the Military Three-Person Committee will reconvene once General Chen Cheng returns to Chongqing. It is understood that Marshall's discussions today largely concerned the matter of Communist representatives going to Nanjing. It is expected that Chairman Chiang, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai will go to Nanjing this weekend.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Special Envoy Marshall intensified "peace conference" efforts today, separately calling on Chairman Chiang and meeting with Zhou Enlai for talks. Marshall's aides did not disclose the progress of the talks. However, a Communist spokesman stated: "Mr. Ma and Mr. Zhou have frankly exchanged views." Observers believe that the lack of clarity in the explanation of the original ceasefire agreement between the Nationalists and Communists necessitates a new agreement, and only a clearly worded written agreement can satisfy both sides.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] A certain official of the National Government stated today: a compromise solution for the Northeast problem is possible. The method is for the government to hand over control of "certain parts," and the Communists to withdraw from Changchun, Harbin, and other large cities, so that National troops can move freely along the railway line between Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The Communist proposal is that the Communist forces should control the entire territory northeast of Changchun, ceding the southern part of the nine eastern provinces to the National Government.

Niu Xianming to Fly to Shenyang Tomorrow; To Discuss Dispatching Small Team to Changchun

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The newly taken over Northeast is now engulfed in artillery fire. The Northeast Executive Team, centered on American personnel, stumbles on the edge of the battlefield and runs into obstacles everywhere. The people of the Northeast, including those in North China, have a glimmer of hope for peace, namely when Marshall will arrive in the Northeast with his bag of tricks. Although the defense battle of the Changchun Security Team has ended, the Executive Headquarters still plans to send a Changchun team. This matter is currently being discussed by the three parties of the Shenyang Central Team. However, principal and technical issues have not yet been fully agreed upon. Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff representing the government in the Executive Headquarters, is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 25th to discuss the matter of dispatching an additional Changchun team and to convey the government's views.

[French News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The four teams of the newly dispatched Northeast branch of the Military Mediation Department are still at a standstill. Team 28 is currently en route between Kaiyuan and Siping. Team 29 is stranded in Fushun. Teams 27 and 30 remain in Shenyang.

### Beijing-Tianjin Economic and Various People's Organizations Urge Communists to Abide by Agreement; Appeal to National Government and Marshall, etc. by Telegram

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Nanjing Provisional Consultative Council held its 27th general meeting, discussing appeals to the National Government, Special Envoy Marshall, and the Communists, calling for adherence to the agreement. The meeting also condemned the Communist obstruction of the National Army's takeover of the Northeast, which was passed by the general meeting.

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 21st] Representatives from all sectors of society and people's organizations, at a joint farewell gathering for National Assembly representatives yesterday, unanimously requested that the current chaotic situation in Shandong Province be reported to the assembly, hoping that the Communist Party would immediately return the military to the nation and no longer use it as a tool for slaughtering compatriots, fighting for political power, and dividing territories.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd] The first meeting of the Shanxi Provisional Consultative Council closed on the 23rd. The meeting lasted fourteen days and passed over seventy proposals. Governor Yan, in his closing remarks, put forward three goals: (1) to reflect the people's opinions and communicate political and civil relations; (2) to remedy political deficiencies and safeguard political powers; and (3) to work together to overcome the current difficulties. The council also unanimously passed a resolution yesterday, requesting the government and the Military Mediation Department to stop the Communist army from capturing Changchun and attacking the National Army, and sending a separate telegram to Marshal Marshall.

### Ma Yinchu in Hangzhou; Talks About Economic Issues

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 23rd] Since Ma Yinchu came to Hangzhou, he has been very busy with speaking engagements. Mr. Ma spoke freely with this newspaper's reporter about economic issues. He believes that political democracy must precede economic democracy. Foreign exchange policy depends on fiscal policy, which in turn depends on military consolidation policy, which in turn depends on industrial policy, which in turn depends on tariff protection policy. Therefore, Mr. Ma strongly advocates tariff protection to maintain the prosperity of Chinese industry.

Commentary

### Gratitude to Dr. Savage

On today's road of national construction after China's victory, Dr. John Lucian Savage, this 68-year-old American hydraulic expert, has overcome long journeys and is currently returning to our country. He has come to China this time to continue pushing forward the Yangtze River Dam Project (Y·V·A·) that he designed for China. We are undoubtedly grateful to this old man Savage, who is working to create a happy and prosperous nation for China's 450 million people. In the future, if his plan is realized, his achievements in controlling China's waters will be no less than those of Yu the Great. In addition to expressing our highest respect to him, we would like to outline what we know about the Yangtze River Dam Project to provide the people of our country with an understanding.

After Dr. Savage recently came to China, he went to Wuhan for inspection and has reached concrete decisions with the authorities: aerial surveys of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to the entire Three Gorges area are expected to begin next month, and the main design work of the Y·V·A project may be completed within about half a year. The preparatory work for social and economic surveys related to the plan will also begin soon.

The origin of this globally shocking Yangtze River Dam Project did not begin today. As early as June of the 33rd year of the Republic, during the War of Resistance, Dr. Savage began drafting it on the blueprint of the American T·V·A· in a small building on the banks of the Longxi River. If this plan can be completed, it can be compared with the magnificent construction and great achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T·V·A·) in the United States. The United States has T·V·A·; China also has Y·V·A·. This is a bright and brilliant road leading us to prosperity and happiness.

Let's compare the American T·V·A· with the Chinese Y·V·A·:

First, in terms of hydropower generation: If the Y·V·A· project is successful, its power generation capacity can reach 10.056 million kilowatts, which is more than 19 times greater than the power generation capacity of the Soviet Union's Dnieper Hydroelectric Plant, and more than five times greater than the American Grand Coulee Dam. Its power transmission network, centered on Yidu, extends east to Nanjing, west to Chengdu and Xufu, south to Guiyang and Guilin, and north to Tianshui and Taiyuan, forming a vast power transmission network covering the Southwest, Northwest, West China, Central China, and East China. Such a vast power transmission range can be called the world's largest. The Yangtze River Dam project and the future national defense and people's livelihood of our country will inevitably be inseparable and closely related. After the completion of this plan, the development of special minerals in Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, as well as regional construction and industrialization, can obtain a large amount of cheap hydropower generated by the Yangtze River Dam.

Let's first look at the achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T·V·A·) in hydropower generation. The maximum power capacity of T·V·A is over 3 million kilowatts, and the current installed available power is 2,216,842 kilowatts (1945 statistics), but it can already help industry with power, electrify agriculture, increase the economic welfare of the general public, and increase the national income of the rural population, which is truly countless. In 1943, power users included federal, state, and municipal agencies, cooperatives, industries, electrical industries, villages, and general residents. The electricity fee is cheap, averaging 3.8 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and residential electricity is even cheaper. In 1943, each residential user in the United States used an average of 1,044 kilowatt-hours, costing 3.66 yuan per kilowatt-hour. The Tennessee Valley residential user used an average of 1,598 kilowatt-hours with the electric fee of 1.96 yuan per kilowatt-hour. In 1943, the average electric bill across the United States per residential user was 3820 USD, while in the Tennessee Valley each residential only pay 3130 USD. Electricity usage was increased the most by 55.5 percent, yet the cost of electricity was reduced by 22 percent. Ten years ago, the electricity in Tennessee River Valley was only 400 kWh per person, and now increase six times (China only have 5 kWh per person), this demonstrates the great economic value of electricity.

Second, in terms of improving agriculture: If the Y·V·A· plan is successful, its massive volume of the Yangtze River Dam can irrigate 60 million acres of farmland and normalize water levels, thus eliminating water and drought disasters. The Southwest, Northwest, and West China provinces are mostly plateaus and hilly areas, with many mountains and a special climate. Therefore, the cultivation of crops in various places is different from other places. Since ancient times, Chinese farmers have relied on the weather to eat, and a slight lack of rain can lead to drought. As a result, Chinese agriculture is still dominated by nature and has not been scientifically improved. After the success of Y·V·A·, agricultural improvement will inevitably take the path of the scientific era. Due to the achievements of the Y·V·A· project, China can also achieve agricultural electrification and agricultural technologization in the future. Moreover, agricultural industrialization must first have the conditions of electrification before it can advance to scientific and mechanized.

Let's look again at the achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (Y·V·A·) in improving agriculture: Ten years ago, eight or nine out of ten farms and farmhouses in the Tennessee River basin did not have electric lighting equipment, so there was no question of agricultural electrification. In 1933, there was one electrified farm in every 28 farms, and in 1943, there was one electrified farm in every five farms. 85,000 farms in the Tennessee River basin are mostly electrified. Residents now use electric lights; they also use electricity for farming and preserving crops. The electricity of the Tennessee Valley Authority is retailed and distributed through 128 power companies, giving great convenience to rural areas and farmers. The organization also encourages farmers to form farm ten-electricity cooperatives, and forestry also benefits from electricity, increasing business. The Authority also established "electric refrigeration cooperatives," where each family has a refrigerator, using electricity to refrigerate miscellaneous items all year round. Regarding improvements in new agricultural technology, the most important thing for the improvement of agriculture is soil conservation due to topsoil loss, resulting in barren land. Y·V·A· established a fertilizer plant at Wilson Dam, mass-producing concentrated fertilizers, especially phosphates. Since the success of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing technology, it has been promoted to general farmers, who accept the technology of new agriculture, and the farmers believe in the effect of phosphate fertilizer, so they organized the "Agricultural Improvement Association" to enhance the scientificization of agriculture.

Third, in terms of transportation and shipping: If the Y·V·A· plan can be completed, then in terms of transportation and shipping, 10,000-ton seagoing vessels can directly navigate between Chongqing and Shanghai, and travel 1,200 miles upstream to the west along the Yangtze River. Also, in the middle of Yichang, there is no need to change boats. The riverbed structure of the main stream of the Yangtze River upstream to Yichang is completely different from the Sichuan River. Therefore, each voyage between Shanghai and Chongqing is carried out in sections, and cannot be directly from Shanghai to Chongqing. As a result, cargo transportation is very difficult, and the increase in freight is particularly uneconomical. During the westward relocation of the National Government and the return to the capital after the victory, we deeply felt the pain that segmented voyages could not reach directly. The water level of the Yangtze River from Yishangyou varies in depth, with dangerous rapids and shipwrecks constantly occurring. The water quality is dangerous, and stone reefs are scattered in the river, making navigation difficult. During the severe winter season, the Sichuan River upstream Xuyiyu line even has a small motorboat of dozens of tons at the place of suspension. After the success of the Y·V·A· plan, the dangerous conditions of the past will be swept away, and the shipping between Shanghai and Chongqing will be unblocked. (Continued on page 2)

Soviet Troops in Harbin to Withdraw Today; Dong Yanping and Others Plan to Return Home Via Vladivostok; Fighting Fierce in Sipingjie Area

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Shenyang Telephone: Soviet troops in Harbin are scheduled to begin withdrawing on the 24th and will be completed by the 25th. Shenyang sent a plane to Harbin today to pick up 81 personnel, all of whom are staff from the Songjiang, Nenjiang, and Harbin provincial and municipal governments, as well as customs and post office workers. Nenjiang Chairman Peng Jiqun also took the train from Qiqihar to Harbin today. Qiqihar is now maintained by the Chief of Police Zhang Weiren. Peng, together with Songjiang Chairman Guan Jiyu, Harbin Mayor Yang Chuoan, and the military delegation led by Dong Yanping, plan to take the train with the Soviet troops this afternoon, returning home via Vladivostok. In recent days, the Communist army in the Harbin city area has withdrawn to the outskirts, planning to reorganize and return to Harbin today or tomorrow to take over. Communist political personnel in the city conducted a census last night. The people of the city are extremely terrified. Only Soviet troops and Japanese residents walk the streets of Harbin today. The general public all avoid living at home and dare not go out.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The fierce battle in the Northeast is currently taking place in Sipingjie. According to official sources, National troops attacked the Sipingjie city area, which was previously captured by the Communist army, on the evening of the 20th, and are fighting with the residents of old Sipingjie. However, this is the first time the Communist Party has attacked Sipingjie. It is reported that the National troops fighting there are three divisions of the New First Army and one division of the 71st Army, and their strength is strong. The Communist army seems to be unable to support the water situation.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Xinhua News Agency said: The Communist army is still firmly holding Sipingjie. A major battle is underway on the line from Sipingjie to Bamiancheng in the west.

[United Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Reports say: The vanguard of the New First Army has arrived at Gongzhuling, which is 120 li away from Changchun, and is engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army. About 80,000 Communist troops are concentrated in the area.

### Sino-US Cooperation Solves Tianjin Air Transportation of Narcotics Case

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd] A huge air transportation of narcotics case has recently been solved here. The successful investigation was due to the comprehensive cooperation between the US military and our police and security forces. Nine criminals and opium worth 90,000 US dollars have been seized. On February 10th of this year, a man named Reidel induced three US military ambulance personnel to transport a large amount of opium to Shanghai by air, promising to make a fortune. The three personnel were not tempted and reported the matter to their superiors. They were ordered to continue to deal with Reidel nominally. The US military set up a feigned situation and ordered a pilot to participate. Until the 30th of last month, Reidel gave nine bags of opium to the pilot to prepare for air transport to Shanghai. Our police and security forces then assisted the US military police in arresting them. A total of ten drug traffickers were captured in the case in Tianjin and Beiping, including five White Russians and five Chinese merchants. The entire case has now been handed over to our side for trial.

### In Memory of Changchun (Part 1)
— Written by Fang Ren in Shenyang

On March 29th, the reporter flew away from Changchun. Two hours later, the plane landed at Jinzhou Airport. The people who flew to Jinzhou on the same plane all breathed a sigh of relief. Those who liked to talk blurted out: "Now we can be considered safe."

Those who have lived in Changchun for a long time boasted that Changchun is a blessed land. The Northeast has experienced many storms, and there have been stories of blood-stained rivers and mountains in other areas, but Changchun has been able to sneak through the chaos. For example, after the Japanese surrendered on August 15th last year, there was no scene of blood flowing like pestles. In mid-November last year, when the headquarters withdrew from Changchun, it looked like a disaster was imminent, but in the end it was able to turn danger into safety. However, now, in the sunny March, the abundant spring breeze has failed to blow green leaves out of the bald branches, and the snow on the wilderness has melted, and when the white land shows its true face, this blessed land is full of gunpowder.

When the sovereignty of the Northeast began to be taken over, it should have been a happy event for the Chinese people, but the facts tell us that on March 13th, the Soviet troops left Siping, and on the 17th, someone besieged the provincial government, using rocket launchers (according to the investigation, the other party had four) to destroy the power grid defense works set up by Chairman Liu Handong, and the power plant where the power supply was located, causing Siping to fall into chaos. Before the 17th, Siping was already in a state of being surrounded. The tigers waiting for an opportunity to move were preparing their weapons, and as soon as the opportunity came, they would act. Everyone could see this step. Finally, the curtain was raised before midnight on the 17th. The provincial government had less than 4,000 people, and the enemy had more than 20,000, which was already a disadvantage in terms of numbers. The security team and police, who had less than 4,000 people, were still in training, so it was inevitable that they would lose. Liu Handong and others were moved from Siping to Lishu, and then from Lishu to Siping. Later, they felt that some of them could be allowed to return to Changchun. On the 25th, Liu Handong and 14 others left Siping by car. They were supposed to arrive that day, but they were kept overnight at Gongzhuling (120 li from both Gongzhuling and Siping). At 10:50 pm on the 26th, the stars were tied to the sky, and the city of Changchun was as silent as if it were dead before they returned to the Mantan Building. From the 17th to the 26th, a total of ten days, the faces of the 14 people who came back were haggard and pale, and they really had nothing but themselves. The most obvious was Xu Nai, the secretary-general of the provincial government, because he was a friend I met in Changchun last year.

When Liu Handong and his party of 14 returned, no one in the building was asleep, and they greeted them with heartfelt condolences. After Chairman Liu saw everyone and sat down, he slowly said that when they left Changchun on January 8th and arrived in Siping, a certain unit in Siping moved from the city to the suburbs. The Siping that the provincial government took over was in a state of being surrounded from the day it was taken over. A certain unit transported coal from east to west on the Siping-Taonan Road through the city. Government personnel could only watch the arrogant locomotive roar and pass by. The scene that had been expected for a long time was staged on the 17th. The crowd was outnumbered, and the ammunition and food were exhausted. Siping finally fell into chaos. Chairman Liu said that when he left Changchun, the basic military force he brought to Siping was: one company of security team, 100 rifles, and 30,000 rounds of ammunition, that's all. Before going to bed, Secretary-General Xu also talked with the reporter privately for a while. When he said goodbye to the reporter, he wanted to find a few sleeping pills. He said: "I haven't gotten a bit of rest in the past ten days. I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep." Although he said that, the reporter didn't have this thing, so he had to express his apology to him.

### President Song Arrives in Beijing from Chongqing: Executive Yuan Routine Meeting to Be Held in Beijing in the Coming Days

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 23rd Dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, along with his wife and Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, arrived in Beijing from Chongqing at 2 PM today. When the special plane of these two top Executive Yuan leaders landed at the Guanghua Gate airport outside the city, the welcoming party was exceptionally small. It is reported that Song's arrival was earlier than generally expected, as today, Tuesday, was originally the date for the Executive Yuan's routine meeting. Slightly earlier than Song's special plane, the planes of several senior officials, including Party-State elder Ding Weifen, Minister of Food Xu Yan, and Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng, arrived at the Minggugong airport. All of these signs prove that the center of gravity of both current affairs and politics has indeed shifted from Chongqing to Beijing. It is reported that the Executive Yuan routine meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held today, may be convened in Beijing in the coming days with a temporary notice. President Song left Chongqing at 10:20 AM this morning, taking Marshal Marshall's special plane, which flew from Chongqing to Beijing, taking three hours and forty minutes, setting a new flight record between Beijing and Chongqing.

[Central News Agency Chongqing 23rd Dispatch] The Ministry of Social Affairs is scheduled to return all its operations to the capital by the end of the month and officially begin work in Beijing on May 1st.

### Sino-French Military Conflict in Hanoi: Our Side Has Lodged a Protest, Demanding the French Army Punish the Culprits and Compensate for the Losses

[Central News Agency Hanoi 21st Dispatch] (Delayed) At 3:30 PM on the 21st, a French military vehicle collided with a Chinese military heavy vehicle near Hoan Kiem Lake in downtown Hanoi. While both sides were stopping to investigate responsibility, the French army suddenly opened fire, killing one of our driver soldiers. A conflict immediately broke out between the two sides. Gunfire erupted in the city, causing great disruption. The headquarters of our 53rd Army, citing that our side had already handed over defense responsibilities and was not responsible for maintaining public order, immediately contacted the Dong Institute and notified all parties by telephone to refrain from opening fire. The conflict soon ceased. At this time, Vietnamese revolutionaries suddenly took the opportunity to attack. Around 4 PM, the gunfire became even denser. Vietnamese near the Hanoi branch of the Central News Agency even opened fire on French residences. After liaison officers from the Chinese, French, and Vietnamese sides rushed to various locations and ordered a ceasefire, the gunfire subsided around 5 PM. According to the commander of the 53rd Army Corps, after the incident occurred, all three sides ordered their troops not to open fire. However, some of our soldiers at guard posts and stationed at railway stations were attacked.

[Central News Agency Hanoi 22nd Dispatch] The Sino-French military vehicle collision on the afternoon of the 21st has come to an end after being handled by the authorities of both sides. During the conflict on the 21st, the French army dispatched several tanks to patrol the city and fire their guns, reaching as many as five conflict sites. French tanks also fired a shot near Hoan Kiem Lake, and some French soldiers opened fire on our Youth Daily newspaper office. The trees in the courtyard were hit. In addition to the four soldiers killed at the collision site, fifteen of our soldiers were killed in various locations in the city. The number of casualties on the French side is unknown. The First Front Army Headquarters, considering that the French army has already taken over the defense of Hanoi and is responsible for maintaining public order, has protested to the French army commander, demanding the punishment of the culprits and compensation for losses, in order to clarify the responsibilities of both sides, representatives from both the Chinese and French sides have been organized a committee to conduct an investigation.

### Xie Guansheng Arrives in Beijing from Chongqing: Trials of Traitors are Being Handled Impartially Everywhere; Living Conditions of Judicial Personnel to Be Improved Soon

[Central News Agency Nanjing 23rd Dispatch] Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng flew to Beijing from Chongqing at 3 PM on the 23rd. He said: Public and rapid trial of traitors is a consistent policy of the government. The handling of this matter by courts nationwide is not a matter of personal grudges, but a manifestation of national justice. In recent times, the work of trying traitors has been widely carried out everywhere, and all cases have been handled impartially. I personally feel gratified. However, "thoroughly eradicating evil" is indeed the essence of the judicial spirit, and "raising up the wronged and placing them among the upright" is also the essence of judicial protection of human rights. Therefore, I hope that all colleagues in law enforcement nationwide can encourage each other with this. Xie then stated: The central government is extremely concerned about the living conditions of judicial personnel. Recently, I have discussed concrete improvement measures with President Song, which will be realized in the near future. In response to reporters' questions about the situation of prisons in the recovered areas, Xie said: The wartime destruction was too severe, and restoring them to their former appearance will not be accomplished overnight. The ministry has formulated a step-by-step implementation plan, starting with major cities and then spreading to the localities. Recently, the government has strictly enforced the prohibition of drugs and opium in the recovered areas, and courts at all levels should do their best to assist local authorities in completing this important task.

Suzhou

Expanding the Teacher Appreciation Movement

Given the poverty of teachers in this county, all sectors are expanding the teacher appreciation movement. It is stipulated that from May 1st to the 7th, it will be Teacher Appreciation Week. The goal is to raise 20,000,000 yuan to subsidize teachers, with each teacher receiving approximately 100,000 yuan. The fundraising targets include students' parents, the Benevolent Relief Association, chambers of commerce, various businesses, and entertainment venues, which will also collect teacher appreciation donations. It is hoped that small contributions will accumulate into a large sum. The education authorities have formed a committee to be responsible for everything.

Changshu

Cessation of Inspections at Stations and Wharves

Commander Yan of the garrison troops, in order to discuss public security in the urban area and gather collective wisdom, convened the third city defense meeting at the regimental headquarters on the 17th. It was decided to cease inspections at city gates, stations, and wharves to facilitate travelers.

Wuxi

Major Disputes in the General Survey of House Tax

Lu Shousheng, the Bao head of the second Bao in Zhongyi Town in this county, accompanied four tax collectors, including Lu Xu from the Local Autonomous Donation and Tax Office, on the 17th of this month to conduct a general survey of house taxes door-to-door. These officials arbitrarily estimated the value of houses, regardless of the size, quality of construction, or rental income of the residents. They then forced residents to sign and stamp application forms. For example, Zhu Wang's one-story house along the street was insisted upon being assessed as a two-story building because it had a mezzanine. Gu Daisheng rented two rooms for 12,000 yuan in legal tender per month, which was five times the original rent. The rent for Gu Jusheng's household was also more than ten times the original rent. Furthermore, it was publicly stated that rent should be calculated based on the price of rice, which caused major rental disputes. The county council raised this issue in the general meeting, demanding that the valuation procedure be fair and reduce the burden on the people.

Songjiang

The All-Virtuous Widows' Hall to Be Dissolved

The All-Virtuous Widows' Hall in this county, established during the Kangxi and Yongzheng reigns of the late Qing dynasty, has a history of one hundred years of providing relief to poor widows. The board of directors now believes that in this era of social progress and equal rights for men and women, the expenditure on this type of old ethical teaching is unnecessary. Therefore, it was brought up for discussion at a meeting held on the 21st. It was resolved to dissolve the hall. Except for poor widows over the age of 45, who will be merged into the Universal Relief Hall (i.e., the Old People's Hall) for continued care, all others will be given 100,000 yuan in severance pay and dismissed. It is said that these measures will be implemented in the shortest possible time.

Jiaxing

Qualification Examination for Township and Town Cadres

In order to improve the organization of townships and towns, the Jiaxing County Government convened township and town cadres and clerks on the 20th at the Huguang Central Elementary School for a qualification examination. A total of 88 people attended. The examination was supervised by Zhu Bingjun, the head of the Civil Affairs Section. The examination was divided into subjects such as Mandarin, Party Principles, Practical Writing, and Autonomous Regulations. Oral examinations and physical examinations were also conducted. All examination papers are currently being graded. It is determined that the passing score is 60 for cadres and 50 for clerks. Township and town personnel who have not yet taken the examination will be given another opportunity to take the examination at a later date.

Huzhou

All the land required above was purchased at a price of 150,000 yuan per mu. Construction will begin as soon as the contracts are signed.

Wujiang

Villagers Beat a Fake Clerk to Death

Yu Wusheng, a 52-year-old villager from Daru Township in Zhenze District of this county, had served as a clerk in the puppet township office for many years, using his position to extort money from the farmers. Farmers resented him deeply. Recently, he did not restrain himself, which aroused public outrage. On the 13th of this month, more than a hundred people gathered and beat him to death, throwing his body into the river. Upon receiving the report, the county government stated that while it is true that traitors and puppets deserve to be punished, it must be done in accordance with legal procedures. Recently, there have often been ignorant villagers who, in a fit of anger, hurt people and destroy houses, which not only undermines the law but also affects public security. Yesterday, a public notice was issued to strictly prohibit such acts, and it is hoped that people will step up the reporting of traitors and puppets so that they can be severely punished and justice can be served.

### Thank You Dr. Savage (Continued from the First Page)

Let us look at the achievements of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T.V.A.) in the area of transportation and navigation. The Tennessee River in the United States is a strange river that flows backwards from south to north. For centuries, it has taken countless lives and destroyed countless fields. In particular, the floods of 1879, 1886, and 1917 were the worst and remain a permanent fear in the minds of the residents. The residents of the Tennessee River Valley did not engage in afforestation, causing the 52 inches of rainfall to flow on the surface without penetrating the ground, creating the potential for flooding. The soil-retaining vegetation on the ground was insufficient to curb the flow of floodwaters, and the precious topsoil was washed away, clogging the waterways and causing inundation. The Tennessee River Valley area, like the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin, has many hilly pastures, woodlands, and farmlands, as well as coal and iron deposits underground. Since the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority (T.V.A.), the river management project has achieved remarkable results. Water retention ponds were built on the main stream, and reservoirs were built on the tributaries to intercept the runoff from the tributaries' catchment areas to reduce the water volume of the main stream during floods. By 1944, all projects on the main and tributary streams had been completed. Because the Tennessee River is very shallow, with some parts only one foot deep, low-grade goods along the coast cannot be utilized due to high transportation costs, resulting in significant economic losses. Therefore, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a plan to channelize the river, open a nine-foot navigable waterway, and build seven high dams or thirty-two low dams. Over the past ten years, a total of thirty-one dams have been completed, one transferred from the U.S. Army and four purchased from private owners! Sixteen were self-built. Regarding the water level and water quality control of the Tennessee River, "rainfall stations" and "channel water gauge stations" have been set up along the river to record rainfall and water flow, and report increases in storage at any time. Regarding navigation in the Tennessee River Valley, over the past ten years, 9,000 miles of navigable coastline have been developed, which is equal to the combined length of the navigable coastlines of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. In 1933, the Tennessee River's navigation volume was only 32,658,951 ton-miles. By 1942, it had increased to 161,469,344 ton-miles. It is estimated that freight traffic will increase to 1 billion ton-miles by 1960.

The above is only a brief overview of the future achievements of the Yangtze River Dam project in terms of hydropower generation, agricultural transformation, and transportation and navigation. The entire plan cannot be described in a short article.

Moreover, if the Yangtze River Dam project can be successfully completed in the future, the commercial prosperity of the Yangtze River basin will inevitably be spurred by industrial development, agricultural revitalization, and smooth transportation. This can be compared to the glorious achievements of the Tennessee River Valley in the United States. Furthermore, the scenery of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River is exquisitely beautiful and grand, and will surely become a tourist destination for Chinese and foreign visitors in the future, just like Switzerland's substantial annual international income. Let us also look at the Tennessee River Valley, where rice paddies and factories are intertwined, and swimming, boating, fishing, and escaping the summer heat are possible. The scenery is beautiful, transforming a desolate area into a land of paradise. The Yangtze River basin will surely be like this in the future.

In short, Y.V.A. is not a bizarre dream, but a concrete construction plan by Dr. Savage to help China build the country. We believe that:

(1) The implementation of this Y.V.A. construction plan can solve the most important problem facing China today, namely the reduction of the military after demobilization. The millions of soldiers to be discharged will have a way out with "full employment." "Employing soldiers in construction" is especially a bright path towards the modernization, scientification, and mechanization of national defense, and is also a splendid shortcut for China to move from an agricultural country to an industrial country.

(2) The implementation of this plan does not have the problem of funding difficulties at present. Because our friendly country, the United States, is as interested in investing in Y.V.A. as it is in T.V.A. in the United States. After Dr. Savage designed the Y.V.A. plan for us and returned to the United States the year before last, he published an article titled "China's Kilowatts of Light," emphasizing the importance of the Three Gorges Dam project on the Yangtze River. He urged the American people to pay attention with the warning that it "may affect world history." He further stated in several aspects: "(1) In terms of employment, if the Yangtze River Dam project is built quickly, the American electrical and mechanical industries will be busy day and night for the next 24 years; (2) In terms of investment, it will become the most beneficial example of American foreign investment; (3) In terms of diplomacy, the friendship between China and the United States, the two major powers in the East and West, will be increasingly strengthened because of the deeply rooted interests in China," hoping for American investment. In addition, Eugene Staley, an economic advisor to the International Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, in his recent book "World Economic Development," discussed in detail the relationship between the existing savings in the United States and the future foreign investment and the construction of the Yangtze River Dam. The conclusion also stated: "Therefore, if the construction of the Yangtze River Dam is of interest to the American government and public, it would probably not be difficult to extract $100 million from its huge investment."

(3) The implementation of this plan also does not have the problem of "equipment" difficulties at present. Because our friendly country, the United States, is looking for suitable ways to dispose of its surplus materials, equipment, and machinery after the war. We can see the deep relationship between the surplus materials and equipment of the United States and the construction of the Yangtze River Dam project from the "U.S. Post-War Economic Policy" and the "Surplus Asset Disposal Act." Mr. Gu Chunfan once explained: "According to the "Business Week" of June 19, 1943, the factory machinery and equipment are valued at 16.6 billion U.S. dollars, which is a small supplement to the Yangtze River Dam project and the enterprises that are generated by the heat, light, power, and irrigation generated by the dam. If the U.S. authorities can consider this point, then the post-war distress of U.S. dollars and the stagnation of surplus materials can be largely and reasonably resolved."

(4) The implementation of this plan also does not have the problem of "technical" difficulties at present. Because our friendly country, the United States, has provided us with significant assistance in technology before, during, and after the war. During the war, with the permission of the U.S. government, our government sent several technical personnel to the United States for internships and research. The U.S. F.E.A. (Foreign Economic Administration) also directly helped us economically to send technical personnel to the United States for research. Only when the Yangtze River Dam project begins construction can Chinese engineering and technical personnel be fully mobilized, and American technical experts, engineering experts, water conservancy experts, and scientific experts will also be happy to assist us in this great human project that "affects world history."

On the road to nation-building after victory, unfortunately, on this day when Changchun and its surrounding areas are engulfed in the flames of war, we welcome and bid farewell to the old Dr. Savage, who is creating blessings for the 450 million people of China. We, the entire nation, are extremely ashamed and grateful.

What we are ashamed of... our nation is too weak, the country is too backward, and the society is too depressed! Today's world is embarking on a new road of "peace," but there are still people who deliberately create internal strife! Today's world is seeking "the happiness, prosperity, and survival of all mankind, but some of us are actually "massacring civilians" in some areas! In today's world, "nation above all else" and "construction first," but we still put party interests above all else and territorial control first! This is truly the greatest shame of the Chinese nation! We can only feel ashamed in front of this old Dr. Savage! Our people must cherish the future of nation-building and must demand stability first and construction first!

What we are grateful for: The old Dr. Savage, at the age of 68, has been working tirelessly and planning day and night to bring our backward country onto the broad road of modernization, scientification, industrialization, and electrification. He wants to dedicate his later years to fighting for the survival and happiness of the Chinese nation! We can only feel grateful in front of the old Dr. Savage. While welcoming and bidding farewell, we must demand that the CCP put down their butcher knives quickly, let the government lead the people, and everyone build the Y.V.A. with their strength and sweat!

Alas! Political countercurrents and turbulent political situations; endless party disputes have ignited a firestorm! How many people can be as loyal to the country as our friend, the old Dr. Savage? We can only feel extremely ashamed and grateful to Dr. Savage, the god of water conservancy and the saint of construction!

### Three Party Leaders in Japan Negotiate; Difficult to Determine New Prime Minister; Socialist Party's Position Crucial; Emperor Hirohito of Japan Cancels Visit to MacArthur

[Special Dispatch from Tokyo by this Newspaper's Correspondent on the 23rd] After the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet, there has been much speculation about the selection of the next prime minister, but Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama are the most frequently mentioned. A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced today that Shidehara and his cabinet members convened a special meeting this morning, after which they went to the Progressive Party's office. Then, in the name of the Progressive Party leader, they consulted with the leaders of the Liberal and Social Democratic parties about various issues arising from the resignation of the cabinet.

[Special Dispatch from Tokyo by this Newspaper's Correspondent on the 23rd] Emperor Hirohito of Japan's scheduled visit to MacArthur this morning was temporarily canceled, causing suspicion among the general public. According to informed sources, Emperor Hirohito canceled the visit to MacArthur on the advice of Yoshida and Shidehara. Shidehara believed that the Emperor's visit to MacArthur a few hours after he resigned would inevitably lead to unfavorable speculation about the new cabinet, so it was best not to visit.

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] MacArthur Headquarters announced this morning: MacArthur maintains a policy of "non-interference" in the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet and the selection of its successor, leaving it to Japan to decide. MacArthur Headquarters regards the Japanese government as an agency for implementing instructions. It is impossible for the cabinet selected by Japan to not accept MacArthur Headquarters' policies. Although political maneuvers in Japan have been extremely active so far, MacArthur has not yet publicly expressed his opinion.

[Kaizo Nipposha, Tokyo, 23rd] After the resignation of the Shidehara Cabinet, the future of the Japanese political situation can be decided in today's meeting of the leaders of the Progressive, Socialist, and Liberal parties. According to the current situation, it is most likely that a coalition cabinet will be formed with the Liberal Party, the largest party, as the center. Shidehara met with Liberal Party President Hatoyama at 2:00 PM today and with Socialist Party leader Katayama at 3:30 PM. The key to determining the next regime lies in whether the meeting between Hatoyama and Katayama can be successful. The success of the three-party coalition cabinet also depends on the meeting between Hatoyama and Katayama. Therefore, the Socialist Party occupies a crucial position. Hatoyama said today that in order to establish the initial stage of democracy, the order to form a cabinet should be given to the President of the Liberal Party. If he himself loses his qualification, then another person will be selected to serve as the party's president.

### Eisenhower to Inspect Pacific and Far East This Week; Will Also Meet with MacArthur

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Department of the Army announced today: Chief of Staff General Eisenhower will depart this week to inspect the Pacific and Far East, and will meet with General MacArthur. His itinerary will be announced later. The purpose of this trip is to personally examine the needs and various problems of the U.S. military, and it will last for one month.

### Eisenhower Says U.S. Army Should Have At Least One Million

(And 23rd dispatch) Eisenhower said last night at a banquet of the Kansas State University alumni association here: The U.S. Army should have at least one million people to serve the country. The minimum number of U.S. occupation forces should also have sufficient strength to quell disturbances, otherwise it will be difficult to avoid asking for help from allied countries. The main reason why he and the Department of the Army advocate extending the conscription law is this. However, the Army authorities actually hope that all occupation forces will be filled by volunteers. No country in the world fears the strength of the United States, and neither does the Soviet Union. Soviet Marshal Zhukov once told me that the Soviet Union fears that the United States will reduce its troops too quickly, so that it will not have the strong power to stabilize the situation in Europe. All allied commanders in Europe agree with Zhukov's statement. As victors, we should occupy Germany and Japan, otherwise we cannot maintain peace. The main thing needed for the occupation is food. The American people must decide whether they will sit idly by and watch their friends, and even their enemies, starve to death? But the American people have never made this decision.

### Soviet Military Strength Reaches Six Million

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] According to the most reliable sources that arrived here today: The Soviet Union's current military strength is estimated at six million people, and it is now planning to train 1.5 million people each year. If President Truman's national military training plan is passed by Congress, then the United States will train one million young people each year. Under the aforementioned Soviet plan, trainees can decide to train for two or five years. President Truman's proposal advocates training for one year. Of the Soviet Union's current six million people, three million are ground troops. The United States had 6,833,353 troops on January 1, and its total will be set at 2,857,800 on July 1 of this year.

### Mussolini's Body Stolen

[United Press, Milan, 23rd] Milan authorities said today: The body of Mussolini, buried in a pauper's grave in the Maggiore Cemetery, was moved away at night by persons unknown. An investigation has been launched to determine his whereabouts. Mussolini was captured and shot by guerrillas on the Swiss border last April. His body was transported to Milan, hung upside down in the square for exhibition, and then buried in the Maggiore Cemetery. His mistress, Petacci, and five followers were executed at the same time, and their bodies were buried near Mussolini's grave.

### British Empire Conference to Discuss Pacific Defense Issues; Australia Concerned About U.S. Increased "Interest" in the Pacific; Wants to Have U.S. Participate in Joint Defense Plan

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Australian Prime Minister Chifley said here on the eve of the opening of the Imperial Conference: The Australian government is quite concerned about the United States' increased interest in the Pacific region. I will discuss with Prime Minister Attlee the various issues related to the Pacific. The Australian government and the New Zealand government have exchanged views on the issue of Pacific military bases and have reached a general agreement. Chifley declined to elaborate on whether his government supports placing disputed and trust territories in the Pacific under international co-management, as the government does not wish to discuss the status of any particular island separately, but only wishes to obtain a clear policy on the general issue of deploying defenses on these islands. The results of this discussion will naturally be communicated to the United States. Chifley went on to say: The Australian government is quite concerned that the United States has a greater interest in the Pacific region than before the war. What the United States is interested in is undoubtedly related to the bases in the Pacific. These bases do not only refer to bases set up by one country, but also bases jointly occupied with other countries. The main strategic issues of the Empire will be discussed at the London conference. He also said: I will travel to Japan on my way home, and will depart from London around May 6 to return home.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Australian Prime Minister Chifley and Foreign Minister Evatt revealed here yesterday that Australia now wants to have the United States participate in the joint defense plan for the Southwest Pacific region. Evatt stated that this joint defense plan should specifically include Manus Island under Australian mandate. The United States had built a large naval and air base on the island during the war against Japan. We believe that the island has now become one of the entire issues of the Southwest Pacific defense base. This is related to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. If the United States believes that this defensive position thousands of miles away is important, then Australia will pay more attention to the defense of the Marshall and Caroline Islands in order to establish a reciprocal arrangement. Australia is now willing to hand over the mandated territory of New Guinea, including Manus Island and the Admiralty Islands, to be taken over by the United Nations organization, but since the islands are related to Australia's defense, they should still be under Australian control. The United States occupies an important position in Pacific defense and is sufficient to guarantee its security.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] South African Prime Minister Smuts arrived here yesterday by plane, ready to attend the Imperial Conference.

### The Security Council Reconvened Yesterday; The Iranian Question Will Once Again Incite Heated Debate; Soviet Troops Not Withdrawn from Azerbaijan

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 23rd Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council will reconvene this afternoon at 3:00 PM (Shanghai time, Wednesday morning at 4:00 AM). The first matter to be discussed is the Iranian question. The experts committee, after deliberation, has decided by a majority vote to retain the Iranian question on the agenda. As for the Polish question, the Security Council does not intend to discuss it today. A subcommittee will first be appointed to review whether Franco poses a threat to world peace; discussions will resume after a decision is reached.

[United Press, New York, 23rd] When the Security Council reconvenes today, it is expected that there will be another round of heated debate. The Iranian question is listed as the first item on the agenda, followed by Australia's proposal that the United Nations establish a commission to investigate the internal situation of Franco's Spain. Most representatives believe that a final decision on the Iranian question cannot be reached at today's meeting. The Soviet Union demands that the Iranian question be immediately removed from the agenda. Supported by the United States, Britain, and the six other representatives of the Security Council (including China), it is firmly opposed, believing that this dispute should only be concluded after the Soviet Union has fully fulfilled its guarantee of withdrawal. Yesterday, British Member of Parliament Fott and an official observer stationed in Iran both stated: The only way to guarantee Iran's independence is to send a fact-finding mission to the country. It is widely believed that this proposal has garnered sympathy from all parties in the Security Council.

[United Press, Tehran, 23rd] The "Tehran Daily" declared today: Soviet troops have withdrawn from Pendar and Palavi along the Caspian Sea coast. The report further stated: Judging from various indications, the Red Army has in fact withdrawn from Iran, with the exception of Azerbaijan province.

Said Not to be Aimed at France

In reality, this is a strictly defensive plan. Ayugieru stated that his trip was to Cuba for personal matters and he had no official mission in the United States.

### Halifax Delivers Remarks Before Leaving the United States

[Reuters, New York, 23rd]: British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, on the eve of his departure from office, delivered a farewell speech last night, stating that the United Nations is truly the world's last and best hope. If we want to make this charter of world peace more valuable than the ink with which it was written, we must faithfully maintain the friendship and understanding between the people of all signatory nations. If so, our hopes have a chance of being realized; otherwise, nothing will be achieved. The establishment of a new organization requires considerable time, and it should be led forward by the United States and Britain, two countries that have many things in common. The friendship between our two countries has no selfish motives and is definitely not aimed at anyone. Its purpose is only to strengthen the will and work of the United Nations organization.

### Trotsky's Posthumous Work Published

[United Press, New York, 23rd] Like a delayed-action bomb, Leon Trotsky's biography of Stalin has finally exploded.

Authorities have explicitly announced that printing or possessing such propaganda materials is illegal. Propaganda materials falsely claiming to be issued by organizations are also frequently found in the mail.

### Eight Cinemas Close Down Over Assigned Seating Issue; "Hiring More Ushers is Too Much of a Burden"; Film Industry Association Sends Representatives to Appeal to All Sectors; Emergency Meeting Scheduled for This Morning

[Our Own Dispatch] The Municipal Police Department issued an order to all cinemas in the city the day before yesterday, requiring that all tickets sold be assigned seats starting yesterday afternoon, under penalty of closure for violations. The Great Shanghai, Jindu, Paris, Jincheng, Ping'an, Huguang, Xinguang, and Dumei cinemas have been forced to temporarily close starting yesterday, as implementation in the short term is beyond their financial capacity. They have requested assistance from the Film Industry Association.

According to a spokesperson for the association, it is indeed very difficult for cinemas to convert tickets to assigned seating. First, with assigned seating, audiences will inevitably arrive after the show is about to start, entering the theater after the lights are dimmed, causing numerous inconveniences for ushering. At the same time, crowds inside and outside the theater will be congested, and order will inevitably be chaotic. Second, assigned seating requires increasing the number of ushers, which would drastically increase the cinema's expenses, making it unsustainable. Previously, the Asia Cinema mobilized ushers from various cinemas to serve when special dramas were shown, but this is not easily implemented for smaller cinemas.

The Great China, Cathay, Golden Gate, and International cinemas in the city originally had assigned seating, so there was no problem. As for the Great Light, Nanjing, and Majestic cinemas, they temporarily wrote numbers on the tickets yesterday afternoon, and audiences found their own seats.

Yesterday, the Film Industry Association dispatched representatives such as Ren Jinzhen and others to appeal to the Municipal Government, Resident Committee of the Municipal Provisional Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, explaining the difficulties and requesting assistance. The managers of the eight closed cinemas convened a meeting at the Great Shanghai Cinema at 5:00 PM yesterday and resolved several points: (1) The eight cinemas ordered to close will publish a public announcement in the newspaper and intensify their appeals to all parties. (2) Request the police department to delay implementation. The Film Industry Association is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting this morning and will also host a reception for the press at the Kangle Restaurant at 3:00 PM this afternoon, requesting them to uphold justice.

### Mai Jingming, First of the Major Traitors to Face Public Trial, Sentencing at the End of the Month; Former Puppet Prison Warden Eloquent in His Defense; Trial of Wang Zuying and Others Postponed for Further Questioning

[Our Own Dispatch] The case of Mai Jingming, the first of the major traitors to face public trial, was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for colluding with the enemy to disrupt finance. The trial continued yesterday. The defendant admitted to serving as a member of the Puppet Central Political Committee's Economic Special Committee, Director of the Puppet Postal Remittances Bureau, Director of the Puppet Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Director of the Puppet Insurance Supervision Bureau. However, he defended himself against the prosecutor's indictment on five points: (1) During his tenure on the Puppet Economic Committee, although there was a proposal to communicate remittances from overseas Chinese, it was not implemented, so the accusation of absorbing funds from overseas Chinese is inappropriate. (2) During his tenure as Director of the Puppet Postal Remittances Bureau, he did not engage in speculative activities. (3) The prosecutor alleges collusion with the enemy, but he did not have contact with the enemy. (4) During his tenure as Director of the Puppet Insurance Supervision Bureau, the sale of stamps was actually received and issued by the Puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce, without any personal enrichment. (5) He surrendered himself to the Military Statistics Bureau on September 30 of last year and should be granted a reduced sentence according to regulations. The defendant did not request a lawyer to defend him, and no family members attended the hearing yesterday. The court appointed a lawyer to provide free legal defense, but the defense concluded with only a few words, and the sentencing was scheduled for the afternoon of the 30th. In addition, the case of Liang Mingwang, a puppet police chief, and Yao Zhiman, a police officer, who were convicted of bribery and dereliction of duty by the puppet court at the time, is currently being executed. After a new investigation by the High Procuratorate, they were prosecuted for treason. The debate in this case also concluded yesterday, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 30th.

In addition, Chen Weifan reported that Shen Guanjing, the puppet Shanghai Prison Warden, transferred 850 prisoners to Sizhao Mountain and other places in the Zhoushan Islands to help the enemy construct defensive fortifications, of whom sixty to seventy died due to unbearable torture, and some of the survivors were also disabled. In addition, he colluded with Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section, to steal and sell large quantities of paper, white cloth, scrap iron, purple copper, gray felt, and other items stored in the prison. After the case was accepted by the High Court, it was heard once, and during the retrial yesterday, the audience was filled with prison officials, guards, and bailiffs. The defendant spoke eloquently, resorting to all kinds of cunning arguments. The court believed that the case still needed investigation and ordered the retrial to be postponed.

Wang Zuying, a puppet Zhenhai County Police Bureau detective; Kang Zhuang, a puppet Shanghai County Sanlintang Inspection Post Director; Li Wenhan, a puppet Customs Police officer; Wang Deqing, a puppet Huazhong Railway laborer; Zhang Shaobo, a puppet Dongtai County Gendarmerie intelligence chief; Liu Huiqi, a puppet Shanghai Zhaoying Road Gendarmerie assistant; Sheng Dian, a puppet Nanhui County Government inspector; Dong Xuelin, a puppet Nanhui County Datuan Town Police Station Nicheng Outpost patrolman; and Wei Wenshou, a puppet Nanhui County Government clerk, were accused of abusing their power during the puppet regime to bully and harm the people. The complainants and victims testified to the details, but all defendants firmly denied the charges. The court ordered the retrial to be postponed.

### Thousands Homeless: Large Fire on Yuyao Road Claims Two Lives

[Report from Our Newspaper] A cluster of over a thousand thatched shacks lined the area around Yaoqiao Creek on Yuyao Road. The residents were mostly rickshaw pullers and other laborers, while the women and children largely worked in factories.

### Lord Fraser Hosts Press and Inspects British Naval Forces Stationed in Shanghai

Invites Mayor and American and Chinese Senior Officials to Participate

[Report from Our Newspaper] Admiral Lord Fraser, a renowned British naval commander with 43 years of service in the Royal Navy and currently Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, hosted Chinese and foreign journalists at 10:30 AM yesterday in the wardroom of the British warship HMS "Whimbrel." At 11:00 AM, he also hosted Liu Hongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yan Huiqing, and others for a tour.

Admiral Fraser stated briefly: He has been in China for six months and is visiting Shanghai for the first time. He is deeply grateful for the warm reception he has received from all sides. He is very pleased with the assistance and cooperation the British fleet has received from the United States and China. At the request of the Chinese government, the British Navy has assisted in mine-clearing operations in North China and the Pearl River, including locations such as Shantou and Xiamen. Currently, the number of ships in China includes four cruisers, eight destroyers, twelve escort vessels, two light transport ships, and several submarines. The fleet's strength is approximately the same as during the war because its duties remain quite heavy, such as protecting Sino-British merchant vessels and guarding ports. Hong Kong will continue to be a British naval base. Admiral Fraser praised the Chinese naval personnel trained in England, calling them exceptionally talented. The UK is transferring a cruiser to the trained Chinese navy, which will arrive in China soon. Other ships will be received after training is completed, as receiving a ship is not an easy task. Chinese naval personnel have been receiving training in England for forty years. After his remarks, Admiral Fraser invited several senior officials to accompany the journalists on a tour of the ship and another similar vessel, HMS "Newfoundland." HMS "Whimbrel" is scheduled to leave Shanghai this Friday and will be replaced by HMS "Newfoundland."

At 5:30 PM yesterday, Admiral Fraser inspected the British naval forces stationed in Shanghai and the flag-lowering ceremony at the British Consulate to commemorate St. George's Day. He specifically invited Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He, Secretary-General Shen, and senior American and Chinese military and political officials to participate. Several hundred British residents and Chinese and foreign dignitaries attended. Mayor Qian, dressed in military uniform, was present, and the British honor guard played music several times, making the ceremony very solemn and dignified. After the flag-lowering ceremony, Admiral Fraser hosted a cocktail party and dinner reception, fostering a very harmonious atmosphere.

### Chinese Tea Association Hosts Banquet for US Presidential Representative: Americans Still Love Chinese Tea

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese Tea Association hosted a banquet at the Jinmen Hotel last night at 7:00 PM to welcome Colonel Harrison, the representative of US President Truman. Shou Jingwei served as chairman. Ms. Smith, the representative of the US-China Commercial Association in China, the tea tycoon Tang Jisan, and Pan Gongzhan, among others, attended. During the banquet, Mr. Shou gave a welcome speech, and Colonel Harrison delivered a reply, stating that Americans have loved Chinese tea for many years. The decline in Chinese tea exports during the war was a great loss for Americans. He hopes that China can continue to supply a large quantity of tea to the United States after the war. Ms. Smith stated that the Chinese tea market has been taken over by Britain, India, and Japan in recent years, mainly because Chinese tea prices are higher than those of other countries. However, Americans have always loved Chinese tea, so she hopes that future Chinese tea export prices can be lowered to regain the market. Mr. Pan Gongzhan expressed: (1) He hopes that exported tea can become standardized. (2) The reasons for the high tea prices are nothing more than high costs, increased interest rates, and deliberate price increases by some speculative merchants. Therefore, he hopes that legitimate merchants can do their best to stop this quickly to develop China's trade.

Two years later, they met unexpectedly, so he reported to the 88th Division Headquarters, which sent troops to arrest Hu and found seven rifles, two wooden Mausers, two pistols, 1,273 rounds of ammunition, and 1.05 million yuan in legal tender on his ship. After being sent to the Military Law Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial, he was found guilty under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clause 3 of the Punishment of Bandits Act and Article 302, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and sentenced to death.

### Bizarre Massacre on Ship Anchored in the Yangtze River: Second-Class Seaman Suffers Mental Breakdown and Causes Havoc

[Report from the United Press International Local News] According to US Navy sources, a major massacre occurred at 3:00 AM yesterday on a US Navy landing ship anchored in the Yangtze River. According to reports, a second-class seaman named Smith, 19 years old, had just left the United States on February 2nd of this year. Last night at 10:00 PM, he was guarding the gangplank on the ship, conveying orders, and went off duty at midnight, sleeping alone. Before long, a mental illness suddenly broke out, and he sneaked into the officers quarters, stole a submachine gun, and carried a pistol he had brought with him, barging into the seamen's dormitory and suddenly firing at thirty seamen who were asleep, firing as many as twenty rounds. When the ammunition ran out, he took out a sharp blade and stabbed wildly before stabbing himself in the abdomen. Seven seamen were killed instantly, and two were seriously injured. The injured men struggled to wrest the blade from him, and another seaman knocked Smith down. Smith had three severe knife wounds to his upper abdomen, and it is not yet known if he will survive. He and the other injured seamen have been transported to the Shanghai Naval Hospital by Navy plane for treatment.

### Umbrella Handle Factory Owner Extorted

[Report from Our Newspaper] Cao Weide, a native of Changzhou, runs the Cao Deji Umbrella Handle Factory at No. 28, TianTong Road Tai An Li. The business is very good, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. At 6:00 PM on the 18th, the factory suddenly received a threatening letter from bandits, using the name "Shanghai Special Branch of the Democratic Party," requesting a temporary loan of 500,000 yuan in legal tender. They instructed that the money be placed in a five-pound Zaikang biscuit tin, with biscuits on top, and left in the house. They would send someone to pick it up in front of everyone tomorrow evening. Cao reported the information to the North Station Sub-bureau, and Chief Li Jiachu of the Criminal Section sent police to wait. As a result, no one came that day. Two or three days later, another letter was received, agreeing to send someone to pick it up between 7:00 and 8:00 PM on the 22nd.

### Such a "Richest" County!

— Our Newspaper's 17th Dispatch from the Air, Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

Nanning Becomes a Kingdom of Merchants

During the Qingming Festival, amidst repeated winds and rains, the depressing days become even more so, and the bustling city becomes more lively day by day. Due to the rapid bankruptcy of rural areas, funds are quickly flowing into the safes of city merchants, and Nanning is no exception. This fortunate city is heading towards a distorted prosperity day by day. Nanning is moving towards prosperity, but crime follows behind it. Merchants dominate everything.

This subtropical small city is not unlovable. After a fresh rain, the brightly green trees lining the streets drip with rainwater. Under the trees are piled high with bananas, loquats, plums, longans, honey pomelos... The small merchants call out in high-pitched voices: "Come on, come on, come get fresh fruit!" It really has a unique flavor. Looking up, the ancient city walls are shrouded in a thin layer of light mist, and the majestic Kunlun Mountains are faintly submerged in the distant clouds. The West River meanders around the ancient city, flowing quietly and slowly. Two or three boatmen, holding pipes, squat on the bows of their boats, chatting idly in the Nanning dialect – Pinghua. Everything is so peaceful, and 80,000 people pass their days there lightly, the busiest only with "business."

Every night, strolling past the rows of brokerage firms along the riverbank, the strong smell of anise oil, star anise, and tung oil stimulates the nerves, and the sound of pouring French silver coins, double eagles, Yuan heads, and copper coins vibrates the eardrums. Merchants, dressed in black silk and holding umbrellas, rush in and out, and money and goods are exchanged on these streets all day long. At daybreak, large numbers of cars set off in different directions, driving to Hanoi and Wuzhou. Those driving to Hanoi smuggled goods through customs and returned with large quantities of foreign goods, like French silver coins. Those driving to Wuzhou carried anise oil and star anise, preparing to wait for ships to go downriver to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The gold business went to Liuzhou, taking Central Aviation planes to fly to Chongqing, Shanghai and other places. The routes are clear and orderly, so the boss's pockets become more and more "mak-mak" (full) day by day.

Although Nanning also has a large river, we have already told you, "It is a quiet West River." It has probably been two months since the sound of steamboat whistles has been heard. Where did the boats go? They were all requisitioned for frequent military transport, and they went east and never returned. Merchants lost a major route for transporting goods, so they had to rely on cars. As a result, transportation companies sprang up like mushrooms after rain. The small city has nearly fifty transportation companies. Whether it's commercial or military vehicles, they won't miss the opportunity, and everyone shares the profits and gets rich.

Drunken Skirts and Tired Red Silks

Precisely because Nanning is purely a kingdom of merchants, even though Nanning is surrounded by shadows of hunger, this small city of two and a half li wide has never lost a bit of its revelry of singing songs and drinking wine, its paper-drunk gold-obsessed atmosphere, everywhere showing a "scene of prosperity." Strolling through the streets every night, there is a restaurant every five steps and a tavern every ten steps. The sounds of yelling and shouting, as well as the cloying, sharp calls and annoying singing of the "goddesses," mix into an evil atmosphere, covering up the misery of the world! Merchants have money and gold bars, so naturally they will enjoy themselves to the fullest. The "Special Areas" (Guangxi's brothels are all euphemistically called "Special Areas," abbreviated as "Special Zones") under the South River are like New Year's Eve every night and Cold Food Festival every morning. Drunken skirts and tired red silks are the unique enjoyment of experts from all walks of life. The "scandal" of a tycoon using a quantity of gold equivalent to the weight of a prostitute to redeem her spread throughout the city. The "romance" of a young gold shop owner buying the heart of a female student with gold has also become excellent conversation material. The word "money" dominates the life of Nanning.

People whose hearts are filled with material desires will not be too disappointed when they come to this small city. Here, there are cinemas, dance halls, and secret "back-rubbing" bathhouses. The smiling dimples and willow-leaf eyebrows of the waitresses in the hotels bewitch your heart, and the frightening number of wandering orioles and swallows in the hotels will make you forget your home and long to stay. There is everything, as long as you have money. It is truly a case of instant obedience to your wishes. When this reporter first arrived in Nanning and stayed in a hotel, a porter even pushed open the door and asked, "Want to play with some wild game?" Pimps for wild chickens. It is said that their rule is that after getting the money, the wild chicken gets 60% and the porter gets 40%.

Another very interesting thing is that Guangxi is a province with the strictest ban on gambling, but in the streets and alleys of Nanning, the sounds of mahjong and pai gow can be heard everywhere. Large gambling dens are controlled by some "powerful groups" and cannot be touched by the government. This is truly the Monte Carlo of the South. Those with a weakness for herding pigs, why not come!

Eating Grass, Squeezing Milk, Abortion Leading to Death

On one hand, there is lewdness and shamelessness; on the other hand, there is serious work. China's civil servants and those who teach are doomed to a life of misery. The scene is bleak everywhere. It really makes one shed tears of sympathy for the teachers who "eat grass and squeeze milk"! There are five private middle schools and one provincial middle school here (recently divided into junior and senior high schools), and two normal schools. The highest salary for teachers in private middle schools is no more than 30,000 yuan. The salary in public middle schools is better, but it is no more than 50,000 yuan or so. Single men can barely manage, but those with families simply complain endlessly. Recently, in the provincial No. 1 Joint Middle School, a female teacher named Lin, who was five months pregnant, really couldn't afford to raise the sixth little life with a salary of 50,000 yuan (she already had five children), so she went to a doctor for an abortion. As a result, both mother and child died tragically, leaving the oldest child only eight years old and the youngest only one year old, calling for their mother in a very miserable situation. As for elementary school teachers, it is even more like bitter gourd stewed with bear bile, bitterness upon bitterness. The nominal salary is 3,000 yuan per month, plus 100 jin of rice, but from January to now, they have not received a single penny or a single grain of rice. Male teachers are forced to set up stalls on the street after class, and female teachers make a living by doing needlework for others. Their plight would make Confucius, if he were resurrected, deeply sigh, "I want to say nothing!" Nanning is the richest county in Guangxi, yet it is like this. The situation in other remote border areas is even more unspeakable.

Students Suffer, Preferring to Go to Jail

Teachers suffer, and students also suffer. The tuition and fees of more than 40,000 yuan per semester charged by private schools go without saying, but public schools are not necessarily a better deal. Tuition is less, but there are many miscellaneous taxes, such as compensation fees, bench fees, bed frame fees... nothing is free, and every fee is expensive. A single charge is 20,000 or 30,000 yuan. The principal then takes this money and gives it to his brother-in-law for general affairs and his godson for cashiering, to operate and operate again, making a big business. They don't care if the students have no dorms to live in, no water to use, or no teachers. It's a complete mess, smoky and chaotic. What kind of school is that? Rice is as precious as cassia (now rice in Nanning only sells for 20,000 yuan, which is considered the cheapest in the province). Sending a child to school costs at least more than 100,000 yuan per semester, which very few parents can afford. As a result, students are constantly dropping out of school. It is common for half of the students to drop out from the beginning of the semester to the end. Normal school students are nominally on government scholarships, but they can only get 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a month. A normal school student said to the reporter with a bitter face, "With this kind of treatment, I would rather go to jail!" The reporter asked him why. He smiled and said, "Because prisoners still have 20 liang of rice rations every day, which is much better than us." Every evening, you can see students, dressed in rags, selling stationery and books at used clothing stalls along Pingdeng Street. Otherwise, how can they afford 15,000 yuan a month for food? There are also many, many poor students, which is a characteristic of Nanning. In fact, it can be said to be a common phenomenon in Guangxi.

The Provincial Government Moving to Nanning is Expected to Materialize

This small city is democratic enough. Newspapers and magazines of all kinds, both pure and mixed, can be seen and bought here. Quite a few pure young people have also begun to be poisoned, dropping their books and pens, rushing to meetings, and brewing up trends. Some time ago, a small group of people with unclear intentions caused panic in this mountain city, but now everything is calm. There are three newspapers in the city: one Central Daily News, one Guangxi Daily News, and one business newspaper run by merchants. Each is a large broadsheet and has its own readers. There are very few bookstores, because most of the bookstores can only be called book stalls, selling goods from 1938 and 1939. Shanghai newspapers arrive once a week, which is indeed very popular.

Recently, Nanning is demolishing the city on a large scale and rebuilding the ring road. Speaking of roads, one thinks of Nanning's municipal administration. Nanning's municipal administration is "roads are uneven, electric lights are not bright, and telephone service is unreliable."

There is talk of the provincial government moving from Guilin to Nanning. If it becomes a reality, the mercantile atmosphere of Nanning will probably be diluted by the political atmosphere.

### The So-Called "Nantong Massacre" Mystery

— …Eighteenth Dispatch, Yao Wei Writes…

Nantong County, located north of the Yangtze River, renowned for its abundant products, honest and simple people, and touted as a model county, since the trumpet of victory resounded and the enemy dragged its miserable shadow away, people began to long for a return to their former peaceful and prosperous lives. However, these beautiful dreams were ultimately shattered by the incessant harassment of the New Fourth Army, leaving the people of Nantong with only a city framework. But the bells of peace have rung, and the Executive Headquarters has finally been established.

The Executive Headquarters arrived on the evening of March 18th, stayed for two weeks, and left Nantong for Rugao on the 31st. Then, some returned to Nantong, some went back to Rugao, and some went to Shanghai. As of now, the government team led by Team Leader Xiao is still in Nantong, while Deng Ke has gone to Huaiyin. The Communist Party representatives are in Rugao. For nearly a month, the two sides have been negotiating without agreement, meeting without discussing, almost reaching a stalemate. Nantong is calm, but the so-called "Nantong Massacre," as reported in the Shanghai newspapers, has left a whirlpool on the quiet lake surface!

Where exactly is the "massacre" "massacred"? Let the reporter first record some facts.

The Agitated Procession

The news of the Executive Headquarters' arrival in Nantong was brought to the city's residents on March 17th. On the morning of the 18th, from citizens to students to civil servants, everyone was busy gathering at the Haier Lane in the West Gate, anticipating the arrival of the Headquarters. Thirty-odd young people were already there, holding the banner of the "Literary and Art Association," shouting "Oppose government-run people's organizations!" when they saw people's groups passing by. When student groups passed by, they shouted, "Students, break free from your cages!" "Those with blood and spirit, come over here!" When crowds of tens of thousands of people passed by, they shouted, "Abolish the Baojia system!" "Oppose household registration checks!" "Oppose one-party rule!" Unfortunately, it rained, and because the Headquarters could no longer possibly arrive before noon, most of the welcoming people could only temporarily suppress their enthusiasm, regroup, and go back to rest, waiting to come again in the afternoon. But a section of the procession began to agitate. Whoever left was "lagging behind," and they were scolded, ridiculed, and roared at. They resisted the cold wind, cold rain, and hunger, shouting and waiting for freedom and light. Young people are easily impulsive, and the psychology of the crowd is blind. Thus, local agitation triggered the entire procession. The leading teachers could no longer make the students obey the rules, because they said, "Today is already a day of democracy!" Democracy meant that teachers could no longer control students, so the teachers left, "liberating" the students, and the students became the "democratic" camp. Thus, amidst the wind and rain, they sang songs and shouted slogans. This continued until 6 p.m., when they finally followed the jeep tracks of the Executive Headquarters and returned. Their basic team consisted of thirty-odd people, plus the so-called "bloody spirited" ones, totaling sixty or seventy people.

The mission of the Executive Headquarters was to mediate military affairs between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Things like "Oppose one-party rule!" "Schools are prisons!" "Oppose secret agent teachers! Secret agent students!" "Abolish the Baojia system!" "To recover the Northeast, first recover Hong Kong!" were unacceptable. At the same time, because it was late, the representatives of the Headquarters should have been having dinner and resting, so after arriving at the guesthouse, Yang, the staff officer representing the government team, went outside and repeatedly and tactfully suggested talking about it again tomorrow. But the mood of the crowd was so extreme that they would not stop until they achieved their goals. Thus, a large crowd blindly rushed to the location of the guesthouse - "Taohua Pavilion" - hoping to meet with the American representative Deng Ke. Deng Ke refused to meet, but after their repeated requests, Deng Ke finally appeared. He also promised the students a tea party the next day (March 19th, 2 p.m.). However, Deng Ke was quite tired, and was followed by a banquet for all sectors of Nantong society. Because of the enthusiasm of the Nantong people beyond all else, the American, Kuomintang, and Communist representatives all enjoyed themselves in the lively music, toasting each other, and drinking heartily, so that all three representatives were somewhat drunk. In addition, Deng Ke had been traveling and rushing around for days, and he caught a slight illness, which ultimately delayed the tea party the next afternoon. At that tea party, Deng Ke did not arrive, but Wu Qing and Fan Fayuan, reporters from the Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency who came with the Headquarters, served as temporary reporters. The students did not raise their hopes, and the two reporters did not have the ability to answer the students' requests. Thus, a disturbance passed.

Sun Pingtian's Disappearance

The matter is like this, but everyone admits that the ending here is terrifying, and it also sows the seeds of the so-called "massacre." On the 25th, a young man named Sun Pingtian disappeared. At the same time, on April 4th, Sun Pingtian's body was found in the river off the coast of Tiansheng Port. This is a mystery, a painful mystery! Sun Pingtian was a young man who had been dismissed for a long time and had served as a reporter for a puppet newspaper. However, he always used the guise of a reporter to participate in various activities. But why did he disappear? Why did he float on the river? According to rumors here, some say it was because Sun Rixin and two others disappeared on the way home on the evening of the 22nd. Since Sun and others were all friends of Sun Pingtian, it was to incite outrage and make them leave. Some say they went to the New Fourth Army area together, but Sun Pingtian was not a communist, and the New Fourth Army falsely accused him of being a troublemaker, subjected him to cruel torture, and tied a huge stone to him and threw him into the river to try to eliminate the traces. Who knew that the spring rains flooded, the river suddenly rose, and the water rushed down, so that it floated to the surface in the river off the coast of Tiansheng Port (Note: Tiansheng Port is upstream, where the New Fourth Army is stationed.) Some say it was a personal feud, taking this opportunity to retaliate, hoping to divert attention. Another said it was a crime of passion involving romance. In short, there are many different opinions. Who exactly did Sun Pingtian die at the hands of? Only heaven knows.

Investigation of the Facts

Here, the reporter made a special trip to interview several responsible parties, soliciting their words about the disappearance of the young people: The first was Luo Yuheng, the principal of Nantong Women's Normal School. Ms. Luo has been in education for nearly thirty years, and has been in charge of the Women's Normal School for nearly twenty years. She said: "I saw in the Shanghai newspapers that two students from the Women's Normal School had been arrested. According to a detailed investigation, there is really no such thing. As for those who asked for leave, there are three or four, but most of them were asked for leave by their parents. Now the students are in class, very quiet, there is no chaotic phenomenon." Regarding the student representatives of the Women's Normal School in Shanghai, Principal Luo said: "I don't know, but this is probably always organized afterwards."

The second is the Provincial Nantong Middle School. Principal Gu went to Zhenjiang to discuss school affairs and did not return. Huang Yingshao, the director of teaching affairs, received the interview. According to him: "The newspaper reported that more than twenty students from our school were arrested. I can't say that. None of the boarding students are missing. Among more than 1,000 students, there are more than ten students who asked for leave, which is naturally not surprising. As for where they went after they asked for leave, the school does not know. However, one of our colleagues, Mr. Qian Sufan, was arrested in the school. The people who made the arrest said, 'We are the Communist Party' when they left. Where did he go? Who arrested him? It's really a mystery!"

Team Leader Ye's Indignation

Xiao, the team leader of the Executive Headquarters government team, returned to Nantong from Shanghai on the 14th. He said: "When I was in Shanghai, I saw news in the Shanghai newspapers about the Nantong massacre. At that time, Chief He also asked me what exactly was going on? I said: There is no massacre or anything at all. At the same time, this news also blames the official for Deng Ke's failure to meet with student representatives. It can also be said that especially me, I have to state that I have no right to interfere with whether Deng Ke meets or not. As for drinking too much, this is something that often happens when people are excited. How can you emphasize that the official got him drunk? The wording is aggressive, and it's too unreasonable!" As he spoke, he was very angry.

Division Commander Liu, Commissioner Xu, County Magistrate Yang, and District Chief Zhang all said this: "We cannot allow the error to exist in the hearts of countless people who do not understand the truth. We must let everyone understand the facts."

Sun Tingchang's Words

Here is another ending, which is a statement published in the "Southeast Daily" in Nantong on April 16th, transcribed as follows: "Sun Tingchang respectfully informs Sun Jingfu and the friends of his young son Pingtian. Regarding the matter of my young son Pingtian, we, the foolish couple, in the spirit of love of our Lord Jesus, have already declared that we do not want to pursue it. Now I hear that in the Shanghai Dagong Daily on the 10th, someone named Sun Jingfu submitted an article in my tone, which is very surprising! I hereby solemnly declare: I hope that Pingtian's friends will no longer take any action in the tone of my foolish couple, so as to avoid external misunderstandings. This announcement." Then, who is the person on the "Dagong Daily" who claims to be Pingtian's father? It's really a mystery! (18th)

Appeals from Various Organizations

According to express mail sent by various Nantong agencies and organizations on the 17th, it is mentioned in great detail about the disappearance of Sun Pingtian, especially recorded as follows: (The signed agencies and organizations are the Headquarters of the 105th Division of the Army, the Fourth District Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu Province, the Nantong County Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Nantong Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Nantong County Government, the Nantong County Local Court, the Jiangsu Provincial Nantong Public Education Museum, the Nantong County Public Education Museum, the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce, the Nantong County Farmers' Association, the Nantong County Federation of Trade Unions, the Nantong County Education Association, the Nantong County Journalists Association, the Nantong Lawyers Association, the Nantong County People's Freedom Guarantee Committee, and the Nantong County Physicians Association.

Sun Pingtian was a reporter for the puppet Central News Agency and the puppet Jiangbei Daily. For several years, under the wing of the enemy, he advocated peace, and was despised by people. After the puppet organization disintegrated, he lost his job and was reduced from a cultural traitor to a local rogue. He was recently assassinated for unknown reasons, but the government, in order to maintain law and order, has already conducted an autopsy and is investigating the murderer. His father, Sun Tingchang, has two sons and two daughters. According to his written statement, he has never been to Shanghai to appeal for his son. The Communist Party is imagining things, using the pseudonym Sun Jingfu, posing as Sun Pingtian's father, and publishing statements to various newspapers, and falsely claiming that Sun Pingtian is a reporter for the New Nantong Daily, in order to place the responsibility for the murder of a journalist on our side, arousing the resonance of cultural figures. The sinister intention is chilling!

After Sun Pingtian was killed, the merchants and people were not disturbed, but the newspaper claimed that a terrifying situation had been formed. The Communist Party is making alarming statements and has other hopes. We respectfully hope that the Shanghai news masters will come to Nantong to inspect as soon as possible to clarify the truth.

The news released by the Communist Party in Shanghai is not even a word or a sentence close to the facts. Sima Zhao's intentions are known to everyone. I hope that the loyal and virtuous people in the cultural and news circles will not be misled by deceptive words. Please see that after the victory, the Communist Party in various places has destroyed transportation and hindered the receipt of surrender. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, cleverly establishing various bloody struggle names, massacring compatriots, and it is difficult to count. Unfortunately, the people in the Communist areas who have suffered their misfortune have recognized their faces, and the urban compatriots who have been deceived by them are still vying to admire them. Social leaders should each base themselves on their conscience, jointly plan for national unity, implement true democracy, and exert transcendent justice to save dying compatriots. The descendants of Yan and Huang rely on this.

The Suffering of Northern Jiangsu!

(1)

Editor: More than half a year has passed since the end of the war, but the plains of northern Jiangsu, which were ravaged by the enemy army for seven years, are now facing another, more terrible enemy after the victory—the Communist Party! This is why half of Jiangsu Province is generally in a state of poverty, hunger, famine, and fierce "struggle" with the Communist Party. Let's take Huai'an and Huaiyin as examples: Since the news of victory spread here, the people were so happy that they jumped for joy, thinking that they could live and work in peace from now on, so they were waiting for the early arrival of the National Army every day. Who knew that in less than half a month, the surrounding Communist army was pressing in step by step, besieging the cities, and successively occupying the two county towns in two weeks. From then on, not only did the hundreds of thousands of people in these two counties have their hopes of living and working in peace dashed, but all the people in the counties occupied by the Communist army were being slaughtered, controlled, devastated, trampled on, and looted... The various phenomena are endless. Therefore, the men and women compatriots in the various counties of northern Jiangsu (referring to the counties occupied by the Communist army) have been fleeing and wandering outward in large numbers since September last year, almost every day. The large number of refugees gathered in the Yangzhou and Zhenjiang areas (the Sooning Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has precise statistics), and the large number of temporary refugee governments of various counties in Yangzhou are an example. The current situation in the so-called "liberated areas" has been described in detail by others. Currently, the fields are barren, the population is sparse, commerce is declining, and the plowing cattle in the countryside have been robbed. The rice seedlings left for planting have also been robbed. One by one, the dilapidated homes have no food, no shelter, and are facing weed-covered wastelands, plowing cattle, plows, and seeds. In January and February of this year, representatives of the gentry in Baoying County appealed to the provincial authorities on behalf of the people living in the city (who could not flee), requesting the Sooning Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate supplies—flour—to provide relief to the people in the city, so as to avoid starvation. This is another example. ——More than two months have passed since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference and the agreement to cease military conflicts, but the Communist Party's actions in northern Jiangsu are still based on its consistent style, "going its own way." On the night when the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department was in Nantong, they still took action to attack Baipu Town. Where is the "ceasefire"? Where is the "negotiation"? The people of northern Jiangsu are truly unfortunate to the extreme. What year? What month? Will I be able to return to my lovely hometown? We now want to shout out and demand that the government unify the military and political orders of Jiangsu, where the national capital is located, and save millions of people from fire and water and put them in a safe place. Chen Qing, a refugee from Huaiyin.

Editor: When writing this letter, tears and pen ran down together. Sir, you do not know the "good governance" of our northern Jiangsu. Now the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has launched a large-scale "struggle." After the struggle, several people are killed. At first, to be honest, I was also a believer in the Communist Party, and I had "respect" for "Leader" Mao Zedong. Now, it is not the same. Of course, I still have extraordinary "respect" for Mr. Mao, respecting "his" great "person" - to be able to let his subordinates do this, and he himself is like a mute, a blind man, and a deaf man! The Communist Party first forced the landlords to give the land rights to the tenant farmers, and then for every four acres of land, the landlord had to pay about ten shi of grain to the puppet "government." The landlords fled one after another, or took risks and did evil in order to make a living. In the areas of Shigang and Rugao, all non-thatched houses were demolished. Destruction is construction, in order to build completely egalitarian houses. Others are taking the bright road of civilization, while they are taking the road of restoring primitive life. If this goes on, the people will have no way to live, and the government still turns a blind eye! Yongbo

### A Number Written in Blood: Fellow Jiangxi Compatriots Thirst for Relief

Although Jiangxi has never had a large-scale battle in the past eight years, it is located at the vanguard of Wuhan, on the right wing of the blood-soaked areas of Hunan, and in the rear of the coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong. At the same time, the Poyang Lake Basin was originally a famous granary in Jiangxi. Therefore, before the flames of war spread to Hunan and Hubei, the counties in northern Jiangxi were ravaged. After the two lakes became war zones and the enemy bandits in Zhejiang and Guangdong harassed the area, northwestern Jiangxi and eastern and southern Jiangxi became areas for enemy troops to detour and harass, and also served as supply areas for enemy bandits to plunder military and refined materials. Therefore, the breadth of its disaster area and the degree of suffering even far exceeded that of other major battlefield provinces. Of the 83 counties in the province, 63 were affected by the war! Here, let's take a look at a number written in blood by the people of Jiangxi during the eight years of war: (According to the Preliminary Summary Report on War Damage in the Province completed by the Statistics Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in January of the 35th year of the Republic of China)

1. Population Casualties: 504,450 people.

2. Property Losses: 935,516,781,856 yuan in national currency.

3. Housing Losses: 372,880 buildings. Among them, the losses in Nanchang City, Yongxiu, Gao'an, Wan'an, and other counties reached more than 75%.

4. Plowing Cattle Losses: 269,184 heads.

5. Transportation Losses: Only a small section of the Gan-Guo-Nan highway remains in the province. Only about 20 vehicles remain in the province, most of which are charcoal vehicles. The Nanxun Road and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road within the province were completely destroyed. Speaking of water transportation, it reminds people of the tragic scene of more than 600 large and small vessels being sunk by the enemy along the Gan River during their retreat last summer. The main dams of rivers and lakes in the province, totaling more than 3,000 kilometers in length, were destroyed by the enemy. Most of them were broken, and dangerous sections were breached everywhere. If the spring water rises sharply, floods will inevitably occur!

6. Industrial and Mining Power: Five heavy industrial plants and eighteen light industrial plants, as well as other private industries, have mostly ceased production. The tungsten and tin mines in Xihua Mountain in Dayu have also been destroyed. The Poyang, Leping, Tianhe, and Fengcheng coal mines have all stopped mining and are temporarily unable to recover.

In short, during the eight years of war, after repeated harassment and ravages by the enemy, more than 76% of the cities and villages in Jiangxi Province presented a picture of such tragic devastation! In addition to the food problem this spring, the prevailing epidemics, and the spring famine that will inevitably form, another thick shadow is cast on this dim picture!

"No food! No shelter! No seeds! No plowing cattle, not even the tools for plowing the land! And we still have to requisition surplus grain! Alas! How are we supposed to live!"

Please listen: This is the cry of the suffering people of Jiangxi demanding relief and demanding to be allowed to live! (Li Guohua from Nanchang)

### Director Wang of the Ministry of Education's Statistics Department Analyzes Wartime Education: Extremely Slow Progress in Peacetime, Sudden and Rapid Advance Due to the War of Resistance

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper] The statistical figures for education at all levels in China after the war have been repeatedly listed in this newspaper. Based on the statistical insights published by Director Wang Wanzhong of the Ministry of Education's Educational Statistics Department regarding the progress of education in the war zones and the Great Rear Area, a summary is recorded below:

National Statistics

(1) Looking at the country as a whole, in the 25th academic year before the War of Resistance, there were 18 million primary school children, 627,000 secondary school students, and 41,900 vocational and university students nationwide. The numbers all increased when the War of Resistance began, and then gradually increased again. In the 32nd academic year (end of July of the 33rd year), there were 18 million primary school students, 1.1 million secondary school students, and 78,900 vocational and university students (end of January of the 34th year). Compared with the pre-war period, the number of primary school students increased very little, the number of secondary school students increased by 75%, and the number of vocational and university students increased by 88%. If calculated based on the average progress from the first year of the Republic of China to the 25th academic year, it would take until the 44th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of secondary school students, and until the 47th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of vocational and university students. Now, thanks to the War of Resistance, it has been achieved more than ten years in advance.

(2) Considering the various provinces, cities, and regions separately, due to the different degrees of war damage, they are divided into (A) Guerrilla Areas, including the fifteen provinces and cities of Liaoning, Jilin, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beijing, and Shanghai; (B) War Zones, including the nine provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi; (C) The Great Rear Area, including the ten provinces and cities of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Xikang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing. Leaving aside the guerrilla areas for the moment, let us now divide the war zones and the Great Rear Area for discussion:

Statistics for the War Zones

(A) Regarding the nine provinces in the war zones, all have suffered considerable damage because some counties and districts have been reduced to war zones, but in addition to primary schools, secondary and higher education have made significant progress. In these nine provinces, the number of secondary school students before the war was 274,000, which increased to 540,000 in the 32nd academic year. The number of vocational and university students was originally 23,000, which increased to 40,000 in the 32nd academic year. If calculated based on the average progress from the first year to the 25th year of the Republic of China, it would take until the 53rd year of the Republic of China to reach this number of secondary school students. Now, thanks to the War of Resistance, it has been achieved more than 25 years in advance.

Statistics for the Great Rear Area

(B) Regarding the ten provinces and cities in the Great Rear Area, the number of primary school students in the 25th academic year was originally 3 million, which increased to 6.76 million in the 32nd academic year, an increase of more than double. The number of secondary school students was originally 107,000, which increased to 340,000 in the 32nd academic year, an increase of three times. The number of vocational and university students was originally 3,700, which increased to 16,200 in the 32nd academic year, an increase of more than four times. If calculated based on the average progress from the first year to the 25th year of the Republic of China, it would take until the 55th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of primary school students, which is now 20 years ahead of schedule. It would take until the 85th year of the Republic of China to reach the current number of secondary school students, which is now 50 years ahead of schedule. The number of vocational and university students was 4,000 in the 20th year, but it decreased to 3,700 in the 25th year. After the war, it gradually increased, and by the 32nd academic year, it had increased sharply to 16,200. The number of years ahead of schedule cannot be calculated. (An)

### Educational and Cultural Circles in This City Welcome Jiang Jianbai

[This City Dispatch] At 9:00 AM yesterday, the educational and cultural circles of this city held a grand tea party at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals to welcome Mr. Jiang Jianbai, the representative of the Ministry of Education stationed in the United States and the educational representative of the National Assembly, who recently returned to China.

Pan Gongzhan's Welcoming Speech

Chairman Pan Gongzhan first delivered a welcoming speech, briefly stating: During the War of Resistance, when the National Army retreated westward, in order to reassure the educational and cultural workers who remained in Shanghai, Minister of Education Chen then sent Comrade Jiang Jianbai as the Ministry of Education's representative in Shanghai, responsible for strategizing everything and fighting against the enemy and puppets. The hardships and difficulties involved are self-evident. Later, due to the increasingly difficult situation, he could not stand his ground, and the central government ordered him to return to Chongqing to continue his educational work. He was then ordered to go to Burma, India, and the United States to work hard for the education of overseas Chinese and to investigate the educational situation in various parts of the United States. Today, we are gathered here, hoping that Comrade Jiang will contribute more of his knowledge of American education for our country's educators to refer to.

Jiang Jianbai's Impressions of Traveling in the United States

Mr. Jiang Jianbai then stood up and gave a speech, briefly stating: Since being dispatched to investigate American education in the 33rd year, he has traveled to important cities and villages throughout the United States. Observing the democratic concepts of the American people, everyone respects each other. Especially in American schools, teachers and students can participate in school administration. This is all due to the correctness of American democratic concepts. It is hoped that our country's education will emulate this approach. Then, Li Ximou, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Baohua, and others successively delivered speeches, which were full of vigilance and moved the listeners. The meeting adjourned near noon, and the principals of various secondary schools later held a public banquet for Mr. Jiang at the Jinjiang Restaurant, where drinks were exchanged and the guests and hosts dispersed with joy.

Art Class of American School Children

Several American schoolchildren are in art class, making small furniture, which is quite the idea of working at entertainment.

### Reading Machine for the Blind Recently Invented by French Professor

[Reuters, London, 24th] French Professor Te Sheng Kuntan has invented a machine specifically for the blind to read books. Documents typed with ordinary printed books, newspapers, or typewriters are placed on the machine, which can automatically emit the phonetic symbols of the letters on the book. Although the blind cannot read with their eyes, they can understand the full text by hearing the sounds. This type of machine is powered by electricity and comes in both fixed and portable versions. Its structure consists of a transparent plane on which the book or document to be read is placed. Below it is an optical instrument that can automatically move back and forth on the book surface, magnifying the letters several times and reflecting them on a rotating cylindrical glass body, which presents white transparent letters on a black background. Due to the change in the letters, the light passes through differently, resulting in vibrations. These vibrations are introduced into another cylindrical electronic device, which is equipped with film equipment. After the vibration of the aforementioned light passes through, it is broadcast through an amplifier, which can transmit the phonetic symbols of the letters into the human ear. The speed of the sound transmission can be adjusted according to the reader's wishes.

### Private School Subsidy Increased to 200 Million

(2) Teachers, regardless of whether they are public or private, will be treated equally in the future. (3) The subsidy for this semester will be increased from 54 million yuan to 200 million yuan. He expressed satisfaction that the private primary and secondary school teachers in this city had not adopted the method of striking, and urged that schools collecting the second phase of tuition fees should be absolutely transparent and reasonably allocated, and instructed the groups to cooperate in reporting violations in order to ensure legality and reasonableness. The representatives still insisted on the original request for the subsidy and discussed for several hours. Finally, Director Gu agreed to do his best to fight for it at the municipal meeting on Friday and reply again on that day. The representatives were satisfied and returned.

### China-England Football Friendship Match - Qingbai Defeats the English Navy - Result 3-2, First Half 2-0

In the China-England football friendship match held at Yiyuan yesterday, Qingbai, riding the momentum of winning two major championships in a row, defeated the English Navy team 3-2. Mayor Qian and General Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, performed the opening kick ceremony for yesterday's match. In addition to Mayor Qian, General Fraser, and their entourage, General Li, General Li Chongshi, Naval Xiamen Fortress Commander Liu Depu, and others were present in the VIP box. The English Navy lineup, except for goalkeeper Le Fumen, who briefly showed his face in the match against Hequn, was all new recruits. Qin Bigaog replaced Yan Shixin for Qingbai, and Huang Shijie was used as the goalkeeper. Cao Qiuting was absent and Luo Shoufu appeared on the field. The match consisted of two halves of forty minutes each. At the end of the match, Mayor Qian presented the guest team with a box of commemorative medals, which were accepted by General Fraser on their behalf. Although the weather was sultry yesterday, with the early summer season approaching, fans still flocked in, numbering no less than 8,000, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic.

Almost a Draw

The English Navy in yesterday's battle was slightly better than the previous few English Navy teams, but they still had more courage than intelligence, and their endurance was quite commendable. Qingbai was strong at first and then weak, not without a hint of complacency. It almost became a draw in the end, which was also quite dangerous. The final result was that Qingbai won 2-0 in the first half, and the English Navy won 2-1 in the second half, with the overall result being 3-2 in favor of Qingbai.

Two Goals Ahead

The match opened at 3:00 PM. After the two sides' lineups were set, referee Huang Renming blew the whistle, and Mayor Qian accompanied General Fraser to slowly enter the field to perform the opening kick ceremony. The mayor first moved the ball and handed it to Fraser, and the battle began. The English army gained the offensive first, and the Qingbai line was full of danger. Fortunately, Wu and Yan two guards did their best to maneuver and did not cause much problems. After ten minutes, Yan Shixin was replaced due to foot discomfort, and Qin Bigao entered the field. The two sides fell into a bitter battle. At 22 minutes, Li Yichen received a pass from Gu Yiche and shot from afar, scoring a goal and taking the lead. Qingbai's offensive then became even stronger. At 35 minutes, Li Sikao used the same trick again and broke the net, making it 2-0. The first half ended with Qingbai leading by two goals.

Qingbai Victory

In the second half, the English Navy's lineup remained unchanged, while Qingbai made many adjustments. The English army was determined to retaliate, and with its strong endurance, it charged left and right, which was quite impressive. At ten minutes, Owens slammed into the net, and Huang Shijie failed to save it. After 2-1, Qingbai had to put in more effort. At 25 minutes, Li Yichen received a long pass from the center back line, got the ball and shot, leveled, and sent it straight to the enemy's goal, Qingbai took the lead with two goals again, 3-1. The English army did not give up at this point, and finally Moore scored a goal to end the game, with the overall result still being Qingbai winning 3-2.

The Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory basketball team, a group of more than ten people, went on a long expedition to Hangzhou, departing on the 19th and arriving on the same day, immediately enjoying the famous scenic spots. On the 21st (Sunday), in the morning and afternoon, at the Zhejiang Provincial Sports Field in front of the palace, they separately fought against Zhejiang University and the Liangzhe Salt Administration team. Many spectators came to admire them, and the afternoon was particularly crowded, with an enthusiastic atmosphere. As a result, they won both matches. The team was led by Zhang Yixiang and returned in triumph on the afternoon of the 22nd.

At 10:30 AM on the 21st, the match against Zhejiang University, with Yang Shannong as the referee, started. Hualian led all the way, but Zhejiang University resisted fiercely. In the first half, Zhejiang University was behind 12-20. After switching sides, Hualian's Zhang Liangxiong shot accurately and repeatedly made great contributions. Zhejiang University could not support it, and the difference became further apart. At the end of the match, Hualian won 48-20, marking a successful start. At 3:00 PM, they played against the Liangzhe Salt Administration team at the same venue.

### Ten Trends in American Education (Continued)

— Jiang Jianbai

(V) New Planning of Work Experience in Secondary Education: Recently, there has been a common trend in American education, namely that secondary education should pay special attention to acquiring work experience. It is generally believed that past secondary education was often impractical, placing too much emphasis on language training. Nineteen out of twenty secondary school graduates failed to enter university, and one-half of secondary school students did not complete high school. Urban secondary school students account for more than half, while rural secondary schools also account for more than half. Urban and rural secondary school students have not been closely linked to their possible years in school and the actual social needs after leaving school. Schools themselves have not been able to complete the training of work experience for young people entering society, nor have they been able to use various social undertakings to train students, resulting in no benefit to both society and individuals. Recently, educational organizations and leaders in secondary education have planned two supplementary secondary schools adapted to urban and rural areas. Each school focuses on the major industrial, commercial, agricultural, and domestic affairs of the city and countryside, and utilizes existing organizations in various industries in the city and countryside. According to individual needs and educational necessities, a central curriculum is adopted. Work experience courses are available from the beginning, but in smaller amounts. In later grades, these courses increase. Basic courses are available from the beginning, but these courses decrease in later grades. In addition, there are elective subjects for basic courses and work experience courses. For example, students who cannot continue their studies after completing the third year of junior high school are guided to select work experience subjects related to their interests in the third year. Students who can still go to college after graduating from high school are guided to select basic subjects. In this way, each grade can meet the requirements for employment and further education, and at the same time, each grade can learn work experience closely related to society. This is a flexible adaptation system. This type of school is called a flexible mixed secondary school, and the future trend may include vocational education, which is a new development that is bound to occur in the future.

(VI) Extension of the Number of Years of Education: The previous section explained the new planning of secondary education, which focuses on the work experience of most students. However, there are still many students who, even after graduating from high school, only about 70-80% go on to further education. Those who cannot go on to further education experience several phenomena: 1. It is not easy to find work. 2. Due to the increase in work standards and technology in various industries and businesses, young people need to improve their educational training. 3. Because the current age for high school graduation is 17 or 18, they are legally under 20 years old and have not yet formally obtained the rights of citizenship. During this transitional period, the state has a responsibility to bear. In order to assume full educational and legal responsibility for young people, the state should provide them with adequate education. Therefore, for high school graduates who can go on to further education or employment, there is the establishment of free intermediate colleges, with a duration of two years, with equal emphasis on general training and vocational training. During this period, if the student's family has better financial conditions, they can still enter the third year of university; otherwise, they can go out and find employment more easily. There are currently more than 600 intermediate colleges, with a small number run by private organizations, which is sufficient to illustrate this trend, which is steadily increasing.

(VII) Promotion of Intermediate Colleges and the 6-4-4 System: The previous section explained the extension of the number of years of education for young people and the establishment of intermediate colleges. This trend is related to the 6-4-4 system in secondary schools. Currently, the 6-3-3 system is the most common in the United States, and the 8-4 system is still common. Due to the establishment of intermediate colleges, there are two common phenomena: the 6-3-3-2 and 8-4-2 systems. Recently, in order to adapt to needs and seek adjustments, the 6-4-4 system has been established, which combines the six years of secondary school and the two years of intermediate college into eight years, divided into two four-year periods. That is, one year is added to the original three years of junior high school, and two years are added after the second year of the original three years of high school, so that those who cannot enter high school can get an extra year of primary education, and those who can enter high school can get two extra years of education. The main purpose is to improve the level and adapt to needs. This system is being implemented and has won the sympathy of the general education community, and will become a new type of school system.

(VIII) Advocacy of Humanistic Education: Universities and secondary schools have felt in the past that the division of labor is too detailed, dividing the entire body of knowledge into several fragments, so that the whole cannot be seen. As a result, students know one thing but not the other, and they cannot see the details of the principles of being a person, doing things, and the responsibilities of society and the country. Therefore, things must be reversed when they reach the extreme, and so-called general education has begun to be emphasized. For example, the Teachers College of Columbia University has for several years changed the required basic subjects of education, psychology, philosophy, politics, society, and economics into a mixed general course. Harvard University has established a committee to study ways to remedy deficiencies, and has determined that general education must be implemented in the first and second years of university, and in subsequent years, the basic cultivation will progress to gradual specialization. Yale University also has the same determination, and this is also necessary in secondary schools. Specialized vocational training must be rooted in basic general training. Therefore, the latest educational goals are set in four categories: namely, self-understanding, relating to others (humanities), social responsibility, and economic responsibility. This is closely related to the above-mentioned extension of the number of years of education for young people and the establishment of central courses, and will be the forerunner of future curriculum reforms.

(IX) Substantialization and Universalization of Vocational Education: The development of vocational education has produced several common trends: 1. Close connection between schools and industry and commerce. 2. Industry and commerce can utilize the talents trained by schools. 3. Training focuses on the specialized skills of a certain industry, and conforms to the conditions required by actual workers in industry and commerce. 4. Attention is paid to unit design, which is decided by the students themselves. 5. The precision of vocational guidance can truly meet the needs of students and solve some personal and professional problems. 5. Most of the teachers are selected from the industrial and commercial sectors and given educational training, so the teaching is practical. These items can be called substantialization, and will be strengthened in the future. Secondly, since the enactment of the Vocational Education Act of 1917, each state has a special management department. In the past ten years, the funding has increased to 600 million, with 2 million students. There are more than 8,000 industry organizations for vocational students. In addition to agriculture, industry, commerce, and domestic affairs, vocational subjects have been popularized to public affairs, health, transportation, safety, and social cooperation, family organization, and infant care. All undertakings that are beneficial to life will be included in vocational education. This can be called universalization, which is another trend in the future development of vocational education. Moreover, the development of vocational education and the above-mentioned general education seem to be contradictory, but vocational students are set up for those who cannot continue to receive general education, and must tend to specialize. However, in vocational education itself, there are recently many who advocate the appropriate implementation of general training, and there is a tendency to approach it in the future.

(X) Promoting Teacher Organizations and Improving Professional Training: The hardship of the teaching profession is the same everywhere. The income of most teachers in the United States is less than that of ordinary intermediate workers. From an economic standpoint, the development of industry and commerce is endless, while teachers have a certain limit. Therefore, the bargaining power of workers' unions against employers is huge, which has attracted the sympathy of teachers, and many teachers have joined as members. Many teacher groups have joined as joint bodies. The purpose is to unite forces to protest various inequalities in society and to gain a leading position. Many educational leaders believe that organization is power, and teachers should have teachers' organizations. The status and responsibilities of teachers are different from the nature of workers, and teachers should have independent organizations. With the power of this organization, the appropriate union and propositions should be determined according to the nature of each event. Each organization itself should have a strong belief, that is, to use the power of education to awaken the public, to exert popular power, to eliminate various social, political, and economic pressures, in order to seek the development of education and their own security. In recent years, educational organizations in the United States have sprung up like mushrooms, among which the Teachers Union, the Progressive Education Association, and the National Education Association have a wider range of activities and greater strength. Many leading figures in the American education community participate in the leadership, and the power of teacher organizations may occupy a leading position in the country in the future. However, in order to do so, teachers' own education and work efforts are necessary conditions for improving their own status and strengthening teacher organizations. Now almost all elementary school teachers are college graduates, and almost all secondary school teachers are graduate school graduates. The improvement of professional training has become a reality. Organization, training, and service are the driving force behind teacher welfare and security, and are also the overall goals of teachers' efforts in the future.

The above ten points are based on the major ones and existing trends. Other things, such as the universal military training of young people, have been proposed by the authorities and some educators, while others have opposed them. The underlying reason is not the military training itself, but the unwillingness of the federal government to obtain educational administrative power as a result. In the future, depending on the needs of the times, it may be changed to half a year or three months per term, and handled by federal personnel in consultation with various schools. Furthermore, the promotion of international culture and the advocacy of cooperative education are all needs of the times and have not yet become fixed, so they are not listed.

### Big Players Lead, Small Investors Follow: Government Bonds Reach New Highs, Target Set at 120 Times, Police Raids Do Not Help

Government bonds reached new highs again yesterday, and there is no other reason to explain it except for the so-called manipulation by big players in the industry. The buyer's target remains unchanged, aiming for the end point of 120 times. Retail investors felt that the profits were considerable and followed suit. The narrow bond market is prone to ups and downs. Tong Bing opened struggling above 5,800 yuan, and was then pushed up by buying, rising gradually from 5,700 yuan, and seeing a high price of 6,250 yuan again, after which it became slightly static. As a result, it closed 500 yuan higher than the previous close. Miscellaneous brands, because Tong Bing had soared for many days, were generally chosen as cheaper options yesterday, bringing up quite a few, with A, B, and D each rising 700-800 yuan. E was hotter, jumping 950 yuan alone. Transactions are still in guerrilla style, so police officers can only disperse them from time to time, and the situation was serious for a while, but they were soon released after being caught and warned.

### Chinese Stocks Trend Weak, Foreign Stocks Also React: Yi Sha and British United Both Fall

The trend of Chinese stocks has weakened, and the state of madness is no longer seen, so general hot money has become tired of it over time, and interest has gradually decreased. The initial firmness of each popular stock has continued to weaken, not deviating from the old tune of the previous few days. Small-cap Qin Xing launched itself with Xin Guang as the target, hoping to achieve something because the three hot companies were holding meetings at the same time. Yesterday, Xin Guang fell in the market, and Qin Xing continued to advance, and the distance between the two narrowed again. I don't know what the always active Xin Guang authorities think. When it was in its best state at the beginning, Yong Sha was 5,280 yuan, Mei Ya was 4,400 yuan, Jing Fu was 445 yuan, and Xin Guang was 390 yuan, and then it gradually shrank, while Qin Xing rose steadily after 300 yuan, going in the opposite direction. The colder China Underwear received attention and the situation was slightly better. The results of the afternoon close compared to the previous close were flat for the three hot stocks of Yong Sha, Mei Ya, and Jing Fu, Xin Guang fell 11 yuan, and Qin Xing rose 20 yuan alone. The cold stocks were generally stable, but underwear rose slightly. It is said that the company will specialize in wholesale afterwards, save expenses, and sell off the facade to recover the shares. Foreign stocks are still within the scope of securities gangs, and have reacted slightly. Small amounts of floating inventory in the hands of foreign merchants were released at high prices, and high prices could not last. Yi Sha once saw 15,400 yuan on the market, and then fell back. People in the securities gang saw that the situation was not good, and paused slightly, selling some of them off, and then struggled around 15,000 yuan, and the situation turned sideways. The afternoon close was slightly lower than the previous day for each popular stock. British United retreated behind Yi Sha again because the old were releasing slightly. The rise and fall of small stocks were slight.

### Yarn Prices Generally Rise: Yangtze River and Wenmin Areas Are Selling Well

Yesterday, the yarn market became more solid. Although the Yue and Tianjin gangs did not purchase in large quantities, customers from the Yangtze River and Wenmin areas purchased sporadically, which was very enthusiastic. Most of the 20-count yarn were sold out and short, and generally rose by 10,000-20,000 yuan. 16-count was also selling well. Fine yarn was very mediocre, but 32-count Hong Yu single yarn rose by 80,000 yuan alone yesterday because the yarn was left over from a Japanese factory and had been repeatedly sold by auction by the Spinning and Construction Company, and had been sold out last Friday. The industry searched for it at low prices because there was no auction price yesterday afternoon. The Spinning and Construction Company opened 30 types of old cotton cloth and 17 types of American and Mexican cloth yesterday. It will sell woolen fabrics, beiges, and cotton yarn as usual today.

### Gold and Banknotes Are Mediocre

The gold bar opened at 1.56 million yesterday morning, and after opening, it fell slightly to 1.54 million. Afterwards, the demand for supply was scarce, and the market was stable. Until noon, it hovered around 1.55 million. The silver houses slightly accepted, and the situation was slightly firmer. The result was similar to the previous close, and the trend was balanced. The silver houses listed gold ornaments at 166,000, silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were still flat. The underground dismantling of silver funds was relaxed, and the interest rate was from 10% to 15%. It was still not easy for those with funds to find a counterparty.

Foreign currency US dollars were slightly weaker in the middle of yesterday. It opened at 2,160 yuan with sellers, and saw a low price of 2,135 yuan after opening, and then gradually stabilized. At noon, it hovered around 2,160 yuan, with little trading, and the process was extremely mediocre. It continued to be stable in the afternoon, and the result was slightly higher than the previous close by 10 yuan. Hong Kong banknotes were newly flat and old ones were stable. Hong Kong exchange rate was 420 yuan with sellers. General foreign firms can now directly order Robi for Indian cotton settlement, and the previous method of settlement through Hong Kong can be removed, so Robi was 520 yuan to 540 yuan, and those who settled were slightly more enthusiastic.

### Spot Cotton Trading Is Still Smooth

Yesterday, the New York American Cotton Telegraph newspaper fell 17 to 29 pounds, calculated at 27.65 for near-term American dollars, 27.82 for forward, and 28.26 for Metering spot. Spot cotton trading in this port is still smooth. The Silk Spinning and Construction Company also began to absorb about 1,000 bales of Metering, and the industry's decorative trading is not lonely. The market price is higher than before.

### China Sugar White Rises Strongly

Yesterday, the price of white sugar continued to rise strongly. The association's initial quotation in the morning was 54,000 yuan, then rose to 55,000 yuan, and further rose to 56,500 yuan in the afternoon, but there were not many sellers, and the asking price was 58,500 yuan. Raw sugar was quoted at 52,000 yuan, and other sugars were cheaper.

### Artificial Silk Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the market price of rayon rose generally by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan due to the stimulus of the rationing price. 120 Tianqiao opened at 1.4 million yuan and closed at 420,000 yuan, which was 10,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Miscellaneous brands of semi-gloss and 150 glossy rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The market price of factory silk did not change much. The industry traded slightly. Five loads of Qianjing were transacted at 1.32 million yuan. The price of American Asia quilt surface in the silk market was stable, and Dazheng grid crepe showed a slight improvement. Hang Su goods were in short supply. Recently, the exchange rate has been very strong, and Linji wax feather yarn is 1,800 yuan per yard.

### Rice Prices See Slight Retraction, Flour Price Increase Resurges

Yesterday, the rice market continued to have supply, and the digestion was flat. Japonica and indica rice both retracted slightly by about 1,000 yuan, and Baiyuan also retracted by slightly more than 1,000 yuan. Other grains, on the other hand, went in the opposite direction and rose unanimously. Flour from Shantou and Ningbo competed for supplies, and the demand was very strong. The price rose sharply by 2,000 yuan, and the supply still could not meet the demand. The oil market also saw active zeroing, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybeans added another 500 to 600 yuan, bean cakes saw a tight supply of 100 to 200 yuan, and bean skins had a very smooth sales path, rising another 500 yuan. Red beans were slightly advanced by the Hong Kong gang, and still hovered at a high peak. According to the rice market, yesterday this city arrived with seven types of white japonica, totaling more than 6,000 shi. The types and number of shi are as follows: white japonica 2,845 shi, Du Xian 826 shi, Yin Yuan 25 shi, Yang Xian 56 shi, early rice 1,502 shi, thin rice 1,365 shi, Bai Yuan 175 shi.

Also, according to rice industry news, 30,000 shi of food rice will arrive here gradually within the next week. The market price of this batch of rice, which was collected by various rice firms and merchants in this city at the beginning of this month, is roughly only half of the current price, so the procurement cost is quite low. Once it arrives in Shanghai, the supply of spot goods on the market can be increased, and the price of rice will definitely fall at that time. At the same time, the various rice-producing areas are now relying on farmers to release large quantities of stored rice for cash, so it seems that it has become much easier for rice merchants to handle goods, but there are slight obstacles in water and land transportation, and it is still necessary for the relevant authorities to cooperate effectively. According to a rice industry giant, although the total amount of food stored in this city has not been accurately counted, it is quite considerable and sufficient for the needs of the entire city for a long time.

### Many Rice Merchants Still Seeking Funds

The food funds in this city have been obtained by the Bean and Rice Industry Association, with 100 million yuan being distributed by the chairman of the association, Wan Lin, to sixteen designated companies, including Wanchang, Heng Taifeng, Guangye, Yong Shuntai, Zhifeng, Xin Chang, Santai, Jiangbei Company, Changjiang Company, and Tongyi Company, with 60 million yuan per company. Another company, Fukang, received 40 million yuan. The other seven companies, including Xinfengsheng, Shuntaide, Quantai, Tairun, Rongfeng, Daxing, and Yongyu, have not been allocated loans and will jointly request the Office of the Special Commissioner of Food Administration, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Senate to treat them equally and provide them with loans.

### Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth Shipped to Guangdong

The China Merchants Bureau's Haibao Wheel left yesterday for Guangdong, carrying more than 2,680 pieces of cotton yarn, 880 pieces of cloth, and more than 1,300 bags of raw peanuts. Also, the Taikoo new wheel Fujian will sail to Tianjin for the first time today, carrying more than 11,000 pieces of American cotton, which will be shipped to Tanggu.

### Egyptian Gold Decontrolled

[Reuters Cairo 23rd] According to an order issued by the Egyptian Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the export of Egyptian gold and gemstones can be resumed.

### Coconut Oil Plummets

Industrial raw materials saw a slight increase in the price of caustic soda compared to last week due to purchases by customers and manufacturers. The price of coconut oil plummeted from 300,000 to about 200,000 due to the large number of arrivals in Hong Kong, with few transactions. Only talcum powder rose to 400,000 per ton due to the lack of spot supply.

### United States Assists Allied Reconstruction, Seeks to Lift Export Controls, Congressional Opinion Is Counterproductive

[Reuters Washington 23rd] According to the Commercial Daily, the US State Department will seek to lift certain export controls in order to assist the economic reconstruction of Allied nations. This attitude is contrary to the views of people in Congress, who believe that the export of scarce commodities will hinder domestic recovery and housing plans. At the same time, some in Congress have proposed banning the export of timber and textiles, but it is believed that the US government will firmly oppose this, and these proposals are unlikely to pass. The State Department believes that domestic housing plans should not be interfered with, but banning the export of washing machines, radios, and vacuum cleaners would hinder US relations with Allied nations. Conversely, lifting export restrictions on certain important machines, such as bearings, could help Allied industries recover sooner without having to rely entirely on US supplies.

The newspaper also said that Commerce Secretary Wallace, when meeting with reporters, explained the department's recommendation to extend the Export Control Act for another year, saying that the department had to continue to implement controls on exports, given the great need for certain scarce commodities for domestic consumption. Wallace continued: Congress and the general public believe that even if the Department of Commerce cancels export controls, this matter will be difficult to implement due to the de facto need for export restrictions. However, the department has made every effort to reduce the export goods that need to be restricted as much as possible.

### U.S. Silk Market Competition Between Japan, China, and Italy

[United Press, New York, 22nd] According to the Commercial Daily News, some major silk merchants have announced they are willing to pay a maximum of nine dollars per pound for newly imported Japanese silk. The batch of raw silk totals 2,600 pounds and is currently under inspection by Holbaggen. According to the inspection company, the silk is valued at approximately $2 million, or six dollars per pound. This Japanese silk is the initial import, with future monthly arrivals expected to reach 10,000 bales (133 pounds per bale), imported by the government-owned U.S. Trading Company. The silk will be sold within a few weeks. Women's hosiery manufacturers and other silk fabric producers are increasingly impatient with the Office of Price Administration's failure to revise or remove price ceilings. Hosiery manufacturers claim that the sale of raw silk will be delayed until retail price ceilings are removed or modified. Raw silk price ceilings were removed in January of this year. Some manufacturers hope silk stockings can be available by the end of May. The Commercial Daily News also reports that three large batches of Japanese silk, several batches of Chinese silk, and three batches of Italian silk are expected to be shipped to the U.S. before the end of this month. The first batch of Italian silk comprises 783 bales, weighing 54,612 kilograms. Market reports indicate that Italian silk can be sold for $10.75 to $11.25 per pound, while over 600 bales of Chinese silk are expected to arrive within the month. Chinese and Italian silk are purchased by silk merchants, while Japanese silk imports continue to be managed by the government.

[United Press, New York, 22nd] Eastern U.S. silk fabric manufacturers anticipate that competition from imported silk from China, Japan, and Italy will lower prices in the U.S. and other world silk markets. According to a report from the International Statistical Bureau's market advisory division, the recent high prices of raw silk and silk products are expected to decrease significantly but will still be higher than pre-war levels. The government-owned War Assets Corporation sold 3,000 bales of surplus raw silk in February of this year at $11.75 per pound. However, hosiery manufacturers offered as much as $22.25 per pound for high-quality silk.

### Tianjin Industries Resolve to Stabilize Finances

To stabilize the financial situation in Tianjin, major commercial organizations in the city recently convened a meeting of relevant responsible parties. It is reported that six measures have been resolved: 1. Gold shops are prohibited from large-scale trading of pure gold and from arbitrarily setting prices. 2. Grain merchants are prohibited from hoarding food or engaging in speculative sales. 3. Securities firms are prohibited from speculative trading and manipulating market prices. 4. Businessmen in all industries must operate within their primary business and are not allowed to engage in businesses outside their industry. 5. Non-businessmen are prohibited from accumulating debt. 6. Government officials are strictly prohibited from engaging in business. It is reported that the above six measures will be implemented after being reported to the competent authorities for record-keeping and then announced for enforcement.

### Excessive Taxation on Chinese Goods in the Philippines: Ad Valorem Tax is Too Unfair

The volume of goods exported from our country to the Philippines is increasing daily. However, in addition to goods subject to specific duties, those subject to ad valorem taxes bear an excessively heavy burden. This is because the Philippine customs authorities still calculate taxes based on an exchange rate of one Chinese yuan to 0.45 U.S. dollars. Thus, goods worth 1,000 yuan are converted by Philippine customs to 450 U.S. dollars, equivalent to 900 Philippine pesos. For example, ready-made garments are subject to a 25% ad valorem tax, so a T-shirt worth 1,000 yuan in Chinese currency, equivalent to 450 U.S. dollars, would be taxed at 112.5 U.S. dollars (i.e., 225 Philippine pesos). This increases costs and impacts sales. It is reported that our consulate in the Philippines is negotiating with Philippine customs, requesting that calculations be based on the exchange rate quoted by Chinese banks, which is 0.5 U.S. dollars or 1 Philippine peso per 1,000 yuan. However, there has been no response from Philippine customs.

### Hong Kong Stock Exchange to Reopen

[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] The Hong Kong civil government is scheduled to be restored within the latter half of this month. Business figures here hope that Hong Kong's economic status, which has seen significant progress, will continue to shine. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which was not allowed to open during the provisional military government's administration, will now reopen. Hong Kong's securities and stocks will reappear on the Shanghai, London, and New York stock markets.

### U.S. Needs Hog Bristles: Question of Export Tax Reduction/Exemption Submitted to the Tariff Commission for Review; Britain Also Transporting Bristles from Chongqing to Hong Kong

Hog bristles for export account for a major portion of our country's exports. Before the war, our annual hog bristle exports were approximately 100,000 piculs. In recent years, American industry has developed rapidly, and hog bristles have a wide range of industrial uses. Therefore, the United States has a strong need for them, and this need will undoubtedly increase in the future. The U.S. relies primarily on our country for the supply of hog bristles, accounting for 60-70% of our total exports. Recently, it has been reported that the New York hog bristle market is experiencing high demand and limited supply. The market price once rose from $2.56 (USD) to $3.50 per pound. Now, with more goods arriving, the price has gradually fallen to $3.12. According to traders, the price of Chinese hog bristles in New York will likely hover around $3 for some time and is unlikely to change significantly in the near future.

Among hog bristle businesses in our country, the Sichuan Livestock Products Company enjoys a strong reputation overseas. During the war, the company focused on purchasing in the southwest. After the victory, it actively expanded its operations, establishing offices in Hankou in Central China, Tianjin in North China, and Shanghai in the Southeast region. In the past six months, the company has shipped approximately 5,000 piculs of standard hog bristles to the U.S. With large quantities of bristles now entering the market in various regions, the company is actively engaged in purchasing. According to the manager of the Shanghai branch, Mr. Zhi Xiang, the company can purchase 20,000 piculs domestically this year to be shipped to the U.S. for sale. Recently, the price of bristles per picul in the domestic market is over 600,000 yuan in Chongqing (based on the 27th grade), over 700,000 yuan in Hankou (based on the 17th grade), 540,000 to 550,000 yuan in Shanghai (lower quality, still based on the 17th grade), and 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in Tianjin due to better quality.

The hog bristle producing regions in our country, including Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, produce approximately 20,000 piculs annually, Central and Southeast China produce 15,000 to 16,000 piculs, and North China produces 70,000 to 80,000 piculs. The total production is likely over 100,000 piculs. Currently, foreign businesses are the strongest force in purchasing and shipping bristles in the Tianjin area, so they handle the largest quantities. Packing hog bristles for shipment from Shanghai to the U.S. costs over 40 U.S. dollars per picul (the cost is higher if transshipment is required). The export tax is 0.75%. An additional 0.25% in Huangpu surcharges is added for exports from Shanghai, totaling approximately 1% in taxes. The company has 2,000 to 3,000 piculs of hog bristles still in transit from Chongqing to Shanghai. It is reported that the current hog bristle inventory in Shanghai is extremely low, with only over 1,000 piculs awaiting export. Therefore, the current hog bristle price standard in Shanghai still depends on the production areas and the New York sales market.

[Additional News] Regarding the recent request from hog bristle export companies to the authorities to reduce or exempt hog bristle export taxes, it has been confirmed that the Ministry of Finance has submitted the request to the National Tariff Commission for further review and consideration of reduction or exemption. An official announcement will be made in the coming days.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] A reporter recently inquired of Mr. Mackinder, the Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Trade, whether the authorities have taken steps to airlift Chinese hog bristle stocks to the United States. Mr. Mackinder replied that some hog bristles have already been airlifted from Chongqing to Hong Kong, awaiting shipment to Britain.

### The Inevitable White Man

— Original by Jack London, translated by Lu Mang

[“The black man will never understand the white man, and the white man will never understand the black man, until the names by which the black man calls the black man and the white man calls the white man are abolished.”]

Captain Woodward said this. We were in the conference room of the Charlie Roberts Hotel in Apia, drinking Abuhumanda for a long time, which was mixed for us by the Charlie Roberts mentioned above, and he drank with us. He declared that this mixing method was passed down directly from Stephens, who was famous for inventing this Abuhumanda wine when he was being urged on by the Nile River—this Stephens was responsible for 'achieving the dismantling of Tum,' and he died in the siege of Ladysmith.

The elderly Captain Woodward was fat and short, with forty years of scorching tropical sun behind him. He had the most beautiful, watery brown eyes I had ever seen in a man, speaking from his extensive experience. The crisscrossing scars on his bald head testified to a close encounter with black men's axes, and similarly indicative of a close encounter were the front and back of the right side of his neck, where there was a visible hole once pierced by an arrow. According to his explanation, he was somewhat hasty in that matter—he couldn’t pull the arrow out. He felt he couldn’t remove the arrowhead for a moment, so he pulled out the shaft as it had been shot in. At this time, he was the mate of the Sapei, a large steamer that was transporting workers from the West to the German colonies in the Samoan Islands.

“Half of the disputes are due to the stupidity of the white man,” Roberts said, pausing to take a big gulp from his glass and cursing a Samoan busboy with familiar words. “If a white man would only allow himself to understand a little bit about what the black man is thinking, most of the troubles would be eliminated.”

“I have seen some people who claim that they understand the black man,” Captain Woodward replied, “and I always noticed that they were the first ones to be eaten. Just look at the missionaries in New Guinea and the New Hebrides—the island of martyrs in Erromanga, and all the rest. Just look at the Australian expeditions that were cut to pieces in the jungles of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. And just look at the merchants themselves, with twenty years of experience, boasting that no black man would ever find their heads, and their heads still decorate the oak trees of those canoe houses today. There was also Old John Simmons—spending twenty-six years on the uncivilized border of Melanesia, swearing that he understood the black man like he understood a book, and that they would never harm him. But he ended his life by Lake Malofu in New Georgia. His head was sawn off by a black woman and an old black man with only one leg (the other leg was lost in the mouth of a shark when he went into the water to catch fish blasted with gunpowder). There was also Belivo, who had a terrible reputation for killing black men, a character whom even a devil would be afraid of. I remember lying on a small corner of New Ireland, you know, when the black men stole half a can of tobacco for sale—causing him a loss of about three and a half gold dollars. He wanted revenge, shot dead a big black man, destroyed some of their war canoes, and burned down two villages. Also in the small corner, four years later, he and the fifty Bukou lads he hired to catch sea cucumbers were attacked by surprise. Within five minutes, they were all dead, except for three lads who escaped in a canoe. Don’t talk to me about understanding the black man. The mission of the white man is to develop the world, and that is busy enough for him. What time does he have left to understand the black man?”

“That’s right,” Roberts said. “After all, it seems that understanding the black man is not entirely necessary. The white man’s development of the world is the direct result of his stupidity—"

“And putting the fear of God into the black man's heart,” Captain Woodward blurted out. "Maybe you're right, Roberts. Maybe it's his stupidity that makes him successful, and one manifestation of his stupidity must be his inability to understand the black man. But one thing is certain, the white man cannot but rule the black man, whether he understands them or not. It is inevitable, it is destiny."

"Of course the white man is inevitable—this is the black man's destiny," Roberts interjected. "Tell the white man that there are pearl clams at the bottom of some lake, surrounded by ten thousand cannibalistic people yelling, and he will go there alone, with only five or six Hawaiian divers and an accurate alarm clock, all squeezed like sardines into a light, five-ton double-masted boat. Just whisper that there is a gold deposit in the Arctic, and that same inevitable white-skinned creature will set off immediately, with shovels and picks, salt pork, and the latest model of windlass—and, well, he will get there. Tell him that there are diamonds in the fiery fortress of hell, and Mr. White Man will go to make a ruckus at the fortress, and make old Satan himself engage in the work of picks and clocks. All that is caused by stupidity and inevitability."

“But I don’t understand what the black man thinks about that—that inevitability,” I said.

Captain Woodward was smiling quietly. There was a light of memory in his eyes.

"I am not understanding what the black men of Mariu are thinking about that inevitable white man, who was on our ship when we sailed there on the Duchess, then and now," he explained.

Roberts mixed three more glasses of Abuhumanda.

"That was twenty years ago. His name was Saxdorf. He was really the most stupid man I had ever seen, but he was as inevitable as death. That guy could only do one thing, and that was shoot a gun. I remember the first time I met him—right here in Apia, twenty years ago. That was before you came out, Roberts. I was sleeping at the Dutchman Henry's Inn, which is now over by the market. Where had he been? He made a lot of money smuggling arms to the rebels, sold his inn, and was shot dead in Sydney six weeks later, in a bar fight. (To be continued)

### Morning

— Chen Gange

The clouds lifted the rising red sun, and the dimness of the night gradually fled from the depths of the river.

The herdsman led out dozens of warhorses again, quietly strolling on this green hillside, spreading his hands and watching the unburdened horses. He turned his head and neighed for a while, and gradually scattered, leisurely... The herdsman smiled, no longer remembering the tension given by the past war, but felt a slippery sensation on his feet. Looking down along the shadow, it turned out to be the dew of early spring, shaken off by his loose cloth shoes, wetting his toes from the green grass!

A burst of lingering bugle calls echoed and broke the silence of the earth.

The sun turned white, and the smoke from early morning cooking gently rose into the sky.

### The Scent of Soil

— Yang Mou

The clear sky pushed away the gloomy, long-raining, dreary curtain, and the light shone in every corner, stirring up the universe's activity.

The grasses and trees sprouted a slight green, and people all seemed a century younger. Listen, the birds are singing! Look, the birds are worshiping!

"We have met another spring!"

"This is a real spring!"

A real spring! I also smelled the scent of the soil!

Friends! Can you smell it? On the vast lawns, or the flat plains of the wilderness, there is a scent of soil.

Don't think this smell is unpleasant; it is the mark of the highest beauty!

Soil, the mother of mankind. It nurtures countless lives, for us to admire, for us to enjoy. Soil, the mother of mankind. Whether noble or lowly, we will all quietly rest in its embrace.

Compared to the soil, our lives are so small, so insignificant. But it loves us equally, caresses us, its whole life dedicated to us.

Friends! Have you ever smelled the scent of soil? Spring has come, and it is again exerting its full strength, doing its work.

But what about us? Friends!

### Ode to Beautiful Women

— Tang Liyan

Southeast region of scenic splendor, site of six dynasties' prosperity. Young nobles picking flowers, unrestrained sons dropping whips, vying in song and dance arenas, amidst rouge-painted ranks. There are Qin Towers and Chu Mansions, Yue Maidens and Wu Belles, with light and heavy makeup, competing for beauty, rapid pipes and urgent strings, metal castanets and bronze drums. King Chen ultimately was sullen and unhappy, looked left and right and sighed, leaned on the armrest feigning sleep, concentrated and was one with his spirit, as if someone, gracefully emerged. This person was ample with surplus, gentle as boneless, her song as fairy dew and bright pearls, dawn wind and remnant moon, a fairy maiden of the ninth heaven, leaving a lingering echo in the human world, a lone wild goose at night, bringing sad wind to the treetops. Moreover, she was as slender as willows, radiant as lotus flowers, her eyes like flowing lightning, her skin like solidified grease, gazing at distant mountains like dark eyebrows, her spring intention as intoxicating as butter, as if treading waves of the Luo River, neither smoke nor mist, suspecting a witch cloud entering a dream, seeming to be there and not to be there. Thereupon King Chen was eagle-like and vigorous, raising his cup to invite the moon, composing a song for a beautiful woman, singing: The beauty beckons me at the edge of the clouds, I want to follow her but the road is long and arduous, the heavenly wind is rustling and cannot but feel cold, turning sideways to gaze east and tears flow in abundance. Gonggan calmly regarded everything, also harmonizing with words, saying: Beauty, oh beauty, I don't know if you are evening rain or morning clouds? I want to follow you but the Milky Way has no ford! The curved moon hangs diagonally before the window, suddenly seeing plum blossoms I suspect it is you, so they sang alternately, melancholically returning.

### Double Flying (29)

— Zhao Qingge

Li Yun did not answer, but handed the letter to Mrs. Mo.

Mrs. Mo couldn't read, so she had Bao Ling read it to her. It said:

"I am now returning to Beijing with Shi Yulou! I don't want to tell Xiao Yun, and I certainly can't take her with me. Fortunately, you are here, so I specially entrust her to you, hoping you will consider our sisterly affection and raise her for me. There will be a day of repayment in the future. To avoid causing a stir, please forgive me for not saying goodbye in person."

It turned out to be a letter of entrustment. After Bao Ling finished reading, she exclaimed in surprise to Li Yun:

"What? Your mother ran away?"

Li Yun cried even more upon hearing Bao Ling's question.

"Say less!" Mrs. Mo spat at Bao Ling. She held Li Yun and comforted her, "Don't cry, Xiao Yun! Move to your aunt's house today and live here. Your aunt will be your mother from now on! Your aunt will love you." After saying this, she asked Li Yun, "Did your mother give you this letter? Does your father know?"

Li Yun finally spoke. She shook her head and sobbed:

"No, this letter was given to me by my father. Mother left this morning. My father actually saw Mother leaving. But Father said he pretended not to see it. Mother left the letter on my bed. After she left, Father woke me up and told me, 'Mother won't be coming back.' He told me to take this letter and find my aunt. I immediately wanted to chase Mother back, but Father wouldn't allow it. He said, 'It's good that Mother left, it's better that she left sooner!'"

"Strange, what does your father mean by this? He wants your mother to leave sooner. Does he want to marry a third or fourth wife?" Mrs. Mo said indignantly.

"Uncle Weng always sleeps in the morning, how come he got up so early today?" Bao Ling interjected, asking Li Yun.

"I don't know," Li Yun replied to Bao Ling, equally puzzled.

At this moment, Mrs. Mo felt very conflicted. She didn't object to Mrs. Weng's departure, and she had expected it would happen one day. Mrs. Weng had also hinted at it to her intentionally or unintentionally. But she felt a sense of farewell! Because Mrs. Weng had been with her for more than ten years, and now she suddenly left, she naturally couldn't help but miss her! At the same time, she thought about her future days, which would become even more lonely because of this! So she also somewhat selfishly resented Shi Yulou!

Perhaps Mrs. Mo was also a little jealous of Mrs. Weng. She had secretly said to herself: If she were ten years younger, couldn't she also be like Mrs. Weng – "gone"? But she was old, and no one would want to take her away. Also, her son was already grown up, and she couldn't abandon him. All her hopes in life were pinned on her son. She had to wait to enjoy her son's blessings, she wanted to get the price of her half-life sacrifice from her son. Although, at present, she could only possess half of her son, the other half being invaded by Mr. Mo, she believed that after Mr. Mo's death, her son would ultimately belong to her. Thinking of this, Mrs. Mo quietly felt happy and relieved again. At this time, she looked up and saw Bao Ling standing right next to her. She saw Bao Ling's fair face and bright eyes, and felt boundless comfort and love! So, in a gentle tone that she hadn't used in days, she affectionately called out to Bao Ling:

"Bao Ling!" Mrs. Mo called out blankly, and then felt it was a bit meaningless. With a flash of inspiration, she found a topic to change the subject and said gently. "Go to your godfather's place and bring your cousin's bedding over. Tell your Uncle Weng that Mother is keeping your cousin Yun to live in our house for a long time."

Bao Ling agreed and walked out.

### Replies to Readers — Legal Inquiries

Shen Liming asks: Mr. A and Ms. B have been married for just over a year. Mr. A used to work as a porter. Once, after Mr. A left, it is unknown whether he was arrested for carrying contraband or for some other accident. It has been over two years since then, and there has been no news. Ms. B has no means of support and has long since returned to her mother's house. Now, Ms. B's mother wants to remarry her. Is this legally permissible? Please advise.

Lawyer Ya Xia replies: Mr. A has already married Ms. B, so Ms. B can only remarry after this marriage relationship has been terminated. "Now Ms. B's mother wants to remarry her," which is not in accordance with the law. Because the law stipulates that "a person with a spouse shall not commit bigamy." If Ms. B herself wishes to remarry, she must wait until Mr. A's whereabouts are unknown for more than three years and apply to the court for a divorce from Mr. A before she can do so.

Xian Zhu Xuan asks: The reader mortgaged four bungalows belonging to Deng on November of the 21st year of the Republic, agreeing on the day that the mortgage rent was 800 silver dollars, and the monthly rent was 4 silver dollars, with a fixed term of five years. At the end of the term, the landlord Deng should return the original mortgage price to the mortgagor Gu in full. A contract was drawn up, with each party holding a copy. When the five-year term expired in November of the 26th year, the landlord Deng did not prepare the money for redemption. Later, because of the war that year, the reader moved west with the government. It has been over eight years since then. Both parties urgently need to resolve this matter. The following solutions are proposed: (1) Since the house has not been redeemed within the time limit, who owns the ownership? Does it belong to the landlord or the mortgagor? (2) If the ownership of the house still belongs to the landlord, how many times the original mortgage price should the landlord redeem it for? (3) The reader wants to increase the original mortgage price of 800 yuan tenfold, i.e., 8,000 yuan, and establish another pawn contract with a term of five years, calculated from the date of the contract. (4) If the landlord cannot resolve the above-mentioned matters satisfactorily, can the reader resort to law? Please provide a detailed answer.

Lawyer Cao Ya Xia replies: (1) According to Article 923, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code: "If the mortgagor does not redeem the mortgaged property at the original mortgage price within two years after the expiration of the mortgage term, the mortgagee shall obtain ownership of the mortgaged property." However, Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration, which was promulgated and implemented on December 18, 1945, stipulates: "If the period for exercising rights stipulated in the Civil Code or other laws cannot be observed due to war, the rights may still be exercised within two years after the implementation of these regulations." Therefore, the ownership should still belong to the house owner. (2 and 3) The law does not stipulate this. The two parties should consider the social and economic situation, the living conditions of the mortgagor, and the extent of the losses suffered due to the war, and decide through negotiation. (4) If resorting to law, you can follow the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration: "If, after the establishment of a legal act, circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should fairly measure and make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects." You can request the court to make a judgment to increase the payment.

Seeking a Specialist Doctor to Treat Deafness

To the editor: My daughter has been mute since childhood, only able to produce simple sounds. Upon closer examination of the cause of her muteness, it is entirely due to the lack of sensitivity of her eardrums. She can usually hear loud noises, but cannot absorb soft sounds at all, so she has no opportunity to learn language. Recently, I read an article translated by Mr. Liu Zudong in the 22nd volume, 8th issue, of the Students' Magazine published by the Commercial Press, "Deafness Restored," from the February 1945 Reader's Digest, which says: "Open a small window in the back of the ear, take a piece of cartilage from the outer ear, trim it, and install it in the small hole, then paste the inner ear membrane previously pulled and tapped to make it firm. The cartilage plug acts as a new stapes, which can transmit sound to the inner ear..." This makes me feel that my daughter's defect can certainly be saved. Shanghai is a concentration of scientific talent, and there should be outstanding doctors who can perform this type of surgery. I would like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to solicit on my behalf, so that my daughter can be cured and restored to hearing. This would be entirely due to your column. If you can enable those with the same condition to meet a savior, it is not only I who would be grateful. Sincerely, Cheng Enxian, at the Social Service Column of Shen Bao.
