[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] After the Morning Post published Special Envoy Marshall's earnest statement on the current situation yesterday, the heavy atmosphere in Nanjing gradually dissipated. People in Nanjing, both Chinese and foreign, expressed their admiration for Special Envoy Marshall's unwavering determination to achieve peace in China. Sensitive observers generally believe that the overall situation will become clearer with the new developments in the military situation in the Northeast. Therefore, reopening the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting to openly discuss the issues at hand is particularly timely. It is reported that this morning, after Shao Lizi and Wang Shijie held talks, Shao and PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen jointly hosted a luncheon for CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, Li Weihan, and Deng Yingchao at the National Assembly Hall at one o'clock in the afternoon. At that time, the two sides gradually approached a consensus on reopening the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting, and the door to serious political negotiations will slowly open.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Shao Lizi told our reporter tonight that the PCC Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting, formerly the Guo-Gong talks, can begin on the 22nd. The government and CCP representatives have agreed to meet on the 22nd. The government representatives Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Cui, Zhang Lisheng, and Wang Shijie, and the CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Dong Biwu, Lu Dingyi, and Li Weihan will all attend. If government representative Zhang Qun cannot make it from Shanghai in time, another person will be sent to participate in the talks. It is understood that the government representatives of the PCC who went to Shanghai will soon accompany the PCC representatives from the Democratic League and the Youth Party to Nanjing. After the representatives arrive in Nanjing, the date of the Comprehensive Subgroup Meeting can be determined. It is possible that the meeting will be held this weekend.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Government PCC representative Shao Lizi and PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen hosted a luncheon on the 21st for CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Lu Dingyi, and Li Weihan, and invited Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, and Zhang Lisheng to accompany them. However, Zhang Lisheng did not attend due to other matters.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Government PCC representative Wu Tiecheng visited CCP representatives Dong Biwu and Li Weihan at Meiyuan New Village on the morning of the 21st. It is said that Wu's visit was a return visit.

### Marshall Meets with Zhou Enlai; Earnestly Hopes Both Sides Will Stop the Propaganda War

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] At ten o'clock this morning, Zhou Enlai drove to Special Envoy Marshall's residence at 5 Ninghai Road for further talks lasting about two hours. It is reported that after listening to Zhou's statement of the CCP's latest demands, Marshall explained the necessity of strengthening the authority of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters with a fair and earnest attitude. Marshall affirmed that only by increasing the prestige of the Executive Headquarters can the work of military mediation not be in vain. Marshall also reiterated his sincere hope that both the Guo-Gong parties would stop the propaganda war. It is reported that Yu Dawei was also present during Marshall's meeting with Zhou Enlai today. The meeting lasted two hours and seventeen minutes. The four and a half hours of talks at Marshall's residence on Ninghai Road and the regular meeting room of the National Assembly were the most active and concrete consultations of the PCC since the return to Nanjing.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] CCP leader Zhou Enlai and Special Envoy Marshall held a two-hour meeting today to discuss the Northeast issue and maintaining peace within China. The two also reviewed the huge plan to divert the Yellow River to restore its pre-war course. The CCP has established a concrete agreement for this huge project, which will include residents of the CCP border area. The details of the talks were not released, but it was announced that the talks would resume tomorrow. This was Zhou's first meeting since last week, when the talks were interrupted due to his illness. He has now apparently fully recovered. Zhou will also meet with the new Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei tomorrow to discuss a truce in the psychological warfare in domestic propaganda.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The presidium of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee nominated representatives Zhang Jingyu, Hu Ding'an, Zhang Daoxing, Ta Yifeng, and Sun Yichang, accompanied by Zhou Shennong, head of the National Assembly Committee's reception section, to meet with General Marshall at noon on the 21st to exchange views on the current situation. Marshall frankly explained the current situation and expressed his willingness to make his best efforts to promote China's peace and unification.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Special Envoy Marshall issued a blunt warning yesterday about the Guo-Gong parties engaging in propaganda that promoted hatred and suspicion without reservation. According to sources close to Marshall, Special Envoy Marshall has spent painstaking efforts in Nanjing and Chongqing for weeks mediating peace with various parties, but the propaganda of the Guo-Gong parties has made the situation more chaotic. Marshall had no choice but to make this direct expression, but it was the first time he had publicly criticized both the Guo-Gong parties. The Ministry of Propaganda had originally drafted a reply to Marshall's statement and submitted it to the Central News Agency for publication, but later withdrew it. The Central government said that the party hoped to have a news agency to engage in propaganda warfare, but since the party has no newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai, Marshall's criticisms do not apply to the party.

[Another Dispatch] After Special Envoy Marshall expressed his opinion yesterday, criticizing both the Guo-Gong parties for engaging in propaganda warfare, he met with Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei and Zhou Enlai one after another today. At the same time, various newspapers have also responded to Marshall's words yesterday.

### Anhui Provincial Provisional Assembly Members Report on the Disaster Situation in Eastern Anhui

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Anhui Provincial Provisional Assembly and the Association of Fellow Provincials in Beijing hosted the press at 3:00 PM this afternoon. First, Cheng Xuming, a member of the Provisional Assembly, reported on the disaster situation in thirteen counties in northeastern Anhui (Sixian, Suxian, Lingbi, Sihuo, Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Zhuoshan, Xuyi, Chuxian, Lai'an, Tianchang, and Dingyuan). He stated that after the northeastern Anhui region was ravaged by the enemy, it fell to the Communist army. Six of the thirteen counties were occupied by the Communist army, and important towns in the other seven counties were also captured by the Communist army. The Communist Party launched a struggle between the rich and the poor in this region, implemented various perverse policies, and forcibly conscripted young men. The people, unable to bear the disturbances, rich and poor alike, fled with their families. Currently, there are more than two million refugees in northern Anhui and along the Yangtze River and the Shanghai-Nanjing area. This situation is still developing, and the number of refugees will increase day by day. These refugees are concentrated in Bengbu, Mingguang, and other places, where they are most numerous. Because they have all been exploited by the Communist army, all their property has already been looted. Therefore, they are homeless and without food or clothing. The Provisional Assembly, seeing the severity of the disaster situation, specially sent Assemblyman Cheng and others to Beijing to appeal to the Executive Yuan, making five requests: (1) Increase relief supplies, (2) Establish relief stations, (3) Provide small loans, (4) Build refugee dormitories, and (5) Establish refugee complaint offices. After Cheng's report, Director Ye of the Anhui Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Anhui National Assembly representatives Qiu Xisheng and Li Xianying, and Senator Shen Shixiong, among others, gave reports. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] The conflicts in Anci and Panggezhuang in the Pingjinbao triangle area may escalate into a full-scale war in Hebei. The CCP side of the Military Mediation Department sent a memorandum to the government side this morning, stating: "The Communist army in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region cannot sit idly by and watch the development of the war in Anci and other places, and in the future, it cannot guarantee that the transportation lines in Pingjinbao and other places will not be destroyed." It is also learned that the Communist army in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region has separately increased troops to the Ping, Jin, Bao, and Shi areas. However, except for minor conflicts, the traffic situation on the Pingjin Railway Line and the northern section of the Pinghan Road is still good.

### Four People, Including the Captain of the Weining Gunboat, Executed for Demanding Money and Illegally Carrying Passengers

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The former Naval Headquarters' Weining gunboat towed the No. 1 iron barge on December 25, 34, loaded with files, goods, and personnel of the department, sailing from Chongqing to Nanjing. The captain of the boat, Li Mengyuan, took the opportunity to solicit dozens of passengers, collecting 200,000 to 370,000 yuan per person. Wang Xuehai, a staff member of the department, Chen Qifu, a gunner on the boat, and Zhang Fengshan, the chief of the iron barge, also took the opportunity to illegally carry many passengers, demanding more than 200,000 yuan per person. Because the boat carried too many passengers and was overloaded, it ran aground three times en route. When it arrived in Anqing, fearing being discovered by superiors, it forced the secretly carried passengers to disembark. Subsequently, the Ministry of Military Affairs discovered the previous situation and ordered the naval authorities to detain Li Mengyuan, Wang Xuehai, Chen Qifu, and Zhang Fengshan and hand them over to the military law department of the ministry for interrogation. After confirming the facts, they were sentenced according to law and submitted for approval. All were sentenced to death. At 12:00 AM on the 21st, the convicts Li Mengyuan, Wang Xuehai, Chen Qifu, and Zhang Fengshan were brought to the court for sentencing, verified their identities, tied them to the execution ground, and executed by shooting.

### Traitor Miao Bin Executed in Suzhou; Enticement of Li Changjiang to Surrender to the Puppet Regime was the Main Reason for His Death

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] After the Supreme Court ruled to uphold the original verdict of the death penalty for traitor Miao Bin, the Jiangsu High Court transferred the traitor to the No. 3 Prison in Shizikou and executed him by shooting on the 21st. At 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Li Shudong and Secretary Wang Yaxiong from the High Court arrived at the execution ground inside the No. 3 Prison to supervise the execution. At 5:00 PM, when the bailiffs brought the traitor Miao out of his cell, he was wearing a blue serge lined robe, gray silk patterned lined trousers, and new black satin shoes, with a clean face, as if he had just been made up. After Prosecutor Li announced the execution order and asked if he had a will, Miao looked calm, took out two letters, one addressed to his parents and the other to his wife, and instructed the prison servants to inform Zhang Ma, who lived at No. 3 Nanxuelong, Cang Street, Suzhou, to stop sending food. At 5:15 PM, the prosecutor ordered Miao to kneel in the center of the execution ground. Miao repeatedly shouted "Die for the country" incessantly. The bailiff executed the sentence, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth, killing him instantly.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] The Supreme Court's review ruling was only delivered to the traitor Miao's cell in the No. 3 Prison at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Traitor Miao was still unaware that death was imminent, so he wrote to his defense lawyer, Ji Fusheng, asking him to come to the prison for a visit to discuss other methods. In the original letter, there was a sentence, "Please quickly inform the above-mentioned Committee Member of the detailed situation," which presumably referred to directing his family to directly seek help from the Chairman. The reporter read the full text of the Supreme Court's ruling, which deeply condemned Miao for enticing Li Changjiang to surrender to the puppet regime. Although Miao had new counter-evidence, he ultimately could not escape death. This point was the main reason. The so-called law values being neither unjust nor lenient. Even if Miao had minor merits, it could not cover up his guilt.

It is learned that the Hangzhou-Huzhou bus of the Provincial Transportation Management Office, for strict prevention, has negotiated with the Provincial Security Command to send a team to protect the vehicle to maintain the safety of passengers, which has already begun to be implemented.

Kunshan

Suzhou

Suzhou Tap Water Actively Preparing

The establishment of tap water in Wuxian County is being actively prepared and has progressed to a considerable stage. Although the mechanical water pipes are supplied by the Good Rescue Headquarters, the factory site has been designated to be rebuilt from the agricultural tool manufacturing plant outside Xumen. The capital is also planned to be at least 100 million yuan, with 70% public shares and 30% private shares, raised through the Baojia method. The labor will be utilized by prisoners. The Rectification Committee held the second meeting on the 19th, and the project personnel have been determined.

Dongshan Primary School is in urgent need of rescue. The county-owned primary schools in Dongshan District are now facing a new measure decreed by the county government, requiring them to bear half the regular monthly expenses of the schools themselves, and half from the Education Department in tandem with the location in which the school is located. As of the start of the new semester, only half of the funding for monthly expenses has been issued from the Education Department, while funding from localities remains on paper for the past four months, rendering payment impossible to execute. As such, the instructors have elected to strike uniformly in the form of filing a grievance with the district office. Consequently, an agreement was reached to appropriate a portion of the income stemming from fruits and produce of this year; however, that harvesting period remains a faraway prospect, and cannot satiate those of whom are starving. A telegram has been sent to associations from Dongshan residing in Shanghai for a prompt influx of capital. Also, instructors have been pleaded with to give weight to education and return to teaching forthwith.

Editorial

### Marshall's Special Envoy's Warning

Yesterday, Marshal Marshall issued his first official press statement in Beijing since arriving in China, pointing out that the malicious propaganda of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, spreading suspicion and jealousy, has further deteriorated the already serious situation. The result is that the Chinese people will suffer great disasters. The work of the mediation executive group is particularly difficult due to this propaganda deeply penetrating the officers and soldiers of both sides, and whether the struggle in China can be stopped or at least localized depends on the efforts of the mediation executive group. Since his arrival, Special Envoy Marshall has been working tirelessly to mediate, and the Chinese people sincerely express their gratitude and expectation for this five-star Marshal's diligent work day and night. Marshal Marshall is an outstanding military statesman. Since arriving in China, he has been down-to-earth and hardworking, not indulging in empty talk. This spirit is especially admired by the Chinese people. The document issued in Beijing yesterday was Marshal Marshall's first official press release since arriving in China, aimed at pointing out that malicious propaganda only breeds hatred and suspicion, further deteriorating the situation and making the work of the mediation executive group difficult. We cannot help but express our sympathy for Marshal Marshall's statement. Indeed, the role of malicious propaganda is only to sting emotions and increase hatred and suspicion, making the situation increasingly worse. Propaganda that only stings emotions is not only of no help to the overall situation but is also extremely harmful. We deeply admire Marshal Marshall's outstanding insight in raising this point in his first official press release since arriving in China. Since Marshal Marshall's statement mentioned that the harm of malicious propaganda would cause great disasters to the Chinese people, standing from the perspective of the Chinese people, we would like to briefly express our views.

First, the Chinese Communist Party, like communist parties in other parts of the world, is a master of propaganda, and they use various methods to devote themselves to their propaganda. Not to mention anything else, just looking at the Xinhua Daily published in Chongqing, one can know how they are launching their propaganda strategy. The American warships transporting the National Army to the Northeast is a kind of rumor that one ally supports another, either saying that the US military is participating in China's "civil war" or that the US military is attacking the Communist army. All this is for the original purpose of the Communist Party, and there is no need to elaborate. Looking at the past facts, the Communist army launches a propaganda offensive after occupying a place, followed by practical action; the so-called "Central Plains War" is a clear proof. As for the Kuomintang side, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and restricted by the domestic and international situation, it never deigns to use propaganda offensives, at most only carrying out appropriate defenses when necessary. The Communist Party fabricates rumors excessively, and denies them when they are pointed out, but it has never launched propaganda offensives as frequently as the Communist Party; therefore, some people, including some foreigners, are quite dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's passive attitude. Therefore, the past expansion of propaganda was initiated by the Communist Party, and this is a point that must be raised regarding responsibility.

Second, since the previous malicious expansion of propaganda was initiated by the Communist Party, we sympathize with Marshal Marshall's statement, and to curb the continuation of this malicious propaganda, we must first hope that the Communist Party can abandon the propaganda strategy it has adopted in the past. What Marshal Marshall pointed out is correct, and our personal feelings are the same as Marshal Marshall's. To prevent the overall situation from deteriorating further, all malicious propaganda must be stopped. In the past, the Communist Party has worked hard to launch a propaganda offensive of jealousy and hatred, so to stop all malicious propaganda, the Communist Party must abandon its usual propaganda strategy. Therefore, we cannot help but feel regret for the word "both sides" used in Marshal Marshall's statement. It is clear that one side is using propaganda strategies, but the word "both sides" is used in Marshal Marshall's statement. This may be a necessary diplomatic rhetoric, but the result is enough to boost the arrogance of the Communist Party and achieve its propaganda attempts. Marshal Marshall, as a third party, is inconvenient to favor either side, but right and wrong must be distinguished, and responsibility must be clear. What's more, the Communist Party's actions are aimed at subverting the government. According to legal theory, one side is treason, and it cannot be mentioned in the same breath at all. Now there are "both sides".

Third, the Chinese people, especially those who have fled from the "Liberated Areas," generally have a deep understanding of the Communist Party and criticize the Communist Party; this is the people's will, and no government can suppress the people's thoughts and words, and China is no exception. The Communist Party's record in China is not something that any true Chinese can praise. The crimes of killing, arson, and all kinds of evil deeds are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Chinese. It can be said that hatred of the Communist Party is the general feeling of the Chinese people. Although the Communist Party has its vast controlled areas, the rule of these areas is based on all its force, not on the hearts of the people. The percentage of true party members of the Chinese Communist Party in the total population of the country can be said to be extremely low—less than one percent, so the fate of China must not be determined by the Communist Party. The reason why the Communist Party has its current dominance is due to the fact that some foreign observers do not understand the intentions of the Chinese people and give it an excessive, inappropriate, or over-estimated evaluation. This situation must be corrected before China can have lasting stability.

I remember when Marshal Marshall first came to China, we hoped that Marshal Marshall would give the Chinese people at least what Lafayette gave the American people. Undoubtedly, the current situation in China cannot be compared with the situation in America at that time. This is a more difficult task, but with Marshal Marshall's talent and wisdom, there are no insurmountable difficulties. We hope for Marshal Marshall's success, China's lasting stability, and the world's lasting peace. The key to this lies entirely in this. We look forward to it so eagerly, that we cannot help but express it so earnestly.

### Facts Speak Louder Than Words

In the past few days, the domestic political situation has been so dull that it seems to have entered a state of suspended animation. Although there are constant discussions about reopening peace talks and continuing negotiations, on the other hand, the drums of military conflict are loud, one wave after another. Although friendly people are running around and calling for help, doing their best to mediate, I am afraid that they may not be able to save the current critical situation, which is truly regrettable and hateful. Chinese and foreign newspapers have detailed the conflicts in various places, but yesterday we received a letter from Lu Dingyi, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party, stating that he denied some reports about the Chinese Communist Party issued by foreign journalists.

Although we people belong to the third party, we are still the masters of the country. At a time when the country is in a critical situation, we should not continue to be confused, not ask about the truth, and blindly shout to stop the civil war, without any sense of right and wrong; but we should raise our vigilance, face reality, keep our eyes open, and clearly see who is playing with soldiers and making trouble? Who wants to resolve it by force? And who should be responsible for the conflict?

We do not want to waste any more words, so-called facts speak louder than words, please see the following facts.

(1) In the Northeast, the Communist army blatantly disregarded the troop reorganization plan, using the name of the "Democratic Allied Army" to seize Changchun and Harbin with force, attempting to expand its territory and occupy the entire nine provinces of the Northeast, and would never let go. Now the Communist Party is chanting "unconditional ceasefire" in order to force the government and the mediation party to recognize its accomplished facts. Fortunately, the National Army has recovered Sipingjie yesterday, and the two cities of Changchun and Harbin are expected to be recovered within a week.

(2) In North China, war is even more widespread, with beacon fires everywhere. The Beining Road has been repeatedly damaged by the Communist army, and it is covered with scars and unusable. Now the Communist army has transferred troops from Hebei and Chahar provinces to reinforce Rehe, launching a major offensive; in addition to occupying Beipiao, it has also attacked Chifeng, which is currently blocked by the National Army east of Chengde. In the Pingjin area, there is a sense of impending crisis, and it has been heavily surrounded by the Communist army. After the Communist army attacked Mentougou, it is only seventeen miles away from Beiping, causing panic among the people, and the city gates are closed early every night; Tianjin is also in the same state, within ten miles outside the city, there are traces of the Communist army, and everyone is on alert, making people even more panicked.

(3) In the northern section of the Jinpu Road, the clouds of war are also dense. The Communist army occupied Cangxian Bozhen, and the war was fierce, and the southern section is also in the midst of war.

(4) In Shanxi, the Communist army is fiercely attacking Shuoxian endlessly, and Datong is also feeling threatened.

(5) In Shandong, after the Communist army launched a major offensive, it successively occupied the two cities of Mingshui and Longshan. Although the ceasefire agreement in central Shandong has been established, who can guarantee that the Communist army will not attack again! Therefore, Jinan and Qingdao cannot be said to have turned the tide.

(6) In northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is ready to make trouble. The Communist army has been clamoring for attacking Yangtai Nantong and other cities for more than a day, and the refugee youth from northern Jiangsu are scattered all over the south of the Yangtze River and have become a large group of pitiful and helpless refugees. Who is to blame?

The above are all ironclad facts, which cannot be denied by a statement from the Communist representative. Also, yesterday Special Envoy Marshall warned both sides not to take malicious propaganda anymore. The Communist Party spokesman actually said that this was not directed at the Communist Party, and attempted to shirk the responsibility for malicious propaganda to others. Who can believe the words of the Communist Party?

### Iranian Representative Reports to the Security Council That the Soviet Union Continues to Interfere in Iranian Internal Affairs. The Security Council Resumes Meeting Yesterday to Discuss It Again.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: The Security Council resumed its meeting in New York at 3:00 p.m. today to discuss the Iranian issue. The Soviet representative did not attend. The Iranian representative submitted a report requesting that although Soviet troops should withdraw from Azerbaijan province before May 6, the Soviet Union has continued to interfere in the internal administration of Azerbaijan province in the past two weeks. As for whether Soviet troops have changed their uniforms and mixed in with the troops of Azerbaijan province, Iran cannot conduct an investigation. At the time of the broadcast, the meeting was still in progress.

[United Press New York, 21st Telegraph] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to discuss the Iranian issue tomorrow. This issue originally had hope of being resolved soon, but now Iran has accused the Soviet Union of not stopping interfering in Iranian internal affairs, so the hope of resolution has become weak. According to a report submitted to the Security Council by Iran's ambassador to the United States, Arle, last night: If the rumors that armed conflicts have occurred in the strategic area of northern Iran are true, then international peace and security will obviously be seriously threatened immediately, but he has not received any news of conflicts between the central government army and the army of Azerbaijan province. So far, the Iranian government is still facing obstacles and cannot exercise its functions in Azerbaijan province, and the Soviet Union's interference in Iranian internal affairs has not stopped. At the same time, the Soviet Union's chief representative to the Security Council, Gromyko, has already stated that he will not attend tomorrow's Council meeting. This is the third time for Gromyko to take such action.

### Iranian Civil War is in Progress. Sadana Claims It Was Only a Small Contact. He Has Ordered Troops Not to Advance Further.

[Our Newspaper News] London, 21st Broadcast, According to sources from Ankara: The Iranian civil war is still in progress in the area south of Urmia Sho on the Azerbaijan border. The Dabriza radio station stated: The troops of the province have repelled the Iranian army's offensive. On the other hand, the Iranian Prime Minister has ordered the Iranian army to stay at the location in front of the line and not to cross the line.

[United Press London, 21st Telegraph] Iranian Prime Minister Sadana today broadcast a strict order to the Iranian army, warning them not to continue to advance along the border of Azerbaijan province. According to the radio station, the Prime Minister has established a committee to prevent continued conflicts, and announced that some people accused of causing disturbances will be tried by a military court.

[Central News Agency, Tehran, 20th, United Press Telegraph] Iranian Prime Minister Sadana admitted that the government army and the Azerbaijan army had started a war. The Dabriza broadcast stated that on the second day of the Iranian army's offensive, it appeared to have had a small-scale border contact. The Dabriza broadcast stated: The leader of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party, Hili, announced that the province has entered a state of war, and the U.S. government has advised local American expatriates to leave.

[Blank Space Twenty-first Telegraph] Iranian Prime Minister Blank Space last night received a reporter from the "Kaihan News" and admitted that he knew that a conflict had occurred in the Azerbaijan border area, but it was not serious, and it was not known which side launched it first. He has telegraphed Dabriza to inquire. Su Blank Space Shen claimed: When I heard the report from the Dabriza radio station, I was extremely surprised. I have repeatedly stated that I will never use force against Azerbaijan province, so I expected that my troops in Blank Space Cort-Azerbaijan must not attack. I dare to assert that my troops will be able to obey the order, but in order to clarify the truth, I telegraphed Dabriza again yesterday to inquire. The reply telegram confirmed that a conflict had occurred, but I did not know who started it first. Today, I telegraphed again, and I also plan to send someone to the scene of the incident to meet with the Dabriza representative to restore order. I have done my best to maintain stability, and I will never let the conflict escalate. I believe that after the order is issued, the war has already stopped. Sadana continued: I will soon send a representative to Azerbaijan province to resume the negotiations that were interrupted in Tehran.

At the same time, the Iranian government also issued a statement, saying that it has ordered an immediate investigation into the rumors of conflict.

[United Press Tehran, 20th Telegraph] Tonight, the Dabriza radio station broadcasted that the Iranian government army had once again attacked the positions of the Azerbaijan army, and the civil war was continuing fiercely. But Iranian Prime Minister Sadana said that everything was just a small contact and had stopped. [United Press London, 21st Telegraph] According to the Tehran correspondent of the Telegraph, Tehran has received news that a large number of armed civilian teams in Dabriza have begun to launch a counter-revolutionary movement against the Azerbaijan government. This news has not been confirmed, but the Dabriza radio station announced a state of emergency throughout the province last night. The correspondent said: It is possible that the state of emergency was implemented for counter-revolutionary actions.

[Reuters, Tehran, Twenty-Blank Space Day] The Dabriza radio station still claimed last night that Iranian and Azerbaijan provincial troops were at war, and the Iranian army was attacking again yesterday. The radio station said: If the offensive continues for two or three days, then peace talks will not be possible.

[United Press Dabriza, 20th Telegraph] Azerbaijan government Prime Minister Bishi Fali declared today: "The Soviet Union morally supports our demands for freedom, and our country has reached the steps of war." Now the central government recognizes our autonomy. Bishi denied that the Soviet Union had provided material assistance to the autonomous government, and believed that the Red Army had completely withdrawn.

### The Journey is Full of Dangers. The Japanese Yoshida Cabinet Will Be Inaugurated Today. Nasu Iwata's Qualifications for Joining the Cabinet Were Revoked. Wada Kimura Will Serve as Minister of Agriculture and Justice.

[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 21st Telegraph] Yoshida's new cabinet was relieved yesterday that it had escaped the danger of abortion because it had obtained the position of Minister of Agriculture from Professor Nasu Hao of Tokyo Imperial University.

Nasu Hao has now refused the position of Minister of Agriculture because he previously served as an advisor to the "Manchukuo" Concordia Society and as an economic advisor to the puppet Nanjing government and the Philippine government. Iwata Blank Space, the Minister of Justice who remained in office, was previously an advisor to the Koiso cabinet and was also rejected by the Allied Headquarters.

### Strange Theory of Senator: The United Nations Security Council is a Tool of Tyranny.

[United Press Minneapolis, 21st Telegraph] Minnesota Republican Senator Blank Space Pusty delivered a campaign speech here today, saying: The Security Council of the United Nations is a tool of tyranny, used to maintain and sponsor its secret remarks, and to make Europe and Asia a breeding ground for the third world war. He voted against the UN Charter because "I do not want to sign a blank check, which powerful politicians can fill out at will in the future and then redeem it with American blood and wealth. Now, the blank check has been filled out in Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam. This kind of behavior is not only despicable, but also a brutal act against the Christian conscience, and it is now threatening our own security and even causing the third world war."

### Labor Strike "Truce" is About to Expire. Truman is Facing a Difficult Situation. He Must Provide Solutions to Prevent Industrial Paralysis. Coal Mines Will Also Be Taken Over by the Government.

[Central News Agency Washington, 20th Telegraph] After receiving an honorary degree in Missouri, President Truman has flown back to Washington, and the situation he is facing is extremely dangerous. According to Washington observers, this is one of the most critical times Truman has faced since taking office. The truce for the railway and bituminous coal strikes will expire around this Wednesday, and President Truman must provide some solutions to prevent a large-scale paralysis of national industry. The government has mobilized 250,000 train operators and locomotive personnel to launch a strike and take over the railways, but White House officials believe that a permanent solution will be negotiated before the expiration date. The outlook for resolving the bituminous coal workers' strike is also not very bright, and it is believed that if the negotiations fail this week, President Truman may take steps to have government agencies take over the coal mines. Congress is quite divided. This year is an election year for members of Congress, so most members are reluctant to excessively confront labor unions, for fear of hindering their own political future.

[French News Agency, New York, 20th Telegraph] Federal Mediation Commissioner McGrath announced today that if the coal mine strike is delayed, the government's next step will be to order the takeover of the coal mines. Any attempt to unite mine owners and workers will be ineffective.

### Establishment of New International Organization to Intensify the Anti-Famine War; Takes Over UNRRA Responsibilities for Food Distribution; Hoover Makes Recommendations to the Food and Agriculture Organization

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Conference held its first meeting yesterday. Representatives from Brazil and Siam, among the invited countries, have arrived to participate, with only the Soviet Union and Argentina absent. Truman's Food Envoy Hoover attended and delivered a speech, offering several recommendations, stating briefly: To address the global food shortage, a new organization must be established, tentatively named the "United Nations Food Bureau." I propose: (1) Appoint a Director and a small advisory committee. (2) The majority of advisors should be representatives of grain-producing countries. (3) Establish Food Bureaus in certain regions, such as the South American Food Bureau and the Indian Ocean Food Bureau, the latter including Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. (4) This organization should only operate during times of food shortage or post-war agricultural recovery. (5) This organization should take over UNRRA's food and agriculture activities starting on September 1st. (6) The newly established Food Bureau should merge the United Nations Food Board and other international organizations dealing with food affairs, engaging in the restoration of normal commerce and global food and agricultural product trade. It is believed that this organization will be able to serve farmers, merchants, and consumers better than individual governments. (7) Charitable distribution should cease immediately to allow for allocated distribution of food. (8) The Food Bureau should establish agreements with grain-producing countries, having the authority to allocate a portion of their grain, the quantity depending on the source of grain. Hoover concluded by saying that the first voice of war is the cannon, but the most powerful statement for creating peace is food.

The newspaper states that this plan is the result of recommendations from the US-Canada Joint Defense Permanent Management Office. Past tests have shown that the United States and Canada are not yet familiar with methods of fighting in sub-zero temperatures, so further joint testing is necessary.

### Creating Peace Cannot Be Achieved Overnight; The US is Determined to Go All Out to Achieve Its Goals; Byrnes' Broadcast Address Targeted at the Soviet Union; The US Will Again Request a Peace Conference to Be Held in July

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Byrnes today broadcast to the nation and the world about the proceedings of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers meeting [yesterday, this newspaper listened to a broadcast from San Francisco and briefly reported its content], stating briefly: The four foreign ministers' discussion of the draft peace treaties with European countries has had little success, which is disappointing. However, as a result of this exchange of views, mutual understanding has deepened, and this progress is greater than expected. Creating "peace among nations" is a long-term and difficult task that cannot be achieved overnight through diplomacy. It requires patience and determination, tolerance and understanding to succeed. We cannot force others to accept our will, but we must also make it clear that they cannot force us to accept their will.

Byrnes' wording today was aimed at the Soviet Union, saying: No major power can exercise a veto over the drafting of peace treaties. If a European peace conference is not convened this summer, the United States will appeal to the United Nations General Assembly to make recommendations. The United States adopted a "peace offensive" at the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers meeting and will continue to go all out until its goals are achieved. Such a treaty is not based on revenge and greed, but on a just peace, which is the only lasting peace. The United States has three policy objectives: the implementation of the 25-year control plan for German industry, the rapid withdrawal of United Nations troops from Austria, and a peace conference for all countries that contributed to the victory in the European war, to be held on July 1st or 15th. I am determined to accomplish all of this. The purpose of the peace conference is to establish treaties with Italy, the Balkan countries, and Finland. This request was obstructed by the Soviet delegation, which insisted, based on the requirement of unanimous agreement on meeting procedures, that a peace conference could not be convened until all basic issues in the treaty were resolved. The Soviet Union's insistence on Italy paying reparations of one billion yuan is an example of what it considers a basic issue. The United States has spent tens of millions of dollars feeding Italians and must provide financial assistance to that country's economic recovery, and then pay reparations from Italy's economy. The United States does not want to repay loans in this way, but the United States has suggested another way to pay reparations, which the Soviet Union does not want. The United States proposed using part of the Italian fleet as reparations, but the Soviet Union insisted that this was their right to war booty. However, war booty has always been the property of defeated countries, and the Soviet Union has never proposed sharing any of its war booty with its allies.

Regarding the New Agreement with Italy, Britain Denies Secret Clauses

[Reuters, London, 20th] A Foreign Office spokesperson denied rumors circulating in Rome that the new armistice agreement with Italy had secret clauses attached. Italian residents here and three people who saw the full text of the document in Paris also denied that its contents differed in any way from what was previously published to the Roman press. [Premier] De Gasperi had not yet seen the full text of the new agreement, so upon hearing the rumors, he telegraphed London for inquiries. The British side assured him that there were no secret clauses. It is understood that the full text of the new agreement will be released once General [blank], Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean, and the Italian Prime Minister sign it.

In addition, emergency laws such as the Burma Defense Act should be repealed.

### Countries are Closer Together, Unable to Be Self-Serving; Nimitz Delivers Speech

### The Directors of the Finance and Land Administration Bureaus Took Office Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The new Director of the Finance Bureau, Gu Chunfan, arrived at the bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday to take office. The former Director, Pu Zhengdong, welcomed him into the Director's office and personally completed the handover procedures, which took half an hour. He then accompanied him to the meeting room to meet with all the staff gathered there and gave a speech introducing him, saying briefly: "Director Gu is a scholar of finance and economics, and his writings have long been admired by all sectors. This time, he has taken over the leadership of this bureau and will definitely make the city's finances increasingly solid. I hope that all colleagues will continue to work hard with the spirit of service they have shown in the past." Gu then gave a speech, which was very humble, saying briefly: "I lack talent and ability, and I still hope that all colleagues will continue to assist me with the same spirit with which they assisted Director Pu in the past. Regarding personnel, I have never advocated for changes. I came here alone and will leave here alone in the future, so I hope that all colleagues can work with peace of mind." The ceremony ended at around 10:00 AM, and Director Pu left the bureau with the entire staff lined up to see him off.

### Gu Chunfan Talks About Finance: Revenue Must Be Increased and Expenditure Reduced

Director Gu immediately received reporters from this newspaper and made a statement, emphasizing his confidence in establishing a civil service system and that personnel should not be changed arbitrarily. In the future, he will be a public servant of the people, and everything will be considered from the perspective of the people. When reporters asked whether there were any new measures to address the city's past financial revenues falling short of expenditures, Gu replied: I have just taken office, and concrete measures have not yet been decided. However, to maintain a balanced budget, revenue must be increased and expenditure reduced. Taxes will be adjusted based on the principles of fairness, reasonableness, and universality. In the past, the city's revenue relied heavily on entertainment taxes and banquet taxes, while the property tax rate was too low. In the future, reasonable adjustments should be made to supplement revenue.

Gu is from Suzhou. He studied hard in his early years, diligently encouraged himself, and eventually became one of the country's leading experts in finance and economics. Gu worked for the Post Office for more than 20 years. His writings are scattered in newspapers across the country, and his works include "China Under the Transformation of Silver Theories," "New Industry and Old Civilization," and "On China's Industrialization Plan."

### Simplify Land Registration, Reduce the Burden on the People: Zhu Ping Announces Work Guidelines

[Our Dispatch] The new Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, took office at 3:45 PM yesterday. Director Zhu arrived at the bureau at 3:20 PM. Accompanied by the former Director, Chen Shi[blank]quan, he convened senior officials of the bureau. Chen first gave a speech introducing him, and then Zhu gave a speech, which lasted 20 minutes.

In his introduction of the new Director, the former Director Chen humbly said that he had been working for eight months since the victory but had not made much progress due to his weak talent. The new Director Zhu not only has deep research in the field of land administration but also has rich experience in land administration, with outstanding achievements in Jiangsu, Sichuan, and during his tenure at the Land Administration Department.

### Enforce Three Rules: Don't Want Money, Don't Fear Difficulties, Don't Fear Hardship

Shanghai is an international city, and its environment is complex, unlike any other metropolis in the world. After the chaos of the occupation period, it feels as if there are thousands of loose ends to be sorted out, which is difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to first study the current situation in Shanghai before formulating a policy based on academic principles. The current work policy of this bureau can be divided into four points: (1) It is hoped that the land registration procedures will be simplified to reduce the difficulties for the people; (2) Shorten the processing time, because deeds and other items can be used as circulating financial instruments in Shanghai. If they are kept in government offices for too long, the people will suffer losses; (3) Reduce the fees for the people: Land registration fees are stipulated by laws and regulations. It is hoped that it will be done as much as possible within the scope of the laws and regulations, and it is hoped that all sectors will report any such incidents at any time, and the bureau will punish them severely. Finally, Director Zhu encouraged his subordinates with his three rules of serving for ten years! (1) Don't want money, (2) Don't fear difficulties, (3) Don't fear hardship. Zhu also said that he will be going to Ping soon to handle the handover of the Northeast Headquarters.

### Dealing With Difficult and Unruly Tenants; Two Refusals to Investigate; All Treated as Empty Houses

[Our Dispatch] The Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan will hold its weekly meeting this morning, presided over by Chairman Wu Guozhen and Vice Chairman He Dequi. Secretary-General Dai Jimin of the committee visited the mayor yesterday to report on the past discussions and work progress of the committee. In addition, the investigation team of the committee has started its investigation, and the situation is quite good. However, recently, some residents occupying houses often pretend that no one is home when investigators arrive, closing their doors. There are also those who open the door but the owner hides and is not seen, and only maids and cooks are interviewed, who give irrelevant answers, which makes it difficult for the team to carry out its work. The committee has now established a rule that if the door is not opened twice during the investigation, or if the owner does not appear, a note will be left outside the door, specifying a time to invite them to talk at the committee. If they are still ignored, it will be treated as an empty house.

### Assassination of "Drug Kingpin," One Shot to the Brain Proves Fatal

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Jiang Tonghai, a 33-year-old Taiwanese man, resided at No. 15, Dongsiwen Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road. Yesterday morning at 10:30 AM, a man in a Western suit suddenly entered Jiang's bedroom. At the time, only Jiang's young daughter, Xiuhong (10 years old), was at home, as his wife, Yuan Qiaoying (from Suzhou), was out buying groceries. The man saw Jiang sound asleep on the bed and fired a shot at Jiang with a handgun, striking Jiang's left temple. Blood flowed profusely in an instant, and the assailant immediately fled. Xiuhong burst into tears upon witnessing the scene. Jiang's wife returned shortly after and immediately reported the incident to the police and summoned an ambulance to take the injured man to the hospital, where he died at 10:00 PM that evening. Song Bingzheng, the second section chief of the Xincheng Precinct, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched officers to investigate the scene, where they found the bed soaked in blood. According to Jiang Xiuhong, the assailant was an acquaintance of her father, known only by the surname Wu, and was also Taiwanese. It was later learned that Wu had previously been in business with Jiang. It was also discovered that the deceased had previously sold morphine and was known as the "Drug Kingpin." The cause of this sudden murder is very complicated, and the truth is currently being thoroughly investigated, and the culprit will be strictly apprehended and brought to justice.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] All the clerks and recorders of the High Court and District Court and the Prosecutor's Office in this city, due to their impoverished living conditions, held a meeting at the High Prosecutor's Office on West Yanan Road the day before yesterday afternoon,提出要求two demands: (1) Each person be given a temporary emergency relief fund of 200,000 yuan, and (2) The authorities implement the Legislative Yuan's resolution on civil servant treatment (i.e., adding a living allowance of 200,000 yuan, and calculating it as 1,000 times the base salary).

### "Three-Dynasty Veteran" Xia Qifeng Desperately Seeks "Coexistence and Co-prosperity" Under the Jaws of the Beast, Judge Angrily Denounces the Old-Time Traitor

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The traitor Xia Qifeng, who served as a "three-dynasty veteran" in the puppet regime, finally bowed his head in the solemn court of our nation's laws and received his deserved punishment.

Xia, from Taixian, Jiangsu Province, is 59 years old, with a shaved head, a sad face, and wearing a dark blue gown, looking very listless. Xia was originally a government official in our government, but he betrayed the country and sought glory when the War of Resistance broke out. He organized the so-called "Reformed Government" and served as the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Internal Affairs. Later, the group of villains in North China, under the leadership of Wang Kemin, organized the so-called "Provisional Government." He rushed to Peiping and served as the director of the Political Affairs Department of the Joint Committee of the Puppet Government. In September of the 28th year, he returned south and served as the "Foreign Minister" of the puppet government. When Wang Jingwei organized the puppet government in Nanjing, he served as the "Minister of Audit" and later also as a standing director of the "Great People's Association," inciting the people and promoting pro-Japanese ideas.

Yesterday, under the strict questioning of Judge Qiu, he finally began to tremble, but he still tried to quibble, saying that his joining the puppet regime was entirely due to Chen Qun's persecution and confinement in the Central Hotel, so he managed to get his name on the list. Going to Peiping was upon the recommendation of Chen Bi, the puppet Foreign Minister. During his tenure as his own "Foreign Minister," there were few visitors and he had no contact with foreigners at all. He only met with the reporter Kot of the Ta Mei Evening News, hoping to use his relationship to contact Zhang Sixu to do underground work, but Zhang was assassinated. Later, he cooperated with the French consul. According to him, he finally found an international line to resist the Axis powers. When he said this, he seemed like a righteous gentleman. But Judge Qiu said, "You are simply an old-time traitor!" This sentence, the first time a judge had called a defendant a "traitor," made the traitor so embarrassed that even his ears turned red, and he could not speak. But he took two breaths and continued to argue that the "Great People's Association" was a fake people's association with no members, only staff, and that the Central Executive Committee was a "nominal" committee with nothing to do and nothing to be done. But no matter how cunning he is, the national law will certainly not let this three-dynasty puppet official go lightly. Finally, the judge announced that the case would be adjourned, and the puppet official was taken down for further detention.

Zhang Guanfu and Zhu Ruilin

The Special Criminal Court of the High Court yesterday also re-examined the case of Zhang Guanfu. Zhang is from Shanghai, 22 years old, and runs the Da Zhonghua Shoe Store and the Shanghai Leather Company. Because he led the enemy police to uncover the radio station set up by Chen Hui, Chen and the deceased Xiao Mingqian (Weichen) were arrested. After the victory, Chen reported to the Association of Comrades Who Suffered During the War of Resistance, and Zhang was detained and sent to the High Court for investigation and prosecution. The defendant denied all the accusations. He claimed that he himself had also suffered at the hands of the enemy police. Zhu Ruilin, a native of Chuansha, had opened a wire nail factory and supplied it to the enemy army. Yesterday, he was re-examined, and the defendant still denied supplying it to the army. Both cases were adjourned for further questioning.

Yang was sentenced to six years of imprisonment

Yesterday afternoon, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court sentenced the traitor Yang Bei. The main text: Yang Bei colluded with enemy countries, resisted this country, sentenced to six years of imprisonment, deprivation of public rights for six years, all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for the family.

Zhu Shunlin's verdict was not accepted

Also, Zhu Shunlin, the chief inspector of the "Hollywood" and "Six Nations Hotel" and other large casinos in western Shanghai, was previously prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office for the crime of treason. After a trial, the defendant hired three lawyers, including Zhang Shizhao, to defend him. Yesterday, the High Court announced that it would not accept the case and would transfer it to the District Court for trial as an ordinary criminal case. In addition, two traitors, Zhu Ada and Huang Senhan, were tried yesterday, and the court ordered the verdict to be announced on the 28th.

### British Ministry of Education - Incentivizing University Education - University Scholarships, etc. Reach 800,000 Pounds Annually

[British News Agency, London, 21st] The Ministry of Education announced today that starting this October, all male and female students in England and Wales who receive university scholarships will receive subsidies from the government if their parents' annual income is less than £1,500. For parents whose income is less than £600, the government will further subsidize their scholarship to cover tuition and living expenses. The Ministry of Education has graded the amount of subsidies based on income below £1,500 per year. This plan will cause the national expenditure on scholarships and subsidies to reach £800,000 per year. Scholarships generally do not exceed £100 per year. Until now, students who have received scholarships have had to rely on subsidies or loans from local education authorities because the cost per academic year is £300 to £400. The national scholarship has always been only 360 places per year, most of which are awarded to students holding university scholarships. The recently announced subsidy plan is the implementation of a proposal by the Norwood Committee in June 1943: "Those who receive university scholarships have the right to apply for public subsidies." In addition, the Ministry of Education is also implementing another proposal by Norwood, namely that the current secondary school examination will be abolished and replaced by a two-part examination: one part is a university scholarship examination, and the other part is a university entrance examination, or a qualification test for a preliminary vocational examination without examination. At the same time, the current graduation examination between the ages of 14 and 17 will also be cancelled or thoroughly reformed in order to relieve students of the burden of examinations before the age of 17 and to strive to meet the individual needs of students. The purpose of the Ministry of Education is to find new techniques to preserve school achievements in order to discover the talents and intelligence of individual students.

### Examination for Youth Army Interpreter's Overseas Study Postponed

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Guiding Committee of the Political Department of the Youth Army previously requested to send 300 Youth Army students to study abroad, and the Foreign Affairs Bureau requested to send 700 interpreters to study abroad. Although both were approved by Chairman Chiang, according to the person in charge of the Ministry of Education speaking to reporters: the dispatch of these students is still very difficult in practice. The funds required for them to study abroad are huge. The Ministry of Education once jointly requested the Executive Yuan to allocate funds for sending them, but whether it can be approved by the Executive Yuan meeting is still doubtful. In addition, the number of students that each country contacted by the Ministry of Education to send students to is limited. Therefore, the above-mentioned overseas study examination will be postponed. However, those of the Youth Army and staff who are qualified to participate in the overseas study examination can still participate in this year's publicly funded overseas study examination.

### Quick Sketch of Shanghai University

— Bao Zhongqi

Since the victory, Shanghai University has been preparing to move back to its original campus on Jungong Road. After a month of inspection, negotiation, and fundraising by the new president, Mr. Ling Xianyang, and several professors, various difficulties were overcome. Finally, the relocation work was completed on April 21, and the class was officially resumed on the original campus on the 22nd.

On April 26th, a celebration of the school's restoration was held in the magnificent auditorium. President Ling and the professors all attended with their wives. The program on that day was wonderful. Professor Lei Yuan's solo performance on the steel saw (a musical instrument) received the most applause, and the teachers and students were united.

The exact number of students in the school is 901, with only a dozen students commuting and the rest living on campus. The auditorium is very spacious, with a full 1,000 seats, so it is enough to accommodate all the students for meetings.

According to statistics, the total area of ​​the school covers 330 acres, with a total of 43 buildings of various sizes.

The male dormitory occupies "Si Yi" and "Si Pei" halls, and the female dormitory also occupies two buildings. At the entrance of the male and female dormitories, signs are hung separately with the words "No Female Visitors" or "No Male Visitors".

The scenery on campus is excellent, but unfortunately, it has been occupied by the Japanese invaders for many years, and much has been destroyed, so it is not as good as before. Several large trees that could be embraced have been transplanted to Jiangwan by the Japanese invaders. Recently, they have repeatedly negotiated with the authorities and are preparing to move them back.

The school holds memorial weekly meetings twice a week. President Ling attends each time to report on school affairs. At the first weekly meeting, he said: "It is estimated that the school's losses in this war are more than 100 million yuan. The cost of construction has been 30 million yuan so far. There are still many things to be repaired, and the funds are quite difficult. Most of it depends on the assistance of the church and does not raise funds from the students." Students are required to attend weekly meetings, take seats according to their numbers, and the order is orderly.

The library has more than 53,000 books, and there are many newspapers available for students to read every day.

For the sake of caution, the drinking water in the school has been sent to the Municipal Health Bureau for inspection, and the result is considered to be quite clean.

For the needs of the students, a barbershop and a laundry shop have been established on campus, which are cheap and of good quality, and are very popular among the students.

In addition, in order to take care of the education of the children of the professors, there has recently been a proposal to establish a primary school, which will be taught by students of the Department of Education to conduct practical tests. Students can freely enter and leave the school from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. For the rest of the time, they must ask for leave from the Training Office if they go out. The procedures are quite strict, because President Ling attaches great importance to the "school spirit."

The gold-lettered school nameplate outside the school gate was inscribed by Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng. Dr. Zheng is the founder of the Shanghai University School of Science. He has served for thousands of years. With several strands of white hair, he has seen all the changes in the world. Now he sees Ling Xianyang taking over as president, with arduous tasks, and making persistent efforts to lay a new foundation for the alma mater, and he should also smile and stroke his beard.

Before the second game between Lianghua and Signal, Liu Hesheng reported that Mr. Cheng Bo'an, who is enthusiastic about sports, donated 1 million yuan to the floor construction fund. The audience applauded upon hearing the news. When the whistle sounded to start the game, the two teams were evenly matched and tied four times. After 8-8, Lianghua replaced Zhang Shaoqing, and the result was obvious. Zhen Zhong and Yu Gong both made great contributions, reversing the score to 12-11. Lianghua led all the way.

### Answering Readers - Medical and Health

Liu Shuge asked: Zhuo'er is two years and five months old. Last winter in Fuzhou, he suddenly had a fever one night, and the next morning his limbs trembled and he could not stand or walk? It was found that the illness occurred when he was still healthy, only that he had suffered from extremely severe diarrhea some time ago, which almost led to death, but he recovered after treatment. Since his legs and waist became weak, he lived in Fuzhou Union Hospital for diagnosis and treatment for ten days without effect. It was said to be "anterior osteomyelitis of the spinal cord". Later, he left Rong and came to Hangzhou, and received intermittent diagnosis and treatment with Chinese and Western medicine. At the moment, he can move the part below his right heel, and he can flex and stretch. The left toe can only move slightly, and his waist is still [weak]. I have always admired your newspaper for its enthusiastic service, and I pray for your guidance.

[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] The disease is indeed anterior poliomyelitis. Flat-stream electrical therapy, massage, and injection of large amounts of vitamin B preparations can be performed.

Wang Bikan from Guang'an, Sichuan, asked: I mistakenly committed masturbation in my childhood, which caused great losses. Due to economic reasons, I have not been able to cure it for more than ten years. Now the disease is getting worse and worse, and it has become impotence. I still have one or two nocturnal emissions every month, tinnitus, blurred vision, waist pain, and weakness in the limbs. The above symptoms are very dangerous. Because I live in a remote rural area, there are no good doctors and special medicines. Please give me good advice. If I can be cured, I will definitely worship your name every day.

[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] (1) You need to quit the bad habit of masturbation. (2) One or two nocturnal emissions per month are not a pathological phenomenon. (3) Do not drink too much water or overeat before going to bed, develop the habit of sleeping on your side, do not make the bedding too hot, and pay attention to fitness exercises.

Yang Shouren asked: I am a small civil servant, and my daily income and expenditure are already difficult to balance, but unfortunately my father is also suffering from a disease. The Chinese medicine name is phlegm madness, and taking medicine has not healed it. Yesterday, I changed to a large hospital for treatment. According to the diagnosis, it is "chronic alcohol poisoning." Because there is no special medicine at present, it is difficult to cure, and I am very anxious! Please answer or publish it in this column, and ask Chinese and Western masters at home and abroad to show good prescriptions. I am looking forward to it.

[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, Medical Doctor] If you suffer from chronic alcohol poisoning, you need to quit drinking and inject large amounts of vitamin B preparations.

### Depending on the Situation of Work and Materials - Organize Road Repair and Ditch Clearing

Public Reply from the Municipal Works Bureau

We have received your letter, along with the original letter from Yu Zhang, regarding the question of when road repairs will be implemented. Citizens often ask questions, and you asked us to publish our opinions for public publication, which shows your enthusiasm for social service. Since the roads in this city have been in disrepair for a long time and are damaged everywhere, and the degree of damage varies, this bureau has regarded road repair and ditch clearing as the most important business since it took over. However, due to limited financial and material resources, it is really difficult to carry out them universally at the same time. We have to consider the situation of work and materials and distinguish between urgency. I believe that the citizens of the city will be able to understand this. We hereby reply for your reference and publication. Sincerely yours, Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, Eighteenth Day, attached is the original letter from Yu Zhang, Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau

Warning to those who blindly worship foreign goods

Editor: I am teaching at the School of Business of Guanghua University. When I went to school today, I saw many DDT solutions displayed on the stalls near the school gate, marked "Made in the United States." Buyers rushed to buy them. At that time, I saw that the bottles used were discarded beer bottles from the US military, and I was deeply suspicious. When I carefully distinguished what was written on the label, it was "Produced by the American 'Packaging' Company," and I suddenly realized it. I couldn't help but feel a thousand emotions. It is not enough to blame such speculative counterfeiting of foreign goods to deceive the Chinese people, but the Chinese people only see the words "foreign goods". Then they blindly worship, regardless of being fooled. It is really sad to be so dead set! I dare to borrow your publication to disclose this to my patriotic people. Sincerely, Cai Wenxi

### Speculation Fearing the Pressure of the Bank of China - The Gold Market Situation is Erratic - Resulting in a Slight Increase and the US Dollar Following

After the rebound the day before yesterday, there was still much fear of the pressure of the Bank of China yesterday. Some short sellers in the industry struggled fiercely.

Rumors spread that the Bank of China would continue to exert pressure outside the pass at 1.9 million, and it fell to below 1.86 million before gradually stabilizing.

It is known that Shanghai-Taiwan remittance has also started from today. The ratio of Legal Tender to Taiwan Dollar is 30 Legal Tender yuan to 1 Taiwan dollar. However, at present, it is only limited to remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan. Remittances from Taiwan to this city can be realized in the short term.

### Both Yarn and Cotton Cloth are Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market turned weak due to the small gold price report. The Cantonese and Hubei gangs intended to wait and see, and rarely purchased. As a result, 20-count Shuangma yarn gradually fell to 1.26 million, a drop of 780,000 compared to the previous day. The remaining 20-count medium and small yarns also followed by 350,000 yuan. However, 42-count Blue Phoenix double-strand yarn, because the drop at the close yesterday was huge, only dropped by 230,000, and the transaction was quite rare, and people's hearts were extremely bland.

The cloth market was affected by the decline in gold and yarn prices, and the needs of the Kejia Gang and Menzhuang were not good. Market prices were mostly weak and few were firm. Fangjian Company once opened to sell 27 kinds of cloth, and 17 kinds of American and Mexican cloth.

In the flower market, New York American cotton continued to rise by 23 to 29 pounds. The near-term US dollar was 27.45, the far-term was 27.98, and the current meterlin spot was 28.05.

Shandong will sail to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Guangdong, carrying 21,000 bags of Guangdong relief wheat and 12,000 boxes of milk powder.

### The Tea Market Transaction is Still Good

Since the Tianjin gang's appetite has been moderate since the previous day, it has not been brightened yet. However, the digestion of the stores in this street and the area of ​​Suzhou and Wuxi has increased unabated. However, buyers and sellers have absorbed and sold each other, so it is difficult to distinguish between honor and disgrace. As for the foreign tea market, the sound of Indian merchants actively buying Wuyuan Chente is very loud. At present, Ruichang, Nianmazhi, and other lines are negotiating with the holders of goods. It is heard that more than a hundred dans have been dragged in by Nianmazhi Foreign Company. The trend is that the green tea with rare and beautiful goods and without coloring, the American merchants are still rarely consulted.

### American Market Lacks - Oriental Carpets

### The Stock Market is Quiet and Thinks About Moving - The Industry Pulls up Jingfu

Huagu is back to the old tricks. Jingfu, a small stock that no one has consulted for several days, was suddenly pulled up by large households in the industry. The claim that the sound of chiming is pleasant is spread. Speculators who are familiar with profiteering face a short squeeze wave. The two major stocks are also indirectly benefited and brought up. The midway is quite brilliant. The prospect will depend on whether retail investors are willing to enter the whirlpool of the Han again to determine the overall situation. Yongsha rose from 4,830 yuan to 5,000 yuan, Meiya rose from 3,700 yuan to 4,000 yuan, and Jingfu jumped sharply from 285 yuan to 340 yuan before slightly returning. Xinguang opened in the morning at 225 yuan, and Qinxing was 190 yuan, both ending at high prices. As a result, Yongsha Meiya rose slightly compared to the previous day, and Jingfu Xinguang and Qinxing each rose by more than 10%. The remaining stocks were stable, and the veteran stocks were also oversupplied. The foreign stock situation was peaceful, and there was no power to rise. After hovering, all stocks except the steel industry, because the transaction on the previous day was not universal and did not fall, and there were more sellers yesterday, fell by 10% alone. The rest rose and fell slightly.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Vigorously Implements Emergency Measures; Prices Have Begun to Decline; Various Industries Prepare to Report Rice Stocks; Rumors of Purchased Foreign Rice Already Being Shipped

The city's rice reserves are quite sufficient, enough to supply needs for at least three months. There is no shortage of supply, yet recently, the rising price trend has been frequent and the fluctuations extreme. The municipal authorities believe that unscrupulous individuals are manipulating the market. The municipal government convened a meeting the other day and agreed on four emergency measures, which were handed over to the Social Affairs Bureau for diligent implementation. In addition to dispatching personnel to conduct discreet investigations, the bureau has ordered warehouses, various industries, and foreign merchant warehouses to report within a time limit. If there is deliberate concealment, failure to report, or underreporting, once discovered and verified, severe punishment will be imposed. At the same time, the rice market is strictly forbidden from allowing members to buy and sell speculatively on behalf of outsiders, in order to stabilize the market.

Social Affairs Bureau Announcement

"Investigation reveals that the city's rice reserves are not lacking and that supplies are continuous. Since supply and demand are normal, the market should be stable. However, rice prices have recently skyrocketed and fluctuated greatly, indicating that unscrupulous individuals are hoarding and manipulating the market in an attempt to make exorbitant profits. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, relevant industries have been ordered to report their grain reserves, and speculation by outsiders has been strictly prohibited. If any unscrupulous individuals disregard the overall situation and speculate by raising prices, people are permitted to report the facts and await severe punishment. If illegal hoarding is confirmed, all hoarded rice will be confiscated and half of its total value will be used as a reward to encourage reporting. This is being announced for general knowledge."

Rice Merchants' Meeting

The two guilds, the bean and rice industry and the rice shop industry, were ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 20th of this month to have their members fill out reports on their grain reserves within three days. The two guilds immediately convened an emergency meeting of directors to discuss the measures and notified all members to fill out the reports within the specified time. However, due to the large number of members scattered throughout the city, it is feared that they will not be able to complete the task on schedule.

Another report states that the Qinglian Pavilion rice market on Fourth Avenue has received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau, stipulating that the market must submit detailed reports daily of the names of both buyers and sellers, the names of their managers, the transaction prices, and quantities, for verification purposes. The market was ordered to comply from the date of the document's arrival. The market immediately notified rice merchants that all firms buying and selling in the market must, from now on, fill out three copies of a form detailing the names of the sellers and buyers, the names of their managers, the transaction prices, and quantities, and submit them to the association daily for collation and transmission.

Market Reorganization

There is also news of the reorganization of the city's rice market. The city's rice market was divided into North and South markets before the war. After the war, it was concentrated in Qingyun Pavilion as a temporary market. Because the area is small and the people are many, management is difficult, and it is easy for speculators to infiltrate. In light of the recent soaring rice prices, the responsible authorities, in addition to taking various effective measures, have also ordered the Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee to restore trading in the North and South markets. It is stipulated that the North market will still be located at the original site of the Rice Merchant Guild, and the South market will be located at Cuixiu Hall. They are also ordered to prepare a concrete reorganization plan and submit it for approval.

Purchasing Foreign Rice

After Pang Songzhou, the Grain Department's specialist, and Wang, the acting special commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning, they immediately visited Director Liu of the Enemy Property Management Bureau and Mayor Wu to discuss plans for allocating grain to Shanghai. According to the person in charge of the Grain Department, the Grain Ministry, up to the most recent date, has directly or indirectly ordered more than 160,000 tons of foreign rice from South America and Siam (excluding the 120,000 tons of rice allocated by the United Nations). Wheat and other grains are still being negotiated. The ordered rice has already been shipped and the first batch of more than 10,000 tons is expected to arrive in Shanghai this month. As for the shipment of Sichuan rice to relieve the famine in Central China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it has already begun. In two weeks, more than 30 specialized ships will carry Sichuan rice to supply the lower reaches. With foreign rice and Sichuan rice arriving in a continuous stream, the current grain shortages in Shanghai, Guangdong, Wuhan, and Hunan may be alleviated.

It is also reported that the China Canned Food Industry Company, whose headquarters were originally in Chongqing, processed military and civilian grain and transported and sold grain during the war. It is now establishing an office in Shanghai and has ordered approximately 2 million large bags of foreign rice from various import merchants. The shipping dates are between June and July. It is reported that due to rising grain prices in Shanghai, the company has decided to sell the ordered foreign rice to various rice shops and factories in the city. With this large source of rice, the people of this city can be assured of food during the lean months of this year.

Rice Prices Fall

Because the authorities acted decisively, all parties were wary. Yesterday, the rice market became stagnant, and large households sought to sell off their stocks, but there were few buyers. The number of transactions in the market was very small, and prices continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour also fell by another 500 to 600 yuan, the oil market continued to decline by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, soybean cake fell by 400 to 500 yuan, and soybeans continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, the amount of rice arriving in the city, according to the rice market, was more than 5,800 piculs. As for general hoarders and various industries storing rice, they are preparing to fill out forms and report to the association in order to submit them within the specified time limit. According to sources at the Social Affairs Bureau, many people directly inquired with the bureau about reporting methods yesterday, and the bureau instructed them to report to their respective industry associations for collection.

According to rice merchant sources, the difficulties encountered by various producing areas in exporting rice have decreased significantly recently, so shipments are gradually becoming smoother. Tens of cars of Anhwei Sen rice stranded in Nanjing have already had 20 cars transported to the city a few days ago. The Ministry of Food and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Shipping Company have discussed the transportation of 2 million dans of Sichuan rice and will soon be ready to begin shipping.

Low-Priced Flour

In order to alleviate the people's food shortage, the Social Affairs Bureau has obtained some flour and is preparing to sell it at a low price. It is planned to sell 1,500 bags per day, entrusted to 50 rice shops to sell on consignment, targeting the poor. Each person is limited to buying 6 catties, and the price is calculated at 60% of the market price. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting of the persons in charge of these 50 shops today to discuss the sales procedures, in order to ensure that the benefits reach the people.

### Tight Sugar Prices

Yesterday's sugar market was extremely tight because the enemy property sugar on Monday was not auctioned off, and no new company goods were opened. The China Granulated Sugar Association's market opened in the morning from 75,000 yuan to 76,000 yuan to 76,500 yuan, with slight fluctuations along the way, ranging from 76,250 yuan to 76,500 yuan, eventually reaching 77,000 yuan.

In addition, there is also a shoe repair machine that can repair a shoe sole in three to five minutes, and a new type of soldering iron, which are also features of the exhibition.

### No Control of Domestic Remittances

There have recently been rumors in Shanghai that the Central Bank and other national banks will manage or control domestic commercial remittances. According to an interview with the person in charge of the Central Bank, domestic remittances are the main business of commercial banks, and the national bank has no intention of managing or controlling them. Since the victory, the national bank has been coordinating financial turnovers in the recovered areas. All remittances from the national bank bureaus to various places are handled by the national bank, and commercial banks often ask the national bank to remit when they lack turnover in a certain place. The current traditional domestic remittance control is mostly a matter of imagination.

### Cinnamon Rationing; US Removes Restrictions

However, American-style woolen gabardines and twills were selling quite well, especially those with colors between gray and grass green. Sales were most extensive in Nanjing and Hangzhou, and customers continued to request them. However, there is a shortage of this color in woolen broadcloth and twill fabrics are now being sampled and dyed.

### Rayon Started Strong, Ended Weak; Silk Market Quiet

In the afternoon, morale picked up slightly, with prices called at 1.4 million yuan, resulting in a drop of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### A Socially Respected Person Highly Regarded by Both the Government and the Public; Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu

— Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 20th; Special Correspondent Zhao Haosheng

There is no one more worthy of respect in the world than someone who has created his social position through his career. "Wang Yunwu" is a name inseparable from "The Commercial Press." Mr. Wang Yunwu's career is built on the countless volumes and the illustrated books closely linked to the progressive lives of millions of people.

This socially respected person, highly regarded by both the government and the public, is an "old man" with the temperament of a child. Although he appears to have gray hair and beard, his spirit, demeanor, and interest and attention to all matters have the vitality of a child, full of soaring and leaping energy. That white hair and beard have only become the embellishment of his special charm.

Short White Hair; Short and Sturdy Figure

He is short and stocky, but very strong. The top of his head is already bald, and he has an extremely thick, silvery-white mustache on his lips. His voice is loud, his enunciation is clear, and he is full of vocal expression. His pure Mandarin and clear gestures will make people pay attention to his conversation and be able to understand it thoroughly.

When the "Political Consultative Conference" was held, Mr. Wang Yunwu was invited to attend as a non-partisan, socially respected person. In that turbulent conference process, the representatives of socially respected people were always relatively quiet. They occupied one end of the U-shaped conference table on the right side. Mr. Wang Yunwu sat to the right of Fu Sinian and opposite Hu Lin. This quiet corner was also a corner that attracted a lot of attention from the audience. Because on some issues, only from here could some correct answers be found, especially from Mr. Wang Yunwu, people could test the atmosphere of the entire venue from his expressive face. He often engaged in written conversations and whispers with Fu Sinian and Hu Lin, and when he found that their feelings were the same, he would happily scratch his bald scalp and even make faces.

During the Conference; Waves of Laughter Tumbling

I remember one day, when discussing the National Assembly issue, Zhang Bojun took out a Ta Kung Pao from a long time ago during his speech and read an editorial on it to prove that his theory of not recognizing the old representatives was also the opinion of non-partisans, reading for five minutes. Wang Yunwu and Fu Sinian handed notes to Hu Lin on the opposite side, congratulating Mr. Hu: "Ta Kung Pao actually has such a loyal reader!" At that time, Mr. Wang Yunwu's childlike, interested expression, Fu Sinian's squinting eyes, and Hu Lin's fat face formed a satirical picture of the speaker. Because in that solemn gathering, which appeared in the posture of representing public opinion, there were actually many things that could not help but make people laugh.

Confused Situation; Still Commanding Calmly

In this Political Consultative Conference, the non-partisan representatives were not spectators who folded their arms without any opinions. When some issues were debated endlessly, they often stood up and spoke with an expression of "I can't help but say a few words." Mr. Wang Yunwu was one of the people who spoke more often. His attitude when speaking was extremely serious and sincere. He swung his gray-haired head, waved his short and powerful arms, and spoke in a clear and distinct voice. That demeanor of侃侃and talking 条分analyzing侃侃and talking made one think of the characters in the British Parliament. His seat was directly opposite Mr. Shao Congen. His energetic 神态 and Mr. Shao's trembling and trembling expression at the same time, were extremely moving scenes. I remember one time, when talking about the number of places in the National Assembly, Mr. Wang used his "abacus" to make a scientific distribution, which won laughter from the entire venue.

In the previous sessions of the National Political Council, Mr. Wang Yunwu was also a very capable chairman. He was energetic and controlled the time of the conference with a "scientific management" method, meticulous and orderly. In the most chaotic situation, he could command calmly.

Mr. Wang Yunwu is an energetic old man, who can manage things with strict scientific methods and live with an optimistic and progressive attitude.

Bringing Business Spirit to Politics

At the beginning of the reorganization of the government, he was first invited to head the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Mr. Wang's past achievements in his career will guarantee that he can become a good official who truly works for the people. If China's politics is to progress, it must inject new blood into these nearly optimized institutions. China needs democracy, but China does not need "street politicians" who only sell empty words, specialize in shouting slogans, and play political tricks. Here I want to say again: "There is no one more worthy of respect in the world than someone who has created his social position through his career!" We hope that Mr. Wang Yunwu will bring his spirit of engaging in business to politics, and we hope that this warrior who has succeeded in his career can break all the old habits of politics and act as a pioneer on the road to political democratization, who becomes more energetic as he gets older.

### Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun

— By Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

At this time, the artillery fire was still very intense. We decided to hang the national flags of China and the United States on one hand, and on the other, to hang the wooden sign of the Sino-Foreign Journalists' Reception Center at the gate. The words on the wooden sign were written by Shi Xun; the American flag was sewn together by Ms. Abernathy of the International News Service and a Japanese girl invited from nearby. Everyone found it amusing that this was a collaboration between the United States and Japan!

Although the fighting outside was fierce, we found it quite warm and peaceful inside the house. Zhao Junmai and Abernathy were both classmates at the University of Wisconsin. They sang the school song together or played bridge. We Chinese journalists, on the other hand, sat facing each other playing Weiqi. But after playing for half a day, our minds were finally disturbed by the gunfire, and the game was scattered all over, without making any sense.

In the afternoon, the fighting got closer and closer. The main force of the Communist army in the south had crossed the Academy of Sciences of China, the Botanical and Zoological Garden, and Shuntian Park, and occupied the Man-Tan Building. Man-Tan was right in front of our journalists' reception center, three hundred meters away. A stray bullet hit the rooms upstairs where Beckett and Shi Xun lived, entering through the outer glass window and making a hole in the wall. Our residence had become a target on the front line. We decided to move people to the basement to sleep, while the American journalists slept on the floor in the reception room.

The moon was particularly beautiful at night. A row of policemen, each with a rifle and several hand grenades, were stationed around the walls of our house. They were intently commanded by Platoon Leader Liu. At two o'clock in the morning, we were awakened from our sweet dreams. A continuous barrage of gunfire and shouts were heard all around the walls of our house, even more densely. We all knew that something was bound to happen tonight. Captain Liu came in to inform us to prepare in advance in case of emergency. Zhao Junmai was clear-headed and seriously concerned about us, especially the safety of our American friends. He instructed Captain Liu: "If the Communist army really comes, as a matter of principle, do not open fire on them, but explain that this is a Sino-Foreign Journalists' Residence, a neutral location."

Following this development, Zhao Junmai had to reconsider his own identity. In the rain of bullets, Zhao seemed to realize that the situation was not as stable as he had optimistically imagined. He first said to us, Chinese and foreign journalists: "From now on, don't call me Mayor Zhao anymore. I need to hide myself for a while." We agreed with his suggestion, but we couldn't think of a way to solve his predicament at the time. Later, he said himself: "I will also be a journalist. I really envy the life of you journalists. I will be a journalist for Ta Kung Pao, and my name is Yang Huaibai." From then on, before he was discovered by the Communist army as the mayor, we all called him "Old Yang," even our servants and guards called him "Mr. Yang." The change of address took a little getting used to, and we would always slip up and say "Mayor"!

Dashing Back to the Residence Through a Net of Fire

At dawn on the sixteenth, the gunfire receded, and the shouting and killing sounds were no longer audible. Captain Liu reported to us: "The Communist army has now retreated to the State Council." We pushed open the doors and windows and walked into the courtyard. The morning light was exceptionally fresh, still as peaceful as before, and the birds were singing happily on the branches.

At this time, the gunfire was even more intense in the north of the city. We knew that the north of the city was the railway station, and seizing the railway station was a strategic key point for transportation and supply. A life-and-death struggle, or rather a seesaw battle, was to be expected. We contacted Zhu Zhou, who lived in the Central Bank, by telephone. He said, "It was once occupied by the Communist army at 4 p.m. yesterday, and now it is under contention." We knew that Major Reik, the military attache of the American Embassy, lived in the Yamato Hotel next to the railway station. We were concerned about his safety and tried to talk to him by telephone, but the telephone was completely out of service.

At this time, the Communist army in the west, from the Imperial Household Ministry, had entered the city. We looked from the balcony and saw three fires breaking out in the west. We knew that these were the Fushunhou and Tianxingfu flour mills on fire. This was from 5 a.m. on the seventeenth.

Zhao Junmai still had this courage for peace. He and Beckett of the Associated Press and Abernathy of the International News Service went to the Central Bank first. At 11 a.m., Captain Liu said: "The security team of the State Council has retreated." At that time, the guards were all preparing to flee to the Central Bank. Zhao Junmai was not here at this time, so we had to take our belongings and Captain Liu to the Central Bank to ask for Zhao's opinion.

Zhao was also extremely busy, talking on the phone with Secretary Chen Jinghua of the Communist army at the West Airport. Chen Jinghua agreed to a ceasefire, but he asked Zhao to relay to Commander Chen Jiazhen to lay down their weapons first before discussing anything else. Zhao spoke with Chen for a moment, and Chen resolutely rejected the Communist's request. We knew at this time that the fate of Changchun was sealed.

We asked Chen Jiazhen very frankly: "What confidence do you have in sustaining this battle?" He said, "Xiong Shouzhu has sent a telegram saying that the New First Army had passed through Siping Street on the fifteenth." Chen's facial expression was very cold, and finally he spat out: "I can only defend the core area."

Zhao Junmai saw that peace was hopeless. It was a kite that had lost its string and drifted with the wind. He wanted us to go back immediately. Many people were crowded into one car, and some things were not taken in time. We went along Datong Street to the City Hall in Datong Square. Because there were so many people, I thought the car would come back for a second trip, but there was no car after that. Machine guns were shooting at our car like raindrops, forming a net of fire, cutting off traffic. Zhao Junmai wanted us to take shelter in the City Hall, but the driver was unwilling to go forward. We stood in front of the City Hall, watching batches of wounded soldiers retreating. Beckett of the Associated Press and Abernathy of the International News Service were both willing to go back. Shi Xun also agreed to this dangerous return. Zhao saw that everyone wanted to return to the Commissioner's Office, so he decided to instruct the driver to drive forward again. Five minutes later, we finally returned safely. But we found that the wheels and the rear of the car had been hit by four or five bullets.

Seeing the Communist Army's Movements

At around 11 a.m. (on the seventeenth), transport planes were constantly circling over the city. Captain Liu said: "Parachute troops are coming down from the sky." We ran out to watch. Wheeler, a reporter for the Chicago Daily Tribune, went out to photograph. When the parachute shadows descended to a certain level, we realized that they were dropping ammunition. For a time, the morale of the security team was greatly boosted, and gunfire erupted everywhere. This was the first time they dropped ammunition, and all the ammunition was dropped into the heart of the security team's position near Datong Square.

At about 1 p.m., the planes came again. At that time, the wind direction was very strong, and the ammunition dropped was almost entirely lost in the Communist army's position. In fact, the security team's position was getting smaller and smaller, and fierce fighting near the core position began at this time.

At this time, the security team also withdrew from the vicinity of our residence. Our residence was about to become a place of contention in a tug-of-war. We knew that danger was imminent. Zhao Junmai was very sensitive. He first instructed the guards to change into plain clothes and bury all the guns and hand grenades in the coal layer, indicating that our residence was a neutral place with no combat activity. There were Chinese and American flags on the roof, and a sign saying "Sino-Foreign Journalists' Residence" on the door.

At about 4 p.m., we saw from the glass window a company of Communist soldiers sitting under the wall of the house opposite to rest. They were wearing yellow cotton uniforms. Shi Xun saw several Communist soldiers walking in front of our residence, probably looking at the words "Journalists' Residence," and then they left. Zhao Junmai said, "I don't think we'll have any big trouble. The Communist army is still rational." Sure enough, the Communist army did not knock open our door.

We were at ease in our little world, still very peaceful. Dinner felt better than usual, and we even had canned pineapple to eat afterwards. Everyone said that the cook was getting better and better, worthy of being the famous chef of Marshal Wu Ziyu. Zhao Junmai raised his hand to distribute bread, like Christ dividing his last supper, and said, "Let's finish this delicious meal tonight. Perhaps this is our last meal!" In each of our hearts, there was a different feeling. We didn't know what to say, and we didn't know how to comfort ourselves. Everyone was silent for a long time, and finally surrounded the round table and sang loudly!

That night, the American journalists still slept downstairs, while Shi Xun and Yang Zhuozhi of the Jiangxi Zhengqi Daily, and the mayor, slept in the basement. We still thought that maybe the security team would launch a counterattack in the middle of the night, and there would be another great battle.

Late at night, at 11:30 p.m., because we were immersed in the great battle, we were mentally exhausted, so when Captain Liu came to wake us up, everyone couldn't get out of bed. Later, he said, "The Eighth Route Army is here." We suddenly woke up and saw more than a dozen Eighth Route Army soldiers with yellow uniforms, leather hats, and bright knives on their guns, with ferocious faces. (The Communist army called soldiers "warriors.") The platoon leader who spoke first was called Zhang Zhengchang. We told him that we were news reporters. Zhao Junmai, disguised as Yang Huaibai, a reporter for Ta Kung Pao, also began to use this identity.

Zhang Zhengchang initially expressed his apologies for disturbing us, and then explained that he wanted to borrow the house for accommodation. We Chinese and American journalists discussed it and decided on two principles: (1) This place is a journalist's residence and can only be borrowed for one night; (2) The entire upstairs cannot be occupied, and three rooms downstairs can be borrowed. Zhang Zhengchang agreed to accept our principles, so Shi Xun and McDesson lived in the east wing on the chess side, Yang Huaibai and Zhuozhi lived in the middle room, and Hui Dong lived alone in the west wing. In the large room downstairs, Li Yinman, Walker, and Abernathy slept together. They were all on the floor.

The next morning (the eighteenth), Abernathy woke up and found that she was surrounded by Communist soldiers on both sides. She was not very happy. She said, "This is the first time I've slept with men." Our original two principles stipulated that there should be three and a half male rooms downstairs. In fact, the Communist army occupied five and a half rooms. Zhang Zhengchang said, "It's really because the brothers haven't slept well for several days of fighting!"

The cook said, "Our rice was all eaten by the Communist soldiers last night!" We were still hungry until 11 a.m. We spoke to a battalion political instructor of the Communist army surnamed Guo. He agreed to return it, so we were able to have our lunch.

Political Instructor Guo had a heavy Shandong accent, like most of the Communist soldiers. He admitted that he had walked from Shandong after August 15, and some had come by sea from Yantai. When he spoke to us, he kept staring at the Changchun city map in his hand. We saw that the area he was drawing was the area of the Central Bank. Gunfire was attacking the Central Bank from all four directions.

The Communist Army Swarmed Away

At 2 p.m., the Communist soldiers living in our house swarmed away. We cleaned the house ourselves, wiped the tables, and felt that this was our home, and we liked it.

At dusk, at 6 p.m., there was an urgent knock on the door. Shi Xun and Wheeler went out to open the door. There were a total of five Communist soldiers, two with machine guns and three with pistols. They were invited to sit in the living room. The rest went downstairs to talk to them. Only Zhao Junmai, disguised as Yang Huaibai, a reporter for Ta Kung Pao, claimed to be ill and stayed in bed.

The Communist soldiers explained that attacking Changchun was a domestic issue, and the Soviet Union handing over sovereignty to the government was a diplomatic issue. These two things cannot be confused at all. Secondly, he also indicated that President Chiang was the leader of China, and if he could truly implement democracy and complete the united government.

At that time, the artillery fire was particularly dense, almost firing a dozen shots in one minute. We asked Sun Zheng, "Is this artillery fire aimed at the Central Bank?" He nodded, indicating that it was true. "Then, once this battle starts, when can it be resolved?" We continued to press.

"I think it can be taken down in an hour."

After he finished speaking, he said goodbye to us. When we pushed open the window, we saw flames reaching the sky. We went to the roof and identified that the burning buildings were the City Hall near Datong Square, the Central Bank, and the East Development Company. The entire blue sky was burned red.

The gunfire started and stopped, but finally subsided without a sound. In the distance, we could hear the mixed sounds of burning wood and the sound of the wind. We couldn't hear the sound of dogs barking in the alley, but when the hot wind blew, it brought a difficult-to-smell burnt wood smell.

After dinner, Sun Zheng sent a Platoon Leader Mao with three Communist soldiers to protect us. That night, we didn't close the gate!

But the night was unusually dark and terrible! (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Nine Great Patriotic Poets of the Late Song Dynasty

— Zhao Jingshen

Regarding the patriotic poets of the late Song Dynasty, the first to mention are three Jinshi scholars: Xu Yueqing, a Chunyou Jinshi; Zhen Shanmin, a late Song Jinshi; and Liang Dong, a Xianchun Jinshi.

Xu Yueqing was from Wuyuan and served as a registrar in Haozhou, relentlessly criticizing the treacherous minister Jia Sidao. After the Yuan army captured Qiantang, he secluded himself in a room, calling himself Quantiānzǐ (Master of Spring Fields). He remained mute for five years (some say ten), not uttering a single word, effectively considering himself dead; in reality, this was even more difficult than death. As a poet, he was known as Mr. Shānwū (Mountain Hut). Until his death, he never spoke a word. Although this was a passive form of resistance, his integrity is worthy of admiration. Xie Fangde greatly admired him and once inscribed a couplet on his door: "If you want to see Xie Fangde today, he is just like Xu Yueqing back then." Xu's poetry collection is titled "Xiantian Ji" (Collection of the Pre-Heaven), in two volumes, published by the Commercial Press in its Four Series Collection. Three years ago, these two books sparked my interest, and after reading them, I wrote an article published in "Cosmic Wind."

Zhen Shanmin was identified as surnamed Zhen because someone mentioned his ancestor Xishan. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he went into seclusion. Some say he was from Kuocang, originally named Gui Fang.

Liang Dong was originally from Xiangjiang but moved to Zhenjiang and served as a magistrate in Qiantang County. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, his younger brother Liang Zhu entered Maoshan Mountain to study with an old monk, and Dong went to rely on him. Dong wrote "Liang Longji's Time Notes." Three years ago, I also wrote an article titled "Liang Dong's Poems," published in "Cosmic Wind." This article and "Xu Yueqing's Poems" were written later, so they were not included in my humble compilation "A Short History of Patriotic Literature" (World Edition).

Next, we must mention two poets who were also artists: one was Wang Yuanliang, who could play the qin, and the other was Zheng Sixiao, who could paint orchids.

Wang Yuanliang was not only skilled in composing poetry and playing the qin, but also wrote Ci poetry. He is the author of "Hushan Leigao" (Drafts from Lakeside Mountains), etc. The Xiling Seal Society in Hangzhou seems to have published a special collection of his poetry and Ci, in two volumes, thread-bound. He became known to Empress Dowager Xie for his qin playing. After the fall of Hangzhou, Empress Dowager Xie and many palace women were captured, and he went with them on the same ship. On the ship, he saw that some palace women were quite patriotic, weeping all day long; while others applied rouge and powder, singing and dancing, hoping to gain the favor of the Yuan ruler in the future. He witnessed the daily activities of the palace women at the time, and like writing palace poems or bamboo branch lyrics, he continuously composed many seven-character quatrains. If Ruan Ji's important work is several "Yonghuai" (Expressing My Thoughts) poems, then Wang Yuanliang's important work is several palace poems placed at the beginning of his collection in "Song Poetry Excerpts." When he arrived in Yandu (Yanjing, present day Beijing), the Yuan emperor asked him if he wanted to become an official. He said he wished to become a Daoist priest. From then on, he traveled around, especially to Lushan Mountain. Some saw his踪跡 were飘忽, like飘风行云, truly like a翩翩欲仙. Before he left, a Jin woman named De Shū吟诗道: "万里倦行役，秋来搜几分；因看河北月，忽忆海东云." The more she looked at the moon in Hebei, the more she must have missed the clouds over the palaces of Haidong (East of the Sea, Hangzhou)? However, she had already traveled ten thousand miles, far away from Hangzhou! Autumn is the easiest time to feel nostalgic, looking back on the past, how could she not lose some weight! Wang Yi and Wang Yuanliang's relationship was of course particularly close. Zhang Shengjie's "Qin Farewell" (see Qing Dynasty Miscellaneous Drama Collection II) writes about the events between the two. In my humble work "Notes on Reading Music," page two hundred and twelve, it says: "Qin Farewell describes the Song Dynasty-Yuan Dynasty Ci poet Wang Yuanliang playing the qin to bid farewell to fourteen female Daoist priests. Recently, Yu Dafu is preparing to urgently print his 'Shuiyun Lou Ci' (Water Cloud Tower Lyrics). Wu Mei said: 'Qin Farewell' is also better than 'Heart's Remaining Wintergreen Tree.'"

Dai Sixiao did not forget the Song Dynasty in anything he did. Even his given name and pseudonym reflect this: "Sixiao" means "thinking of Zhao (the Song imperial family)," "Suonan" means "forever remembering Hangzhou in the South," and "Fenweng" (Angry Old Man) also meant remembering the Song Dynasty. Where he lived, he hung a条, on which was written "木穴世界." Removing the "十" from below the character "本", and adding the "十" that was removed from "本" to the character "穴", it becomes the character "宋" (Song). In other words, the "十" character of "本" is moved down. Placed on the character "穴", it becomes the two characters "大宋" (Great Song). Similarly, he wrote a book called "Da Wugong Shikong Jing" (Classic of Great Non-Labor Ten Empty). What is called "Wugong Shikong" ("Non-Labor Ten Empty")? "空"字"无工" becomes the character "穴"; "穴" plus "十" is still the character "宋". Therefore, the "Da Wugong Shikong Jing" is the "Da Song Jing" (Classic of Great Song). The reason why he wanted to be so roundabout was of course because after the fall of the Song Dynasty, he was afraid of offending the literary inquisition, so he used such obscure language. He lived in Suzhou and spent his time painting when he had nothing to do. He especially liked to paint orchids. When a Han Chinese traitor prefect asked him to paint, it was useless even if he kowtowed and called him "father." If he got angry, he would scold the prefect, making him go away with a face full of shame. However, if the lovable villagers asked him to paint, as long as they secretly put a piece of paper on his table when he went out, and put a pot of good wine and a few dishes, he would drink wine, eat some dishes, and get excited, picking up his brush and painting orchids on the paper. However, the orchids he painted were very strange. Other people's orchids all had roots, but the orchids he painted had no roots. People asked him: "Why don't you paint roots when you paint orchids?" He would sigh and say: "The roots have already been tied up by foreigners! When we recover the lost land, we will add the roots!" Usually, he always sat facing south, and during festivals, he would definitely cry facing south. He put his poetry manuscript "Xinshi" (History of the Heart) in an iron box and hid it in the well of Chengtian Temple, hence the name "Jingzhong Xinshi" (History of the Heart in the Well), also called "Tiemian Xinshi" (Iron-Faced History of the Heart). It wasn't until the eleventh year of Chongzhen that this History of the Heart was discovered. Then, in the early years of the Republic of China, Deng Shi and others established the National Studies Rotary Club and printed this History of the Heart in oil-paper type, in only one volume.

Finally, we must mention the four wintergreen trees, which are the four important figures in Jiang Shiquan's (Xinyu) "Wintergreen Tree" chuanqi opera: Xie Ao, Lin Jingxi, Xie Fangde, and Wen Tianxiang. "Wintergreen Tree" is derived from this. On the other hand, it refers to Lin Jingxi. Wen Tianxiang and the two Xies had characters like the "wintergreen tree," able to withstand the erosion of wind, frost, rain, and snow, still standing upright, forever lush and unwithering. Only Jiang's statement that Jingxi later received冥报 is superfluous. Jingxi has "Baishi Qiaochang" (Singing of the White Stone Woodcutter) in six volumes and "Lin Xiaoshan Ji" (Collection of Lin Xiaoshan) in five volumes, but he is most famous for the poem "Wintergreen Song." This poem is extremely obscure and difficult to understand. I remember that the National Studies Rotary Club published "Notes on Wintergreen Song." Cheng Minzheng's "Song Remnants Record" (Notebook Novel Grand View edition, published by the Civilization Bookstore) seems to also have a volume of annotations. In the Ming Dynasty, Bu Shichen wrote a "Wintergreen Record" chuanqi opera about Lin's affairs, but it has been lost.

Xie Fangde and Wen Tianxiang were from the same hometown, also Jiangxi people, from Xinzhou. He was forthright and read books quickly, remembering everything he read for life. When people talked to him about national affairs, he would often stroke his beard and beat the table, jumping up and acting vigorously. He was praised as "a startled crane soaring to the sky, impossible to cage." After organizing a militia and resisting the Yuan marshal, he failed in Xinzhou and went into seclusion in Jianyang, Fujian, earning a living by fortune-telling, only taking shoes and rice, not taking silver. Several poems about giving shoes and rice in "Dieshan Ji" (Collection of Dieshan, Commercial Press Four Series Collection, two volumes) were probably written during this period. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he was unwilling to come out of seclusion. The Han Chinese traitor Cheng Wenhai insisted for many years, insisting on forcing him out, tying him up like a kidnapped person. He had no choice but to starve himself on the way, eating only fruit, and eventually starved to death in Beijing's Minzhong Temple.

Many people know about Wen Tianxiang's last days, so there is no need to describe them in detail. His life story can be found in Song History, volume 418. There are many modern works about Wen Tianxiang. Commercial Press and World Bookstore have reprinted "Complete Works of Wen Tianxiang." Yang Yinshan wrote "Wen Tianxiang Chronological Biography" (Commercial Press) and also wrote the drama "Wen Tianxiang." Wu Zuguang also wrote a drama "Ode to Righteousness." Yang's work examines historical facts with great effort, but unfortunately it has no performance effect and is not convenient to perform, which is due to excessive adherence to historical facts; Wu's work is mostly inconsistent with official history. I gave a lecture at the Shanghai Drama and Art Society once, specifically commenting on this work, but Wu's performance effect was excellent. Zheng Zhenduo not only rearranged "Zhinan Lu" (Record Pointing South) in the first collection of the World Literature Library, but also took this theme and wrote a novel "Gui Gongtang," and even the junior high school Chinese textbooks selected this novel, which has been widely circulated. Other popular readings such as the "Wen Tianxiang" biography written by Zhang Yiping and Yi Junzuo can penetrate the masses even more. It is said that "Ode to Righteousness" has been set to a new song score, so the dissemination will be even wider. Here, I will only say one anecdote: Wen Tianxiang was arrested at Wuchengling in Haifeng (because he was arrested while eating, so later a Fangfan Pavilion (Dining Pavilion) was built there. Haifeng Middle School was built there, and I taught there for half a year twenty years ago). Zhang Hongfan wanted him to write a letter to recruit Zhang Shijie, but he refused. When he was pressed hard, he only wrote out two lines from his old work "Passing Lingdingyang": "人生自古谁无死，留取丹心照汗青!" (Since ancient times, who can avoid death? Leave a loyal heart to shine in history!) Zhang Hongfan had no choice but to smile bitterly.

Many of the above nine poets have many poems selected in the fourth volume of "Song Poetry Excerpts" (Commercial Press National Studies Basic Series). After "knowing the people," if you want to appreciate their poems again, then reading this book is the most convenient and easy to obtain. I introduced the poems of the last seven in "History of National Literature" (World), which can also be used as a reference. There is also "Research on Late Song Patriotic Poetry" published by Zhengzhong Bookstore, which is also a good book.

### Middle Age

— Feicun

The jianghu is old,

But the world feels increasingly unfamiliar.

The smiling faces of elders are nowhere to be found,

The children in our arms push us away.

The steps of "effort,"

Have unexpectedly approached the edge of life's wilderness,

I also gradually have the stinginess of a vagabond at the end of his road,

The years remaining in my hands are few.

Passion has been extinguished by worldliness,

The remaining embers are a pile of sorrow.

Middle-aged dreams are cigarettes and alcohol,

Only they can dry the dampness at the bottom of my heart.

### Drizzling Rain

— Lin Yun

A few lonely hours slipped away in the tassels of the drizzling rain, how much of life's brilliance has faded away, in the lost, brilliant April, who can withstand the rainy season of the heart?

April's wind is gently hazy, although that cloudless sky is a gray-blue, without the fiery red of the setting sun; nor the magnificent colors of the evening glow, but under the drizzling rain of dusk, I linger, like reading a page of melancholy little poems, lightly, it will let you understand more thoughts!

Let's not speak, quietly watch the waves slowly rise and fall, at that time, it's as if listening to a mystical movement, you will understand the meaning of life's ups and downs, whose life can have a wide and flat road? There are spring and autumn in the years, days full of sunshine, and hours drifting with salty rain, although people are infinitely happy and laugh, but no one can resist the gloomy weeping, even if they can deceive others with a forced smile, but they can never deceive themselves, otherwise they would not feel that the punishment of the soul is too cruel.

Silk-thin raindrops, densely scattered, in this solemn realm, silence can feel a little more intimacy, when the river wind brings a soothing evening bell, a white religious feeling will unconsciously float on the soul, you will lower your head, falling into distant contemplation, that is a vast sea. How much past, how much future, memories of childhood laughter, youthful love, but memories will also return you a little bitterness and a little desolation, if memories give you too heavy a burden, you may shed tears of rain.

People live between hope and disappointment, live between memories and childhood dreams, many past events will evoke solemn memories, but many new hopes will evoke infinite reveries, but hope is always hazy, like the rainy scenery on the river at dusk, covered with a layer of light fog, so faint...

Riverside, in the drizzling rain of dusk, one can gain more profound enlightenment, understand oneself, and also understand life, life will be as erratic as drizzling rain, but don't be too sad, although today there was a drizzle, there was a touch of thin sorrow, perhaps tomorrow, in the warm sunshine, there will be infinite laughter, but, don't forget today's drizzle.

### Inscription on a Painting

— Chen Zhongtao

The rain feet, high and low, fly ten thousand crossbows. The banana leaves transform into graceful dancers. The sparse osmanthus, wind enters, the lamp sways. In my dream, I hear the spring geese in the reeds. The wine is cold, the incense fades, the dream fades and I awake. The shadows of the jianghu are too fragmented. Unable to sleep, I love to listen to the night watchman's clapper. Tomorrow, I know apricot blossoms will fill the city.

### Familiar Shouts

— Fu Bo

Outside the window, the shout of "White Sugar Plums" has started again.

For eight years, I wandered in small cities in the Southwest, where there was no familiar sound. Therefore, whenever the late spring season came, and I felt nostalgic for my hometown, I would think of the plum groves of my home, which were probably full of green plums? Thus, the shout of "White Sugar Plums" would float leisurely in my ears again.

Last autumn, I returned and went to see if the plum groves were safe and sound, but the weeds were ankle-deep, a desolate scene, and I couldn't find any remaining branches of plum trees!

I didn't feel heartbroken or sad about losing the plum groves, because at that time, victory had just arrived, and my heart was burning with an even greater fire of joy.

But, gradually, this joy turned into disappointment, domestic disputes were like this, the people's livelihood was so depleted...

Therefore, when this familiar shout rang in my ears again, in addition to a feeling of intimacy, I also felt infinite sadness; the taste of victory is not the same as white sugar plums, wrapped in a layer of sweet sugar coating, but the inside is still bitter.

### Peonies and Phoenixes

— Shi Jimei

I remember when I was a child, a teacher said: "The magnificent peonies are not necessarily stronger than the duckweed on the water, and a rooster that crows at dawn is more brilliant than the phoenix, the king of birds." I didn't understand the riddle-like parable, but I sincerely admired that teacher, so I kept his words carefully in my heart, until today.

I dare not say that I am smarter now than before (because I am always stupid), but at least I understand things a little better than when I was a child. People who have visited a chemistry lab will no longer be surprised how a leaf can be turned into a beautiful bookmark. A twenty-year-old naturally knows more about the social situation than a ten-year-old. Why? Is this society so unsatisfactory? Is it presenting extreme deformity? One side is desolate and dark, with no light; while the other side is unusually lively, respectable, and glorious. Why? Perhaps this is a mystery, but one point must be admitted: in the current society, there are really many great people, but the great careers that have been achieved are really too few.

"To aspire to do great things, not to be a great official." The Founding Father said such words, what a short and meaningful lesson! I think there are too many peonies and phoenixes in our society.

### Flying Together, Two by Two (37)

— Zhao Qingge

Regarding Mrs. York's visit to Beijing, Mrs. Weng had not told Shi Yulou beforehand. Mrs. Weng asked one of Shi Yulou's private qin teachers to write the letter. It wasn't that Mrs. Weng intended to hide it from Shi Yulou, but rather that Mrs. Weng felt that this matter was between her and Mrs. York, and there was no need to ask for Shi Yulou's consent. Moreover, Shi Yulou didn't seem to have time to inquire about this matter. Besides, Shi Yulou couldn't read or write, so even if she told him and he agreed, he couldn't handle this matter for Mrs. Weng. Therefore, Mrs. Weng simply acted dictatorially, but unexpectedly, in a casual conversation, it was revealed by the qin teacher. The qin teacher asked Mrs. Weng why the guest she had invited hadn't arrived yet. Before Mrs. Weng could answer, Shi Yulou pressed her to ask what guest she had invited. Only then did Mrs. Weng have to tell him everything. But Shi Yulou was annoyed. He had been in a bad mood lately, his career was not going well, and his temper had become particularly irritable. So he blamed Mrs. Weng for not telling him beforehand. His reason was that he didn't like guests. On stage, he could reluctantly mingle with many people, but at home, he only wanted to be alone. He loved solitude! Mrs. Weng explained her relationship with Mrs. York, exaggerating how good Mrs. York was as a person, and explaining that Mrs. York was a meritorious figure in helping her and Shi Yulou to get together, but none of this moved Shi Yulou. He had no impression of Mrs. York at all, so she had no interest in her. Because of this matter, they quarreled for the first time, although in the end Mrs. Weng still succumbed, but she was very dissatisfied in her heart. She thought that Shi Yulou wasn't treating her as his wife, but simply as his emperor! Shi Yulou's autocracy gradually made her feel uneasy! She felt oppressed! She also understood Shi Yulou's financial difficulties, but she had taken out some of her own private money to help Shi Yulou. Naturally, Shi Yulou's monthly salary was only two hundred yuan, and two hundred yuan was not enough for her to eat and smoke. For this reason, Mrs. Weng thought that Shi Yulou was afraid that Mrs. York's arrival would increase his burden. In fact, Mrs. Weng herself understood that Mrs. York would not burden them, and Mrs. York might even help them. Therefore, Mrs. Weng hoped even more that Mrs. York could come to Beijing, and hoped that she would come quickly. Whether in spirit or in life, she desperately needed Mrs. York. But she was unwilling to say much to Shi Yulou about this.

One evening at dusk, after Mrs. Weng sent Shi Yulou to the theater, she was feeling lonely in her heart. Suddenly, there was a commotion outside, startling her to rush out the door to take a look. It turned out that Mrs. York and丽华,丽云 had arrived! Immediately, Mrs. Weng was so happy that she jumped up! She rushed over and grabbed Mrs. York's hand, saying:

"Sister, you've finally come! I've been waiting so long that my eyes are almost worn out!"

Mrs. Weng also greeted Lihua, Liyun, especially when she saw Liyun, she felt a pang of sadness, called out "乖 (Guai)," and tears welled up in her eyes!

"Sister! How have you become like this? If you hadn't called me first, I almost wouldn't have recognized you!" Mrs. York scrutinized Mrs. Weng for a while, and the first sentence struck at Mrs. Weng's sore spot.
