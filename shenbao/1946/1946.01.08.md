Finally, Member Shao Lizi especially hoped for the success of the meeting, and expressed his apologies for those who requested to participate in the meeting or request to attend as observers, but could not get their wish. Shao also said: it is because of the limitations of the meeting venue and other issues, not because of disrespecting their opinions, and he hopes that all parties understand. By 5:00 p.m., the chairman made a conclusion and announced the adjournment.

### National Army Flies to Changchun in Succession; The Entire Division of the First Batch of Security Forces Will Be Transported Within Three Weeks, Responsible for Guarding and Assisting in Takeover Work

[Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 6th] It is known that the troops airlifted from Beiping to Changchun beginning on the 5th are the Second Northeast Security Force, reorganized from the puppet Manchukuo army. The first batch of 217 officers and soldiers, led by Deputy Commander Wu Yaozong, flew to Changchun on ten transport planes. Another 250 officers and soldiers took off today. It is estimated that the unit will be transported within three weeks. Commander Liu Depu is scheduled to fly there next week. It is reported that after the unit arrives, in addition to a part being responsible for the guard of Changchun, the rest will be assigned to various provincial governments to assist in the takeover work. Today, Commander Liu told this reporter that the unit has excellent qualities. University graduates account for 5%, middle school graduates account for 40%, and higher elementary school graduates account for 50%. The equipment of firearms is also very good. For several years, the unit has been in close contact with the central government. After Japan surrendered, it first entered the Kailuan mining area from its station in Zhenzi Town to accelerate industrial and mining production. On September 26, it was ordered to be reorganized into its current number, with a full European compilation, roughly equivalent to a division. There is a cavalry regiment that has entered Rehe with General Du Yuming, and the remaining three infantry regiments are being airlifted one after another. Before Japan surrendered, the unit was stationed in Luanxian. Now that the national humiliation has been avenged and they have returned to their homeland, all officers and soldiers are overjoyed. Commander Liu, a native of Shenyang, graduated from the 10th class of the Northeast Lecture Hall.

[Report from This Newspaper] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 7th stated that Chiang Ching-kuo, President Chiang's personal representative, is currently on his way back to Chongqing from Moscow and will report to President Chiang on the results of his negotiations with the Soviets. It is reported that this negotiation was very smooth for China to take over the Northeast. Chinese troops can be airlifted to Harbin, and Chinese troops in South China can be transported to the Northeast by sea.

[United Press Dispatch from Beiping, 7th] In the past two days, more than 1,000 national troops have been transferred from Beiping to Changchun. In addition, Commissioner Chiang Ching-kuo has returned from Moscow and reported on the trip, so the national army in the Northeast is becoming active again. New C-47 type transport planes carried 400 members of the Northeast Camp Security Team to Changchun on the 5th and transported them again on the 6th, where the weather is 20 degrees below zero. When the national army entered the city, civilians lined the streets to welcome them. The airlift continued today, still carrying 400 people. For three weeks, U.S. special aircraft have been equipped and airlifted to Beiping to provide cold weather protection, but each plane is still afraid to spend the night at the airport for fear of freezing.

### Rehe Takeover is Extremely Smooth; Advancing on Both North and South Routes

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jinzhou, 7th] The takeover of Rehe is extremely smooth. The Northern Route National Army has advanced from Yixian and Fuxin to the vicinity of Jianping. The Southern Route National Army also advanced to the vicinity of Lingyuan today. The defense of the two places can be completed within one or two days.

[United Press, with Troops in Rehe, 6th] General Du Yuming's troops did not fire a shot in Rehe Province, and successively recaptured the coal mining center of Beipiao and the important railway and highway town of Chaoyang from the Communist army. Thus, in the past 48 hours, it has completely occupied the so-called "Saar region of the Northeast." Trains have resumed running between Beipiao and Jinzhou. It is reported that the Rehe Provincial Government will move to Chaoyang as soon as possible. Beipiao is located 20 miles inside the border of Rehe Province, along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Railway. Chaoyang is southwest of Beipiao, 22 miles from the Rehe-Liaoning border. The National Army occupied these two cities successively after retaking Fuxin at the beginning of last week. The area has a population of 130,000 and was expanded by the Japanese army during the war to become the largest coal production center in the Northeast, with an annual output of nearly 5 million tons. During the Japanese occupation, Beipiao alone produced more than 100 tons of coal annually. Fuxin and Beipiao are located at the two ends of a 75-mile coal bed in Rehe Province. Du's 13th Army is pressing tightly on Chengde, the provincial capital, from the east, and the 92nd Army is advancing from the Beiping area in the west, so Chengde is under pressure from both sides. General Du and Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, went to Fuxin for inspection on Friday. On the same day, the National Army entered the city of Beipiao. On Saturday, the National Army recaptured Chaoyang, 60 miles northeast of Jinzhou. After the Soviet army withdrew a month ago, the entire province of Rehe was heavily fortified by the Communist army, which was forced to retreat at the last minute when Du Yuming's army penetrated the southern part of Rehe via Fuxin. In Fuxin, through the interpreter, the reporter chatted with the local villagers and learned that the Communist army had withdrawn half an hour before the National Army arrived. I (the reporter referring to himself) am the first American correspondent to enter Rehe in recent years, and I accompanied General Du Yuming to inspect the front-line troops north of Fuxin.

Soldiers Guard the Border in the Cold at Fifteen Degrees Below Zero

In a temperature of fifteen degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale, I personally saw soldiers sitting behind the wall at the muzzle of the cannon, obviously trying to warm themselves. The severe cold of the weather, even with leather gloves and winter uniforms, seemed to be of little help. They held rifles in their hands and stomped their feet constantly, wiping the snot from their noses with their sleeves. I took General Du's special car to Fuxin, led by a hundred guards in armored trains. The engines of the jeeps and trucks never stopped throughout the journey to prevent freezing. The train heads and carriages were filled with water heaters, and we could hardly see anything from the windows. The officers and soldiers constantly drank tea and warmed themselves in the car. On the way, the car passed over two temporary bridges, and the original bridges on both sides had been blown up by the Communist army.

Only Two Caves Can Be Used in the Saar Region of Northeast China

Among those who accompanied General Du to Fuxin and Beipiao were several coal mine experts. When inspecting the Fuxin Coal Mine, the so-called Saar region of the Northeast, after its recovery, it was found that only two of the eight mine caves were still usable. These two caves belong to the local excavation type. The remaining six caves are deep underground, and it is estimated that it will take about a year to repair them before production can be restored. In the past few days, central coal mine experts have conducted a detailed study based on the records of Chinese workers and Japanese managers. They declared that the major machinery had been dismantled by the Soviets, and the smaller equipment had also been removed by the Communist army. The pumps in all six holes were dismantled, and the entire interior was flooded. I saw miners working hard at zero degrees in the other two holes, producing 500 tons of coal per day; but during the Japanese occupation, 14,000 tons of coal could be produced per day. It is reported that during the one month of Communist army occupation, a total of 300 tons of coal were produced per day. During the two months of Soviet army occupation, the miners were afraid and fled, and production completely stopped. At the same time, the Soviet army was not interested in this, and all the Soviet army wanted was to dismantle the heavy machinery.

### Three Guangzhou Traitors Will Be Publicly Tried Separately

[Dispatch from Our Guangzhou Office, 6th] The High Court has decided to publicly try Chen Hongci, the puppet High Court President and Chief of the Pacification Office's Military Law Office, on the 20th; Li Chaoqun, the traitor, on the 8th; and Wang Yingru, the puppet Minister of Civil Affairs, on the 9th. The three major traitors will be allowed to hire lawyers to defend them and the public will be allowed to attend the trials, but the lawyers here believe that traitors are enemies of the people and are unwilling to appear in court to defend them. The court believes that lawyers should defend the defendants and will appoint lawyers to defend them, and will not allow them to refuse.

### Changchun Citizens Console the National Army; The Camp Group Has Entered Shenyang; Administrative Personnel Leave the Border on Two Routes

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 6th] The news that the Northeast Security Team has been airlifted to Changchun has spread throughout the city, and all walks of life have sent condolences and are preparing to hold a consolation conference. Some of the consolation items were completed one or two months ago. In addition, most of the Soviet guards guarding the Xingying organs have been withdrawn today and replaced by our newly arrived security team.

[Another Dispatch] Another group of officers and soldiers from the Northeast Security Force flew here from Ping today. They were transported on ten planes, and another two planes carried Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province, and Commissioner Liang Zhongquan, together with a group of 38 personnel from Jilin, Liaobei, and Songjiang Provinces.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 6th] The Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief Department's Camp Group, which was originally scheduled to enter Shenyang from Xinmin last night, arrived by car at 9:00 a.m. this morning due to traffic conditions. When the reporter arrived and the Chang car drove into the city, the people along the way gave General Peng Bisheng enthusiastic cheers, and the cheers for the accompanying guard troops were especially enthusiastic. The clothing and actions of the guards were very noticeable. Mayor Dong Wenqi and Soviet Deputy Commander of the City Defense Arloxing were also at the station to welcome them.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Beiping, 7th] The troops airlifted from Ping to the Northeast, starting on the 5th, have been proceeding smoothly due to the good weather in recent days. Officials from various provincial governments and takeover personnel in the northeast have also been airlifted out of the pass in large numbers in recent days. In addition to the chairmen of Songjiang and Nenjiang provinces, and important personnel who have been airlifted to Changchun in the past two days, Zheng Daoru, chairman of Jilin Province, is currently ill and unable to start. Deputy Chairman Wang Ninghua is temporarily acting as chairman, and led a secretary general Mao Tuoqing, and 20 others to fly to Changchun from Ping on the morning of the 7th. Personnel from the departments of economics, transportation, telecommunications, and postal services are waiting for a flight and can travel within days. Administrative personnel in Beiping from the Northeast are leaving the border by air and land on two routes, and it will take ten days to complete the transportation. The Northeast Camp and key personnel from various provinces have been working day and night to plan the takeover.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 5th] At 10:00 a.m. today, Mo Dehui went to the municipal government and police station to give instructions. He was warmly welcomed by the municipal government along the way. Mo originally went to the citizens by car, but the crowd was crowded and the road was blocked, so he got out of the car and walked. The voices of "Long live the Republic of China" and "Long live President Chiang" were endless, forming a craze. At 3:00 p.m., Mo went to the old provincial government to attend a welcome meeting from all walks of life, and everyone cried out in pain when he talked about the tragedy of the northeast in the past fourteen years. After the meeting, Mo returned to his residence and encountered a row of students from Changli Xu, cheering in unison. Mo is scheduled to hold a rally to comfort the citizens in the city hall on the 6th.

### Chennault Arrives in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] General Chennault, the number one hero of the Flying Tigers and former commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, returned to China on his special C54 Skymaster transport plane on the evening of the 6th, five months after leaving the country. Among those who welcomed him at the airport were General Weidner and Mayor Qian Dajun. That evening, he also attended Mayor Qian's reception. Chennault traveled from San Francisco to Shanghai via Manila, taking only three and a half days. Chennault's demeanor remained unchanged, still wearing his military uniform and retaining his original Air Force Major General rank, but he did not bring any attendants. Chennault mentioned that he had lost four pounds during his five-month stay in the United States, which he considered regrettable. Yesterday, Chennault met with various U.S. military generals here, and many of his Chinese friends also visited him. Chennault has taken up residence in an apartment here. A reporter visited him last night and he said that he hoped to go to Chongqing as soon as possible to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, and also hoped to return to his old residence in Kunming for a short rest. He deeply felt honored to have cooperated with the Chinese Air Force to fight against the Japanese invaders during the war.

Editorial

### The Reconstruction of Our Navy

According to recent news reports, the Naval Headquarters has been ordered to be abolished, and the Ministry of Military Administration has sent the Director of the Naval Affairs Department to Shanghai to take over. At the same time, it was reported that Admiral Chen Shaokuan, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, has resigned. As the great task of national construction is being actively promoted, and the primary task of national construction lies in building up the military, this adjustment in national defense and military affairs is indeed a significant measure.

First of all, we must point out that in our efforts to build up the military, the importance of the navy cannot be ignored. Although China is a continental country, we have a long coastline and the islands of Taiwan and Hainan, making us the only major power on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. To defend our coast and to protect Taiwan and Hainan, we must attach importance to the navy in our efforts to build up the military. Because we did not have a sufficient navy in the past, we were unable to resist the Japanese pirates' land and sea invasions. In our great task of national construction, we should actively build up the navy. However, there are several important issues in the reconstruction of our navy. First, the organizational problem of building the military; second, the naval policy problem. In addition to these, there are many problems surrounding the building of the military, such as the industrial and technical problems of building the military, the problem of talent or personnel, etc. However, compared with the organizational and policy problems, the problems of industry and personnel are secondary.

Some people may say that this is the age of atomic energy, and it seems unnecessary to rebuild the navy, which is somewhat mistaken. The navy has both passive and active significance in national defense. In terms of passivity, the navy is sufficient to prevent aggression. Nazi Germany's failure to cross the English Channel and invade Britain should be attributed to the British Navy. Control of the sea is extremely important from a national defense point of view. In terms of activity, the best defense is offense, and without a navy, one cannot take the offensive. The defeat of the Japanese invaders was mainly due to the US Navy. Without the navy led by Admiral Nimitz, how could they have occupied Iwo Jima and taken Okinawa? The Normandy landings also relied on the superiority of the Allied navies. The navy was a very important factor in defeating the Axis powers. The Second World War reconfirmed the importance of the navy. Therefore, the navy cannot be ignored in our efforts to build up the military.

However, in our efforts to build up the military, we also need a strong organization. The dual organizational system of the army and navy is no longer in line with the current use of national defense. This dual organization really needs to be reorganized. The United States originally had an independent Department of the Navy, but far-sighted people, in order to cope with future situations, advocated abolishing it after the First World War and combining the army and navy to form a single combat department or military department centered on national defense. Unfortunately, this plan was opposed and failed to be realized. Based on the experience of the Second World War, U.S. President Truman recently submitted a bill to Congress proposing to merge the army and navy departments into a single Department of National Defense. The introduction of this bill is due to the painful experience of the Second World War and has been widely praised. China has been committed to the construction of the navy for more than 50 years, but has not achieved any success. Although the reasons for this are not simple, the navy's independent system is also an obstacle. Now that our country is actively building up the military, the adjustment of military organization is a matter of urgency. We believe that the establishment of a naval affairs department in the Ministry of Military Administration is a necessary condition for unifying military power. Judging from recent international trends, it is a wise step. However, the tasks of the army and navy are different, and under the unified military power, each should have its own responsibilities and perform its duties separately. It would be incompetent to have army officers take on naval duties. What we need to strive for is to create a new tradition for our navy under the unified military power, rather than creating the army's navalization.

In addition, the unification of military power refers to the army, navy, and air force. In the United States, the air force is attached to the army system, while the United Kingdom has an independent air force. U.S. President Truman's proposal is to combine the army, navy, and air force into a single military department, with three departments for the army, navy, and air force. This plan is enough for us to learn from in building up the military. China's air force is still in the stage of growth, and the construction of the air force must be planned in conjunction with the construction of the army and navy. The Ministry of Military Administration, as its name suggests, takes the entire country's armed forces as its object. We approve of the measure of placing the navy under the control of the Ministry of Military Administration, and we also hope that the Chinese air force will not form its own system, and should also be transferred to the Ministry of Military Administration for deployment under the call for unified military power. Only in this way can our country's military construction have a sound organizational foundation.

As for policy, what kind of navy do we need? It is also worth studying. Building a navy requires an industrial base and cannot be achieved immediately. During the First World War, the Japanese Navy was still mainly building ships abroad; this was more than 30 years away from its active construction of the navy, which shows that naval construction is not easy. The main object of China's navy reconstruction should be to defend the country, it should be defensive rather than aggressive. Therefore, the focus of China's navy reconstruction is not on battleships, but on cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and even submarines. The task of the Chinese navy is not to control the open sea, but to protect the coastal waters. Our ally on the other side of the Pacific Ocean has the task of making the Pacific Ocean forever peaceful, and the task of the Chinese navy is to assist this task on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. To fulfill this task, we need at least one million tons of warships, and we need a large number of naval personnel. China's naval construction has not fully begun, and we must create an excellent tradition for the Chinese navy. Due to the adjustment of the military structure, we hope that China's new navy can be truly rebuilt.

Before the United Nations machinery begins to work, the representatives must consider the following points: (1) Electing six non-permanent members to the Security Council to cooperate with the five most powerful countries (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France) in the committee. The election of non-permanent members should be based on geographical distribution. (2) Electing the Secretary-General, with the Ambassador to the United States, Bia Sun, as the top candidate. In addition, Marshal Eisenhower, former British Foreign Secretary Eden, and the Norwegian Foreign Minister have also been rumored. (3) Establishing a military committee, whose first task is to guide the Security Council on the military quotas that each country should contribute. (4) Trusteeship issues are expected to be raised early in the General Assembly. Some representatives in the Preparatory Committee already have a tendency to suspect that the trusteeship governments will delay the action of replacing the mandate system with the trusteeship system.

### United Nations Organization is the Cornerstone of Peace

[United Press, New York, 6th] The New York Times cautiously evaluated the recent Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers for two weeks before concluding that the agreements reached at the conference, along with the United Nations organization, have become the two pillars of permanent peace. Both pillars show the world that the war in Europe and Asia was a war for the United Nations, and therefore all should participate in seeking peace. [Associated Press] The newspaper also expressed a hope for the departure of the U.S. representatives to attend the United Nations General Assembly in London, believing that the painful lessons learned in the past twenty-five years have not been wasted, and that the new United Nations organization and General Assembly will take swift and decisive action to seek reconciliation and progress. The newspaper said: Although the League of Nations was not successful, it did have its important goals, and its organization worked in the center of the continent where countries were competing with each other. If the United States had joined the League, and if the League members had taken small risks to avoid big disasters and taken decisive measures against aggressor countries, the League of Nations would have had a better chance of success. The newspaper concluded: The United Nations organization is now ready to take over the research and specialized departments of the League of Nations, including the library and archives. The new International Court of Justice is actually a continuation of the League of Nations International Court of Justice. "We can say that the League of Nations has not disappeared, but will be resurrected from the ashes."

### Amidst the Disturbances in the Dutch East Indies, U.S. Troops Withdraw from Southeast Asia, All Parties Consider This Move of Great Significance

[United Press, Washington, 7th] U.S. Secretary of State Beal announced last night that the United States was disengaging from the Mountbatten Joint Command in Southeast Asia. Because the British and Dutch troops attacked the Javanese independence army, which caused private controversy for several weeks, the United States can now follow an independent political path in the turbulent Southeast Asia.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Southeast Asia United Nations Staff Corps issued a notice at midnight today, stating: "The U.S. military's mission in the India-Burma theater has been completed. The United States has no need to participate in the disarmament of the Japanese army and the restoration of the political situation in the territory under the Southeast Asia Command. Therefore, the United Nations Staff Corps believes that from a military point of view, Admiral Mountbatten does not need to retain the Anglo-American Joint Command. The U.S. representatives will be limited to theater liaison in the future." At a time when the Dutch East Indies are in turmoil, with British and Dutch troops in Java fighting the East Indian independence army, all parties believe that this move has great significance.

### U.S. President Urges People to Help with the Clothing Drive

[United Press, Washington, 6th] President Truman today called on the nation to help the "Victory Clothing Donation Drive" to aid hundreds of millions of people worldwide who have suffered from the ravages of war. The President's call said, "More than 300 million people in disaster-stricken countries around the world are paying the price of victory this winter with hunger, cold, poverty, and disease. Americans donated old clothes in the spring, allowing 25 million men, women, and children in Europe, China, and the Philippines to stay warm, which is the starting point for relief and rehabilitation this winter. To further enable those who are less fortunate than ourselves to share our surplus, we are now collecting victory clothes, so as to express our gratitude to the Almighty God for enabling us to win victory at a great price."

### Investigation of Pearl Harbor Incident May Reach Two Conclusions

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th Dispatch] The U.S. Congressional Pearl Harbor Incident Investigation Committee has completed two-thirds of its work since hearing reports on November 15 last year. The committee has now adjourned. To date, 60 witnesses have testified, and the report records have reached one million words. There are other witnesses, including General Short (Army) and Admiral Kimmel (Navy), who are directly related to the Pearl Harbor incident, who will continue to speak, so it will still take some time before responsibility can be determined. The New York Times wrote an article today reviewing the investigation of the Pearl Harbor incident, stating that it may reach two conclusions: (1) The late President Roosevelt did not lead the United States into war, and (2) the jealousy and infighting between the U.S. Army and Navy should bear part of the responsibility for the Pearl Harbor tragedy.

### U.S. State Department to Strengthen International News Service Work

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The State Department today issued a statement on the report submitted by Dr. McClymont regarding the establishment of the U.S. International News Service. The statement said: Modern international relations belong to the people of all countries, not just the governments. Therefore, open information activities have become an integral part of the guidance of foreign policy. If the people of other countries do not understand the background of our foreign policy, then the various policies cannot be clearly understood and accepted. The U.S. government has long been aware of this. Dr. McClymont argues that the government should not wage a news war with the people. In peacetime, the United States needs a news service that covers the globe. The report submitted by Mr. McClymont has ten points for future work, such as strengthening news releases, assisting journalists, publishing publications, assisting the foreign publishing industry, exhibiting photos, lending radio broadcasts, and showing films about the United States.

### Shidehara Still Has Lingering Intentions to Cling to Power, the Cabinet Faces Numerous Difficulties, Dispatch Foreign Minister Yoshida to Meet MacArthur for Instructions, the Date of the Japanese General Election Will Be Decided by MacArthur

[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch] The Japanese political situation is currently in a precarious and uneasy situation. The fate of the Shidehara Cabinet will probably be decided within a day or two. During yesterday's cabinet discussion, the question of whether the cabinet should resign en masse was left to Shidehara to handle. Today, this newspaper's reporter went to the gate of the Prime Minister's official residence and saw government personnel going in and out, very busy, and their flustered state was revealed in their expressions. Shidehara has not yet gotten out of bed due to illness, but he is in contact with various parties today, continuously discussing how to implement MacArthur's instructions. It is generally believed that the Shidehara Cabinet may fall within a day or two, but Shidehara himself clearly still has lingering intentions to cling to power. It is said that he notified the cabinet members yesterday to continue to serve. The Social Democratic Party publicly criticized the Shidehara Cabinet today, demanding the resignation of the entire government, but general public opinion and political parties have not yet made explicit statements. At the same time, Shidehara has ordered Foreign Minister Yoshida to meet MacArthur to ask for instructions on the question of the cabinet's advance and retreat, and hopes that MacArthur can take into account the difficulties of the cabinet members and enable the cabinet to remain standing. As of this afternoon, Yoshida has not yet met MacArthur. All parties believe that the actual action of a partial reorganization or general resignation of the Japanese cabinet will be taken after Yoshida meets MacArthur. As for the future, the entire political situation in Japan will be greatly reformed under the influence of MacArthur's decisions. Both the political circles and the parliament today believe that the cabinet crisis is becoming more acute, and that the members of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, political party figures, and local personnel who are aggressors will also be on the list of those to be purged, because the purpose of MacArthur's order is to guide Japanese politics onto the road to democratization. According to reliable sources, it is clear that Shidehara's intention is to remove the cabinet members who have been accused of being aggressors, and then carry out political and economic reforms in accordance with the instructions to overcome the current difficulties. However, the outcome will depend entirely on MacArthur's decision.

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Kyodo News Agency speculated today that the Japanese general election will be held around mid-February. According to the Allied Headquarters, the official date will be decided and announced by the Allied Headquarters as soon as MacArthur's instructions have cleared out the Japanese aggressors and guaranteed the people's freedom to vote. The Japanese cabinet originally planned to hold a general election in January, but it was postponed by the Allied Headquarters' instructions. However, the cabinet still hopes to hold the election as soon as possible so that it can submit the budget and other important matters to the special parliament convened after the re-election.

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] MacArthur recently issued an instruction to purge Japanese aggressors, and today the Communist Party followed suit, demanding the elimination of Japanese women war criminals. According to Maki, the director of the party's women's department, the Communist Party has prepared a list of women war criminals and is currently compiling a second list, which includes female educators, female writers, officials of the Women's Division of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and officials of the Japanese Women's Association supported by the government. In addition, there is a female factory foreman who strictly controlled the female workers and punished those who did not obey.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Jiji Press reported that, according to well-informed sources close to the cabinet, the Imperial Guard Headquarters will also be thoroughly reorganized under the influence of General MacArthur's instructions, because most of the officers and soldiers of the Guard were former officers and soldiers of the Imperial Guard Division.

### Gandhi Re-Advocates Using Disobedience as a Weapon to Fight for Indian Liberation; Nehru Advocates Organizing a Federation; British Delegation Received Reporters Yesterday

[Reuters, Calcutta, 7th] Gandhi, who has been out of politics for six months, made a statement yesterday, claiming that he will use disobedience as a weapon to achieve India's goals. Disobedience is the strength of the Indian people. The entire nation is unwilling to obey British aspirations and is prepared to endure the consequences of this. Ultimately, it will inevitably cause the institutions of imperialism to grind to a halt.

[Reuters, Bombay, 7th] Nehru, leader of the Congress Party, said in a speech today at an election meeting in Sukkur, Sindh province, that he hopes India, Burma, Malaya, Ceylon, Iran, and Afghanistan can form a federation. The plan to partition India would create a permanent life of slavery. Even if the British government and the Muslim League agree to partition India, the opposition of the Hindu and Sikh communities will ensure that it cannot become a reality. After the British withdraw from India, the question of India's political system can be resolved. Nehru added that the plan to partition India goes against the spirit of the times.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 6th] After arriving in New Delhi this afternoon, the British Parliamentary delegation held its first press conference, reiterating that the delegation is in India to conduct thorough research and will inquire about all matters related to the Indian issue. Professor Lees-Smith, head of the delegation, said, "We are not here to lecture, nor are we representatives of the government. We have not been instructed to make any report; we are purely independent representatives." Sorenson, a member of parliament who is most loved by Indians for his sympathy for India, said, "We are here to learn, so we must sincerely tell you that we have absolute freedom to express our opinions." Richards stated that the delegation's plans have not yet been decided. It is said that Jinnah, chairman of the Indian Muslim League, will be the first Indian leader to meet with the delegation; he is currently in New Delhi.

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang

Report on the Collapse of the Seawall Submitted to the Provincial Government: This county previously reported the collapse of the seawall and requested an on-site inspection for emergency repairs. County Magistrate Huang not only submitted a report to the provincial authorities but also dispatched technical assistant Xu Zhenxing and others to inspect the Jinshanzui area. According to the investigation, the most severe damage was found along the 3rd, 4th, and 5th "baos" (sections) of Jinshanzui Township. The total length of damage reached 1,220 meters, with some breaches as wide as 37 meters. In the event of a strong gale or large wave, these areas are in danger of being washed away. Therefore, detailed charts and tables have been prepared and submitted to the provincial government for approval.

Letter to County Government Requesting Speedy Establishment of Vagrant Training Centers: Vagrants and beggar children are increasingly prevalent in urban and rural areas. These people have been corrupted by the Japanese enemy and have mostly become addicted to drugs and other vices. Therefore, the Winter Defense Office proposed at a joint meeting of all sectors to establish centers to accommodate them and provide relief. It was resolved that the county government should be requested to quickly establish vagrant training centers and beggar children's education centers. In addition to allocating funds from the existing vagrant training centers, a letter was sent to the managers of the Fude Benevolent Hall to request that all of the hall's land rent revenue be transferred to this purpose.

Hangzhou

Municipal Expansion: Departments to be Reorganized into Bureaus: To expand municipal administration, the Hangzhou Municipal Government has decided to reorganize the Public Works, Health, and Education Departments into bureaus. The personnel selections have been announced: (1) Shen Jingchu as Director of the Public Works Bureau, (2) Zhang Xinpei as Director of the Health Bureau, and (3) Zhong Boyong as Director of the Education Bureau.

Suzhou

Frequent Thefts in Four Rural Townships of This County: Theft has been rampant in the four rural townships and urban areas recently. There have been several robbery cases every day. Yesterday, Lishu reported a bandit alarm again, with more than 40 bandits holding weapons and robbing for two hours. The provincial government has instructed the Wu County government to pay close attention. In addition to strengthening defenses, the City Defense Command plans to cooperate with the police to establish an extensive intelligence network to prevent bandit activity. Zhang Shaohua, the head of the Second Water Police District, is preparing to conduct a large-scale suppression during the winter defense period to pacify the four townships.

Wuxi

County Government Arrests Traitorous Bandit District Chief: Mao Yunxiang, a villager near Nanmenhou Fangqian, served as the leader of the intelligence team of the puppet spy station and the secretary-general of the Yi Society during the enemy occupation. He privately set up checkpoints in the four townships, extorting travelers. With a large network of accomplices, he rejoined the traitorous bandits after the enemy's surrender, serving as the district chief of the suburban area, levying public grain and forcibly conscripting young villagers into the bandit ranks, poisoning the local area. Recently, he secretly went to Shanghai, which was discovered by County Magistrate Fan Tisheng, who immediately dispatched officers to Shanghai, arrested Mao Yunxiang, and also captured Lu Hefeng, deputy district chief of the traitorous bandit Meixi District, and Hui Xigen, leader of the Self-Defense Team, and three others. They were escorted back to the county for detention. After repeated interrogations, they confessed to their crimes. Commander Tang of the Third Front Army issued a special commendation to County Magistrate Fan yesterday for capturing the bandit leaders.

Evidence of Treason Submitted to the High Court: Thirty-three traitors from this county were sent to the Suzhou High Court two months ago. The outcome has been of great concern to all sectors. Because the county government did not attach evidence of the crimes of each of the accused, the High Court sent a letter requesting the county government to submit them for investigation. The county government then issued a public notice to the public, urging them to report crimes automatically. It is now known that the crimes of the 33 traitors, including Qin Lianggong, were partly reported by the people and partly substantiated by the Traitorous Crimes Investigation Committee. Yesterday, the county government sent all the evidence of the accused to the High Court Prosecutor's Office for review.

### Education in Taiwan Province After Takeover: The Teacher Problem

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] Before the takeover of Taiwan Province, there was one university, Taipei Imperial University; five vocational schools; three normal schools; forty-five middle schools; twenty-seven industrial schools; ninety-two industrial supplementary schools; one thousand and ninety-nine national schools; and two schools for the blind and deaf. In terms of social education, there were ninety-four libraries, seven museums, sixty-eight shrines, twenty-three sports grounds, twenty-four swimming pools, one hundred and twenty-nine theaters, thirty theater troupes, and six industrial and commercial incentive halls.

Higher Education

In higher education, Taipei Imperial University has been largely taken over by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education and renamed National Taipei University. One public agricultural, industrial, and commercial vocational school has been taken over by the Provincial Department of Education and renamed Provincial Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Vocational School, and the principal has also been appointed. The original medical vocational school, which was attached to the university, has also been taken over by the Ministry of Education. The original private women's vocational school is currently suspended. In the future, provincial vocational schools will also admit female students, giving women the opportunity to receive higher education. During the Japanese rule, women had no opportunity to participate in Taiwanese higher education.

Secondary Education

In secondary education, the public middle schools in the Taipei city area have been directly taken over by the Department of Education. The public middle schools in the other states and halls are first taken over by the state and hall takeover committees. Taiwanese compatriots with better academic ability are temporarily selected from the education sector of each school or neighboring school to be appointed as acting principals and are responsible for the safekeeping of all equipment and property and continue to hold classes while waiting for personnel to be dispatched to take over. All public middle schools in the province have now been uniformly renamed provincial schools. In addition, there are six private middle schools and two private vocational schools that continue to operate.

National Education

In national education, the national schools in various regions have been taken over by the takeover committees of the various states and halls and reorganized. Principals are all Taiwanese, or Taiwanese are appointed as academic affairs directors to act as principals. In social education, the industrial supplementary schools in various regions have been taken over by the takeover committees of the various states and halls. The libraries, museums, and shrines in Taipei have been taken over by personnel dispatched by the Executive Governor's Office and the Department of Education. In the various states and halls, they have been taken over by personnel dispatched by the takeover committees of the various states and halls. Comparing the enrollment rates of Taiwanese and Japanese children in the former states and halls of Taiwan Province, the average number of Taiwanese male and female children was only 7,117, while the number of Japanese male and female children was nearly 9,962. The ratio of Japanese to the population of Taipei is one to ten, but the difference in the enrollment rate of children is even greater.

Teacher Problem

The current teacher shortage is a major problem. According to Zhao Nai, director of the Provincial Department of Education, personnel have been dispatched to Shanghai to recruit 300 teachers of Chinese and history and geography to serve in Taiwan. Starting next semester, Chinese language and history and geography education will occupy the most time in the curriculum. Other subjects will remain as they are for the time being. Textbooks have not yet been printed, which is also a pressing problem to be solved.

### Meeting of Private Elementary and Middle School Principals in This City Yesterday to Discuss Tuition Fee Standards for the Next Semester

[This City News] The Joint Association of Private Elementary and Middle Schools in this city held a meeting of private school principals at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss tuition fee standards for the next semester and to launch a campaign to protect school buildings.

Chairman Jiang Jizhou and recorder Tong Muge reported that the current semester is coming to an end and the tuition fee issue for the next semester urgently needs to be discussed to establish a reasonable standard for reference by the educational administrative authorities. Subsequently, Wei Yi and Jian Wu discussed the issue of protecting school buildings. Po Xiang said that most private schools are rented and landlords often use the expiration of the lease or the claim that they want to take back the property for their own use as an excuse to sue in court, forcing the schools to move. For the sake of education, he requested that the Legislative Yuan enact special regulations. Before the enactment of special laws and regulations, he requested the Housing Lease Committee of this city to supplement the lease regulations with provisions to protect school buildings to demonstrate the protection of education. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Elementary school tuition (including miscellaneous fees) should not exceed 12,000 yuan, and the amount of reduction or exemption should not be less than 15%. Junior high school tuition should not exceed 16,000 yuan, and the amount of reduction or exemption should not be less than 10%. Senior high school tuition should not exceed 20,000 yuan, and the amount of reduction or exemption should not be less than 10%. (2) Teachers' salaries, excluding housing rent, should not be less than 70% of net income. (3) Please request the City Education Bureau to discuss with relevant parties to open up the Racecourse and other public places and private vacant land for students to use for activities. (4) Negotiate with the Municipal Public Utility Bureau to establish preferential transportation arrangements for teachers and students. (5) Regarding the issue of protecting school buildings, Yu Chuanding, Mao Jiaju, and Xu Wenxiang were selected to represent all private schools to provide opinions to the Housing Lease Committee.

### On the Collection of the Haiyuan Pavilion

— Huang Heqing

Yesterday I read a Central News Agency dispatch from Tianjin in the newspapers, stating that the books from the Liyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng are now stored in Tianjin. President Song recently decided in Tianjin that the government should purchase them and hand them over to the Beiping Library for preservation. After investigation, there is only the Haiyuan Pavilion in Liaocheng, Shandong, and no Liyuan Pavilion. The Liyuan mentioned in the report must be a mistake for Haiyuan Pavilion. I am specially pointing out this correction and briefly introducing the Pavilion as follows:

The Haiyuan Pavilion was the pavilion of Yang Yizeng, who was one of the four great book collectors in the north and south during the Qing Dynasty. It had more than 460 old Song and Yuan editions and was known as "Nan Qu Bei Yang" with Qu's Iron Lute Bronze Sword Tower in Changshu. Although the collection of the Pavilion has been repeatedly damaged by war and lost a lot, the fine and famous publications are still moved around. It has long been coveted by Japan, who wanted to buy them at a high price and carry them away. At that time, the Shandong Provincial Government, upon learning of this news, ordered Wang Xiantang, the director of the Shandong Provincial Library, to negotiate the purchase by the government. However, the asking price was too high, and no agreement was reached. The Japanese purchase was also prevented by the government. However, a few precious books were still inevitably smuggled to Japan. The price of the books was astronomical at the time. According to what I know, Song editions were sold for 7,000 yuan, and Song editions of Liu Zongyuan's collection were sold for 10,000 yuan. Also, I heard a month ago that Yuan Tongli, the director of the National Beiping Library, was negotiating to buy the books from the Pavilion stored in Tianjin. The price of the books was estimated at 20 million yuan and has been approved by Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education. Now that the Central News Agency has sent a telegram stating that President Song has decided to buy them, the matter is bound to go ahead. It is gratifying that these extremely valuable books of our predecessors will be preserved by the state under a special responsibility and will not be lost again in the future.

### Chen Guolian States: French Ship Smuggling War Criminals Case Is By No Means A Local Incident; French Consul General and Ship Captain Should Be Held Criminally Liable

The "Baudin" Affair Must Not Be Considered A Local Incident; Our Side Is Currently Negotiating With The French Side In Chongqing, And The Ministry Of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged A Serious Protest With The French Embassy In China, Demanding That All The Conditions Put Forward By Our Side Be Immediately Fulfilled And That Similar Incidents Be Guaranteed Not To Happen Again.

Mr. Chen Guolian Severely Criticizes

Chen Guolian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, refuted Consul General Ferey's point that the case was a local incident when he met with reporters yesterday, saying: This case must not be regarded as a local incident, but as the first major event that occurred after our country recovered extraterritoriality. The French side's actions are, in terms of sovereignty, an act of infringing upon our sovereignty, and in terms of law, the French Consul General and the captain of the "Baudin" are both criminally responsible. Since after the recovery of extraterritoriality, within Chinese territory, only the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the Police Bureau, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the judicial organs can arrest people; no one else has the right to arrest criminals. Therefore, the French side's arrest of criminals in Shanghai has violated the criminal code. The French side attempts to take advantage of the Shanghai people's decades-old traditional views and misperceptions of foreigners to create a fait accompli. Although this action does not affect the lives of the people, the impact on our national status is not insignificant, and the loss of sovereignty begins with this. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will never regard this case as an ordinary local incident. To give an example, what would be the seriousness of the situation if a foreign warship were to take away senior personnel of our country's puppet organizations who were seeking refuge in that country's consulate in the future? In short, the citizens of our country after the victory should cultivate a new spirit, and foreign envoys should also have a new understanding of our country. In order to maintain the integrity of sovereignty and the dignity of the law, our country will have to take resolute and appropriate steps.

French Consul's Claims Are Totally Unfounded

The reporter further learned that the French Consul General claimed that he had not received a notice from the French Ambassador to China regarding the closure of the consular court, and that the French Consul General still held consular jurisdiction before the Sino-French New Treaty came into effect. According to the decree publicly announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this cannot be established at all. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already informed the French Provisional Chargé d'Affaires in China, Peng Gu Er Zheng Che Sheng, on May 19, 1943, stating that "All concessions obtained by France in accordance with unequal treaties between China and France, the Peking Legation Quarter, the Shanghai International Settlement, and the Xiamen International Settlement, administrative power, consular jurisdiction, and other privileges, have been eliminated due to France's illegal actions (Note: At that time, the French side illegally violated international law by signing an agreement with the puppet organization to return the concessions), and the Chinese government is no longer bound by them." Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' announcement on December 3, 1945, "The French Embassy has now agreed to immediately close its consular courts in China." On the 14th of the same month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced again, "It has been found that the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by all countries in China have been abolished. Our courts should not recognize any country still exercising extraterritorial rights in our territory." Based on this, the French Consul General's claims cannot be a reason for his illegal arrest of criminals.

Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Repeatedly Stated

In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that we have the right to arrest and try any foreign personnel who collude with the enemy and endanger China and the Allied countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on October 24, 1945: "Regarding the handling of foreign enemy-supporting elements in China, our military authorities have decided to arrest them and hand them over to the courts for trial. However, if the criminals have also committed crimes in the Allied-controlled areas and their cases are more serious, they will be handed over to the Allied forces for punishment." On December 22 of the same year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also ordered the Shanghai Office, stating: "In cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping, and other recovered areas, foreign personnel who have colluded with the enemy and endangered China and the Allied countries during the Japanese occupation period, we have the right to arrest and try them in accordance with the Sino-Foreign New Treaty. In addition to the Military Affairs Commission issuing orders to the Army Headquarters and the commanders of various war zones, the Ministry of Judicial Administration will also issue orders to courts at all levels to comply. It is hereby ordered to comply, and cooperate with local courts and relevant agencies." According to the above-mentioned publicly announced decree, the French Consul General's unauthorized arrest of people in this city, infringing on our sovereignty, cannot be easily dismissed.

### Enemy Spy Nakatani Has Been Arrested

[Report from this newspaper] Nakatani, an enemy spy from the Shanghai Military Police, used to cruelly abuse American detainees and our underground workers during his time working at the enemy Military Police Headquarters on North Sichuan Road. After the victory, Nakatani, because he could speak fluent Chinese, still disguised himself as a Chinese citizen and lived in various parts of this city. The U.S. War Crimes Investigation Office had been investigating in many ways and recently discovered Nakatani mixed in with the Japanese concentration camp in West Shanghai. He was arrested and has now been escorted to Tilanqiao Prison, and will soon be submitted for trial as a war criminal.

### Western-Style Used Clothes For Relief Are Prohibited From Being Sold Or Exchanged; Mr. Liu Hongsheng Gave A Speech Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, answered questions from this newspaper's reporter yesterday, explaining the various rumors circulating recently. The details are recorded as follows:

Penicillin Cannot Be Sold Widely

Reporter asked: (1) A large number of Western-style used clothes distributed by the Administration to various charitable organizations are not suitable for refugees to wear and are not warm enough. It is said that the entire batch will be sold and Chinese-style cotton clothes will be purchased instead. Has the Administration heard of this? Answer: This batch of used clothes was donated by the people of the Allied countries for relief purposes and must not be sold in any way to prevent malpractice. Although Western suits may not be as warm, they are better than having no clothes at all. Therefore, until further orders are received from the headquarters, all sales or exchanges for other items are prohibited. This is the current position of the Administration. (2) Asked: Recently, penicillin has been rampant on the black market, while hospitals and pharmacies are extremely short of this drug. What are the remedies? Answer: The penicillin on the market at present is definitely not owned by the Administration, because not much of this drug has been transported here. Therefore, it cannot be distributed to various health agencies on a large scale. It can only be considered for distribution when certain diseases require it as a special medicine. If it is widely used for any minor illness, it is feared that the current stock will be exhausted in a few days. For overall planning, it is necessary to be cautious. Therefore, hospitals and pharmacies may not be able to widely put it on the market in the short term.

Organize Inspection Team To Provide Opinions

In addition, the Administration has specially dispatched inspectors He Fangli, technician Xie Zhangzhe, commissioner Lin Shigan, and four others to form an inspection team. They departed yesterday morning to inspect various charitable organizations, groups, and hospitals, and will put forward inspection opinions for improvement in the future.

### Tan Yulin Succeeds As Chief of Staff of the Garrison Department

### Qian Dajun Encourages Subordinates To Develop A Clean And Honest Atmosphere

Mayor Qian Dajun gave a speech to all the staff at the memorial week held by the municipal government yesterday morning, encouraging them with three things: Colleagues must absolutely eliminate corrupt behavior and cultivate a good atmosphere of clean and honest politics. Any unit should be closely supervised by the head officer and followed in unison. If any employee is found to have illegal behavior, once verified, they will be dealt with severely, and the head officer will be held jointly responsible. Secondly, regarding the issues of cleanliness and neatness, we should start with ourselves, invigorate our spirits, cultivate vitality, strictly observe time, handle official affairs, and strive for speed so that work efficiency can be improved.

### Guangdong Sojourners in Shanghai Rescue Yang Wendao

[Report from this newspaper] Yang Wendao, who was wrongly imprisoned for ten years in the Nakayama Hideo case, has aroused sympathy from all walks of life since his son Hanzhi appealed for help. It is learned that the directors of the Guangdong Sojourners Association in Shanghai, Lao Jingshiu, Guo Lingshuang, and Xi Guansheng, etc., together with Feng Shaoshan and other responsible persons of the Guangzhao Public Hall, will convene a joint meeting in the coming days to discuss rescue measures. Tang Huai, the lawyer who defended Yang Wendao that year, told reporters that he had submitted a petition to the Supreme Court in Chongqing, urging for a trial. Ge Zhaoji, another lawyer who defended Yang, has now been reassigned as a commissioner of the Seafarers' Party Department, responsible for hosting the newly established Sea Responsibility Radio Station, and has been broadcasting appeals for Yang for days. Listeners have sent letters and telegrams one after another, expressing great concern, especially the Guangdong sojourners.

### Unblocking City Traffic and Expanding North-South Trunk Lines

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Public Works pays special attention to expanding the north-south traffic trunk lines for road construction. Before the war, the Shanghai International Settlement, the French Concession, and the city center each had their own traffic systems. For example, the International Settlement tried its best to develop westward, extending to roads built beyond the boundary, resulting in deformed development. Now, the Bureau of Public Works has started the project of widening Zhejiang Road, Jielu, and North Xizang Road, and the Henan Road project is also being planned. In the future, it is planned to integrate the city center, Zhabei, Huangpu District, and the entire Nanshi area, so that traffic in this city can be accessible in all directions.

In addition, the above-mentioned repaired road surfaces have been completed for more than 80,000 square meters, accounting for one-quarter of those that should be repaired.

### Enemy Warehouses and Weapons Are Inventoried by the Military Administration Department

The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau convened a meeting of responsible persons from the Customs, the Military Administration Department, and the Naval Office yesterday morning to hand over the army and navy equipment and weapons inventoried in various warehouses to the Military Administration Department and the Naval Office respectively.

In addition, the enemy warehouse previously received by the Naval Headquarters began to be transferred to the Customs for inventory on November 9 last year.

Chule has been detained by the naval authorities today. Witnesses stated the details of the accident as follows: The military truck driven by the driver hit several tricycles and a tram in succession when approaching Chuqing Road on Nanjing Road. Several people on the tram and on the road were also hit, one of whom was Chen Huizhen. The police authorities stated that the truck driven by the driver did not obtain permission and appeared to be caused by drunkenness. According to the information, the situation of the truck accident this time is quite similar to the accident on Albert Road a month ago.

### The Entire Shanghai-Nanjing Highway Will Be Open To Traffic Within Days

The Shanghai-Nanjing Highway, from Shanghai via Su, Xi, to Wujin section and from Zhen via Jurong to Nan, Jing section have been repaired and are unimpeded. The section from Wujin via Jintan Danyang to Zhenjiang can also be repaired and open to traffic before January 10.

### Salary Income Tax Stipulates The Standard For Assessment

How should the income tax of salaried classes be calculated? This question has long been valued by general employees. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau had previously announced that the basic salary would be the standard, and all living allowances, temporary allowances, and rice loans increased due to wartime price fluctuations would not be included. However, since not all employees in this city have basic salary regulations, and the general salaried class does not have a division of salary and allowance for the monthly income, it is not easy to understand how the income should be calculated. According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau, how should the salary and allowance of employees in various industries without basic salary regulations be divided? It should naturally be stipulated and standardized. In order to be reasonable and fair, the bureau is now referring to the regulations for the amount of salary and allowance for civil servants, that is, subtracting the amount of rice loans and living allowances for local civil servants from the total amount of monthly salary and allowances, and then dividing by the multiple of local civil servants' salary to obtain the taxable income, and then calculating and assessing according to the tax rate table based on this number, and intends to formulate a formula for calculation.

### The High Court's Criminal Division Tried Two Traitors Yesterday; The Traitor Zhou Yi Was Sentenced To Life Imprisonment

Ding Guanping, a Hangzhou native, 40 years old, graduated from Fudan and Soochow Law Schools. He served as the director of the North Jiangsu Office of the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee and the director of the Puppet Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center. The case of being sued as a traitor was reviewed yesterday morning by Liu Yugui, President of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai High Court, Judges Cao Jun and Zhu Zonghai, and Prosecutor Lin Woming in the joint trial held in the Tilanqiao Temporary Criminal Court.

Serving In Puppet Posts To Procure Grain

First, Prosecutor Lin Chen stated the main points of the indictment, stating that the defendant served as the director of the North Jiangsu Office of the Puppet Food Administration Committee in August 1942, and as the director of the Puppet Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center in February 1945, purchasing grain for the enemy and the puppet regime, violating Articles 2, Paragraph 1, and Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and should be tried by the court in accordance with the law. Then, the traitor Ding confessed: "I held the post of director of the North Jiangsu Office of the Puppet Food Administration Committee for a total of eight months. I resigned when the committee was abolished and reorganized into the 'Food Department' in March 1943. The North Jiangsu District governs Yangzhou, Baoying, Taizhou, Gaoyou, and Xinghua counties. I also served as the procurement director in Yangzhou. Since Yangzhou's rice production was not enough for its own consumption, I requested to be exempted from procurement, and the procurement work in the other four counties was handled by special commissioners appointed by the Food Administration Committee. I only supervised, so I did not actually bear the responsibility of procurement. As for the grain procured in the North Jiangsu region, it was all used for the distribution of civil food in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, which can be proven by retrieving the archives of the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee and the Former Puppet Shanghai Food Bureau. If it is found that there was supply to the enemy, then please punish me with extreme punishment. So-called traitorous officials and rebellious sons, everyone has the right to punish them, even if I die, I will not be wronged. During my tenure as the director of the Puppet Shanghai Detention Center, I held the "post" to improve sanitation and unblock prisoners. Please investigate the facts in detail to clarify the facts." The court held a deliberation on the defendant's request to inspect the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee and the Shanghai Detention Center archives, and ruled that the inspection of the Puppet Nanjing Food Administration Committee was not necessary because the defendant's confession was detailed. The request to inspect the archives of the Puppet Shanghai Food Bureau and the Detention Center should be approved. The defendant's lawyer was asked to prepare a summary report to the court for investigation point by point. After briefly questioning the defendant, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned because the case still required investigation and evidence, and the defendant was returned to custody.

Extortion, Fraud, and Molesting Women

The High Court also tried Xu Xing, a traitor who molested women, extorted, and defrauded. The defendant is 20 years old, from Suzhou, and served as a pseudo-examiner in Xinzhuang. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for oppressing and extorting people by relying on the power of the enemy and the puppet regime. Xu Jianchang cried loudly and denied this. Then, the victim Yang Songtao was called to testify, stating: "I was transporting rice by bicycle through Xinzhuang. Xu Xing, who was wearing a uniform, came to check at the 'Inspection Office' and demanded 5,000 yuan. Because I have a small business with thin profits, I pleaded bitterly. Xu Ni not only refused but also slapped me twice and threatened to confiscate the goods as a threat. I had no choice but to pay him 5,000 yuan." He also said: "More than 200 people in Xinzhuang hate Xu Ni. If what I said is not true, I am willing to be punished instead." The next witness, Chen Jingchang, stated: "I have personally seen Xu Ni molest women," etc. At this point, Xu Da burst into tears again, still refusing to tell the truth. Later, the appointed lawyer, Fei Xizhen, responded, saying: "The defendant served as an extra inspector in the office and cannot be included in the traitor regulations. Please transfer the case to the local court for handling." The court announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2 pm on the 14th of this month.

Sentenced To Life Imprisonment For Recruiting Laborers For The Enemy

Zhou Yiwei, who recruited laborers to serve as translators for the enemy, was sentenced yesterday afternoon. The main text of the verdict is copied as follows: Zhou Yiwei conspired with the enemy country, recruiting military laborers and craftsmen, and was sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of political rights for life, and all property confiscated.

### The City's Financial Difficulties Are Under Discussion With the Resources Committee For Assistance

Shen, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, said that although the city's tax revenue has increased somewhat under the reorganization of the Finance Bureau, 12 of the 17 types of taxes originally collected by the local government have been ordered to be assigned to the central government. At the beginning of the reconstruction work, there are many things to be done and expenses are huge. The current tax revenue is difficult to offset. However, the construction work of this city needs to be promoted urgently, and it is impossible to give up because of financial difficulties. In addition to trying to save administrative expenses, it is also under discussion with the Resources Committee for assistance, and concrete solutions will be obtained soon. Regarding the method of consolidating the municipal bonds issued before the war, Shen said that it is under thorough study by the Finance Bureau.

### Bandits Extorted A Large Sum of Money And Were Shot Dead By Police Officers

[Report from this newspaper] Yongshengtaili Customs Brokerage, opened by Hu Jinqing, a native of Suzhou, at No. 10, Lane 183, Jinling Road, Lower Box Room, was suddenly attacked by a bandit at about 7:15 last night.

### Li Ze Detained and Sent to Court for Investigation on Charges of Colluding with the Enemy, Xinxin Company Employees Hosted the Press Yesterday

[Our Report] Li Ze, General Manager of Xinxin Company, after being reported by the company's employees for his treacherous behavior, was arrested by the police yesterday afternoon at the company. It is now reported that he has been sent to the Procuratorate of the Higher Court for legal processing.

The case in which Li Ze was accused of being a traitor by Xinxin Company employees such as Shu Yueqiao was summoned by the Municipal Police Bureau some days ago, but Li Ze did not appear. The accuser, Shu Yueqiao, appeared in court and stated that Li Ze had served as a director of the puppet "Commercial Control Association," a member of the puppet "Sixteen Kinds of Commodity Evaluation Committee," and a member of the puppet "Enemy Property Committee," and that he had sold all the water pipes in the company to the Japanese military, etc. Four other employees of the company, including Yao Zhuoren, testified with similar statements. The bureau, because Li Ze resisted the summons, arrested him at 2:00 PM yesterday.

Trial of Treason According to Law

After interrogation, Li Ze confessed to having served as a director of the puppet "Commercial Control Association" and other organizations, and that the water pipes were sold to a certain iron factory, etc. The police bureau has confirmed that Li Ze's actions constitute treason. The bureau sent the suspect Li to the Shanghai Higher Court at 5:00 PM in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. More than 300 employees of the company have jointly submitted a petition to the Garrison Headquarters, reporting Li Ze for colluding with the enemy. The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters has accepted the case and is now conducting a rigorous investigation into Li Ze's collusion with the enemy and is determined to handle the case with a solemn attitude.

Employees Report Li Ze's Treachery

The employees of Xinxin Company hosted the local press yesterday at 2:00 PM at the company's staff club. Han Wucheng, the employee representative, first reported the process of reporting Li Ze's treacherous behavior to all relevant parties. However, more than three months have passed since the presentation of the report, and the handling methods are still like a stone sinking into the sea. Recently, it was heard that Li Ze was about to depart for the United States to evade the law, so they specially requested the press for two points: First, how to report Li Ze according to the law as soon as possible. Second, how to urge the relevant authorities, who have not yet taken any measures to show attention, so as not to let the big traitor escape the law. Finally, he listed the newspapers that published Li Ze's assumption of puppet positions and crimes, and their publication dates as proof. Then, the representative Shu Yueqiao reported his experience of reporting the treachery, which had been repeatedly frustrated. According to him, strange guests were found in his home from time to time after reporting Li Ze, threatening and intimidating him, but his original intention of reporting the traitor remained unshaken. Finally, each representative reported separately that Li Ze had gradually transferred and dispersed his important private property since August 10 of last year, and recently sold a large number of hoarded goods, such as flannel, money cloth, and so on. A large number of stocks under Li's name have also been transferred.

Military and Police Authorities Devise Methods for Investigation

After the meeting, reporters visited the Laozha Branch of the Police Bureau and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and other authorities separately. The Laozha Branch believed that this matter should be handled according to law, and it was not convenient to take any measures or express opinions before the investigation was completed. They believed that the posters posted by the employees of Xinxin Company attracted pedestrians to stop and watch, obstructing traffic, so they were banned. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters authorities revealed that Li Ze was indeed arrested yesterday afternoon.

The reporter then visited the management of Xinxin Company afterwards. According to them, Li Ze had applied for leave from the company's board of directors, and the board of directors had approved a month's leave. When asked about Li Ze's arrest, they said they did not know the details. They then stated that the employees of the company's report on Li Ze this time did not conflict with the company's business, so the company continued to operate as usual.

Announcement Published with Such Explanation

The board of directors of Xinxin Company published an announcement in various newspapers today, defending Li Ze, the general idea being: (1) The company hired Japanese advisors to cope with enemy and puppet oppression and personal safety, with no other purpose. (2) The iron offering was actually the Japanese requisition of water pipes, so the water pipes were sold to the Mori Iron Factory. (3) Regarding the dispatch of personnel to the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the celebration, it was the puppet Ministry of Industry who sent personnel to the company to select domestic products, which were said to be transported to the puppet Manchukuo Exposition. This matter had nothing to do with Li Ze, etc.

Commercial News

### US Dollar Form Steady, Gold Prices Suddenly Rise, Government Bonds and Stocks Rebound

Yesterday, news of rising gold prices in Tianjin and Guanwai, as reported by yesterday's newspaper, attracted scattered buyers, and the price immediately rose to 8.15 million. Since then, people have seen that there is an opportunity to take advantage of in the gold market, and demand exceeded supply. It gradually rose from 8.13 million to over 8.35 million. At this time, large securities firms reused their old tricks, selling gold and pulling stocks. At noon, it hovered around 8.3 million. In the afternoon, speculative funds from the stock market returned one after another, and finally stepped up to over 8.5 million. As a result, it rose sharply by 53,000 compared to last Saturday. Jewelers hung up 90,000 for gold jewelry, 600 yuan for refined silver, and silver allowances still hovered around 430. There was a lot of demand from underground securities firms, and interest rates remained stable at around 10%. Speculative funds from the stock market have been returning for days, and it is even more obvious today. The future should tend to rise.

The US dollar still has no special changes. It is said that the gold market is advancing and retreating together, and the arbitrageurs are entering and exiting at a difference of 585 yuan to ten taels, gradually improving from 1425 yuan to 1460 yuan. As a result, it was 50 yuan better than last Saturday. Hong Kong bills are still extremely mediocre, so that both new and old goods are similar to last week. Government bonds fell back after rising. Many bulls in the industry closed out at high prices, and Class C gradually fell from 965 yuan. Although there was no shortage of retail support in the middle, the general trend was gone, and the hype was weak, so it broke the 900 yuan mark and ended with a mediocre situation. As a result, hot stocks fell and miscellaneous stocks rose compared to last Saturday. This is a matter of time, and they have not caught up.

Chinese stocks were the securities firms reusing their old tricks, first drawing the firewood from under the pot and then using the golden cicada to shed its shell. The market situation was initially lively and then tired. It was once again pulled up in the middle. By 11:45, the large firms turned their heads and were unwilling, and retail investors rushed to kill, but it was too late, and the situation was extremely miserable. Yongsheng Yarn was pulled up twice to a new high of 1060 yuan, and ended with the lowest price of 980 yuan. Mei Ya also repeatedly saw a high price of 830 yuan, but no one wanted it at the lowest price of 720 yuan. The three small hot stocks, such as Xin Guang, also fell by more than 10% from the higher prices at the close. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsheng Yarn was flat, Mei Ya fell by 15 yuan, and the three small hot stocks fell slightly by 50 cents to 1 yuan. However, due to the time factor, various unpopular stocks still showed a brilliant scene.

There were many foreign stock requests for supply, with three twists and turns. Generally, they advanced and retreated with Chinese stocks, initially firm and then tired, and then pulled up again near noon. However, each stock has been rising for a long time and has reached saturation. Many parties have profited, and there are many who see the opportunity to close out. The chips have changed from tight to loose, and there are cracks in the potential. As a result, the popular stocks had mixed fortunes compared to last Saturday. Rubber stocks were relatively deserted, and although the closing price was higher, it was the supplier's asking price.

### Yarn Market Rising Wind Not Yet Over

Yesterday, the yarn market became more and more outstanding. At the beginning of the morning market, there was a general rush. The sales of customer gangs were not as enthusiastic as last week, but the retail investors were thinking high and buying incessantly. At the same time, it was rumored that a certain number in the Securities Building would start operating small-amount transactions in cotton yarn, using the 20-count red Ren Zhongzhan bill of the Shenxin No. 1 Factory as a chip, which was quite favored by speculators, and the price was between 770,000 and 780,000. The current yarn market is even more invigorated because of this. The price of 20-count ordinary yarn rose by about 50,000. Special Double Horse has jumped a lot in recent days, and the Guangbang buyers are slightly inferior, only rising by 20,000 to 30,000, with a transaction price of 870,000 to 880,000. Fine yarn and double thread, weaving factories and sock factories still come to drag in. In the case of a strange shortage of spot goods, it has risen by another 100,000.

### Rice Market Transactions Stagnant

There are more than 100 ships storing rice in the Zhabei He Xia area, and more than 100 ships are also stored in the Nanshi He Xia area. The market is stagnant, and japonica rice, indica rice, and early rice are still scarce and lack transactions. Because the production area of ​​indica rice is high, forming a reversal, very few cars arrive. The market situation is still stable, and Baiyuan is similar. The Nanyang route of flour continues, and the market situation is firm. The arrival of soybeans is scarce, and the Minbang Xinghua Quanzhou continues to operate, and the trend is stable. The oil market is operated by the Zhejiang Fangning side, and the price continues to rise by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts and sesame seeds are firmly established, soybean cake slightly rises by dozens of yuan, Shantou slightly takes, vegetable cake is established, and wine prices are stable.

### Silk and Satin Unanimously Upward

Yesterday's silk and satin market was unanimously lively. At the opening of the morning market, 120 Tiqiao, 770,000 yuan for rayon, because each silk factory had a strong appetite, the transaction between the same industry was not lonely, and there was a lack of spot goods. Furthermore, because it was rumored that the enemy and puppet warehouses would be opened indefinitely, the market atmosphere was strong, and people's hearts were prosperous. The selling price rose step by step, and the closing price of 120 Tiqiao was as high as 850,000 yuan, and semi-gloss was 830,000 yuan. However, after hearing that the Chinese merchants' warehouses were about to open, the silk factories needed it, or the energy source was continuously supplied, I am afraid that it will cause a high face of no rice for cooking. The sales of factory silk were not bad and the price also soared. High uniformity was 1.3 million yuan per load, medium grade was 1.1 million yuan per load, and ordinary grade was 900,000 yuan. The silk market slightly increased the selling price due to expensive raw materials and rising costs. Mei Ya was covered with 550,000 yuan per 100 pieces, Dazheng Geli Bixuan was 1,600 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade was 8,500 yuan per piece.

### Coal Ball Retail Sales Are Surprisingly Smooth, Coal Market Trend is Gradually Stable

Coal, firewood, and charcoal are not lonely in actual consumption, and the source is constant, and the market is still stable. Coal balls are an essential fuel for general household users. In the past, the main raw material, white coal dust, was not smooth in source. A few coal ball manufacturers mixed it with coal slag as a substitute, resulting in poor quality, weak firepower, and loss of reputation. Now that the source of raw materials is promising and the supply of electric power is smooth, coal ball manufacturers have improved the quality to facilitate business. In addition, it is the winter season, and coal balls can be used for heating in addition to being a regular fuel for general households, so consumption has increased sharply, and actual sales are surprisingly smooth. At present, the manufacturing cost of ordinary guaranteed burning coal balls containing 50% coal dust is about 45,000 yuan per ton (35,000 yuan for direct raw materials, 3,000 yuan for direct labor, and 7,000 yuan for manufacturing expenses). The retail price of coal shops is 3,000 yuan per load, and the secondary grades range from 1,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan.

### Asphalt Demand Exceeds Supply

Asphalt is in high demand for candle making, and dealers are not supplying much. The source is becoming increasingly scarce, so dealers and candle workshops are purchasing from various producing areas. It is said that dealers purchased hundreds of pieces from Jiaxing at a cost of 18,000 yuan, and candle workshops purchased dozens of pieces at a cost of 18,500 yuan, both for delivery. They also purchased 15,500 yuan to 16,000 yuan of Lan oil from Hangzhou, and 12,500 yuan to 13,000 yuan from Lanxi, all for delivery on the spot, with a total of hundreds of pieces, which can be loaded in a few days. The price of Heshi oil sold by dealers is 22,000 yuan, the price of Lan oil tip goods is 18,000 yuan, and the price of second-grade is 16,000 yuan. Demand exceeds supply, and the trend is still bullish.

### After the Reopening of the Tobacco Exchange Market, the Transaction Methods are Stipulated

After the reopening of the tobacco exchange market, the market transactions are stipulated as follows: If a transaction is concluded in the morning, the payment must be paid and the goods must be delivered before 6:00 PM on the same afternoon. If the transaction is concluded in the afternoon, it must be cleared before 12:00 AM the next morning. If either party delays or breaches the contract, they must compensate the other party for the loss. When the goods rise in price, the market price on the same day must be followed. When the price falls, in addition to the loss, interest must also be paid.

### Customer Gang's Actual Sales are Activated, Paper Prices are Gradually Rising, Especially White Newsprint

After the opening of the foreign paper, it is gradually rising, because the scheduled arrival of goods is indefinite, and the customer gangs have activated actual sales, canceling the wait-and-see attitude, and advancing fiercely. Moreover, the bottom is shallow, and demand exceeds supply. Today, the paper price is even more firm due to the rising gold price and the accompanying rise in the US dollar. Among them, white newsprint is the most, because the demand is the most.

### Economic Briefing

Eastern Zhejiang native products are coming in continuously. The Ping An Bureau Dahua Wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before (Sunday), transporting 3,000 bags of sugar and more than 2,000 pieces of wood from Wenzhou. The wheel will leave for Fuzhou tomorrow morning, transporting 2,000 bags of Fujian flour from Shanghai. There are still a large number of Jianzi transported back to Shanghai.

The Municipal Mechanized Coal Ball Industry Association gathered funds from all colleagues to purchase a large amount of white coal dust from the coal-producing areas along the Yangtze River. Now, because the coal loading ship Yuanli Wheel is still stranded in Yangzhou, the purchasing delegation has to postpone its departure.

The five-year plan for post-war cooperation will be implemented starting in January. It is reported that it is planned to establish 189,019 cooperative units in the next five years, not including the 360,943 units already established nationwide.

The reserves of the pseudo-Manchukuo banknotes issued by the pseudo-Central Bank in the 34th year of pseudo-Manchukuo accounted for about 60%. In view of this fact, the government authorities decided that the exchange rate of the Northeast circulation coupons would be equivalent to that of the Manchukuo pseudo-money, that is, one yuan of circulation equals one yuan of pseudo-money.

The national land tax will be levied starting this year, and it is reported to include the following three items: (1) Field tax, (2) Deed tax, (3) Land boundary tax. The land tax portion of the annual budget for the 35th year is about 90 billion yuan.

The exchange rate of legal tender in Keelung is approximately 25 to 30 yuan. The office set up by the Central Bank in Taiwan is actively planning to collect and exchange it. The price of gold in the area is approximately 3,400 Taiwan dollars per tael.

The administrative expenses budget of the Ministry of Finance for this year is approximately 53.3 billion yuan, of which approximately 5.5 billion yuan is for recurring expenses, more than 300 million yuan is for business expenses, 44 billion yuan is for living allowances, and 3.1 billion yuan is for temporary expenses.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the Beizhi Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., which was taken over by our side in Beiping, is said to have a capital of 300 million. It has been completely taken over a few days ago. The mine plans to produce 1,200 tons of iron per day. Before Japan surrendered, it was able to produce 500 tons of iron per day, double the 250 tons per day in the Longyan mine era.

### Commercial Situation Summary

Green sugar has always been concentrated in Hangzhou. Today, the Hangzhou market has risen, affecting the sugar price in the city, which is 5,000 yuan higher than the previous market. The price of four or five white markets is also tight.

The price of raw peanuts in the North-South goods market has been repeatedly increased. The sales price of persimmon cakes and red dates has been continuously increased. Black dates are scarce, and the price has also been greatly increased. Golden vegetables, black fungus, and bamboo shoots are all favored by customers, and the price is very tight.

Seafood dealers saw that the gold market was rising, followed up, and the price of each commodity rose as soon as the market opened, about 20% to 30% higher than the market.

The customer gang pursued dyed cotton cloth extremely eagerly. The dyeing and weaving factories waited to supply and sell as much as possible. Unfortunately, the white base was still tight. The market situation was advancing in the high peak. Lily dried was in short supply this year due to very little production. Now, the Guangdong going out is gradually moving, and the market situation is very tight. The current dry and white goods in the market are sold for 30,000 yuan, and the ordinary goods are 25,000 yuan. It is said that the bottom of the producing area is very scarce.

The tea shops and Tianjin gang's buying interest in tea leaves are not lonely. A total of more than 450 tea groups, including coarse Mao black tea, medium-grade Hubei black, and Anhui baked green tea, were transacted in the city, and the market was bullish.

Yesterday's knitted goods market can be said to have risen without exception, especially 32-count socks and towels. The reason for this is the influence of both the gold and yarn prices.

Yesterday's cigarette market was lively due to the opening of the market and the prosperity of the gold market. Although there was rationing, the bullish trend was not suppressed. The market situation was steadily rising throughout the day.

Tung oil transactions are rare, because the current sales have reached the end, so buyers are not willing to pay. The market is also in a stagnant state. The price of 1517-degree white oil is 26,000 yuan per load, and the price of Hongjiang oil is about 20,000 yuan per barrel.

### Assorted Pennants

— Chen Fengxiong

Jinzhou's climate is slightly milder than Beiping's, but with a gust of wind, the temperature drops suddenly. Recently, it has been as cold as twenty degrees below zero. Many Guangdong soldiers in the National Army have already experienced the biting cold. At the mention of having to go to even colder Shenyang, even while sitting around the stove, they can't help but shrink their necks and shiver.

Within Jinzhou city, there are still many strangely worded slogans that have not been cleaned off. For example, above the entrance of the Da Xing Company established by the Japanese (now the receiving office of the Transportation Department's Shenyang District and a radio station) is a banner painted with the words "Without the ×× Party, there would be no China," each character two feet square. Despite repeated scrubbing, it is still clearly visible.

Many sections of the asphalt roads have been dug up as trenches, which the Japanese were forced to dig before the National Army entered the city in preparation for resistance. Now, the Japanese are busy filling in those trenches that affect traffic. According to locals, these trenches were never used.

It is said that when the National Army entered the city, the pseudo-Jinzhou Railway Bureau (now the Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief Headquarters) had already poured kerosene in the building, but the National Army entered the city before they could set it on fire. Only the telephone bureau in Jinzhou was bombed, with more than half of the three-story steel-reinforced concrete building destroyed. Workers are now busy repairing it. In addition, the most tragic was the pseudo-Jinzhou Provincial Government Office, which burned for three days and three nights, leaving not a single tile intact. Locals say, "There were so many good things inside, everything you could want was there, all burned!"

The Xiaoling River, west of Jinzhou city, is now dry. The three bridges over the river have all been blown up. Two of them are iron bridges, railway bridges, and one is a cement bridge, a highway bridge, all four to five hundred meters long. The iron bridges have now been repaired and are about to be converted to standard gauge for traffic. A section of the highway bridge was blown up, and it is said that it took six attempts to destroy it. On December 16th, it was heard that Chairman Chiang was going to inspect Jinzhou from Beiping, and the highway bridge over the Xiaoling River was the only way to enter the city from the airfield. The Commander-in-Chief Headquarters temporarily gathered four hundred Japanese people to work through the night by gaslight, building a simple road for cars on the riverbed and between the banks. Unfortunately, Chairman Chiang was too busy with official duties to fly to Jinzhou, and the people couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.

Jinzhou's specialties are shrimp paste and apples. A large bottle of shrimp paste only sells for ten yuan, cheaper than water in Chongqing. The apples are fragrant, crisp, and delicious, with an excellent taste, costing thirty yuan per catty. After Governor Du heard that Chairman Chiang was going to inspect Jinzhou, he specially ordered people to buy three large baskets of apples (about a hundred catties per basket) to present to the Chairman to take back to Chongqing. It is unknown whether those apples are now fortunate enough to be lying in the fruit bowl of the Lin Garden official residence.

Jinzhou's prices cannot be compared to Chongqing's because there is no standard. The legal tender stamped by Governor Du is used at the same value as the puppet Manchurian currency, but because the denominations are too large (at least five hundred yuan), merchants cannot make change, so the market has been inactive. For example, buying an egg costs four yuan and fifty cents, and when a National Army soldier pulls out a thousand yuan note, it is difficult for small merchants to return nine hundred and several tens of yuan. Of course, the National Army has no other bills, so merchants have to say, "Comrade, pay us when you have change, a few yuan doesn't matter, we really can't make change!" Soldiers also say, "Shopkeeper, you have to recognize my mark, I'm not cheating you!" Everyone is amicable: the merchants, seeing the light of day again, cannot hide their heartfelt joy and often generously treat the soldiers for free. Some merchants, fearing that customers will buy their goods with large bills, only bring a small amount of goods to the market to sell, because even if you bought all of their goods, it would only cost dozens of yuan, requiring small bills. After they sell out, they go back and bring out a little more. Some people simply close their doors and do no business, or hide their goods, and if you ask to buy anything, they have nothing. When I first arrived in Jinzhou, I borrowed several thousand yuan to go out for dinner, but I couldn't find a formal restaurant in Jinzhou. Finally, I walked into a small shop that only sold sorghum rice and tofu soup, and the shop assistant immediately said, "Sir, you need to use small bills to eat here!" I had no choice but to go back to the hotel hungry.

Governor Du ordered an absolute ban on merchants entering and leaving Shanhaiguan to purchase goods. Several Tianjin merchants brought some goods and secretly sold them in Jinzhou, and then bought a lot of cotton thread (over a thousand yuan per bundle, which could be sold for twenty thousand yuan in Tianjin). They were stopped at the train station and had to sell the cotton thread cheaply again. They stayed in a small shop for a few days and took some pseudo-Manchurian currency back to Tianjin, which was worthless inside the pass.

Legal tender below fifty yuan, even if not stamped by Governor Du, can also be used. I had four ten-yuan bills in my pocket, which I never had a chance to use in Chongqing, but I ran to Jinzhou and got a haircut and bought a catty of apples. Japanese merchants also welcome small legal tender bills. At least the legal tender is printed much more elaborately than the pseudo-currency.

Now, the Jinzhou Central Bank has opened, and banknotes are already being issued. It is said that the market is much more active than it was a few days ago. The old city's South Gate is Jinzhou's entertainment district, with theaters, cinemas, and brothels. The Japanese brothels that recently opened are all in the new city, and business is not bad. Sometimes, one or two gaudily dressed Japanese prostitutes are seen riding past on tricycles, making one feel as if one had found a rose in a desolate mountain.

Outside the East Gate is the marketplace, where hundreds of vendors are selling odds and ends and old items on the ground, and the food stalls only offer sesame cakes, barley porridge, and Guandong candy. When these vendors hear the accents of people from other provinces asking about prices, they ask for the sky. Because they know that these are all wealthy people with large bills on them.

### The Joke of Driving on the Right

— Mao Shukei

Today is the eighth day of implementing right-hand driving for vehicles. Citizens have gradually become accustomed to it, moving from novelty to habit. Pedicabs and tricycles naturally keep to the right. Cars, aware of being the root cause of trouble, drive with caution, and their speed has clearly slowed down. Only the Allied jeeps continue to speed back and forth as before. It turns out that they are used to driving on the right. Now that they are skilled at it, it is no wonder. Although there have been several vehicle accidents during these days, similar to peacetime, few of them are actually caused by driving on the right. The intersections of various roads can also be said to be orderly. This is the effect of prior publicity efforts, right?

Last October, the British *Times* suddenly published an article describing the chaotic situation in our wartime capital on the first day of vehicle conversion to right-hand driving, with cars colliding with pedicabs, pedicabs pulling onto sidewalks, and cows and horses braying in a mess. It turned out that our country's right-hand driving was originally scheduled to be implemented on October 1st of last year, but later the enemy surrendered. More important things needed to be done, such as accepting the surrender and taking over, so it was postponed to New Year's Day of this year. This *Times* reporter stationed in Chongqing probably wrote the article based on assumptions, sent it back to his country long ago to be published in a periodical, and then forgot about the postponement. That's how this joke happened. This shows that foreigners expected it to be very difficult for our country, which has been accustomed to driving on the left for decades, to suddenly switch to driving on the right. It cannot be denied that changing customs is not an easy task, especially in Shanghai, which has 127,000 vehicles of all kinds. But the facts tell us that the achievements of the past few days are enough to make this *Times* "prophet" feel ashamed. I pray that the Allied jeeps, having adapted to their habit of right-hand driving, will no longer cause accidents in the future. At the same time, I hope that all vehicles in the city will continue to exercise caution and complete this historic reform in a bloodless manner.

### Chongqing Snippets

— Mei Youyun

Starting from New Year's Day, rickshaw pullers are shouting "Right hand!" in the downtown area. The sound of "Left hand" is no longer heard. When the slogan "Vehicles and horses keep to the right, pedestrians keep to the side" first appeared, someone said, "Damn it! Vehicles and horses keep to the right, who is left to walk on the left?" I wonder if that gentleman has figured it out now?

Various bookstores have hung up banners with "New Year's Big Discount," but although the stores are packed, few people are buying. Most of them are friends who stand and read everything before leaving, because they can browse at will and save a lot of trouble compared to borrowing books from the library. Can we blame the "book readers"? No! People who like to find books to read here are mostly people who do not like or are not good at "making money."

Movie theaters have suspended operations over ticket prices, demanding tax exemptions. The actual ticket price is 500 yuan per ticket. The government is unwilling to reduce taxes and unwilling to increase the burden on citizens, so the issue is still "deadlocked."

The dance craze in the mountain city is growing. The "Shanghai Dancers" hired by the Yangtze River Ballroom from Shanghai have arrived in Chongqing to perform "dance instructor" duties and have started working.

"Sleeve," the only dance drama weekly in Chongqing, plans to hold an election for the "Top Five Dance Stars of Chongqing." The organizer is Li Luzi, the author of "Chongqing Insider."

### Non-Anger

— Dasha

The explosion of anger is formed by the accumulation of many small worries. Most people, especially young people, have latent or erupting anger. When we examine the source of anger, it is mostly due to external pressure, restlessness of mind, and inability to be calm and self-controlled. When interacting with others, we suffer grievances and insults, which excite our heartstrings and cause us to find ways to vent. It's like hitting a spring, which will inevitably vibrate.

Professor Stadden, a psychologist, believes that "anger is an expression of human nature, and everyone can be angry. However, anger can lead to many disasters and resentments." He believes that getting angry is a risky thing. Getting angry can lead to alienation, and the tragic result is the destruction of friendship and colleagues. Psychologists have researched many methods to control and guide human anger. Regarding the psychological state of anger, most psychologists believe that a safety valve should be used to properly restrain it. Getting angry is like the release of steam. When there is too much steam, the machine can't keep up and trouble will result, so a safety valve should be used to close the "steam."

It is very unworthy to get angry when someone angers you. You should restrain your anger and seek some appropriate way to vent it that will not harm your emotions, such as boxing or singing opera. Psychologists say, "In a very critical situation, when encountering someone who is angry, the best way to deal with it is to remain calm, clear, and peaceful."

Sometimes the arrival of anger can expand our future. We must guide anger into positive action to advance our careers. Lao Tzu said in the Tao Te Ching, "Those who are good at being soldiers are not warlike, those who are good at fighting are not angry, those who are good at defeating the enemy do not contend, and those who are good at using people put themselves below them. This is called the virtue of non-contention, this is called using the strength of others, this is called matching the ancient peak." The "those who are good at fighting are not angry" means that "those who are not angry have the confidence to win." "Non-anger" is a good proverb for dealing with the world.

Education

### Enrollment Retention Fee

— Yanqiu

Two or three weeks before the end of each semester, the school authorities prepare for the enrollment retention fee issue. Our school is of course no exception. Last Friday, we received a notice from the school regarding the enrollment retention fee, which read as follows:

"Each student should pay an enrollment retention fee of 1,000 yuan in legal tender, from × month × day to × month × day. If the student does not pay the enrollment retention fee but still comes to the school next semester, they will be treated as a new student. If the enrollment retention fee is paid but the student does not come to the school next semester, the fee will not be refunded."

From the above notice, it can be seen that the purpose of collecting the enrollment retention fee is money, not retention. How can we tell? Just look at the notice: If you pay but don't come, there will be no refund. This shows that they only know how to take in and not how to give out, and they stipulate the deadline for paying the enrollment retention fee before school is out. They also don't know how much tuition will be due next semester? If the tuition fee for the next semester is announced and the parents cannot afford the tuition, wouldn't the 1,000 yuan enrollment retention fee be wasted? Now I have an idea, but I don't know if it's appropriate?

The idea is that the enrollment retention fee should not be legal tender, but a letter. The student's parents should write a letter of enrollment retention, signed and sealed, to avoid joking. This proves that the student will still attend school next semester. If the tuition fee for the next semester is too expensive and they cannot afford to study, the parents can decline with a letter.

### Soldier Treatment Issues

— Shu Mei

"Wu Qi ran to Chu and explained to King Dao of Chu the way to enrich the country and strengthen the army, saying: 'The state of Chu has a territory of thousands of miles and more than a million soldiers. It should dominate the feudal lords and be the leader of the world. The reason why it cannot surpass other countries is that the way of raising soldiers has been lost. The way of raising soldiers is to first enrich their wealth and then use their strength. Now, officials who are not urgent fill the court, and distant relatives squander public funds, while soldiers only have enough food left to eat a peck or two. How can they be expected to sacrifice their lives for the country? If Your Majesty truly listens to my plan, eliminates redundant officials, dismisses distant relatives, and uses all the salary to treat brave soldiers, and if the country's prestige does not rise, then I will accept the punishment for false words.' King Dao followed his plan. Many ministers said that Qi's words should not be used, but King Dao did not listen. Therefore, he sent Wu Qi to assess the official system, and he eliminated hundreds of redundant officials. The children of high officials were not allowed to steal positions through connections, and those of the royal family above the fifth generation were ordered to support themselves and be compared to commoners. Those below the fifth generation were reduced according to their degree of kinship. Several tens of thousands of national taxes were saved. Elite soldiers were selected from the country for training day and night, and their wealth and equipment were reviewed to increase their salary and food up to several times. All the soldiers competed to exert themselves, and Chu became powerful in the world because of its army.'"

A few days ago, I saw an appeal from a soldier in a certain newspaper, the gist of which was that the monthly salary of only three or four hundred yuan was not enough for any use. The implication seemed to be that their past wind and dew, life and death, were really "not worth it."

This is a very bad phenomenon. Could such a psychological evolution lead to some rather serious misfortune?

Reading *Strategies of the Warring States* by chance, I saw an article about improving the treatment of soldiers, which could not help but evoke many feelings. I am recording it, perhaps as a reference.

Invention

### Postal Rocket

— Junyi

Rockets were originally powerful weapons of air warfare, but recently they have become available for postal work. The inventor is Professor Harry, a famous British scientist. Harry served in the Royal Air Force for a long time, and his original goal was to facilitate the swift transmission of intelligence. After the war ended, he planned to convert it for postal use. Harry began researching postal rockets in 1941. He not only spent all his assets on research, but also borrowed a sum from the headquarters where he worked.

In September of last year, Harry experimented with postal rockets in Blackpool, northern England, with great success. Harry has not yet officially announced the structure of this rocket, but it is only known that its weight is reduced by three-fifths compared to military rockets, and its composition contains a lot of aluminum, so it is very light and the speed can be increased tenfold compared to military rockets. A rocket launched from London could reach San Francisco, USA, in 53 minutes.

### American Resource Losses

— Bao Zhongzuo

The United States has suffered enormous losses of natural resources in this war. According to confidential estimates by the US government, from 1941 to 1945, it used up a quarter of its oil reserves, seven-tenths of its iron ore resources, one-fifth of its copper, and one-quarter of its lead and zinc. Furthermore, according to forecasts by the US Bureau of Mines, natural gas reserves can only be used for 49 years, copper for 29 years, zinc for 19 years, oil for 18 years, gold for 14 years, lead for 12 years, and silver for 11 years. Other metals such as tungsten, platinum, mercury, asbestos, manganese, nickel, and zinc are almost exhausted and will need to rely on overseas imports for years to come.

These metals that the United States lacks are all extremely important in industry. For example, tungsten can increase the hardness of steel, which is necessary for high-speed cutting of the large quantities of products that need to be shortened.

The United States is now planning to spend money to purchase large quantities of metal minerals necessary for military equipment from abroad to compensate for the loss of natural resources in this war.

### Answer to Why Children Are Not Allowed in Movie Theaters

— Song Guobin

This topic appeared in this column on the 28th of last month. I, from a hygienic and medical point of view, answer as follows: The most common route of transmission of infectious diseases is through the mouth and nose. The mouth and nose are the doors for the body to contact the outside world. Summer diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and epidemic dysentery are all transmitted through the mouth; winter diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, measles, diphtheria, and meningitis are all transmitted through the nose. (In ancient times, people did not know about germs and believed that "evil spirits" were at work, but in fact, most germs travel with the wind and are transmitted through the air. The name "evil spirit" is not entirely inapplicable.) These types of germs are spread in the air by patients or carriers coughing, and others inhale them through their noses, thus forming a transmission. Although the conditions for transmission are not so simple, most germs are very fragile and do not easily thrive without a suitable environment. Once they encounter dryness and low temperatures, they lose their ability to reproduce. The most suitable environment for transmission is probably public places of entertainment. In winter, windows are tightly closed, and heating is turned on. The air is not circulated, and the temperature and humidity are extremely suitable for the survival of germs. Therefore, if there are patients or carriers in the audience, a cough will scatter germs in all directions, invading and attacking the neighboring seats and achieving their transmission offensive. Children's bodies are delicate and easily infected, and there is more than one person coughing, and more than one person is infected under one cough, and more than one disease is spread. This is why the above-mentioned diseases easily become epidemic between winter and spring. Therefore, in my opinion, not only should children not be allowed in entertainment venues, but also adults with coughs should automatically stay away to avoid harming others. This is not only related to public health, but also beneficial to the promotion of hygiene ethics. What does the public think?

This article was written by Dr. Song Guobin, a consultant to the Shanghai Health Bureau, and is of course very valuable based on his rich academic knowledge and experience. I hope that readers will pay attention: Do not casually set foot in public places if you have an infectious disease to avoid harming others; parents, in order to protect their young children, should not risk taking them into such places. If both parties pay attention, it will be a small contribution to public health. (Editor)

### Regarding Housing Adjustment Problems - Please Establish a Method to Relieve People's Hardship

Dear Editor: A very serious social problem lying before us that needs to be resolved is the adjustment of rent increases between second landlords and third tenants. Isn't the city government now stipulating that rent increases should be 40 times the increase in 1937? But now, the first landlords are increasing rent to the second landlords using the equivalent amount of the fake currency in legal tender, and the second landlords are increasing rent to the third tenants, of course, also converting the fake currency to legal tender. On the surface, it seems very fair, but when the second landlords rented the houses from the first landlords, the rent was of course very small, and the increase is very limited. The rent of the second landlords who sublet to the third tenants has already been greatly increased, especially those who rented after the war. If the increase is 40 times, they will not be able to afford it. If the fake currency is converted to legal tender, how can they cope with it? For example, if a second landlord sublets a house to someone for 1,400 yuan per month, now it needs to be changed to 1,400 yuan in legal tender. The second landlord increases the rent to the first landlord by a small amount, but increases the rent to the third tenant by the same amount, which allows them to reap profits for nothing. This matter is related to the housing of millions of citizens in the city and is extremely serious. Although there are many appeals of injustice in the newspapers every day, the municipal authorities have not adjusted it. Fearing that in the future, housing disputes will inevitably become more and more intense, I have already tasted this flavor. I dare to ask your newspaper to speak out for justice and appeal to the municipal government to quickly adjust: (1) Reiterate the previous order to strictly prohibit using the conversion of fake currency to legal tender as the standard for rent increases; (2) The second landlord's rent increase should be increased in terms of pre-war and post-war, and should not be treated in general; (3) Promptly stipulate the standard for rent increases between second landlords and third tenants; (4) After the adjustment, if the third tenants have already paid excess rent, it should be deducted from the rent. If the above-mentioned are adopted by the municipal government, then housing disputes in this city can be reduced, and the suffering of the third tenants in the city can be alleviated, which is truly a great merit. Sincerely, Sun Xiaozhu

### Inquiry About the Route to Xi'an

Dear Editor: We just came from the countryside and our purpose is to go to Xi'an, but we don't know how to get there? Is the traffic blocked? And how much travel expenses are needed per person, so as not to suffer the pain of being stranded in a foreign land? I am really very sorry to bother you for your time, and I hope you can take the time to tell us in detail, and we will be very grateful.

Respectfully, Shen Zenan

(Answer) To get to Xi'an, first take the train to Nanjing, cross the river to Pukou, take the Jinpu train to Xuzhou, and change to the Longhai Railway heading west, all the way is smooth. The amount of travel expenses can be inquired from the China Travel Service. (The company is located on Sichuan Road, north of Nanjing Road)
