[Our Newspaper Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the attack on U.S. troops in the Anping area, the Communist Party stated that it is currently awaiting the investigation report from the special group sent by Peiping.

[Our Newspaper Peiping 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the attack on U.S. troops at Da Xiao Sha He, the U.S. side of the Military Mediation Department has not made any statement other than agreeing to send a group to the site for investigation. It seems to be awaiting instructions from the U.S. military and diplomatic authorities in China, showing unusual caution. U.S. reporters are particularly concerned about this. Cai Wenzhi's statement on this matter was fully published by the United Press without a word omitted. The Communist side sent a memorandum to the U.S. side in the name of Ye Jianying, which was roughly the same as the broadcast from Yan'an, stating that Da Xiao Sha He was a "Liberated Area" and that Anping Hexiwu was a place repeatedly contested by the National and Communist armies. No evidence was presented regarding the so-called joint National and U.S. armies. When reporters asked Chen Shiqu, the Chief of Staff of the Communist Party, about this, Chen said: The captured U.S. military truck driver was a witness, but no other evidence was presented. Chen said he had not heard of the capture of a Communist military doctor. The government side is particularly concerned about this matter. The group that the three parties agreed to send for investigation was originally scheduled to depart on the 3rd, but it did not happen. According to the Communist side, the reason was that the U.S. side requested that the Communist army in the area be notified first, that is, a reliable guarantee for the personnel of the group must be obtained first. It is also learned that the National Army has advanced to the area yesterday and, in order to protect the highway, will recover Xianghe County, which is located next to it.

[Central News Agency Tianjin 3rd Dispatch] It is reported that the U.S. military authorities stationed in Tianjin have conducted a detailed investigation into the situation when U.S. troops were attacked by the Communist army on the Peiping-Tianjin Highway on the 29th. On that day, there were a total of 24 vehicles in the patrol team traveling from Tianjin to Peiping. The first four vehicles were outposts, consisting of one machine gun jeep, one communication jeep, and two automatic gun jeeps. A considerable distance behind the outposts were twelve trucks, followed by eight vehicles including army jeeps, Xingzheng trucks, and patrol cars, with a total length of 400 yards. When the outposts reached Da Xiao Sha He in Anping, they were blocked by ox carts placed as obstacles in the middle of the highway. The right front of the highway was Da Xiao Sha He Village, where there were Communist machine guns. There were also Communist machine guns in the small woods on the left front, and Communist sniper teams in the cornfields on the left rear and right rear. The Communist command post was located on the left side of the highway (east). The U.S. military vehicles were blocked by the obstacles, and immediately after stopping, they were attacked by the Communist army without warning. It is generally believed that this was a planned action.

[United Press Peiping 3rd Dispatch] A U.S. military patrol team of 200 men will leave Peiping for Tianjin on the morning of the 4th, but in view of the attack on the 29th of last month, they will carry full equipment to prevent accidents. The team of U.S. soldiers will carry four medium tanks and thirty other vehicles, including two radio jeeps and one radio truck. The remaining trucks will carry U.S. soldiers.

### The Plane That Forced Landed in Northern Shaanxi a Month Ago; Destroyed by Government Planes; Action Taken Because Yan'an Refused to Hand It Over

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] The Communist Party's Yan'an broadcast yesterday regarding the bombing has attracted attention from various parties here. At 11 p.m. on a rainy night, reporters made a special visit to the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Chen Cheng. Chen had just returned from a banquet hosted by the U.S. Navy at the Lizi Society and was resting because he felt slightly unwell. The reporter then wrote the questions on the back of his business card and asked him to respond. Soon after, his attendant staff officer came out and told the reporter: The Chief of Staff was aware of the news of the bombing of Yan'an and would not comment on it temporarily today. The government will issue an announcement tomorrow.

[United Press Nanjing 3rd Dispatch] Air Force Commander Zhou Zhirou said today that the government planes bombed Yan'an yesterday to destroy the B24 bomber that flew to Yan'an on June 26, and the bombing was successful. A spokesman for the CCP office claimed that seven planes bombed Yan'an, taking off from the Xi'an base, including six P47 fighter planes, which had recently arrived in Xi'an from Nanjing, and one B24 bomber, which strafed and bombed Yan'an for 20 minutes. According to Yan'an sources, the planes fired forward at the B24 bomber and the Communist headquarters in Yan'an, dropping 11 bombs. One of the bombs landed only 500 meters away from the office of Communist Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. The six fighter planes strafed the military area. The government B24 bomber that flew to Yan'an caught fire after being hit and was burned. According to Zhou Zhirou, he had instructed the air force bombing Yan'an to concentrate its targets on the government bomber left in Yan'an and to avoid bombing other places in Yan'an. The government bomber in Yan'an was forced to land due to a shortage of gasoline. It had been requested that the plane be returned to the government, but more than a month had passed and the request had not been accepted. Therefore, a team was sent to destroy it. Zhou Enlai was in a meeting with Special Envoy Marshall when he received the news of the bombing of Yan'an. The official news from Yan'an did not mention the number of casualties, but according to the Communist side here, the number of casualties was likely to be high. CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan said that the bombing of Yan'an was sudden and the Communist army was not prepared. There are currently two U.S. liaison officers stationed in Yan'an, one of whom is Major Yang Ge.

[Our Newspaper Peiping 3rd Dispatch] Ye Jianying sent a memorandum to the government and the U.S. today, stating that seven government planes bombed and strafed Yan'an for 20 minutes yesterday, dropping 11 bombs and firing more than 10,000 bullets. The plane piloted by Liu Shanben was also destroyed at the Yan'an airport. He requested that the Military Mediation Department report the matter to the Three-Person Committee. The Communist side denied that the Communist Party had any planes.

### Official Washington to Issue Statement; Reaffirming U.S. Policy Toward China; Savage Says He Will Promote Our Country's Unification

[Central News Agency Washington 2nd Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated today that he expects the U.S. government to issue a statement soon reaffirming U.S. policy toward China, making a comprehensive review of the Chinese situation. He avoided mentioning China's internal problems, only saying that there had been small clashes between U.S. Marines and the Communist army. When reporters asked Acheson what criticism he had of the Chinese situation, Acheson said: An official statement would be issued soon, and he did not wish to make any criticism at this time.

[U.S. Information Service San Francisco 2nd Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Hodges Savage stated at the Federal Congress here today that the U.S. steps to aid China were aimed at promoting China's unification, not supporting any party's military groups. His speech reviewed the goals of U.S. foreign policy, from isolationism to the transformation of leading international cooperation, as well as the goals of the United Nations. He said: "Building a better world is a very difficult task, and therefore the task of U.S. diplomacy is even more difficult. China, one of the countries that suffered heavy losses in the war, is our good neighbor and friend across the Pacific Ocean. We have deep sympathy for the Chinese people, who made a heroic and sustained resistance against the brutal aggressor. We hope that they will soon achieve domestic peace and unification. The various actions of the U.S. to aid China are the steps to implement an established plan to help the entire China remove the effects left by the long war against Japan. These actions must not be seen as supporting any military group of any party in China. These actions cannot be completed in three or four months. The common goal is to promote rather than destroy unification, to encourage China to solve its domestic problems through democratic methods of peaceful agreements, rather than using military force."

### Military Setbacks and the People: What's the Connection? In Northern Jiangsu and Northern Hebei, Communist Forces Conduct Large-Scale Dam Breaching; Twelve Counties in Hebei Become a Vast Expanse of Water; Nationalists Rush to Repair Dams, but Communist Forces Obstruct, Leading to Fierce Battles

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Military News: After launching an offensive in northern Jiangsu and suffering setbacks, the Communist forces resorted to the most cruel policy, initiating large-scale dam-breaching operations from July 31st onwards. The details of the dam breaches over the past two days are as follows: (1) A breach occurred three kilometers southwest of Lianhe Station, near Xuzhou; (2) A breach, one kilometer long, occurred at Xin'anzhen on the Shu River line, 85 kilometers southwest of Haizhou; (3) A breach occurred at Shangfangjie on the Hou Shu River line, southwest of Donghai; (4) A breach occurred at Qiaoche, 16 kilometers southwest of Haizhou. After these four dams were breached, the average flooded area ranged from 200 to 300 square kilometers. If the water continues to rise, the area will continue to expand, and countless people will die. When our reporter inquired about this matter with the Communist Party's spokespersons, they claimed that the Communist Party had never breached any dams, only that it may have been due to major dam breaks or excessive rainfall causing flooding.

[Northern News Report, Beiping, 3rd] Baoding Phone Call: The Communist forces in Hebei continue to breach dams everywhere, and engage in repair battles with the Nationalist forces. According to reports, the Jiuxuan Gate on the North Grand Canal and the Jinmen Gate on the Yongding River have been breached, with water flowing in all directions. The embankments of the Ziya River at Xianxian and the Ziya River at Qijia Bridge have been breached, flooding the four counties of Wen'an, Tai, Xiong, and Renqiu. It is reported that after the dike northwest of Wang Xiwei Village, six li from Cangxian, was breached, the Nationalist and Communist forces are engaged in fierce fighting at Ergang Gate to repair the dike. The Jian Gan River dike was breached in anger by the public, with floodwaters flowing into the Communist area. Currently, repair teams along the Yongding River, the North and South Grand Canals, and the Daqing River are all engaged in fierce battles with the Communist forces. The purpose of the Communist forces' dam breaching is to isolate Cangxian and cut off the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. The Hebei Provincial Government has sent another telegram to the Military Mediation Department today, requesting a cessation, and has also dispatched the Construction Director to Tianjin and Cangzhou to inspect and supervise repairs.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] In northern Hebei, the Communist forces frequently breach dikes along the North and South Grand Canals and the Ziya Daqing and other rivers. Twelve counties, including Qingyuan, Wuqing, Cangxian, and Xincheng, have been flooded. Dam-blocking efforts are proceeding under the Communist forces' rain of gunfire.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 3rd] The Communist forces in Anyang breached the Liu Xinzhuang Cao Village River embankment, causing floodwaters to flow south, inundating more than sixty villages. Recently, due to continuous heavy rain, the northern embankment of the Huan River breached, causing floodwaters to flow north and west, converging with the Hun River. More than one hundred and twenty villages have been affected by the disaster.

### Financial Chaos Caused by the Discontinuation of Red Army Currency in the Northeast; Various Trade Associations Present Six Demands

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] The recovery of various areas in the Northeast and the discontinuation of 100-yuan Red Army currency from the first of the month have caused immense financial chaos. Many businesses have announced temporary closures to see how things develop, and disputes among the people are occurring frequently. There is widespread lack of money, inability to cover expenses, and a shortage of living expenses. The general public is also expressing great dissatisfaction with the registration requirement of paying one-tenth and the brevity of the registration period. Various trade associations held a meeting to discuss this issue, and as a result, decided to submit the following opinions to the authorities immediately: (1) For funds deposited by local banks with the Central Bank before August 1st, whether they were Red Army currency or circulating currency, they should be exchanged for circulating currency at face value. (2) Because only one-tenth of the face value of Red Army currency is exchanged at the time of registration, with the remaining nine-tenths being deposited and a deposit slip issued, it is hoped that holders of these deposit slips will be loaned at least five-tenths of the face value of their deposit slips in circulating currency, in order to facilitate market finance. (3) According to regulations, only 22 branches of the four national banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) and commercial banks (Yifa, Zhicheng, Commercial, Gongcheng, etc.) are designated for registration and redemption. Given that the registration period is only ten days, it seems too short. Therefore, it is hoped that the number of exchange locations will be increased and the redemption period extended. (4) For the 9.7 billion yuan of Red Army currency issued beyond that recognized by the Soviet Union, the government should bear the responsibility for the losses, so as not to plunge society into a state of unrest. (5) The government should consider Red Army currency currently held by handlers of relief funds and other public funds being raised, so as not to put the handlers in a difficult situation. (6) Government agencies should accept Red Army currency for at least one-half of the amount of taxes levied. It is rumored that the authorities are currently studying this. Personnel handling registration at various banks are recalling the losses suffered by people during the early Republic of China due to Russian foreign currency and are already trembling with fear. This time, the losses to the people due to the Red Army currency are even more severe. Everyone is now regarding the currency of the puppet Manchuria as a treasure again, but on the other hand, they know that they will still suffer some losses. According to our reporter's investigation, the total amount of puppet Manchuria currency issued was 13.1 billion. Some estimate that about 100 million or more has been destroyed. In addition, the legal tender with Director Du's seal, which was temporarily circulated in the Northeast last winter, has already recovered 700 million. The remaining amount is less than 100 million and can be recovered by the end of the year. At the time of issuing this stamped legal tender, the exchange rate with the puppet Han currency was one-to-one.

### Five Customs Offices Temporarily Established in the Northeastern Region

Furthermore, since the UNRRA Council will be convened in the near future, it is necessary to wait until then to make an announcement. They also stated that the announcement will be based on a review of the global situation and will declare what action UNRRA will take.

### Zhejiang Province Postpones Tax Collection

Fellow Provincials in Shanghai Elect Representatives

To Visit Chairman Shen and Plead for Consideration

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The Zhejiang Administrative Conference, after deciding on detailed methods for collecting actual taxes and borrowing grain, is promoting eliminating abuses and ensuring peace for the people in order to maximize benefits. It has instructed special commissioners and county magistrates in various regions to implement the measures. Recently, the joint meeting of various Zhejiang hometown associations in Shanghai, chaired by Chu Fucheng, telegraphed the provincial government to request that the decision to collect actual taxes be rescinded and sent representatives to the province to petition. Chairman Shen explained the situation in person. Mr. Chu stated that he understood the government's need to collect actual taxes, but pointed out that Jiangsu had discounted the tax amount by 20%, and the Ministry of Food had understood. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang are adjacent, he requested that the same procedure be followed. The provincial government is currently inquiring with the Ministry of Food to verify the truth before deciding on a method. Chairman Shen has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. The collection of land taxes in Zhejiang Province this year was originally scheduled to begin on September 1st in eastern Zhejiang and September 16th in western Zhejiang. However, due to insufficient preparation and unharvested fields, it has been decided to postpone it by half a month. The borrowing of grain by various counties is already underway, and the work is proceeding smoothly.

### "Iron Bars Beauty" Kawashima Yoshiko; Claims to Have Never Even Had an Unofficial Marriage; Lives Alone in a Room, Passing the Years Reading "Dream of the Red Chamber"

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] "Iron Bars Beauty" Kawashima Yoshiko, who is thirty-two years old this year, told visitors that she is not yet married and has never even had an unofficial marriage. The rumor that she married a Mongolian prince and then ran away is the flattery of her older sister, Tushiye Tu. Okanshiye Tu died of illness not long after divorcing the Mongolian prince. She also denies the story that she dressed as a man and led 28 cavalrymen to occupy Chengde. She said that she was only fourteen years old at the time, how could she have had the courage to do that? That matter was done by her brother, Jin Bihui. She explained the reason why outsiders called her "Commander Jin": her father had participated in Zhang Xun's restoration, and at that time she was only four years old and liked to dress as a man, so the servants called her "Commander Jin," which later became her nickname. As for why she is named Kawashima Yoshiko, it is because she was raised in the Kawashima family in Japan and received education in a certain noble school in Japan, so she was named so. Her Chinese name is Jin Bihui. She currently lives alone in a room in prison, spending her days reading "Dream of the Red Chamber," sometimes teaching a boy named Teng to sing, trying to pass the time.

Editorial

### Japanese Reparations and the Restoration of Municipal Administration

Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, U.S. reparations commissioner Edwin W. Pauley has visited and investigated the material conditions in Japan, Korea, and our Northeast. He has since reported and made recommendations to U.S. Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. At the same time, it is rumored that the U.S. has also suggested to the Far Eastern Commission that it re-draft the Japanese reparations plan. We believe that, regardless, the results of Pauley's investigation will contribute significantly to the future discussions on the amount of Japanese reparations and its distribution, and may serve as an important basis for implementation.

China was the first country to be invaded by Japan and suffered the greatest sacrifices. Therefore, the amount of compensation we demand from Japan should naturally be the largest. According to Pauley's remarks in Tokyo, the Allied nations' purpose in dealing with the reparations issue is twofold: first, to dismantle Japan's military-industrial complex to ensure lasting peace; and second, to transfer Japan's military-industrial facilities to the invaded countries to develop their industries. This embodies the intention to eliminate aggression and lay the foundation for peace while compensating the invaded countries for their losses. We deeply agree with this far-sightedness. Having learned from Japan's long-term aggression, we know that Japan dared to brazenly launch a war of aggression because of China's industrial backwardness and weak national defense, which aroused Japan's covetousness. To ensure peace in the Pacific in the future, China's prosperity and strength must be the main stabilizing force. Many people in the country advocate using Japanese reparations to establish heavy industry, consolidate national defense, promote national economic prosperity, and guarantee the victory of world peace. This opinion is in line with the two goals expressed by Pauley.

However, we would like to point out that general attention is focused on national defense and heavy industry, and other aspects seem to be neglected. The restoration of municipal administration is one of these aspects. In our opinion, establishing heavy industry and consolidating national defense are the most fundamental requirements for China's revival. However, during the eight-year war of aggression, Japan spared no effort in destroying the municipal construction of our occupied major cities. Now that they have been recovered, it is difficult to restore them due to the lack of various facilities. This has a great impact on the future development of the national economy, and it is necessary to demand considerable materials from Japan for compensation. We believe that Japanese reparations should not be limited to military-industrial materials alone.

Recalling that since the July 7th Incident, each of Japan's attacks has targeted our country's major cities. Because cities are the center of the national economy, occupying a city allows for the control of the region related to that city; destroying a city also has a serious impact on the region related to that city. Taking Shanghai as an example, after Japan occupied Shanghai at that time, because of Shanghai's special importance in our country's economy, the severe damage it caused to our country's economy is self-evident. After other major cities were occupied, they also had a greater or lesser impact on our country's economy, depending on their importance. Fortunately, our government took appropriate measures and managed to overcome these difficulties. Now that the cities have been recovered, it stands to reason that the central role of the cities should also return to normal. However, if the destroyed municipal construction cannot be restored in time, its central role will be greatly weakened, and the damage to our country's economy will not be completely eliminated. The restoration of municipal construction is the key to the economic development and prosperity of cities; and the development and prosperity of urban economies can promote the development and prosperity of the national economy. The depth of this relationship and the magnitude of its impact cannot be ignored.

According to the original meaning of compensation, if Party A's materials are destroyed by Party B, Party B should compensate with the same materials. This original meaning should also apply to the issue of Japanese reparations. Although in order to eliminate aggression and permanently establish peace, we cannot but focus on dismantling Japan's military-industrial complex. However, if our original municipal facilities or materials have been damaged by Japan's aggression, affecting the development of the national economy, and these facilities or materials are also possessed by Japan, then demanding the same materials as compensation is also justified. Taking Shanghai as an example, after Shanghai was occupied by Japan for a long time, all of its original municipal construction was severely damaged, especially water, electricity, gas, trams, buses, docks, ferries, etc. These facilities were either destroyed, plundered, or allowed to deteriorate. The magnitude of the loss is difficult to estimate, and there are facts to prove it. This municipal construction is not only necessary for the daily life of the people, but also related to the development and prosperity of industry and commerce. If it is not vigorously restored, Shanghai's importance will be greatly reduced, and the national economy will also suffer greatly. However, the materials for restoring this construction are very scarce domestically, and it is extremely difficult to replenish them. Japan is still quite rich in this equipment. Investigating and seeking compensation from them to offset wartime losses is not an excessive request. After Shanghai receives this type of compensation, the four million citizens will benefit from it, and the activity of industry and commerce will double. This will be a great help in promoting national prosperity and becoming a stabilizing force for peace in the Pacific. Therefore, we do not hesitate to elaborate on the issue of demanding reparations from Japan, pointing out that attention should be paid to the restoration of municipal administration, precisely because we are aware of this.

The Far Eastern Commission for Japan has passed an interim report on the issue of Japanese reparations, allowing each invaded country to submit a request for compensation. We hope that when the government submits this application, in addition to focusing on major aspects such as national defense and heavy industry, it will also pay attention to the acquisition of materials for municipal construction. At the same time, we hope that the Allied nations will also pay attention to this when discussing this issue. Because this is not only beneficial to China, but also beneficial to world peace.

### Voting System Issue at Peace Conference – Becomes Focus of Dispute Between Large and Small Nations – Four Powers Pass Resolution on Rotating Chairmanship

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] Yugoslavia has stated that it will demand the right to veto proposals at the Paris Conference regarding Trieste. This request involves both the issue of the Port of Trieste and the voting rights system. New Zealand, Brazil, and the Netherlands have also formally opposed the two-thirds majority voting system proposed by the Four Powers for the first time, and advocate for a simple majority system. Yugoslavia believes that any proposals regarding border issues cannot be effective without the consent of the Allied nations involved. The Soviet Union's attitude remains unclear today. However, Belarusian representative Kislov expressed support for the Four Powers' plan for the Port of Trieste, while stating that the final decision should be based on protecting Yugoslavia's national economic and special interests. Discussions in the Rules Committee remain stalled on the issue of the majority voting system. It is expected that if Britain and the United States firmly insist on a two-thirds majority, this method may become established. Otherwise, a simple majority system may be adopted, and the roots of the crisis will be buried therein.

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The Rules Committee of the Peace Conference today passed a resolution supporting the rotation of the chairmanship by the Four Powers by a vote of twelve to eight. The Abyssinian representative did not participate in the vote. U.S. representative Byrnes declared that he supports the rotation of the chairmanship of the Peace Conference by the Four Powers, as widening the rift over this issue would threaten not only the Peace Conference but also the subsequent Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. The adoption of the Four Power rotation chairmanship was influenced by Byrnes' remarks. According to the French alphabetical order, the first chairman will be the United States, followed by France, Britain, and the Soviet Union every three days. During the debate, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov repeatedly insisted that the chairman of the Peace Conference should be rotated by the Four Powers. The New Zealand representative, supported by the Netherlands, Brazil, Australia, and Canada, strongly opposed this proposal, stating that France is the host country and should be asked to serve as the permanent chairman to prevent disputes.

### Indian Representative Delivers Speech – Concerned About Peace in the Middle East – Greek Representative Makes Two Requests

[Our Report] Paris, 3rd Broadcast: The sixth plenary session of the Peace Conference was held today at 3:00 PM (midnight in Shanghai). Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, the chief Indian representative, delivered a speech, stating that India has close economic and cultural ties with East Africa geographically, and is closely linked to the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Therefore, it is also concerned about the future of Italian territories. He concluded by saying that although there are many difficulties and intense contradictions in this Peace Conference, the Indian people still deeply believe that the Peace Conference can achieve success. Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaaris then spoke, stating that Greece has two requests: (1) to request material compensation to compensate for the losses suffered by Greece, otherwise Greece will be unable to rebuild itself; (2) to request a guarantee of its territorial security through collective cooperation. Finally, representatives from Ukraine, Belgium, and South Africa delivered speeches, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Soviet Foreign Minister Quietly Leaves When Canadian Prime Minister Delivers Speech

### Abyssinia Demands Italian East African Territories

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] Abyssinian representative Wolde, in a speech at the Peace Conference today, requested that the Italian East African territories of Eritrea and Somaliland be incorporated into its territory. It is claimed that these colonies were invaded and exploited by Italy. This is the first country to make a request for Italian territories at the Peace Conference. Abyssinia also hopes to obtain reparations from Italy. Wolde ignored the fact that the Four Powers' conference had agreed to postpone the issue of Italian colonies for a year, and unexpectedly made a request, which was unexpected.

### Spanish Government in Exile Active in Paris

[Our Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: The Spanish Republican government in exile has begun informal talks with Italian and Soviet representatives at the Paris Peace Conference regarding the recognition of the Republican government as the legitimate government of Spain. Most of the 21 countries attending the Peace Conference have not yet recognized the Spanish Republican government, so the Spanish Republicans intend to use the opportunity of the Peace Conference to negotiate this matter. Molotov said in a speech on Wednesday that the time for removing the Franco regime is not far off, which has given the Republicans a lot of encouragement. They interpreted this as saying that the Soviet Union will announce a definite plan to expel Franco at the Paris Peace Conference or at the United Nations General Assembly to be held in September.

### British Government Reiterates Policy – Maintain Austrian Integrity

### Britain Dispatches Indian Troops to Basra – Britain Plans to Establish Largest Military Base in Pakistan

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] An official announcement states: The authorities have dispatched troops from India to Basra (a major port in the Persian Gulf, belonging to Iraq) to protect the lives of British, Indian, and Arab people and British interests in southern Iran if necessary.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The India Office stated: The New Delhi radio station announced that Indian troops have been transferred from India to Basra to protect the lives of British, Indian, and Arab people and British interests in southern Iran. In fact, there is no issue of British troops being transferred to Iran. The Ministry originally hoped to clarify this intention when announcing the troop movements.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] A "New York Times" reporter stated: The so-called withdrawal from Egypt is not only the withdrawal of the British Army from Egypt, but also the abandonment of the naval base in Alexandria and the air base in the desert. Palestine can be used as a new base for the army, navy, and air force. The partition plan for Palestine is under consideration.

The Negev Region is of Strategic Importance

The plan aims to keep the Negev desert region in southern Pakistan under British control. It is rumored that Britain intends to establish its largest military base in the Middle East here. Britain had previously obtained the right to station troops in Transjordan when it allowed it to become independent. British military leaders hope that after establishing a military base in the Negev, British troops can still be readily deployed in the event that the Suez Canal is attacked. British aircraft can reach the canal area in one hour, Cairo in two hours, and Baghdad in less than three hours from the Negev. The port of Haifa can be developed into a first-class naval port, and the oil fields are nearby, so the Negev is the most ideal military base in the Middle East. Although the Iraqis want to revise the British-Iraqi treaty, it is expected that the British army will not lose its position in that country after the new treaty is concluded. Therefore, although the British army has withdrawn from Syria and Lebanon, the troops in Iraq are still a strong force to protect the oil fields and the canal.

Cyprus is a Strategically Important Military Prize

In addition to Pakistan, Iraq, and Transjordan, Cyprus is also an important base for Britain's plan to control the Mediterranean. There is a good natural naval port on the east coast of the island, and the eastern part of the island is a plain, which can be used for aircraft to take off and land. Geographically, the island controls the entrance to the Aegean Sea, which is equivalent to the gateway to the Black Sea. From Kyrenia on the north coast of Cyprus to Turkey is only 45 miles, from Larnaca on the southeast coast of the island to Beirut is only 20 miles, and from the south coast to the Suez Canal is also 230 miles. Historically, Cyprus has been the battlefield for Arabs, Romans, French, Venetians, Turks, and British. The evolution of modern tactics does not reduce the military importance of Cyprus. Britain's suspicion of Moscow's interference is also due to this.

### Silent Rocket Passes Over Sweden

[Associated Press, Swedish Capital, 2nd] It is reported that someone witnessed a silver silent rocket slowly passing over the forests of northern Sweden. Seven or eight people witnessed this object, all saying that it was shaped like an airplane. This type of rocket has been found over Sweden several times recently, and there is much speculation as to whether it came from the Soviet-occupied zone. Military authorities have prohibited the publication of the locations where the rockets passed in order to prevent the launchers from measuring their direction and speed.

### Truman Disagrees with Pakistan Partition Plan – U.S. Delegation Recalled Home – Hopes for Roundtable Conference Dim

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Well-informed sources say the U.S. President is unlikely to endorse a plan to divide Palestine into two provinces and two districts, although official statements are still lacking. Attlee's actions will depend on the official statement. It is heard that the British Cabinet is scheduled to hold a special meeting next Wednesday to discuss the Palestine issue, at which time President Truman's attitude towards the Palestine partition plan may be clearly announced. Churchill previously suggested transferring the trusteeship of Palestine to the United Nations organization, and many Labor Party members also support this proposal. The Cabinet meeting next Wednesday will pay special attention to this matter.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. delegation in London discussing the Palestine issue suddenly returned home yesterday after receiving an urgent telegram from the President. The reason may be that the British Cabinet must obtain Truman's decision on the Palestine partition plan before discussing the Palestine issue on Wednesday.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Authoritative sources: Among the Arab countries that have accepted the British government's invitation to attend a meeting to discuss the Palestine issue, there are four countries: Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Lebanon. However, they are all conditional, that is, they are unwilling to meet at the same table with Jewish representatives. Therefore, the hope of holding a roundtable conference seems to be quite slim.

### World Can Only Achieve Security by Not Resolving Disputes with Force – U.S. Releases Second Atomic Bomb Test Report

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] The White House today released two reports received by President Truman concerning the second underwater atomic bomb explosion at Bikini Atoll on July 25th. One report warned that the Bikini test showed that "the world must abolish war as a method of resolving international disputes if it wishes to achieve security." This report came from the President's Evaluation Commission, composed of nine non-military personnel, including Dr. Compton, the current president of MIT and an atomic energy scientist, and chaired by Senator Hatch of New Mexico. The second report came from the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Atomic Bomb Test Evaluation Committee, composed of naval and army officers and non-military scientists, chaired by Compton. Both reports pointed out that the radiation energy immediately after the underwater explosion was "estimated to be equivalent to hundreds of tons of atomic energy." The observation ship "Haven," where the two evaluation groups were stationed, was located eleven miles from the explosion site. The report described the major damage caused by the bomb as follows: The battleship "Arkansas" sank immediately, the aircraft carrier "Saratoga" sank within seven and a half hours after the explosion, and the destroyer "Hughes" ran aground on the sand but avoided sinking. The Japanese battleship "Nagato" sank five days after the explosion. The President's Evaluation Commission report compared air and underwater explosions, reaching the following conclusion: "Based on our observations, surface ships in the damage zone suffered more severe damage from the air explosion than from the underwater explosion. The flood caused by the second bomb contained deadly radiation. An enemy with two or more atomic bombs could cause damage equivalent to the combined damage of the two tests. The results of the two tests are being studied by the Maritime Bureau, and it is expected that the size, style, and structure of future ships will be completely changed to reduce the impact of explosions. We believe distance is the best defense. The Bikini test clearly shows that future atomic bomb wars will destroy nations and change the current level of civilization. The world must not use war as a tool for resolving international disputes if it wishes to be safe; this is self-evident." The Joint Chiefs of Staff Evaluation Committee's report detailed the atomic bomb explosion process, stating: "The water column stirred up by the atomic bomb was 2,200 feet in diameter and 5,500 feet high. The water column contained approximately 10 million tons of seawater. The waves outside the water column (approximately 1,000 feet from the point of impact) were 80 to 100 feet high. As the waves surged outward, the wave crests quickly decreased. The work of measuring the seabed wave vibrations has not yet been completed. There was no earthquake phenomenon during the atomic bomb explosion." Regarding the strong radiation produced by the explosion, it stated: "Human heads exposed to this strong radiation for a few minutes would be instantly paralyzed and would die within a few days or weeks. This highly damaging radioactive seawater made it difficult to ensure the safety of inspection teams entering the target area four days later. Details of the damage remain to be determined after a thorough investigation by the engineering team. In both tests, the arrangement of the target ships did not represent normal fleet mooring patterns. The arrangement of the target ships was purely to obtain the maximum results caused by the atomic bomb explosion." The observation and conclusion section of the committee report stated: "It is indeed possible to estimate the atomic bomb explosion within the scope of a normal explosion. In the first atomic bomb air burst, the above-deck equipment on major ships within a half mile suffered heavy damage, while the internal structure had only minor damage. In both tests, almost all ships within one mile were damaged. The second atomic bomb threw a large amount of radioactive seawater, which entered the hulls and decks, and the ships often became radiation warehouses, and the radiation could burn to death any living things on board. It seems premature to analyze the Bikini test and its problems in detail. We should point out that we should actively and immediately study certain unique problems caused by atomic bombs. The problem of atomic bombs poisoning large amounts of seawater is one of them. We should not only study the problem of protecting sailors on board, but also the problem of protecting people from radiation damage." The Evaluation Committee's report included a supplementary report on the first test, stating, "Approximately twenty ships within a half mile of the impact zone suffered heavy damage. The ships that did not sink should undergo twelve days of preliminary repairs, otherwise, the ships will not be able to return to the main base on their own for complete repair."

### U.S. Military Government in Korea Should Continue to Exist

Opinions Expressed in MacArthur's Letter

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] MacArthur stated in a summary letter to the Korean military government today that due to the breakdown of negotiations between the U.S.-Soviet Commission, the U.S. military government in Korea still needs to continue to exist. After the breakdown of negotiations between the U.S.-Soviet Commission, people publicly discussed whether to independently organize a temporary government in South Korea, but as the situation developed, the discussion subsided, and conversely, everyone hoped that the U.S. military government would continue to exist.

### Indonesian Radicals' Landing Attempt on Bali Thwarted

### Belarus is a Wasteland

UNRRA Releases Report

[Reuters, Geneva, 2nd] UNRRA recently released a report on the working conditions in Ukraine and Belarus, stating that there are no complete cities in the 400-mile stretch from Moscow to Minsk, resembling a desert. All ten million residents of Belarus are destitute, and only some livestock remain, hidden in dense forests and swamps. The situation in Ukraine is also tragic, with most towns relying solely on UNRRA relief supplies for survival. The average consumption of meat and fat is no more than one pound per person per month. UNRRA began transporting supplies to Ukraine and Belarus in March of this year, originally scheduled to deliver 2.5 million tons of materials, of which food and soap accounted for approximately 300,000 tons, and the rest were machinery and other items.

Yesterday, the Mendes District Court handled a case of a Chinese woman who committed suicide by jumping off a building. According to her suicide note, she also requested her husband to transport her remains back to her hometown for burial.

### Miss Britain's Bad Habit – Licking Fingers After Eating Chocolate – Witty Answer to Parliamentarian's Question

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Miss Summerskill, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food, is a red-haired and beautiful lady, but she has a bad habit, which is that she always licks her fingers after eating chocolate. Today in Parliament, a member raised the issue of "bad table manners" and asked Miss Summerskill to respond. The lady calmly stood up and said, "I admit that I do have this habit, but I don't believe that other members of parliament don't lick their fingers after eating chocolate, especially when it is a rare treat at the moment."

### Celebrating American Independence Day in President Truman's Hometown (Below) – Listening to Old Overseas Chinese Talk About the Past and Present

— (Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing stationed in the United States)

On Independence Day, Mr. Menggen, the "mayor" of Grandview, is still working hard. Menggen is a car repairman, also a manor owner, a shop owner, and a bank manager. He is the richest person in the whole village, so he was elected as the mayor, serving as the "parent official" of the president's hometown. Menggen is a very hardworking and amiable person. He wore work clothes and greeted us at the car repair shop, reaching out his hands covered in grease, and sincerely welcoming us to visit the former residence of the current head of state. There are many Jews in Grandview, and there are also many Americans who migrated from Germany in the past.

President Truman's father was a German immigrant, and his mother was a British immigrant. These people of different races have lived together in the village for decades. Over time, they have become harmonious, like family members. After Truman became the President of the United States, some merchants in the village wanted to build some presidential memorial sites to attract tourists from all over the United States, but Truman stopped them all. According to people in the village, Truman himself hates these uncoordinated compliments and extravagance and does not want others to treat him as a "trick" to make money. I searched the whole village, and only one car repair station on a corner, a newly built house, was written "Truman Intersection". The old overseas Chinese He Liyuan has a very good "relationship" in this area. He walked in the middle of the village, greeting people left and right non-stop. His humility and simplicity are the typical Chinese people in the eyes of Americans. He must ask people "Is your wife safe?" "Is the baby doing well?" American friends have a good impression of him from the bottom of their hearts. I saw the Mayor Menggen of that small town hold his greasy hand and talk to him for a long time. He Liyuan used to live in this village, twenty-five years ago, he and the current head of state, had a life of "working at sunrise, resting at sunset, and hearing the sounds of chickens and dogs." They lived in the same village, as neighbors for six years.

Old He told me that before the war, five dollars could hire a servant to work for a week. After the war, labor was much more expensive, and six dollars could only hire a servant to work for a day, and the working hours of a day were less than eight hours. Every week pays seven days of wages, but only works five days, with two days off, but wages must be paid. Old He believes that this is a very uneconomical thing, so he decided to sell the land last year and got a price of fifteen thousand dollars. Old He's current life is worthy of praise. Five years ago, his old partner passed away, his son is in Indiana, and he lives alone at 129 East Linwood Street in Kansas City. He practices Chinese medicine and sells Chinese medicine, and many foreigners come and go from his clinic. He said that he has been tired of his profession for more than 30 years. But there are still many Americans who often come to seek medical treatment. He has a beautiful car that he drives himself, three hunting guns, and two fishing rods. He leads a very flavorful "fishing and hunting life" in his spare time, often fishing alone all day, and returning home in the evening with three bass, cooking and eating himself. Hunting in the suburbs of Kansas City is limited, only open for forty-five days between November and December each year. But fishing is free, as long as you get a "fishing license", you can fish anywhere.

Outside Kansas City, there are seventy-five lakes of various sizes. The municipal government specially raises fish species and feeds them fish food for many anglers, and welcomes citizens to go fishing and relaxing when they have nothing to do. He goes to bed early and gets up early every day, very concerned about his motherland. He has American citizenship, but he voluntarily gave it up. He said: "I am Chinese and will never change in my life." He hates the bad entertainment of overseas Chinese youths and often encourages young people to make progress. He doesn't like noisy cities, and his car mostly drives in the suburbs. One night before Consul Shen Zhuogan and I left Kansas City, he used his car to take us to a secluded restaurant called "Sandee" for dinner. The cool summer breeze blew in the suburbs of Kansas City, blowing on Old He's free and easy white hair. In the hazy night, I looked at his strong black shadow and deeply blessed him!

### President Song Preserves Shipping Rights – Shipping Industry Extremely Excited

Maritime Customs Bulletin No. 39 Resolved to be Abolished

According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, President Song of the Executive Yuan has decided to cancel the Jianghai Customs Bulletin No. 39 of March 21 this year, which specifically approved foreign ships to navigate between coastal ports. The reason for the cancellation of this order is due to the impact of the flow that has occurred in recent months, and the shipping industry has repeatedly reported the facts to the authorities. President Song adopted the situation and quickly abolished it. In addition, the decision was made to preserve the navigation rights of the Yangtze River, and the original proposal to open trade to four ports was abolished. Only foreign ships transporting public goods and relief supplies are allowed to directly unload goods in Jinghan from abroad, and are not allowed to carry commercial goods. This issue has been specifically resolved. The shipping industry is extremely excited about President Song's cancellation of Jianghai Customs Bulletin No. 39, and the announcement on the 16th of last month that the rental of British ships would be terminated to ensure shipping rights. At the same time, compensation will be allowed to various private companies for the sinking of most commercial ships caused by participating in the Jianghai blockade work during the war, and to assist shipping companies in obtaining a large number of ships, totaling approximately 400,000 to 500,000 tons, in order to seek the restoration of China's shipping industry and gradually replace Japan's pre-war shipping position in the Far East.

### Pan Gongzhan's Address at Academic Symposium: International News Cooperation is the First Thing to Do in Cultural Cooperation; Chinese and British Journalists Have an Unshirkable Responsibility

[Our Report] The Shanghai cultural and academic circles' weekend academic symposium held its seventh symposium yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai branch of the World Cultural Cooperation Association on Avenue Joffre. More than 20 leading figures from the city's education, academic, news, industry, and science circles attended, as well as Mr. MacDonald, director of the British Information Office, and Mr. Holyoake of the British Consulate, to exchange views on Sino-British cultural cooperation. The symposium was chaired by Li Shizeng, a senior member of the Kuomintang, and began at 5:30 p.m. The discussion was very lively. Everyone present then requested Mr. Li to address the meeting. Mr. Li briefly stated: "The Sino-British cultural cooperation that has a history is not artificially created, but is the natural evolution of many years of culture." Mr. Li welcomed the two foreign guests and asked them for "advice." Mr. MacDonald, director of the British Information Office, and Mr. Holyoake of the British Consulate then delivered short speeches, both expressing their sincere gratitude for the cooperation of the Chinese people. Mr. Holyoake also pointed out that Mr. Li had transported a large number of scientific instruments and books to our cultural institutions and universities during the war through the dangerous Hump route, and is still continuing to do so. Then Mr. Pan Gongzhan addressed the meeting, saying: "The first thing to do in international cultural cooperation is international news cooperation. To achieve lasting world peace, it is necessary to deeply understand each other and seek to eliminate barriers. In this great war, China and Britain have been the two countries that have fought for the longest time, made the greatest sacrifices, and taken the greatest risks. After this history of shared adversity, coupled with the arrival of Ambassador Stevenson in China, the relations between the two countries will become closer. However, if we want to achieve thorough understanding between the two countries, the news circles of both countries have a great responsibility. Some past international misunderstandings and distorted and inaccurate reports should be held accountable. Therefore, how journalists cooperate in the future and how to increase mutual understanding between countries should be an urgent matter." Mr. Pan also pointed out that when Allied personnel collect news materials and political opinions from all walks of life, they should consider whether the news is accurate and whether the opinions can represent the majority of the Chinese people. Mr. Pan added: "British friends should especially understand that China is still in a transitional period and has not yet reached the democratic politics that Britain has in its history. We are learning, sincerely and earnestly learning. Unfortunately, after the war, various ideas have emerged at once. When British journalists report on the situation in China to their government and people, they hope to recognize the source of information and respect the opinions of the majority of the people in order to avoid increasing political friction in China." Mr. MacDonald immediately expressed his deep agreement. Subsequently, Mr. Li Shizeng accompanied them to visit the Shanghai branch of the World Society and the Biological Research Institute before the meeting adjourned.

### Report on Rong Case Cracking by Garrison Headquarters; "Mental Torture" Method Used During Interrogation of Main Culprit Luo Wenqing

[Our Report] The entire process of investigation and cracking of the Rong Desheng kidnapping case has been personally written into a report by Mr. Tao Yishan, director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters. The internal staff of the department were mobilized and worked for three days and nights to complete the compilation. After it was submitted to Commander Xuan for review, it was publicly released to the press yesterday afternoon. Mr. Tao, carrying a thick investigative report of more than an inch, entered the reception room where reporters were gathered with a smile. He first gave a general explanation of the cracking process of the case, saying that the rapid cracking of the case was due to the active effort to take the lead and the close cooperation between the military and police agencies. During the process, the principles of impartiality and confidentiality were strictly observed, and no torture was used on the arrested criminals. Mr. Tao cited an example: the habitual bandit Luo Wenqing was interrogated 15 times, but there was no truthful confession. Finally, the "mental torture" method was used. Fifteen people were assigned to continuously interrogate him for 48 hours, which eventually made Luo confess everything. It can also be said that Luo's kidnapping of Rong made it a reality. According to Luo, he had committed more than 20 crimes before and was known as "Uncle Ye." The other accomplices in this case were initially wary, but were persuaded by Yuan Zhongshu, who said: "If you work with Uncle Luo, you will never fail." The criminals then boldly colluded and took action. Currently, 15 major criminals in the case have been transferred to the military court to begin trial. Yuan Zhengfei, Zhong Boyuan, Xiong Yonghe, and Pan Jinlong have also been temporarily transferred to the military court, but it is learned that they are not significantly related to this case. The details of the case are recorded below:

Kidnapping Process

At about 8 a.m. on May 25, Luo Wenqing, Zhang Shaoqing, Huang Ahu, and others took a car No. 15044 borrowed by Wu Zhigang at the intersection of Huacheng Road and Minguo Road (Wu's car was borrowed from Wang Gongxia, the deputy director of the headquarters adjutant's office), driven by Wu's driver Zhu Liansheng, and drove to the intersection of Ga'en Road and Meinini Road to park. Luo and others got out of the car and waited. When Rong's car drove out, Zhang Shaoxiang stepped forward to stop it, forbidding any noise. Huang Ahu showed a forged red arrest warrant, falsely claiming that a certain agency wanted to invite him for a talk. Luo Wenqing got into the car, took Rong down, forcibly dragged him into car No. 15044, and passed Beichang Road, turning through the Van Hoàng Ferry Station, Zhongshan Road, to the intersection near the Water and Electricity Company on Zhabei Water and Electricity Road to park. Huang A was waiting there. Luo and others took the hostage off the car. Luo Wenqing, Zhang Shaoqing, and Huang Aba carried Rong to Xiaobangbian, and carried him on a prepared civilian boat. Luo and Zhang Shaoqing immediately took a rickshaw back. Huang Aba was responsible for the hostage. The car was driven back by Song Liansheng. Liu and Huang took rickshaws along small roads back to Shanghai.

Hostage Location

The hostage Rong was held by Luo Wenqing, Zhang Shaoqing, Huang Abao and others in a civilian boat hired in advance by a Xiaobangbian, the owner of the boat Xi Achuan, the ticket keeper is A Mao, (feared to be fabricated by Luo Wenqing, this name is being strictly pursued) Luo Weiquan, Huang Abao and Huang's concubine Zhang Wuyue, at six or seven o'clock the next afternoon, Luo Wenqing took Wu Zhigang's car, still driven by Zhu Liansheng, got off at the Mei Village of Route Dufour, waited until eight or nine o'clock, and drove to the Water and Electricity Company on Zhongshan Road, and put a person in blue cloth and an old fat man (Rong) into the car, stopped at the bridge in Caojiadu, Luo and others changed the hostage to a rickshaw and moved him to Huang Abao's house at No. 100, Old Public Benefit Lane, Caojiadu, Yuan then took the car to the Great World.

Contact Situation

1. Telephone: Luo Wenqing invited Zheng Liantang to contact Wu Kunsheng, the manager of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, by telephone to negotiate the ransom. Later, Wu discovered that the telephone was being monitored and warned him to stop the contact. Zheng then found the telephone number of Chen Pinsan, the deputy manager of Shenxin No. 9 Factory, in the telephone directory, and called Chen to continue the negotiation. Zheng made more than ten telephone calls before and after. 2. Letters: The bandits forced the hostage to write two handwritten letters to his family. The method of delivery was that Luo Wenqing hid the letters under the washbasin in the public toilet of the Xiang Sheng Hotel, and then called Chen Pinsan to tell him to take them away. On May 15, the bandits believed that the victim's side had failed to resolve the matter quickly, so they wrote an anonymous threatening letter and sent it by post to Zhan Rongpei, doing their best to threaten him. 3. Posters: The bandits found it difficult to talk by telephone and it was inconvenient to talk too much, so they used red paper to summon the lease and posted it on the wall of Chengshun Pawnshop on the west side of Jing'an Temple on May 23. A small paper was hidden on the back of the poster, indicating the route for payment. On the 24th, it was posted on the wall of the Nanjing Grand Theater. The small paper on the back indicated that the contact would be made in Room 316 of the Shenzhou Hotel.

Before and After the Ransom

The bandits initially demanded US$1 million for the ransom, but eventually reduced it to US$500,000. Yuan Zhongshu invited Wu Zhigang and Zhan Rongpei, the manager of Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 Factory, to handle the payment. Wu was a graduate of Fudan University and is currently the manager of China University Enterprise Company. He has a good relationship with Zhan. Zhan has a reputation and is a close friend of Rong's and has a good reputation, so Wu represented the bandits and Zhan represented Rong to negotiate the ransom payment procedures. After several negotiations, at 9 a.m. on May 27, in Room 8 of the Labor Hospital, Wu put the US$500,000 in gold hidden by the hostage Rong Desheng into a leather suitcase. After locking it, he went to his mother-in-law's house at No. 54 Kangle Village, Fuxu Road. After Wu received the suitcase, he secretly opened it and took out US$100,000, wrapped it in cloth, kept US$400,000 in the suitcase, relocked it, and sent the original suitcase to Yuan Zhongshu's place at Nanyang Bridge in a car. Yuan then took the suitcase to Chen Luo's (Luo Wenqing's sister) house at No. 548 Minguo Road. Luo Wenqing and Huang Abao were waiting there. After the ransom was paid, at about 10 p.m. on the same day, Luo Wenqing and Zhang Shaoqing still used Wu Zhigang's car and his driver Zhu Liansheng to send the hostage to the intersection of Fuchai Road and Tifei Road to get off. Luo Wenqing hired a tricycle to send him back to Rong's son-in-law Tang Nengyuan's house on Meinini Road. Therefore, Rong Desheng, who had been kidnapped for more than a month, was released after paying a price of 500,000 US dollars.

### Liang Hongzhi Was Summoned Yesterday; Mistakenly Thought to Be Executed; Had a Hearty Meal and Dressed Up Before Departure; Face Turned Pale and Covered in Cold Sweat

[Our Newspaper's Report] The arch-traitor Liang Hongzhi has been uneasy in prison ever since the High Court sentenced him to death. Yesterday, at a little after 10 o'clock, three court police officers suddenly arrived at the Zhongjian Prison carrying a summons to bring Liang in. Upon hearing this, Liang's face suddenly changed, and he said palely to the police officers: "Please wait a moment, let me eat my fill and dress properly before I go." After saying this, he turned around to eat and, after dressing properly, followed the astonished police officers out of the prison gate. However, the three medical examiners did not escort Liang to the execution ground but to the court, because the High Procuratorate's office was investigating a certain case that involved Liang, so he was specifically brought from prison for questioning. This false alarm caused Liang to be covered in cold sweat.

It is now learned that the Higher Court of this city is only waiting for the Supreme Court to confirm the review, and upon receiving the order, the execution can be carried out within the Shanghai Prison. Therefore, Liang's death is not far off. However, his family is currently filing a petition for reconsideration.

### A Pharmacy Apprentice Became Blinded by Greed; Used Bleach to Remove the Endorsement on a Check; Fraudulently Cashed a Huge Sum and Fled Far Away; Enjoyed a Carefree Life by Riding Horses at the Six Bridges and Three Temples; Was Eventually Apprehended in Shanghai After Purchasing a Fine Horse

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the morning of the 26th of last month, at 11 o'clock, Xie Hanzhang (40 years old, from Ningbo), the manager of Tongfeng Pharmacy at No. 14 Hengyuan Lane, Tianjin Road, instructed the apprentice Li Yucheng (18 years old, from Ningbo) to deposit a cashier's check from the Asia Bank with a face value of 30 million yuan (check number 33124) into Huichang Qianzhuang. Unexpectedly, the apprentice became greedy and secretly bought bleach, first removing the endorsement, and then, together with his friend Zhang Qiyin (18 years old, from Sichuan, residing at No. 14, Lane 179, Tianjin Road), went to the Asia Bank to cash it. The bank clerk was momentarily negligent and did not distinguish between genuine and counterfeit, paying the full amount. After receiving the money, Li and Zhang took a pedicab to another friend, Qiu Minxing (18 years old, from Zhejiang, residing on North Xiangyang Road), to store it. They also arranged to go out for lunch together. After lunch, they took the money to buy two leather suitcases, over 20 taels of gold, a small gold ingot, and three gold rings. Returning to Qiu's place, they put 19,665,000 yuan into the suitcases, asking Zhang and Qiu to keep them safe, saying that he was going to Hangzhou to purchase medicinal materials and carrying so much money on the road was inconvenient, and he would need them to remit the money when he needed it in Hangzhou. Then, he hurriedly took his leave with the remaining amount of about 6 million yuan and the gold in another suitcase. By this time, it was nearly 5 p.m. Zhang and Qiu, because of their close friendship with him, insisted on seeing him off, so they hired a pedicab to escort him to the West Shanghai Station to board the train. When Zhang and Qiu returned home, the manager of Tongfeng, because Li Yucheng had been gone for a long time and had not returned, was deeply concerned about an accident, so he telegraphed Huichang Qianzhuang to inquire. The bank told him that no check had been deposited today, so he knew something was wrong. He hurried to Asia Bank to inquire and learned that someone had cashed it. He immediately pursued the guarantor Xu Wenxin and reported to the Huangpu Branch for investigation. At the same time, Qiu Minxing's parents also discovered the suitcase full of banknotes and knew there must be a reason, so they took their son to the Huangpu Branch to report and await investigation. Therefore, they coincided without prior arrangement, and the huge sum was first recovered. The Judicial Section Chief Zhou Guanghui then dispatched members Tie Jian and Zhao Haiming, and police chief Wang Shufan to Hangzhou to investigate. They learned that Li Yucheng had arrived in Hangzhou and was staying at No. 37 Hubin Hotel, enjoying a carefree life amidst the scenery of West Lake. Because he liked horse riding, he spent his days riding horses at the Six Bridges and Three Temples, and told the groom that he wanted to buy a fine horse for commuting to school in the future. The groom, Sun Xingguo, saw him.

His extravagant behavior made him think he was a wealthy young master from Shanghai, so he introduced the horse trader Wu Shixian to find one for him. Because there were no good breeds in Hangzhou, they agreed to come to Shanghai yesterday. After the police detectives learned of this, they once again tracked him to Shanghai and arrested the three men in room 311 of the Jinshan Hotel on Sanma Road at 4 p.m. yesterday, and seized more than 100,000 yuan and 7 taels of gold. According to Li's confession: there was still more than 1 million yuan and 11 taels of gold in Hangzhou, and the rest had been spent. The First Police Bureau immediately summoned Xie Zhang and guarantor Xu Wenxin to the bureau for interrogation.

Not only blind children, but also deaf and blind students study there. They rely on the meaning of words and different vibrations to learn. At first, there was electrical equipment to help, but later, just by placing their fingers on the other person's face, they could know the meaning of everything. The phonetic method of learning is completely abandoned.

The students at Perkins School for the Blind come from the United States and 19 other countries, including China. Many graduates have returned home and have also opened schools of the same nature, and China now has one. (Translated from a US News Agency manuscript: The End)

### Using Proceeds from the Sale of Surplus Materials; Exchange Students to Study Abroad; Truman Recently Approved the Fulbright Act; Enhancing International Understanding and Cultural Exchange

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The United States recently established a long-term plan to enhance international understanding, as President Truman has approved a bill proposed by Senator Fulbright, authorizing the State Department to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of surplus materials overseas for student exchange and other educational activities. According to the provisions of this bill, up to $20 million can be provided to any country that provides US surplus materials for educational exchange work, and $1 million can be used annually in the aforementioned countries. The United States is currently conducting negotiations with several countries (including China) on this matter, but the amount spent can reach $3 million to $20 million. Fulbright stated that the main impact of the bill will be that in the next two or three decades, it will allow about 100,000 American students to study abroad. This bill uses the loan from the US for each country to purchase the value of surplus materials, so it cannot manage the expenses of international students from other countries. The bill also stipulates that the expenses for this activity must use foreign currency. Under these regulations, Chinese students can still receive scholarships at the various universities jointly run by American churches in China and at Yenching and Lingnan Universities. And students going to study in US universities can also get travel expenses from this bill.

[Another Report] The association has recently received numerous reports from members regarding the matter of the People's Political Council's accusation that He Dekui colluded with various schools to use false textbooks and that he is suspected of being a traitor. Many students in various schools have questioned why the government has maintained an ambiguous attitude towards this matter despite the ongoing investigations into false textbooks. Whether or not the association should express its opinion has reportedly been submitted to the Board of Directors for discussion, with the intention of requesting an explanation from the City Government.

### Ministry of Education Appoints Two Committee Members, Fang and Wu, to Supervise Sports in the Capital City - Propose Four Suggestions for Sports Facilities

### City Government Civil Affairs Office Convenes the Seventh District Administration Meeting Yesterday - Director Zhang Presides Over Discussion of Several Major Cases

The City Government Civil Affairs Office convened the seventh district administration meeting yesterday (the 3rd) at 9:00 AM in the City Government Auditorium. District chiefs, and heads of various offices and sections, were present. Director Zhang Xiaosong presided over the meeting. The chairman first reported on a letter from the Ministry of Interior requesting the establishment of district mediation committees and the implementation of production initiatives. He added that the number of public office candidates in the city was too small. Each district should encourage citizens to participate in qualification reviews, with the hope of having thirty to forty people per district in the urban areas and twenty to thirty people per district in the rural areas. He also added that proposals for the district administration meeting should not be submitted one or two days before the meeting, but can be submitted at any time so that there is time to print, distribute, and study them. Next, the 20th District reported on local public health matters, and the 11th District reported that the issue of office space for the district government had not been resolved for a long time and that the police station was urging them to move. The district hoped to be allocated space. Among the cases discussed, the most important were the recommendation of personnel for the autonomous organization and the responsible officials, the arrangement for veterans to solicit donations with the help of security personnel, the requests from various agencies and armies for assistance from the district office, and the registration of household registrations entering and leaving.

### Q&A on Household Registration Regulations (Continued)

(18) Question: What occupation should be listed for those who make a living by chopping firewood, carrying water, operating a ferry, slaughtering animals, providing pedicures, scrubbing backs, or doing laundry?

Answer: Those who chop firewood should be listed as "Agriculture," those who slaughter animals should be listed as "Commerce," those who carry water or operate a ferry should be listed as "Transportation," and all other categories should be listed as "Other Occupations."

(19) Question: What occupation should be listed for those who burn charcoal kilns, make and sell incense, or make a living by fortune-telling or geomancy?

Answer: Those who burn kilns should be listed as "Industry," those who make incense can also be listed as "Industry," and all other categories can be listed as "Unemployed."

(20) Question: What occupation should be listed for those who make a living by performing storytelling of the Great Drum?

Answer: The "Storytelling of the Great Drum" may be listed in the occupation column, and "Freelance" in the profession column.

### (2) Types of Household Registration

(22) Question: If several unrelated men have no family, jointly operate a business, live together in the same residence, and are listed as a household in the security district register, can they be listed as a family in the household register?

Answer: They may be listed as a family in accordance with Articles 8 and 9 of the Household Registration Law, and the manager's position is the same as that of the head of the household.

### Answer to the 24th District Office

The Civil Affairs Office has responded to the 24th District Office saying that the Executive Yuan's strict prohibition of concurrent employment for civil servants refers to civil servants in Agency A concurrently employed by Agency B. Since the duties are different, their energy and time are not allowed. Even some civil servants try to take on concurrent employment in order to increase their income, which leads to poor performance of their duties, so it has been repeatedly prohibited. Concurrent employment may be permitted in order to promote operational coordination and improve work efficiency as long as it does not harm the original duties. For example, the Central Government has explicitly stipulated that village chiefs may serve concurrently as principals of national schools and captains of national guard teams, for the purposes of integrating care, relief, and health in villages, which is one example of this. As for the staff of the District People's Representative Council, Article 19 of the Implementing Rules of the City Organization Law stipulates that they should be appointed by the District Chief from among the staff of the District Office. Therefore, the City Government's decision not to establish full-time staff for the District People's Representative Council and to have staff from the District Office serve concurrently due to limited funding is not inconsistent with central regulations. Whether or not to employ District People's Representative Council staff should be determined after ensuring sufficient funding.

### High Discount Rates and Large Expenses - Silk Factories and Brokers Share the Same Difficulties - The Inability to Export is the Current Fatal Flaw

[Our Report] In the midst of high-interest loans, silk reeling factories are uniquely able to obtain a loan of two million yuan from the Central Bank at a monthly interest rate of 1.8 percent to purchase silk cocoons. Furthermore, they are providing loans of one million yuan to silk reelers at the same interest rate. This is quite exceptional. However, according to surveys, of the hundred or so silk factories in three provinces and two cities, less than one-fifth have opened. In the city, which was once full of silk factories before the war, only Dali, Lianyuan, Daming, Hefeng, and four or five other factories remain open and are barely managing to operate. The situation is still extremely dire. According to industry insiders, although the government provides low-interest loans, the purchase price of silk cocoons is limited to 120,000 yuan per dan. Therefore, one dan of silk requires 2.4 million yuan for the silk cocoons alone. Adding in wages, factory fees, interest, etc., the cost exceeds one million yuan. As a result, the cost of silk is 3.4 million yuan per dan.

The Cost is Still Too Far From the Selling Price

The current market price in New York is 933 pounds of silk per pound for US dollars, equivalent to 1,200 US dollars per dan, or 2.4 million yuan. The shipping cost from the factory to the United States, the cost of labor, and insurance fees are not included. As such, exporting each dan of silk results in a loss of over 50 percent. Industry insiders dare not continue to do so. According to sources from the Silk Reeling Industry Association, the industry has enough spring cocoons to produce 20,000 dan of silk. However, because the cost is too high and exports are difficult, they must request export subsidies from the government in order to open factories. Moreover, authorities in the import and export industry said that silk is the focus of Chinese export goods. Before the war, exports could reach around 120,000 dan per year. Although various efforts have been made this year, only 8,000 to 9,000 dan have been obtained. They also say that the foreign trust in Chinese silk is still good.

The Chain System is Beneficial to Foreign Exchange

Currently, various parties advocate for a chain system for imports and exports. If this can be achieved, the export bill of exchange for 120,000 dan of silk can obtain foreign exchange positions of tens of thousands of US dollars. The government should take a holistic approach and provide support. In the midst of the silk reeling industry’s decline, silk weaving factories and silk brokers are also suffering difficulties. According to sources from the Silk Weaving Factory Association, there are currently 5,600 weaving machines in the city. However, due to sluggish sales of silk fabrics, the labor-management friction has not recovered in recent months. Only a few factories are operating. Furthermore, according to sources from the silk and satin sales industry, sales are weak and capital is too heavy. Under high-interest exploitation, the industry will have no way to survive. Several businesses have already been stranded or suspended operations in recent days. However, the root cause was present from an early stage, and it is difficult to remedy it for a time. It is said that before the war, each piece of stored silk had a principal of 40 yuan. Counting the monthly interest rate of one cent, the interest was 4 jiao.

Interest Rates Are Too High - The Silk Industry Has No Way to Survive

Now, each piece is under pressure, with a principal of 30 yuan and a shortage. Those who are short of money have to borrow. The market interest rate is 1.5 cents per month, and interest of 45,000 yuan should be paid. That is, the price of goods has increased by slightly less than 8,000 times, while the interest has increased by 100,000 times. According to the Silk Broker Association, there are currently 130 to 140 members, including silk floss sellers. About 30 to 40 of them are larger in scale, and dozens of others are brokers with very little capital and sluggish business, who cannot afford various donations and taxes.

Silk Brokers Are Too Painful - Seeking Assistance From the Chamber of Commerce

They have asked the Chamber of Commerce for assistance. According to sources familiar with the matter, the main business of silk brokers has always been to provide loans to small silk reeling factories and to sell their exports. Now that exports are weak and silk factories are failing, the difficulties of the industry can be imagined. As for the industry's request for assistance from the City Chamber of Commerce, sources from the Chamber of Commerce have revealed that many industries have become brokers out of necessity, and relief should be given in terms of donations and taxes.

Stable Bond Market

Yesterday, only Class A bonds saw stability due to outside idle funds being absorbed by a foreign firm. Class C bonds had eight sales and fell slightly. Class D and E bonds were stable. In the early morning, Class A and B bonds were at 420 yuan, and Class C bonds fell from 740 yuan to 700 yuan. Class E bonds were slightly thinner after opening. Near noon, only Class A and B bonds rebounded to over 450 yuan before closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds each rose by 20 yuan, Class C bonds fell by 20 yuan, and Class D and E bonds were unchanged.

### American Cotton Will Rise

Observations from the American Cotton Industry

[Reuters, New Orleans, 3rd] According to many people, the price of cotton will soon increase to 40 to 50 cents per pound, because the control has been canceled and the official price of 35 cents per pound is no longer valid. Agriculture Director McNutt also said that it may soar to 50 cents per pound in the coming months, while Georgia Agriculture Director Linte said that 50 cents per pound is still quite cheap.

### Gold and Paper Money Change Very Little

Stable prices with limited changes, limited trading, and little transactions. The morning opening price hovered around 1.885 million. News reported that gold was flowing into China, and there was a slight supply after opening at 1.888 million. The central government distributed 55 bars at a price of 1.885 million. After 10:00 AM, there was a slight downstream decrease to 1.878 million, after which it stabilized. At noon, it stood above 1.88 million. The afternoon situation was more stable, around 1.885 million. As a result, it rose slightly by 3,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver coins were all stable. The black market exchange rate was between 1 jiao and 1.2 jiao.

Foreign currency US dollars were even more mediocre. The opening price was 2,500 yuan, and after opening, the supply and demand were scattered, with no special changes and a very narrow range of fluctuations. The gold market was downstream, falling from 2,510 yuan to around 2,490 yuan, after which it stabilized slightly. At noon, it was struggling around 2,495 yuan. In the afternoon, due to it being Saturday, it was stable. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also mediocre. There were not many chips on the market, and the result was stable.

### Before the Official Lifting of the Ban: A Discussion on Exceptional Export of Yarn and Cloth; Substantial Quantities Already Granted Special Permission by the Authorities

[Our Report] News has emerged from yarn and cloth circles close to the Textile Reconstruction Company (紡建公司) that the company has recently obtained special permission from Premier Song of the Executive Yuan to ship a substantial amount of cotton textiles to Southeast Asia. It is said that since the government promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade" on March 1st of this year, cotton yarn and cloth have been listed as prohibited export items, with the provision that shipments approved by the government could still be inspected and released by customs, although this was not clearly defined. Therefore, this export is expected to materialize in the near future. The person in charge of the Textile Reconstruction Company stated that they will still apply for the government to formally lift the ban to compete for overseas markets. Authorities in the private cotton textile industry believe that current exchange rates are unfavorable, and yarn mills are suffering from high interest rates. The manufacturing industry cannot compete with foreign goods. The government must abandon its high yarn price policy to allow private industries to follow the government's lead and compete for overseas markets. Reports on whether yarn and cloth exports will be unbanned vary. This news was obtained from reliable sources and is therefore reported.

### Limited Inquiries from Trade Guilds; Yarn Prices Stop Falling and Stabilize

Yesterday, the yarn market showed signs of improvement. The Guangdong (廣帮) trade guild made inquiries about large-scale yarns such as "Double Horse" (雙馬) and "Surplus Chicken" (余鷄), while the central and small-scale guilds also had merchants from Beijing inquiring and purchasing. Transactions were not stagnant, and the price of 20-count yarn stopped falling and stabilized. However, the sales of fine yarn were limited and showed no improvement. People's minds remained calm, and they are waiting for the autumn sales to begin.

Yesterday, New York cotton futures rose 20 to 29 points. The near-term U.S. dollar price was $33.95, the new crop forward price was $31.09, and the Middling spot price was $34.78. Local raw cotton transactions were reduced due to the Saturday closure. The Textile Reconstruction Company and private yarn mills remained in a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in few transactions.

Biji (嗶嘰) leaders, after being sluggish for many days, showed some signs of upward movement, but actual transactions remained scarce. Therefore, other cloth prices remained lifeless. At noon, the Textile Reconstruction Company's opening price was similar to the previous period, with Biji still at 52,000 yuan and Dragon Head (龍頭) at 55,000 yuan, but the number of buyers decreased daily.

### Few Transactions by Major Players; Broad Decline in Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks were mediocre and weak. The Yong Yarn (永紗) market showed signs of weakening, lacking momentum to rise and eventually declining. The Mei Ya (美亞) market remained relatively stable, with limited fluctuations. The "Three Small Hot" (三小熱) stocks fell from high to low and continued to be sluggish. The movements of various stocks were uneven, with some entering and exiting along the way. Transactions in unpopular stocks were even quieter, with no one driving the market. Market sentiment was depressed, with a slight decline. Major players' entries and exits were scattered, indicating a break. The initial high prices were 713 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,880 yuan for Mei Ya, 245 yuan for Jingfu (景福), 245 yuan for Xin Guang (新光), and 178 yuan for Qin Yu (勤與). The near-noon low prices were 680 yuan for Yong Yarn, 3,700 yuan for Mei Ya, 232 yuan for Jingfu, 225 yuan for Xin Guang, and 165 yuan for Qin Yu. As a result, Yong Yarn fell 19 yuan compared to the previous close, Mei Ya fell 100 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot" (景福·新光·勤典) stocks each declined slightly. Smaller and medium-sized stocks also saw small declines, and veteran stocks were also slightly weaker.

Foreign stocks fluctuated at low prices, lacking the impetus to rise. Yi Yarn (怡紗) rose slightly in the middle of the session but failed to surpass the previous closing price. Many investors sold off, resulting in a slight decline. Yi Beer (怡啤) fell too much and showed some stability. Xiangtai Timber (祥泰木行) at 4,000 yuan and Ken Zhi (墾植) at 2,500 yuan both had transactions. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yi Beer rose slightly, while Yi Yarn, British Federation (英聯), Jardine Matheson (會德豐), Asia, and Paper all suffered small declines. Ye Guang Iron and Steel (業廣鋼業) decreased by half a percent.

### Qingdao Tobacco Leaves Shipped to Shanghai in Batches; Distributed Equally Among Cigarette Factories

Recently, foreign goods have flooded Shanghai's commodity markets, severely impacting national industries. Taking cigarettes as an example, American cigarettes, with their attractive packaging and low cost, sell well in the market. Domestic manufacturers, due to high labor costs and lack of raw materials, cannot compete. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau (蘇浙皖敵偽產業處理局) has been actively shipping enemy tobacco leaves received in Qingdao to Shanghai in batches, entrusting the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over the China Tobacco Company (中華烟草公司) and gradually distribute them to cigarette manufacturers in Shanghai. The principle is to distribute them only to manufacturers registered with the Goods Tax Bureau. The distribution method is to first notify the Cigarette Industry Association (捲烟業同業公會) to inform cigarette factories in the city to fill out applications for purchase based on their actual needs. Then, the allocation is made based on the percentage of the requested amount to the total amount of tobacco leaves available for shipment to Shanghai. For each allocation, manufacturers are invited to view samples, and they are notified to pay at a designated bank according to the price assessed by the Management Bureau. Then, they can exchange the payment slip stub for a warehouse receipt from the China Tobacco Company to take delivery of the goods. Since the beginning, three distributions have been made, totaling about 10,000 barrels. There are more than 10,000 barrels still being shipped to Shanghai and are being actively processed. They will be distributed in batches, ensuring that all applicant manufacturers obtain sufficient raw materials. However, those who abandon their purchase halfway will have their qualification for continued purchase revoked.

### Green Tea Begins Export to America; Strong Interest in Reserved Tonnage

750 Cases Loaded Today

The SS "Steadway" (史帝威) sailing to New York from Shanghai this afternoon loaded 750 cases of silk and tea from Wu Chang Company (午昌公司), weighing 64,000 pounds. All of it is local Anhui product, named "Xi Chun Huang Xi" (熙春黃熙). In the past, Chinese tea exports to America were mostly black tea. Since the Allied forces came to China to participate in the war, they have increased their interest in silk and tea. After repatriation, they adopted the habit of drinking green tea during conversations, transforming it into a household name. Therefore, this export of the above two types of green tea is a post-war first. The selling price is $0.42 per pound, which is a favorable price. It is also known that the SS "Bali" (拜里) sailing to England on the 20th, stopping at various places along the way, are mostly areas that love to drink Chinese tea. Various Chinese and foreign tea merchants in the city have been actively reserving tonnage in recent days. The total is estimated to be over 4,500 cases. At that time, Jardine Matheson, Concord (協和), Wu Chang, Wang Yu Tai (汪裕泰), Xin Hua (新華), and China Tea Company (華茶公司) also plan to rush to load 800 cases of black tea to England.

### 152 Firms Join the Silver and Money Industry Preparatory Committee; National Banks May Also Join

[Our Report] A person in charge of the preparatory office of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Preparatory Committee (銀錢業聯合準備會籌備處) told reporters yesterday that the office has issued 172 letters inviting various firms and trust companies to join the committee. Currently, 152 companies have responded and joined. The Bank of China (中國), the Bank of Communications (交通), the Farmers Bank of China (中國農民), as well as the China Trust Bureau (中信) and the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau (郵匯), have not been invited due to their status as national banks. However, according to the past practices of the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee, there is a high possibility that these banks will participate. Although the date for the inaugural meeting has not been determined, it is hoped that it can be established soon. It was also mentioned that after the establishment of the committee, interbank lending will only be used as a temporary adjustment when truly necessary, and it will not be able to provide operating funds to the general industry on a regular basis. It is hoped that all firms will strive for stability in the management of their own business.

### Stagnant Rice Market; Increased Supply of Edible Oil

The supply and demand for soybean cake were both scarce, and the market was flat.

### Fujian and Guangdong Sugar Continue to Rise

Yesterday, due to the lack of Shantou (汕) shipments, the Chaoqing (潮靑) brands of sugar were scarce, leading to higher prices. The guild initially set a premium of 92,000 yuan.

Various other brands of goods also declined by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and transactions were scarce. Factory direct sales showed limited transactions, and the selling price was not good. 81-point C-grade high-uniformity rayon was priced at 2,200,000 yuan for immediate payment, and 78-point high-uniformity rayon was priced at 2,100,000 yuan. There were transactions with Indian merchants through foreign firms, priced at 1,500,000 to 1,550,000 yuan. The opening price was 1,300,000 yuan, but few inquired. The silk market was quiet, and prices did not fluctuate much.

### Lushan: The Birthplace of National Reconstruction

— Special Correspondent Fang Canglang from Guling on the 30th

If the sight and hearing are not exhausted, how can the universe be vast? The river water is as thin as weaving, and Pengcheng is smaller than the palm of your hand. Why should I be so trifling, unable to escape the dust? Returning, I think of self-pity, lowering my head and entering the ant's soil.

— Bai Juyi Climbing Xianglu Peak —

The great citizens of the Republic of China, one of the four powers, are unfortunate that a few "red heroes" who are keen on private struggles have unrestrained ambitions, causing the government to be overwhelmed, the soldiers to be exhausted, the people not knowing where to die, and foreigners shaking their heads and sighing. Thinking about it, it's truly the most unlucky. In this day and age, the whips of life and the days of distress have truly disturbed our 450 million great citizens to the point of "not knowing tomorrow" and "not caring about cold or heat." Therefore, to this day, the number of people who have truly come to Lushan to escape the summer heat is still less than 200. According to the report of Wu Shih-han, Director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, the population of the entire mountain has now reached over 14,000, an increase of five times compared to the September survey of over 2,000 people. However, according to the recent classified statistics of the increased population, it is approximately (1) over 4,000 local residents returning home, (2) 3,000 civil servants (including summer camp staff and trainees), (3) 1,000 seasonal vendors, (4) approximately 1,000 military, police, and constabulary, (5) 3,000 laborers, (6) 100 journalists (including employees of the Lushan editions of the Central Daily News and the China Daily News, as well as correspondents stationed in Guling from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Jiangxi, and other provinces), and (7) approximately 200 dependents of public school personnel and outside summer visitors. From the above statistics, it can be seen that the number of summer visitors to Lushan this year is small, compared to the annual average of approximately 30,000 people per month before the War of Resistance against Japan, with an average of 10,000 people entering the mountain each month, the difference is very large. At a time when other places are suffering from intense heat and Lushan is uniquely cool, the fact that people with money and leisure do not come to Lushan to escape the summer heat shows that today, the heartstrings of people with money are tense, and all living beings have become ants on a hot pan. This phenomenon is noteworthy.

However, precisely because there are few summer visitors and more people sweating, Lushan this year appears even more pure, beautiful, upright, and majestic. Those who remember the history of Lushan nine years ago seem to have a premonition that Lushan this year may again cast a new page in the history of our country. Thus, a large group of reporters followed our Head of State, as well as Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, to Lushan.

A Piece of Incense to Pray for Peace

Readers of newspapers, editors of travel magazines, and travelers who appreciate mountains and rivers can all recite the scenery and spirit of Mount Lu, so we do not need to flaunt our elegance or pretend to be erudite to waste paper. If we are not blind, we should represent those poor people and express the pain deep in our hearts to the mountain spirit. Now, the good people of China, as well as people around the world who sympathize with China, have focused their attention on Lushan in Jiangxi, the land of integrity. Especially those tens of millions of refugees who fled the difficulties of victory, they are homeless, without clothes or food, without anything to show respect to the "red heroes." They can only offer a piece of incense from their remaining piety to our Head of State Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the respectable and lovable Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. They unanimously pray to Heaven, hoping that in this solemn and pure summer capital of China, some good news can be issued. Even if they are given a single word, a single "peace" or "war," they will laugh with tears in their eyes. But do not "delay," absolutely do not "delay," because if this awkward situation is dragged on, everyone will be dragged to death. They are now dreaming and waiting, they are waiting for the day when a decisive message will be issued from the heights of Guling, regardless of "war" or "peace," regardless of "good" or "bad," they only ask that the country be safe.

The Yuanrong Naturally Has a Plan for National Affairs

Our Head of State Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Special Envoy Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart have already seen the pitiful plight of these war-victorious refugees clearly in various Chinese and foreign newspapers and cannot help but feel sad. However, the Chinese Communist Party issue that has caused millions of refugees is not just a matter of whether the lives and property of millions of people are guaranteed, but a matter of the safety and survival of the entire Chinese nation, and can also be said to be a major issue of whether the entire world can achieve lasting peace from now on. Moreover, this issue is quite complex. Dealing with such a major issue is very different from deploying a war and marching towards a victorious goal. Moreover, inside this issue, in addition to "military," "political," "economic," and "transportation," there are also "others." Therefore, in order to gain more ample time for thinking, and to use some calm and meticulous minds to study this complex, abrupt, and volatile Chinese Communist Party issue, and at the same time to hope that during the period of dealing with this abnormal issue, it will not affect the normal military and political plans, decisions, and strategies. Therefore, all people with conscience in China unanimously recognize that our Head of State Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Lushan this time is nothing less than a symbol of the bright future of the country. Because everyone knows that during the War of Resistance against Japan, in order to lead the people of the whole country towards the overall goal of winning the war, he could preside over three Supreme Staff Meetings every day, even during the emergency time of military affairs, and even each meeting lasted for three hours. However, purely military issues are quite different from a complex political issue. Dealing with this issue also requires an absolutely vigorous working spirit and a longer working time. It is no wonder that when journalists saw the healthy complexion of the Chairman, everyone said that there was a solution.

Waiting to See the Surrender Document Presented on a Famous Mountain

Now, up to today, Chairman Chiang has spent two weekends in Lushan. Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have returned to Guling the day before yesterday. Whether the door to peace talks can be opened in the shortest period of time depends on this week. Although no news has been revealed, it seems that for the health of Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, it cannot be delayed any longer. People in Lushan say: Marshal Marshall is already thin, and Stuart is sick (The Ambassador is suffering from a stomach cold today, causing our people to shed tears). Alas, the two old men have suffered enough from this distressing issue. Moreover, at a time when the whole country is angrily calling for "The CCP must withdraw from Subei and Jiaodong, and traffic must be restored," it is indeed like reaching a final turning point.

If history needs to be replayed, this Lushan is the birthplace of the New China. To put it briefly, this famous mountain has decided the great plan for saving the country and the people. The first time, it decided the great plan for suppressing the rebellion. The second time, it decided the great plan for resisting the War of Resistance against Japan. The third time, it decided the great plan for blockading the Madang Estuary to control the bandits. Now, if it is decided again, it will be the fourth time. What we hope for is the great plan for national reconstruction. Our wise Head of State is tirelessly planning. It is said that all plans are for national reconstruction, not for suppressing the rebellion, but it still awaits the final choice of the CCP. If history really needs to be replayed, then the last sentence of Luo Jialun's Lushan Song, "Lushan Prepares to Build the Surrender Platform," will be considered by us to be a good phrase that is beneficial to the political life of the CCP. Please take the Subei battle situation as proof. Force does not seem to be a good way to help a political party. Why play with the fate of the country, devastate the people, and drill into a dead end? The above subjective statements and opinions are all the voices of the people passed down from a group of old Lushan people. Because the reporter, as a mountain resident of Lushan, believes that the mountain residents' understanding of national affairs has valuable historical experience, so he wrote it out, and at the same time, it can also explain that there is no news in Lushan now, Lushan is still waiting, and at this moment, the twenty-odd journalists flying all over Guling Street in Lushan are wasting the valuable money given by the newspaper office to wait for important news.

### On the Way Out of China's Political Situation

— Jiang Junzhang

(1) Depression and Contradiction

The political situation in our China, as it stands today, can be said to have reached the extreme of depression and the extreme of contradiction. Everyone knows that China needs peace, needs unification, and even more so, needs reconstruction, and that the people need to recuperate and thrive. However, almost a year has passed since the victory, has peace been realized? Has unification succeeded? Because these two basic conditions have not been met, the nation's reconstruction and the people's recovery are naturally out of the question. This atmosphere is truly depressing; this phenomenon is truly puzzling.

Since the recapture of Changchun, peace talks have resumed, and the negotiation period has been limited to fifteen days. This news gave us immense hope and comfort. But after fifteen days of unsuccessful negotiations, another eight days were added. After eight days of unsuccessful negotiations, it was followed by an indefinite delay. During this period of delay, the smell of gunpowder spread across the plains of the Huai and Yellow Rivers. Thus, there are so-called organizations striving for peace and organizations against internal strife. Regardless of how different their signs are, the great trend of peace and unification is obvious. Even the most ardent warmongers have to hide behind the grand banner of peace, chanting peace while engaging in sabotage. Therefore, this has increased the current contradictions, but it has made those of us who long for peace even more worried.

Such clever propaganda is easily poisonous to our intellectuals who are only enthusiastic but lack the experience to discern, especially the youth. Just like the spread of germs causing disease, intellectuals with only enthusiasm are like people with weak resistance, and there is a great danger of being innocently harmed. "Epidemic prevention" is an important task. In this depressing and contradictory political situation, pointing out pathways that benefit the country, providing reference for our intellectuals to determine their position, and avoiding being poisoned by propaganda, so as not to mislead the country, is of course also an important task. The author wishes to present the following few opinions based on personal objective observation:

(2) Seeing Clearly the Possible Outcomes

Regarding the current political situation in China, the future evolution will be nothing more than the following five:

(1) Maintaining the status quo of the past year, that is, the so-called talking and fighting, fighting and talking situation, or a situation of talking and fighting simultaneously. That is to say, the problem will never be resolved, the deadlock will never be broken, and finally, the doomsday of national destruction and family ruin will arrive.

(2) Striving to create an ideal situation, which is the grand principle of peaceful unification, and the specific methods are nationalization of the military and democratization of politics. That is to say, the military and territory belonging to political parties or individuals should be handed over to the state to establish a national defense force without party affiliation. At the same time, all political parties should have equal status and be free to participate in political activities, provided that social order and national interests are not hindered. The urgent task at present is to create a constitution suitable for the country in an environment of peaceful unification, so as to organize a national assembly and produce a formal government. Before the constitution is produced, all parties should participate in government work to gather ideas and benefit from diverse perspectives.

(3) Recognizing the existing situation of the Chinese Communist Party, or the government and the Communist Party making some exchanges, transforming the areas where the CCP and the government are intertwined into two neat and distinct parts with clear boundaries. That is to say, dividing China into two, turning it into a China practicing the Three Principles of the People and a China practicing communism, and from then on, China would be formally divided into two countries.

(4) The Communist Party using its power to overthrow the government by force to create a Soviet China.

(5) The government using its power to defeat or resolve all the military forces of the CCP by force to unify the country.

In addition, there are two absolutely impossible outcomes, namely, the Kuomintang handing over its existing political power to the Communist Party, or the Communist Party unconditionally handing over its existing local political power to the National Government. These two methods were originally the simplest and most effective, but in reality, they are almost impossible. Because the motivation for the establishment of a political party is to seize political power. The Kuomintang is the largest party in the country. It has fought for sixty years, overthrown the Manchu Qing dynasty, and defeated the warlords. This time, it led the nation in a bitter eight-year war to defeat Japanese imperialism. The National Government is an internationally recognized government, and most of the country is under the direct rule of the National Government. It has the responsibility to restore order and revive the nation. How is it possible for us to expect such a political party to hand over the political power it has struggled for and abandon its responsibility to serve the country? Similarly, the Communist Party, from the Xiang River Uprising to the "Long March of 25,000 Li," also has a history of several decades. In the past, it did not have a single soldier or a single piece of territory. It still wanted to riot and seize political power. Now, it is said that it has territory in more than 300 counties, an army of nearly one million, and more than a million so-called security forces or militia. Will it hand over these hard-earned things? This is also an incredible miracle.

The above five possible outcomes can be summarized into four characters: "division, unity, governance, and chaos." The first possible outcome and the third possible outcome are phenomena of "division" and trends of chaos. The fourth and fifth outcomes must first go through a stage of war before national unification can be achieved. Only the second outcome can achieve national unification and people's recuperation without war, hence it is called the ideal situation. The creation of this ideal situation originally requires negotiation, but negotiation requires both parties to have the sincerity to solve the problem. If one party is sincere, while the other party only has the intention of exploiting, and only regards it as a means of gaining time and space, then problems within problems and complications beyond complications will inevitably arise, and a conclusion will never be reached. Even if there is a conclusion, it will only be a meaningless document that is difficult to implement. Such negotiations can only produce the first outcome and can never produce the second outcome; and most unfortunately, the past negotiations have been such negotiations.

(3) Finding the Root Cause

The failure of negotiations is because one party does not have the sincerity to solve the problem. Then, which party lacks sincerity? It is very clear that the government must hope to solve the problem to stabilize society, build the country, and thereby ensure the fruitful results of the victory against Japan, and leave the question of which party will hold future political power to the people of the whole country after the constitution is formulated. However, the Chinese Communist Party is a party that believes in armed rebellion to seize political power. In the recent negotiations, the failure to implement the unified compilation of Communist Party troops and the inability to resolve the issue of stationed areas are the main reasons why the deadlock cannot be broken, and the reason why it has become a deadlock is of course because it wants to use these forces to seize political power. The most important method of seizing political power is to constantly expand problems, create chaos and terror, so that the government has no ability to control the overall situation, which is the most favorable opportunity. Chinese history tells us that the demise of a dynasty is mostly due to the misgovernment of the central government, coupled with years of drought and floods, with wailing everywhere, starving people on the roads, and bandits all over the place. People in the countryside rise up to defend themselves, and cunning people take the opportunity to rise up and exploit the situation, creating a situation of fragmentation and chaos, and the old dynasty may be overthrown. The Anti-Japanese War has caused such great losses to our country and people, the occupied areas are so vast, and social order is so unstable. In the eyes of the CCP, this is of course an opportunity to overthrow the government and seize political power, so how can it be willing to easily give up this opportunity? In order to make it more advantageous to seize political power, the CCP must find ways to create problems, expand problems, and even create and expand terror. For example, its anti-American propaganda and anti-American actions are all forcing the mediators of the negotiations to retreat in the face of difficulties. How can it have the slightest sincerity to solve problems with the government? This is the root cause of the ineffectiveness of past negotiations.

From this, it can be seen that the CCP's goal is to use force to overthrow its political enemies and gain real power to rule the country. But why doesn't the CCP simply use a policy of force? The reason is very simple, that is, its current strength is still not enough. If we pay attention to reading the Xinqing Xinhua Daily after the news of victory was released with an objective attitude, we can get two conclusions here:

(1) In the period from August 11 to September of last year, the Xin Hua's statements and news were trying as much as possible to discuss the dispute over the right to surrender and the expansion of the "liberated areas." Today, such and such city was recovered, and tomorrow, such and such city was liberated. There were statistical tables from time to time, explaining how many cities were recovered or liberated. During this period, only in extremely unimportant locations could be found news of stubborn resistance that was difficult to liberate. After September, the news or statistics of liberation gradually decreased, and the statements and news against the civil war gradually took its place. After mid-October, the statements and news against the civil war occupied the most important position, and at the same time brought out the demand for peace. What does this mean? It means that during the CCP's military expansion period, there was talk of civil war, and the development of the war was represented by terms such as uprisings and encirclements of fake regimes. After the CCP's military could not develop or even encountered failure, it began to publicize anti-civil war and peace. Peace and aversion to war are the eager expectations of our compatriots across the country. The Communist Party after military failure publicized anti-civil war and peace, on the one hand, to cater to the hearts of the people across the country, and on the other hand, to cover up its own lack of strength, while at the same time protecting the territory it has already occupied, as a base for future attacks. Therefore, the CCP's saying peace is a means, a means to protect the liberated areas and strength, which is complementary to its central strategy of armed rebellion to seize political power. We must understand this key point before we know that the so-called orders to stop conflict, restore transportation, army reorganization and unified compilation plans, and resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were all produced under this propaganda of using peace as a means. The CCP fundamentally has no sincerity to implement them.

(2) The CCP's call for peace has regional differences. The areas where the most effort to call for peace was found in the Xinhua Daily are the Central Plains Region (i.e., the area east of the Dahong Mountains in Hubei to Mahuang) and the Dongjiang Region (i.e., some mountainous areas in the Dongjiang River in Guangdong), and sometimes the Qiongyai Region is also mentioned. In fact, the areas where the conflicts were the most intense or the situation was the most serious were the Taian area of Shandong, the Kunlian area of northern Henan, such as Yongnian, the Southeast Shanxi area, the Chifeng Pingquan area of Rehe and the Northeast, and recently various places in northern Jiangsu, but the Xinhua Daily rarely found news of the battles in these areas, and sometimes it could find some scattered explanatory or argumentative press releases or essays and talks, which were nothing more than saying that they were passive or self-defense, or even that people were spreading rumors. Sometimes there is news when an important place is recovered or lost and recovered again. The former news always exaggerates how powerful and capable the People's Army is; the latter news always says that the People's Army withdrew because it respected peace or because the mission had been completed. As for news about the destruction of railways and telegraph lines, that is never reported. What does this mean? In my opinion, this shows that the CCP needs peace in areas where its strength is weak, and needs war in areas where its strength is strong.

From these two conclusions, we can know that the CCP's strategy is to use peace as a means and war and seizing political power as the goal. Due to this central strategy, it is carrying out military offensives in coordination with political offensives, so any peace talks are just a performance of the CCP's political offensive, and it is difficult to produce results, and even if results are produced, they are difficult to implement.

Therefore, if we hope that peace talks are effective, there is only one principle under which the goal can be achieved. That is, reluctantly recognize the CCP's military power and territory, and let it formally or informally become a "country within a country," clarify the boundaries, and each maintain the status quo, so that a peaceful result can be obtained. This is the ending of "division." This is the third type of possible ending I mentioned above. This is peace that violates the principle of "unification." How long can such peace last? That depends on when the CCP believes its strength is sufficient. Once that time comes, war will still be difficult to avoid, and the scale of the war will definitely be larger than it is now, and the intensity will be even greater. At that time, if international friction intensifies, and if the country that was devastated in this war has already had a considerable recovery, then the background of China's party problems will be even more complex than it is now. At that time, if international friction decreases or is eliminated, and if the Western problem is largely resolved, then the conflict of China's party problems may really cause international intervention. Therefore, the rhetoric of "international intervention" is so vaguely revealed at this time, perhaps that is the future hope of the CCP. However, in any case, whether this kind of ending is beneficial or harmful to the future of our country and nation, our intellectuals must be able to distinguish it very clearly.

(4) Carefully Choosing Our Path

What our China needs most at present is peace and unification, but because there are two forces developing in the same time and space, there can be no peace or unification. It is like a balance scale, even though the weight on one side is greater and the weight on the other side is less, the side with less weight still has a considerable weight, which prevents the heavier side from suddenly falling down. Therefore, this makes the balance scale a phenomenon of one end high and one end low, neither up nor down. The author has already said that if we want the Chinese Communist Party to achieve its goal of seizing political power by force, it must go through a very long period, and its development power and speed must be greater than the government's development power and development speed. This possible result is to make our descendants of the Yellow Emperor and the Republic of China, and even world peace, perish together. But if we increase the weight of the heavier side of the balance scale, then we can create a situation of a sudden drop, which is naturally much easier. This means increasing the power of the government. The possibility of unification can be increased, the time to strive for peace can be shortened, and the suffering of the people can be reduced. This is a simple and clear trend, and there is no doubt about it. "How will the world be settled? It will be settled by one." Today, the reason why we want to say peace and unification together is still this reason.

Increasing the power of the government will not necessarily lead to a conclusion of unification by force. Let us look at the CCP's acceptance of reorganization in 1937, the CCP's acknowledgement of the Three Principles of the People, and then look at the CCP after the Battle of Suiyuan last year and the CCP after the recent Changchun campaign and the conflict in northern Jiangsu. It is shouting "unconditional ceasefire" again. Its attitude, at least on the surface, is trying to change. Therefore, we can know that when the CCP feels that the difference in strength is huge, it will change its attitude accordingly. Only when it believes that the difference is not very far, it will rely on force even more. A CCP leader said to a friend, "It's not that the CCP is unwilling to sign a treaty of surrender, but it's only good to sign it when it's absolutely necessary." This truly reveals the CCP's inner thoughts.

Therefore, intellectuals who are concerned about the current situation, intellectuals who are willing to participate in political activities, do you really need China to have a long period of chaos, allowing the CCP to develop its power, and causing the country, the nation, and world peace to perish together? Then you might as well speak more for the CCP, weaken the government's power more, and increase the CCP's momentum. Otherwise, do you really hope that China will be peacefully unified? Then, you must increase the government's power and reduce the CCP's arrogance, and the CCP will have no choice but to change its attitude. The political stance must be based on the interests of the country and the nation as the standard for decision-making. Private grievances should not be considered, and personal honor and disgrace should not be the deciding factors. In particular, one should not just complain and lament one's fate in vain. Otherwise, one will inevitably go astray and mislead the country and the nation.

### "Parasite Grass" Actors

— Guan Yu

The "Parasite Grass," recently performed by the Art Troupe, is a play that Mr. Hong Shen translated a long time ago. This play depicts a young mistress-type character who refuses to move. She not only parasitizes society and her family, but also parasitizes everyone close to her. This "parasite grass" type of illness was finally cured by her brother. The medicine to cure this illness is jealousy in love.

This is a comedy, satirizing this type of young mistress! It can make every wife, miss, and young mistress think about it after watching it, to think about whether she has this parasitic disease. If she does, she can quickly change it.

The young mistress is played by Ding Zhi. This is the first time Ding Zhi has shown her acting skills on stage since the victory. Although we haven't seen any special acting skills from her, we can already see that she has grasped the character. The most obvious point in the whole play is her lazy appearance every time she goes upstairs: humming in her mouth, twisting her body weakly, her neck seeming to be unable to support her head, making her head tilt from side to side, her hands holding the handrails of the stairs, slowly, step by step, going upstairs. This can fully express the character she is playing.

The first time she came down the stairs, she didn't immediately sit down on the single sofa in the center of the stage. She just stood next to the sofa and directed others to bring her a magazine. When others brought it to her, she also took a few steps to receive it, and then sat down. If she sat in the sofa and then directed others to bring her something, I wonder if it would better express her "parasite grass" character. Although this is a small point, the first introduction of the character must be especially solemn.

Bao Gengwen is meeting the audience for the first time on the Shanghai stage. His acting skills are clearly highlighted here. Although he is an optimistic character and has returned home from afar to see his sister, he can express the happy situation in his heart through his external actions. However, because the acting skills of other actors are not exaggerated enough, he has become a "comedy character" here. Although we don't find it annoying, we feel that he is overdoing it. The scene in the whole play that can make people feel the most satisfied is the scene of cutting and arranging flowers in the first half of the second act: there are no words on the stage, just watching him arrange flowers. If he really finished cutting and arranging the flowers and put the vase on the table, then we would feel that his acting skills were overdoing it again. Fortunately, after he finished cutting and arranging, he suddenly threw the flowers in the vase on the table and cursed. At this time, we can know that he is deliberately teasing his parasitic sister.

The performance of the whole play is not bad. There are no major artistic flaws. It is much better than those performances where each actor shows off their own talents and develops freely on the stage.

### The Formal School in Acting (Continued)

— Ye Zi

Meyerhold's first period was one of movement, while his second period was the exact opposite: stillness. Actually, he was engaged in a program of poses to replace a program of actions. His great performance, "The Inspector General," can be regarded as the culmination of this period. It attempts to intertwine a series of poses, but the overall structure remains static, with any movement often being directed by mechanical forces.

The movement of objects triggers emotional responses through the power of their combined forces. The effect of the sensation stimulates the psychological response. A cigar or a fan in the hands of an actor is no longer simply a cigar or a fan; it symbolizes all the values associated with the relationship between these objects and their user.

Meyerhold's characters are also symbolic objects. Although they now wear realistic costumes, there is still some emphasis on trivial objects, with a certain degree of exaggeration.

In Moscow, everyone can understand their own emotions and may need the guidance of a director. However, a theater that primarily focuses on external forms relies on the actor's position in the group on the stage. Actors have no access to the overall form, and depend on the director, sitting in the audience, to tell them when and how to match the stage composition.

Composition—Compositional understanding replaces decoration, and many strange things and characters are woven into fantasy forms.

He himself said that he used actors like a sculptor uses clay, creating different works and achieving different effects. Therefore, the most malleable actors become his best actors.

All of his actors are like rubber balls. He throws them out, and the balls have to bounce, otherwise they are useless to him. But it's impossible for a rubber ball to bounce on its own. A good rubber ball is silent and has no right to act independently. Meyerhold's theater does not allow for individual intelligence. Meyerhold himself supplies all the intelligence, just as he supplies all the skills. However, many actors are excellent but unwilling to act as rubber balls, and no matter how good they are, they are thrown away. Therefore, it is naturally not easy for Meyerhold to maintain a good line of actors.

Meyerhold is not like Stanislavski, who seeks methods suitable for actors. Instead, he seeks an interpretation that is closest to his own. He already knows the exact speed and cadence of each word, and the actor only needs time to learn it accurately.

Every movement, every blink, every piece of music, every prop and costume – as long as it is among those three hundred people, they have already defined the play. By the four hundredth person, the public performance is almost complete.

He seems to know what every position and every movement looks like, and knows the internal reasons and external effects, and the audience's reaction. He explains all of this to the actors and tells them how to do it, step by step, pose by pose. He builds up the entire play's actions, while the actors remain still, waiting for Meyerhold's movements. Then, just like reciting lines, he uses Meyerhold as an example.

His control over the entire play has made it impossible for good actors to work with him. Similarly, the best designers are also unwilling to work with him, because in his presence, they are little more than foremen.

Meyerhold is a singular figure. After his death, there will be no successors. His contribution is simply to provide the impetus for theatrical revolution.

Stanislavski tells actors to forget they are on stage, Tairov says actors should forget everything, and Meyerhold says actors are part of the audience.

Theater biomechanics is actually the application of compositional or mechanical theory to actors. It assumes that the actor is a rather peculiar machine composed of many machines. The new problem for the theater is how to enable each part of this machine to function perfectly. Muscles, tendons, representing flexible living plugs, cylinders, etc., work with all their strength, according to the mission issued by the brain along the spinal cord and reaching the nerve center, and convey its proper meaning.

The laws of theater biomechanics are based on the study of human psychological structure. The purpose of this system is to enable people to understand the mechanism and laws of its structure, and thus be able to use it completely. It has established an analytical principle to distinguish various body movements, and can be fully used to express emotions. Previous theories of acting based on emotions assumed that the mechanism of the human body was ignorant, and used technical education to train the actor's intelligence, develop his body through games, and thus cultivate a vibrant actor who fully possesses the keyboard of body and mind, and is able to increase his divine inspiration. Now theater biomechanics rises up to replace this theory. Those who apply theater biomechanics to the theater aim to enable actors to control their own movements, rather than movements controlling the actors. This has become the ideal proof of organic human body and its mechanics.

At that time, poster plays were used as weapons of struggle. Speaking of this kind of reform, I think the important characters are too generalized, just like the outline of an advertisement. Their enthusiasm is the party slogans listed on the posters affixed to every corner and every plane.

These plays require specially trained key actors. The training method is as follows: words should be reread while acting in sign language, which can make people pay attention to the expression of the voice and create an atmosphere. Its effect is more powerful when the dialogue is divided by reading aloud and singing. Later, this kind of dialogue was called telegraphic dialogue. Its meaning is that the pronunciation is like the way of slogan-like dialogue, with its own unique and complete rhythm. This method of reading scripts is determined by the agitational effect that actors should first pay attention to, just like an experienced political speaker carefully considers the words he uses to move the audience. Gestures are also based on the same theory. Gestures match sounds, just as sounds match meaning, and the gestures of the arms have the same nature as the "gestures of words." This is the basis of a laborious method that requires very hard research.

What he sought was a new type of actor, an actor who could accurately control his body, with all his movements, and with a healthy briskness and liveliness.

He and psychology are too far apart. When changing a character, he felt the need to explain and emphasize the good and bad qualities, based on today's class consciousness. The bad qualities must be exaggeratedly described, and the good qualities must be refined and brought to the pinnacle of heroism. Meyerhold did not use words like "experience" or "emotion" to think about actors, but rather regarded actors as supervisors of the people, prepared to lead those whom he encouraged.

His foundation is built on juxtaposing contrasts. Therefore, it's a mix of tragedy and comedy, the most sublime and cruelly distorted emotions. (End)

### Movie Records

—

Recently, the movie records we hear on the radio are often old antiques, even the "Fisherman's Song" from over a decade ago has been dug up.

Because victory is nearly a year away, most record companies are unable to recover. At the moment, the only record companies in Shanghai are Greater China, Victor, and Pathé. Victor is American-owned, Pathé is British-owned, and only Greater China is owned by us Chinese. And none of these three companies have released a new record.

Until now, Greater China has only released six records: Zhou Xuan's "Victory Founding Song," Zhao Dan's "Victory Song" and "Welcome Soldiers," etc. It is said that they plan to release three records per month in the future. As for Pathé and Victor, they will probably release new records in the near future as well.

The record industry is a type of cultural enterprise, and especially in the field of music and art, it has a close relationship with mass education. Therefore, we must make efforts to assist in the promotion of records.

### Thirteen Kinds of Kisses - Marie McDonald's Experience

— Gang Ren

If you're a lucky one, Marie can tell you about thirteen kinds of kisses, from "Cutie" to "Kiss of Death."

She says, "Using their fingertips, no! Their lips, a woman can get anything from a man, even his precious life."

Marie is recognized as the woman most skilled at kissing on screen. She used only four "kisses" from her "warehouse" to hold the hearts of Lawford and Calhoun, which you can see in her Universal new film "Pirates of Monterey."

Now let's write about the text from her mouth!

One. "Her first kiss on the list is the "Cutie", just a quick peck on the man's nose."

Two. "The "Cheek Peck" is a full expression of friendship."

Three. She said, "At the same time there is also a "Social Kiss" which is also the same peck."

Four. "The "Wind Kiss" is an air kiss."

Five. "The most clever and slippery is the "Ear Kiss", lightly stroking his ear with pursed lips."

Six. "A cunning kiss is the "Hand Kiss", giving him a breathing kiss on the lips."

Seven. This kiss should be more generous, especially suitable for college campuses, willingly given, but relatively hasty."

Eight. "The following one is the "Top Kiss", making a kissing sound on the top of the other person's head, which is especially suitable for a lovely dad."

Afterwards, Miss Marie talked about more serious kisses.

Nine. "Neck Kiss". At that moment, lovers who embrace and hang on arms, the girl can lift her head and lightly kiss the neck under his ear."

Ten. This kiss should be "Lovers Kiss" then. Often accompany with heated embrace, nothing but love!"

Eleven. Similar to Lover’s kiss is “fiance”, which is more cautious.”

Twelve. "Hasban" is what a wife gives to her husband.

Thirteen. The last one is"Whamdodie". It is commonly used."

Finally, it is the death kiss."

"Lassie Come Home" is a Technicolor film set in England, telling the story of a dog and a child. Lassie is a dog loved by that boy so deeply, but one time it was taken by an earl, and raised in luxury in cage with comfortable living. But it prefers to give up the silk cloth and delicacy for a life that is not being cared for. It finally escaped, back to the child's simple home.

It is a touching film, telling people the love of animals is loyal and sincere. It is said that MGM decided to show the film around the sixth day of this month to kind citizens throughout the city, calling on behalf of the Shanghai International Society for the Protection of Animals: "Love animals."

### Weekly Movie Short Reviews

— Zhu Xi

There are no particularly good films this week, except for "The Seventh Veil," which is still good, but it doesn't have much innovation in its handling techniques.

The Bloody Road

Although the script is weak, like a myth, it is for promotional purposes, which is understandable. Because of the director's agile editing, this film has become the best of this week's films. From the opening to the forced landing of the plane, it is impeccable. Of course, there are also shortcomings, mainly because there are too many coincidences. The best actor is Zhi Lunhai, who is clean-handed and lovely. Errol Flynn is just average.

Our Time

The script is stiff, and the connection between the anti-Japanese war in the latter part and the former part is not good. The director handled several small scenes very well, such as the scene of a couple drinking late into the night until 3:30 in the hotel, which is very good. It is reasonable and good to add thin cigarette smoke or cigarette circles to the screen several times in the film, which is very novel. The anti-Japanese war section in the latter part is too perfunctory, which is a failure. Ida Lupino is excellent as an actress. There is also a supporting actor, the old man Michael Chekhov, who performs better than Ida. Paul Henreid is not outstanding.

The Seventh Veil

The prose-like treatment lacks stability, and the shots lack a new feel, but the opening scene is excellent, without saying a word. The performance is above par, and the use of famous songs is also a clever way. As for the actors, James Mason is not as ideal, and Ann Todd is very hard-working.

To Have and Have Not

The continuity of the play cannot be said to be skillful. Clark Gable has only a few small actions worth mentioning, and Lana Turner is very coquettish. The first part is better than the second part. It is very suitable for her to play a hot girl who pleases men with her charm and beauty. Today's popularity in Hollywood can be seen in this film. As for the director, the ending is what catches the audience, but the others are average. The section in Hanoi in the latter part is not as good as the previous section.

Diamond Horseshoe

The scene is not grand enough, and the relaxation is not lively enough. It only relies on the help of the actors. John Payne has no part to play, Betty Grable is still competent, and Victor Mature's amorous gestures are not bad. As for the director, the introduction of Betty's appearance is the worst, and the best part is Betty's performance of the "shadow boxing dance." The ending is not strong enough.

The Bandit of Sherwood Forest

The structure of the story is special. The protagonist is not a hero, but is close to being a rude man, but it cannot be said that the performance is very successful. The director took too many dark scenes, which has the disadvantage of suppressing the audience's joy. Actor Mai Lai Gu has not exerted his talent, and Luo Taiyang is excellent, especially after the murder of his old lover, his inner pain is all externalized, which is unmatched by new stars.

### The Negation of Art

— Mo Yu

Lu Xun spent half of his life exposing the ignorance and foolishness of our compatriots, but to this day, we still see many people who specialize in criticizing the works of others leading the spread of this trend, which can at least be said to be a painful tragedy of this era.

In the past few days, several Shanghai newspapers have continuously written many articles on Gao Tianxin and even Liu Shi's works that were similar to abusive curses. We certainly have nothing to say about the merits and demerits of this kind of writing itself, but we feel that the critic's fundamental negation of the original art existing in this era is very disappointing.

China, which has endured eight years of suffering in the torrent of the War of Resistance, also has a complete fragmentation in art like other political economies: Fragmentation will not disappoint us, because it is only the catharsis and record of the pain that art workers have expressed after a long period of hard tempering. This, as a record of the process of a turbulent era, is just like the brief commotion in the art world after the French Revolution. It will eventually be complete because of the art workers' ardent pursuit of light after breaking free from the darkness. China is still struggling in an era where the cost of living is five thousand times higher, and art workers still have to continuously fight against the hunger that dominates their own destiny. It is really impossible to force them to write melodies and movements as complete as Chopin's at the moment.

I have not seen many of the works of Gao, Liu and others, but their devotion to artistic work is at least worthy of admiration. In this commercial society where gold is supreme, people are indifferent to the act of picking up a pen and scribbling a few strokes on a blank sheet of paper, writing a few sentences. Because of this, this work of eating grass is even more worthy of cherishing; In the near future, the art of this twentieth century will inevitably have a bright and complete future. We need someone to work hard on this vast journey in piecemeal and serious way. Even if he is moving a pile of mud, or picking up a few stones, he can be regarded as having done his best effort for the future of the art of this era.

Chinese artistic achievements originally had a very brilliant past, but the regrettable thing is that even these few achievements were negated by the ignorance and foolishness of our compatriots. When the American soldiers first came to Shanghai after the victory and indulged in the many dazzling Chinese embroideries and exquisite handicrafts, they were satirized by general critics in a roundabout way. This is a strong proof that our ignorance and foolishness has cut into the confidence and tradition of our country's art; on the one hand, we marvel at the greatness and singularity of the artistic works displayed in foreign museums, even those before our Tang and Song dynasties, but on the other hand, we are intentionally or unintentionally trying to shovel away the milestones of our own country's emerging art. Is this the painful tragedy in this era? Is this also the shameful ignorance and foolishness of our compatriots and critics?

I have seen several predecessors who dedicated themselves to the news business, spending a lot of time every day to study and select the works of others, even those of younger generations, one article after another, so carefully, without being prejudiced at all; he entrusted his entire life and vitality to the paving work of art. This spirit of affirmation and seriousness, sincerity and piety towards art is worthy of alerting us, because isn't this era filled with a frivolous atmosphere of specializing in negating the artistic works of others?

Tao Yuanming was regarded as a flaw in the jade because of an article "Idle Sentiments", and Zhu Shuzhen avoided the criticism of infidelity because of two sentences "The moon is on the willow tip, people are after dusk". I always feel that this is a redundant page in history; we should remember that Chinese art works are still breathing, and they are still very poor. History is moving forward, we should not use ancient ignorance and foolishness to negate and stifle its progress.

### The Grand Reunion in Literary Works

— Jiang Xingyu

Talented scholar and beautiful lady novels of the Ming and Qing dynasties were often written according to the formula of "private engagement in the back garden, disgraced scholar wins the top examination." They generally described a previously destitute person later becoming successful in officialdom, or favored by those in power, thus acquiring three wives and four concubines, returning home in glory, and bringing honor to ancestors. Once this point was reached, the story would no longer continue. We often call this formulaic ending a grand reunion. The most fatal flaw of talented scholar and beautiful lady novels is the grand reunion, yet the vulgar petty bourgeoisie welcomes this, appreciates this. This is a question worthy of our careful study.

The Chinese people attach great importance to the word "end." The Book of Documents even lists "dying a natural death" as one of the Five Blessings, meaning that being able to die peacefully without suffering is a kind of happiness. Therefore, when lower-class people have quarrels, they often curse each other with "may you not die a good death." They emphasize this "end" not only for people but also for things. The most exquisite dishes are served only when the banquet is about to end, and famous actors' performances are saved for the finale. Therefore, they stubbornly demand a complete ending for literary works as well. Before the May Fourth Movement, China did not produce Ibsen's "Nora" type of problem plays because the answer required the reader to ponder, and fundamentally did not constitute an ending.

It is understandable why the bourgeois class appreciates the grand reunion. Their artistic cultivation is relatively lacking, and their interests are more low-level and narrow. They spend money to buy a book or a theater ticket with the purpose of entertaining themselves, allowing their emotions and muscles to relax. Having already spent money, shedding tears seems like an unwise deal. People with artistic cultivation are different; they can appreciate the humor of "Don Quixote" and the sorrow of "An Icelandic Fisherman" because these are both the truth of life, just as sweetness and bitterness are both flavors.

Since the Xinhai Revolution, titles like "top scholar" and "prime minister" have long become historical terms. With the occurrence of the May Fourth Movement, women's rights activists exposed the unwholesomeness and immorality of the system of three wives and four concubines. Thus, the grand reunion changed its nature. The endings of stories often involved Mr. A and Ms. B taking the "Contessa" liner to Hong Kong for their honeymoon, or "songs echoing in the valley, spring is ours," etc. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, the grand reunion infiltrated anti-Japanese war literature. The endings of works were uniformly the recovery of cities, the deaths of Japanese devils, the capture of traitors, and the cheering of the masses for the guerrillas. Once the formula was established, the works inevitably became stereotyped, resulting in the so-called "Eight-legged Essay of the Anti-Japanese War."

If it is said that writers completely create grand reunions to cater to the readers or audiences of the bourgeois class, this is not entirely true. Let us try to observe from the writer's own perspective: ordinary people only find compensation for their defects—spiritual and material comfort—in dreams. Therefore, beggars dream of white rice, and travelers dream of returning home. This is completely subconscious. Writers, in addition to subconscious dreams, can also have a conscious method of consolation, which is their work. The group of struggling scholars who initially wrote talented scholar and beautiful lady novels imagined themselves as the male protagonists in the books, writing articles more brilliant than Ban Gu and Ma Rong, appearances surpassing Song Yu and Pan An, relying on beautiful wives and concubines, living in pavilions and towers, and finally ending with complete satisfaction, which was originally a symptom of a perverted psychology, wanting to escape from the real world, using this method to deceive and satisfy themselves.

The reason why we criticize the tendency towards grand reunions is not to deny the possibility that some things in the world can come to a satisfactory conclusion, but because the same thing will never be repeated without any change in different times and spaces. It is because writers' life experiences are extremely poor, and they simply create based on borrowed concepts and imitation. Without talking about its content or its consciousness, it is impossible to be figurative even in terms of technique.

The tendency towards grand reunions contains a philosophy of fatalism and mechanism, believing that everything is predestined and that everything is controlled by gods, thus talented scholars must be romantic, officials must be snobbish, beautiful ladies must be affectionate, maids must act as matchmakers, and even guerrillas must be cheered by the masses. Fatalism completely ignores the subjective conditions within events and the objective environment outside of things, and mechanism completely forgets that the world is in constant motion. Fatalism and mechanism are the most superficial and unhealthy philosophies.

Another tendency opposite to the grand reunion is Thomas Hardy's "The Return of the Native," "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," etc. There are also such works in China, where the ending is always extremely bleak, just a dark shadow, a kind of irreparable despair. Lu Fen's novels, especially "Wild Bird Collection," express this characteristic most clearly. This is also a philosophy of fatalism and mechanism, and should also be criticized.

A thing can have various different results, and a novel can also have various different endings. Works faithful to life will never fall into the formulaic rut. Grand reunions are not impossible to write, but don't force them, just put them on as a set.

### Church

— Zheng Zhen carved

### Childishness

— Yang Mou

Once you become a person, you unconsciously put on a pair of shackles—because you are a person.

Sarcasm, disdain, ridicule... you must be constantly vigilant.

When someone occasionally says a few words of warm encouragement, it is truly like sweet spring water in the desert, and you are so flattered that you almost shed tears. But when you raise your head and see a hypocritical and cunning face, how indignant you become—but it is only indignation, and no matter how fiery your anger is, it can only be buried in the deepest part of your heart.

Between people, there are clearly traps laid out, a situation of drawn swords and cocked crossbows where they fight to the death, yet they must be adorned with a layer of sugar coating full of poison.

A straightforward beating or a straightforward scolding would be fine, but it can't be done.

I envy children: I envy children's innocent smiles, I envy children's innocent cries, I envy children's ability to clearly distinguish between good and evil.

Unfortunately, when innocence is combined with affectation, it is just ugliness and suffering.

Nevertheless, something about it allures me, guides me, and I imitate children.

All sarcastic remarks, I just pretend not to understand, and I just smile foolishly; I also pretend not to understand and slip cold arrows into my words to vent a bit of dark and stifled annoyance.

Some friends say, "You're still so naive," and some people criticize behind my back, "That guy is too childish." I smile, it's not that I don't understand, it's that I understand too much. I'm not naive, and I'm not childish; these are just my smoke screen and mask. Pretending is painful, but at least it gives me temporary freedom and satisfaction.

Why shouldn't I do this?

I have the right to scold these people, even though there are still people around them praising and flattering them. I don't want to be a pitiful little tail; everyone should have their own will.

I can speak my mind frankly, but those self-proclaimed seniors put on a condescending and bureaucratic air: "You don't understand, you're still young." Fine, then I'll just put on a child's mask and teach those people a lesson!

However, the more I act childish, the more clearly I feel that the childish spirit is gradually leaving me, leaving only affectation, which is truly lamentable.

### The "Organ Grinder Ghost" Talks about Dance Hall Music

— Liang Xiyan

A friend told me: "This is a very sad thing: a classmate of mine, Mr. So-and-so, who had extremely high musical talent, has now become an organ grinder ghost in some dance hall."

Music being used as a tool for low-level eroticism is the sorrow of music, and a person who studies music becoming a performer of erotic jazz is the end of the road for a musician. But society is also too cruel, adding the name "organ grinder ghost" to these dance hall "musicians," making it impossible for them to ever turn over a new leaf. In fact, the "musicians" in dance halls, although they play extremely low-level and shallow music, may not be without transcendent talent. They only sacrifice their opportunities for artistic development in order to eat, burying their own talent for the sake of life. In China, orchestral bands are too underdeveloped, and the general level is pitifully low. It is actually extremely sympathetic that those with musical talent end up as "organ grinder ghosts"!

Of course, foreign countries also have dance hall music, but their orthodox music already has a strong foundation, and they don't allow many highly talented musicians to become "organ grinder ghosts."

The Shanghai Music Association once considered the issue of dance hall music, but has not yet made a concrete decision. I believe that extracting some truly talented performers from the dance hall "musicians" and allowing their artistic skills to be brought into the right direction is one solution. Also, moderately raising the level of dance hall music so that the jazz is like jazz and doesn't just mess around endlessly is also very necessary!

Jazz was created in South America in 1914. Originally, it only used brisk rhythms and lively melodies to stimulate the nerves of the audience. Although the artistic value is reduced, it cannot be absolutely excluded from the realm of music. But today, this jazz is becoming increasingly out of tune, turning into a messy, comical, purely erotic thing. And in Shanghai dance halls, it is especially terrible. It is coupled with nasal singing by female singers, which also wins strong applause.

This situation will cause pain to every true lover of music! We know that dance hall music has its reasons for existing, but there should be a limit! Don't let excellent talent be buried here, and don't let these sounds destroy people's hearing without limit!

### Queen Charlotte

— Painted by Gainsborough (1727-1788)

Displayed in the Victoria Museum, London

Thomas Gainsborough was one of the greatest portrait and landscape painters in British history. Born in Sudbury, he loved to depict the beautiful scenery near his hometown in his childhood. At the age of fourteen, he went to London to study painting. In his early years, he was unknown. It was not until 1760, when he moved to Bath, a famous hot spring area, that he became slightly famous for painting portraits. In 1774, he went to London, and soon gradually became the rival of the greatest painter of the time, Sir Joshua Reynolds. The two had very different styles and shared the world equally. The Londoners who admired Gainsborough and those who admired Reynolds were roughly equal in number. He was one of the founders of the Royal Academy, and his works were displayed at the first art exhibition of the Academy.

Gainsborough's landscape paintings were a precursor to the naturalist school of landscape painting in modern times, and his portraits, especially portraits of women, all have a lightness and beauty that is unmatched.

### Rambling Talk on National Painting

— Yu Lu

As for national painting today, there are many schools, but few are orthodox. Scholarly attainments are not deep, cultivation is insufficient, and coupled with the trend of the times, they often like to show off by referring to new methods of Western painting. The result is neither Chinese nor Western. It is already difficult to achieve verisimilitude, and even more so to achieve spirit and breath. It is said that a certain painter thousands of years ago was famous at the time for being proficient in both Chinese and Western painting. But critics said that Mr. So-and-so's Western painting was so lifelike that the Chinese sighed in admiration, and Mr. So-and-so's national painting was so ingenious that Westerners were amazed. This is probably inevitable flattery. However, this shows that the true value of painting has nothing to do with the taste of the common people.

After Lu Lianfu and the Ren brothers of Shanyin, there have been many talented painters in Shanghai over the past few decades. The Zhang Daqian brothers are famous in the Jiangnan region as people of Sichuan. Most others are from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The best among them should be Feng Chaoran, Wu Hufan, and Zheng Wuchang. Wuchang's landscapes occasionally imitate Shi Tao, and his painting relies entirely on inspiration. Hufan's paintings are known for their clarity and elegance, while Chaoran is known for his antiquity and vigor. In the past, Di Pingzi greatly admired him. Wuchang still has a price list, but Feng and Wu are too busy to handle the many requests. Feng and Wu live in the same neighborhood on Shanshan Road, living in close proximity, and often enjoy singing and harmonizing with each other. When the inspiration comes, they wield their brushes freely, never tiring all day long. Only Feng's paintings are asked to verify their authenticity. Someone once asked Feng about a work that was suspected to be copied, and he smiled and said, "Those who know will naturally distinguish it, why bother to care?" Feng is proficient in landscapes, flowers and birds, figures, and ladies, but in recent years, he has focused on landscapes, with powerful strokes and meticulous composition. It is said that Feng did not participate in the Shanghai Artists Association exhibition in early June. A hanging ink painting borrowed by the association is probably his work.

### Sunday

— Written by George Gissing, translated by Ma Yufeng

George Gissing is a modern British writer. "Sunday" is translated from "The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft," a book that is famous in literary circles. Some even say that it is the most elegant work of English prose in the nineteenth century.

On Sunday I get up later than usual, I change my clothes, because it is appropriate to take off the usual work clothes on the spiritual day of rest. Indeed, I usually don't have any work, but Sunday also brings me quiet. I am immersed in the quietness of the world, and my thoughts are more completely detached from the busy world than usual.

How does this house of mine create the quietness of Sunday indoors? This is hard to see, because it is usually so quiet that there is almost no sound. However, I myself can see the difference. The maid walks into my room with a Sunday smile, and she seems happier on this day, and her happy appearance also makes me happy. She speaks in a gentler voice than usual, and the clothes she wears make me feel that only the simplest and cleanest work is done in my home. She goes to church both morning and evening, and I know this is very good for her. When she is out, I often inspect the rooms that I don't usually enter. Indeed, within the realm of a virtuous woman, the shining cleanliness and order make my eyes feel joyful. If there were no clean kitchen, what would be the use of me keeping books and hanging pictures? All the quiet in my life depends on the honest care of this woman, who lives and works in places I cannot see. I believe that the reward I give her is the smallest part of the reward she receives. She is an old-fashioned woman, performing what she believes to be her duty, which is the purpose in her eyes. The work she completes is itself her satisfaction and pride.

In childhood, on Sunday, I was allowed to read some books that I could not easily touch on weekdays. These were books with beautiful illustrations, or elaborately bound books by famous authors, or books that required special attention because they were thick. Fortunately, these books all belonged to high-level literature, therefore, in my mind, an inseparable association was formed between the greatest names in poetry and the Sabbath. I retain this habit throughout my life. I often think of quietly spending some of my Sunday time on books that are usually easy to put aside. In order to favor the pleasing appearance of newly published books, I neglect them under the guise of knowledge and love for new books. Homer and Virgil, Milton and Shakespeare, there have not been many days in the past Sundays when I did not read the works of these people. Not many Sundays? No, this is a habit that people easily fall into exaggeration. Rather, I would say that on many Sundays, I have discovered such a mood and opportunity to read. Even today, mood and opportunity will never abandon me. When I am happy, I can take down my Homer or my Shakespeare. However, to form a special friendship with these books, I feel that Sunday is the most appropriate. Because these great men wearing immortal crowns do not allow people who are enthusiastic about worldly struggles to approach them. A solemn and leisurely attitude and a tendency towards peaceful thoughts are suitable for them. I formally flip through picture albums. If the word sacred has any meaning, is this not sacred? When I read, no obstacles can appear in front of me. The singing of the cardinals, the buzzing of the bees, these are the sounds surrounding my sanctuary. When I turn the pages of the book, there is almost no sound.

### Random Remarks

— Shao Fu

Heaven has unpredictable weather, and man has unexpected fortunes. In the current view, this is not vague and unfounded, nor is it the work of any god, but has a completely scientific basis.

Like the weather the day before yesterday and yesterday, it was not only hot but also stuffy. Whether it is hot or stuffy, it comes suddenly. Anything that moves violently will inevitably have an unstable foothold. There will inevitably be sudden changes in between.

When a person becomes rich suddenly, his lifestyle will never be balanced and peaceful. Many things that never existed in the past or could not be imagined will often happen to his family and himself. The reason lies in accidental abnormality. Heaven and man are originally the same principle. The so-called weather and fortunes are by no means from thin air.

I remember Mr. Feng Zikai once expounded the philosophy of "gradualness." Preventing problems before they arise, "gradualness" is indeed the most terrible demon. Unconsciously, in daily life, it completes its deeply rooted power. But when it breaks out, I often regard it as unpredictable, as sudden. In form, it seems to be so, but in fact, it has been a long time coming.

Therefore, we don't need to be alarmed by the things that appear or encounter in our lives. After careful consideration, it is not difficult to find its clues.

### The Arduous Struggle of the Chemical Industry - The Past and Present of the Yongli Company

— Fanshi

Speaking of China's chemical industry, we can't help but think of Mr. Fan Xudong, who passed away nearly a year ago, and the Yongli Chemical Industry Company, which he founded and dedicated his life to.

From the Jiuda Salt Company to the Yongli Company, from the third year of the Republic of China to the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Fan's decades of struggle and effort not only achieved brilliant success in his personal career, but also made China's chemical industry radiate with brilliance because of him. Under his leadership, the Yongli Company set up two factories, one in the north and one in the south. The North Factory was located in Tanggu, Hebei, manufacturing soda ash. The South Factory was located in Xiejiatian, Liuhe, Jiangsu, manufacturing ammonium sulfate. The former is the raw material for paper and glass, and the latter is the main component of artificial fertilizers. These two important products have saved the country's rights and interests for more than ten years. However, just as people were placing greater hopes on him and Yongli, the gunfire of the July 7th Incident rang out.

The gunfire rang out, and the North and South Factories fell into the hands of the enemy one after another. The persevering and extraordinary Mr. Fan led his subordinates to Sichuan. The old was lost, and the new began again. In Wutongqiao, another soda factory was established. Although the scale was not large, it also contributed a lot during the Anti-Japanese War. Under poor and simple material conditions, they endured and worked.

Serious Blow

After the victory, just as the Yongli Company could make a big difference, Mr. Fan passed away due to illness last October. This was certainly a major blow, but fortunately, the foundation he laid was quite solid, and his friends and subordinates had already taken on the burdens he left behind.

What is the situation of the Yongli Company now? Yesterday, the reporter had the honor of being received by Mr. Li Tifu, the deputy general manager of the company, and had a long conversation in their reception room.

He said that both the North and South Factories have been taken over, and the equipment inside has suffered some losses. The North Factory resumed work in February this year, and the daily output of soda ash is about 90 tons. The South Factory is still being reorganized, and only a small part of it has resumed work, producing only a small amount of sulfuric acid. Why has the South Factory not been able to fully resume work until now? The main reason is that the source of coke and coal is a problem. Before the war, the South Factory always relied on the Xiaoxing Coal Mine Company in Zaozhuang, Shandong, for supply, but Zaozhuang is now under the control of the Communist Party's army. The company authorities have considered going to other places to buy coal, but transportation is very difficult. Reluctantly, they had to order goods from Canada. The quality of the coal is better than domestic coal, but the price is much more expensive.

Because of this reason, coupled with the high cost of wages and transportation, the current market price of foreign goods is 20% cheaper than their products.

Preparing to Move to Shanghai

However, because not many foreign goods have arrived yet, the sales of their products are still not bad, especially in Shanghai and North China, where demand is stronger. If both the North and South Factories, each with more than 1,000 workers, can return to their normal state, the daily output of soda ash in the North Factory can be increased to 200 tons, and the daily output of ammonium sulfate in the South Factory can also reach 150 tons. In addition, the soda factory in Wutongqiao, Sichuan, which was built during the Anti-Japanese War, is still in production, although it only produces two or three tons per day.

The current persons in charge of Yongli Company are Mr. Hou Debang, Mr. Li Tifu, Mr. Fan Hongchou, and Mr. Yu Xiaoqiu. They are preparing to move the head office to Shanghai and plan to divide the country into five regions - east, south, west, north, and central - and set up branch offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places respectively.

"However, all development and planning still depend on three major factors: national stability, smooth transportation, and price stabilization. The government has not shown any support for Yongli, but the National Bank has always provided considerable convenience in terms of capital turnover." This was Mr. Li's last insightful remark to the reporter.

### Difficult to Serve Maids

— Ink

My wife brought our two children from the interior. After much effort, I asked a friend to find us two rooms. Once settled, she suddenly realized we needed to hire a female domestic helper. This was originally my wife's responsibility, but because she was unfamiliar with the area, I personally stepped in.

At the maid agency in ×× Wei, I found a woman who looked honest and was neatly dressed, appearing to be around thirty years old. I stood facing her in the shop for a full half-hour, going through what she considered a negotiation (no, it wasn't a negotiation, it was her examining me!). The conversation went as follows:

"Where do you live?" she asked.

"×× Street, ×× number," I replied. "How many rooms?"

"Two."

"How many people?"

"Four, including me, my wife, and two children."

"Do you want me to cook?"

"Of course."

"How many meals a day?"

"Three."

"What about the dishes?"

"You'll wash them?"

"And the clothes?"

"You'll wash those too!"

"How many times a week do you wipe the floors?"

"Twice!"

"Do I have to wipe both rooms?"

"Of course!"

"That's too much work! The wage must be 90,000 yuan."

"I'll give you 70,000 yuan!"

"No way." After a moment, she asked, "Does your wife like to play mahjong?"

"Yes, she does!" I knew what she was getting at. "She has a table almost every day!"

"That's right! Oh, and sir, I also need meat four times a month, one pound each time!"

"Fine by me."

"Let's go!"

"Just like that? Aren't you bringing your bedding?"

"Bedding? No! Your husband has to make it for me."

I called two rickshaws to take us to my house. I introduced her to my wife. She inspected both rooms, up and down, for a week. Suddenly, she asked, "Where do I sleep?" "This place is too small," my wife said. "You can just sleep on the floor in the living room at night!"

"No way! Sir! I'm not doing it! Please give me the fare back!" I couldn't contain my anger and drove her out the door like chasing a dog. She cursed outside the door.

### Transformation

— Youfu

The changes over the past eight years have been boundless. Vanity and pleasure have ultimately transformed her.

In the spring and summer of the twenty-seventh year [1938], at the guerrilla base by Gaoyou Lake, I saw her for the first time. She was just nine years old, an underage, innocent, lively, obedient, and clever child. From then on, she was forever etched in my memory.

Because I was busy rushing to the front lines, I didn't have a moment to stay in the rear, so I couldn't inquire about her background. I just kept the image of that adorable child in my mind.

Two months later, I was ordered to return to headquarters for work, which gave me another chance to see her. This time, I got to know her. It turned out she was the younger sister of one of our female comrades. I solemnly told her, "You are an extremely lovable child. You must work hard! Your future potential is limitless." I used these words to encourage her. I thought this child's thinking was too advanced; she would definitely become a remarkable person in the future. At the same time, I advised her sister in a very sincere and friendly tone, "You must devote all your energy to cultivating this only little sister!"

My heart was filled with poetic dreams. I hoped she would become a prodigy in the world. While these thoughts still lingered in my memory, another two years passed like lightning. For two years, she remained unchanged, always moving forward. In the early summer of the twenty-ninth year [1940], I left northern Jiangsu to pursue a truth and an ideal. I only saw her once before leaving in a hurry. I only said one sentence: "Seize the precious time and bury yourself in hard work!" She looked at me with an expression like a Christian listening to God preaching, leaving me with a final memory.

For five or six years, I raced across the north and south battlefields, traveling through half of China, during marches, battles, encampments, studies, arrests… and in many other spaces and times. I always remembered this good child, and I believed in her. I had this mysterious little angel. During these long years, I only received one letter from her. The letter was very straightforward and honest. She told me she was about to graduate from high school, and I was very happy. I used a very short letter to encourage her again. That was in the thirty-third year [1944]. When the overall victory finally came, I was truly ecstatic, like a volcano erupting. I murmured to myself, "I will soon be reunited with this adorable child."

Following the victory and demobilization, I arrived in Nanjing and then transferred to Yangzhou. I immediately inquired about her whereabouts. She was indeed living in Zhaizhou, surrounded by red forces. I really wanted to see her, but I had to pass through the red zone. I didn't dare take that pointless risk. Due to time constraints, I boarded a train to Shanghai. I still missed her.

Three months later, I received a letter from an old friend. The letter said, "Liwei is no longer the same as before. Her ambitions have changed greatly. She has already cohabitated with Deputy Division Commander Ye and has gone to Beijing and then to Wuhan!" I was shocked upon receiving this letter, as if I had fallen from a high building!

Waking up, it was already the dawn of the next day. I was walking in the garden, and I couldn't help but feel emotional at the sight. I quietly thought about the sun and the air. The impression they had given me for eight years had never changed. Only the flowers in the garden had withered and fallen! No wonder people have changed too!

I remember the first time I saw her, she was a nine-year-old child, with a vast and sacred future. Unexpectedly, in the last five years of the war, she changed! Her friends told me, "She has two views on life. One is to work hard and strive for the future, and the other is to be extravagant and enjoy pleasure to the fullest. Now, she has ultimately embarked on the latter path."

### "Therefore"

— Shanshi

Middle school students often misuse function words when writing classical Chinese. One student repeatedly misused the word "而" (er, "therefore"), and his Chinese teacher became increasingly annoyed. So, he added the following comment at the end of the essay:

"Where 'er' should be used, it is not used; where 'er' should not be used, it is used. From now on, it is finished!"

"Are there any houses for rent here?"

"Yes, there are. Do you have a note from your neighborhood association?"

### Crows Are Black the World Over

— Fang Jun

Crows are black the world over, but the color of Hong Kong landlords is a bit different. People who haven't lived in Hong Kong can't imagine the methods Hong Kong landlords use to oppress tenants. Previously, with legal priority to protect them, landlords were demons to tenants. Later, when the government announced the rent increase and eviction ordinance, tenants could breathe a little easier legally. However, other forms of oppression did not ease up. People living in Hong Kong, unless they owned property themselves, had to swallow a lot of anger.

Now that the eviction ordinance hasn't been abolished by the government, tenants can still use it as their only protection. However, if a landlord wants to take back a certain apartment to rent to someone else, the existing tenant of that apartment becomes uneasy. First, the landlord deliberately creates a legal basis, not coming to collect rent and refusing to accept it even when it's delivered to their doorstep. Secondly, they ignore the water bill. When the water bill arrives in the landlord's hands, they disregard it, delaying payment and allowing the water authorities to cut off the water supply. In addition, they give tenants a lot of trouble, actively and passively using various methods to make the tenant of that apartment unable to bear it and give up their right to live there.

Hong Kong is experiencing a housing shortage, and the housing problem is quite serious. This is because a lot of housing was destroyed during the war, the number of people returning from the mainland has increased, and recently, people coming south from Shanghai have been like carp crossing the river. This has created the basic phenomenon of a housing shortage. The housing shortage directly gives landlords a golden opportunity. They repair damaged buildings, and after the repairs, they rent them out, on the condition that the tenant compensates the landlord for the building's repair costs of several thousand yuan. The rent is then increased five or even ten times compared to before the war. Landlords use the above-mentioned methods to force existing tenants to move out of well-maintained buildings, then rent them to new tenants, on the condition of a transfer fee of several thousand yuan (about 5,000 yuan). The newly set rent value is then doubled or even tripled.

Landlords are so rampant because there are people helping them do evil, profiting from the chaos. The rent dispute mediation office can't handle it. It's not that they can't handle it, but rather that legal persistence requires witnesses or material evidence. The loser often suffers from insufficient evidence, while the landlord has another "pocket" full of money.

Therefore, the landlord's ferocity and their coldness and arrogance toward tenants are initially due to the legal protection they had in the past. There are too many poor people in Hong Kong, with those who have to rent housing accounting for more than 95% of the total population. Too few of these 95% of tenants understand the law, and too many are willing to submit to the landlord's exploitation. This "willingness" is explained by themselves as not wanting to cause trouble, but others are causing trouble on their heads. I believe this is the biggest factor in fostering the landlord's ferocity. However, it's hard to blame them for not wanting to "cause trouble" because most landlords are Justices of the Peace. Justices of the Peace are very powerful in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong society has a very different character from other places.

Hong Kong landlords are extremely privileged. Several of them are even figures who have a page in Hong Kong's history. How could a tenant dare to confront them, lest they be crushed to pieces? However, the pre-war rent increase and eviction ordinance may have played too much of a joke on them, and many landlords are very dissatisfied with this. However, on the tenant side, they hope the government will announce a more democratic "law" on the housing issue.

### The Voice of Shanghai – The Reborn Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra

— Xiyan

Music is a major event in civilized countries.

After the victory, Shanghai has had grand performances; but the municipal orchestra, as Shanghai's only symphony orchestra, has only recently completed its reorganization and rebirth.

Money, the focus of all problems, the municipal orchestra had ample funding during the time of the Public Works Department [工部局], thus the achievements were not small. But when this orchestra was reorganized into the municipal symphony orchestra, there was a period of financial constraints. The musicians' livelihoods could not be maintained. They did not have the energy to practice, and it was difficult to perform well. After all, to make music, one must first have a stable life. Unlike writing, which can improve with poverty. Now, the funding problem has temporarily come to an end. Mayor Wu has agreed to allocate 20 million yuan per month as funding, with each musician's salary being 300,000 yuan per month. In this way, their lives are slightly more stable, and they can concentrate on art. They regularly practice at Yi Garden [逸園] from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM every Tuesday and Friday, and hold public performances from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM every Wednesday and Saturday. Ticket prices are divided into three tiers: 2,000 yuan (standard), 3,000 yuan (middle row), and 4,000 yuan (reserved). According to Xu Jinqing [許錦淸], the new director of the orchestra, in order to popularize music, they hope that civil servants and students will attend the orchestra's practice sessions every Tuesday and Friday, which is completely free.

The predecessor of this orchestra was the Public Works Department Orchestra, so the existing foreign foundation was established for us by them. Although it has been crowned with the name of the Shanghai Municipal Symphony Orchestra, when you look at the 54 performers, 46 are foreigners. It really makes us ashamed! However, the number of Chinese people has increased now. In the past, there were only three Chinese people in the Public Works Department Orchestra, such as Ma Sicong [馬思宏] and Chen Youxin [陳又新], which is shameful to say! Now, there are two first violinists, three second violinists, two violists, and one trumpeter who are all Chinese. According to Director Xu, there is also a foreign flutist who will come to Shanghai from Chongqing to join the orchestra. Mr. Xu, speaking English with a French accent, also said: "We hope there will be more Chinese people in this symphony orchestra!"

The conductor of the former Public Works Department Orchestra was originally the Italian Pacy. Shanghai audiences are very familiar with him. His conducting style of separating his hands to make different beats has long been praised by many. But now he has left the orchestra for some reason. The current conductor is Mr. Sloursky, a Russian, who is also experienced and cultivated. His advantage is that he doesn't make unnecessary flourishes to distract the audience.

I listened to their eighth performance. Many of the pieces were very common and well-known works, with no symphonies. I think it was for business reasons. However, for the Shanghai audience, I think it's excusable to temporarily avoid too many serious programs and slightly consider the audience's interests. One thing I feel is that the equipment on the stage at Yi Garden probably causes a lot of loss in sound volume. Open-air venues often cause the sound volume of smaller orchestras to dissipate, especially when there are violin and cello solos. The sound simply becomes very weak. These words may all be "pretentious expertise," and I don't know if they are correct.

### Writing Seal Script

— Gao Tianxin

Engraving seals must first involve writing seal script, to understand the brush techniques and character structure of the seal script style. Zhao Fanfu [趙凡夫] of ancient times said, "If modern people can't write seal script, how can they have good seals?" This is indeed a true statement. Ye Erkai [葉爾鎧] also said, "The value of a seal lies in the text. If you don't delve into the seal script and instead focus on the knife work, you are deceived." The difference between a seal artist and a craftsman lies in the different seal script styles.

To write seal script, first practice the Mt. Yi Stele [嶧山碑] (published by Zhengshu Bureau [正書局]) and the Mt. Tai Inscription [泰山刻石] (published by the Yiyuan Zhenshang Society [藝苑真賞社]) to achieve strong and vigorous strokes. Next, write the Stone Drum Inscriptions [石鼓文] (published in collotype by Zhengshu Bureau and Zhonghua Book Company [中華書局]) to seek beautiful structures. Then, copy bell, ding, and yi vessel rubbings to obtain their charm.

Among the best rubbings of bell and ding inscriptions, the Sanshi Pan [散氏盤] is the best. Guangyizhou Shuangji [廣藝舟雙楫] commented: "For ancient simplicity, there is the San Gong Shan [三公山]; for exquisite beauty, there are the stele headings; for magnificent grandeur, there is the Tianfa Shenzhen [天發神讖]; for elegant strength, there are the Fengchan Guoshan [封禪國山]; for dense vigor, there are the Shaoshi [少室] and Kaimu [開母]. These are all rare treasures." (Seal text: Feng Yuxiang's Bowl [馮玉祥之鉢])
