### National Army in Rehe Advances to Luanping; Hebei and Rehe Routes Will Join Forces at Gubeikou; Rumors of Datong's Fall Are Absolutely Untrue

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] After the National Army entered Chengde, it is now expanding outwards. A certain unit moving south has reached Luanping, and it may soon join forces with the Ping-Gu Line National Army at Gubeikou. There are still small groups of Communist troops between Gubeikou and Chengde, but they seem unable to prevent the National Army from opening the Ping-Cheng Line. The Communist troops in Chengde are retreating towards Zhaichang, but most are still near Fengning. It is also reported that the National Army in northern Hebei has advanced and today has occupied the area of Da Xiaotangshan and Jiulishan.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 1st] The Communist troops in eastern Hebei are attempting large-scale movements and railway sabotage in order to coordinate with the Rehe campaign. The National Army has begun operations to maintain transportation. If the Hebei and Rehe National Armies join forces at Gubeikou, the Communist troops in eastern Hebei will find themselves in a large encirclement.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 1st] Xiaozhuang, between Lutai and Hangu on the Beining Railway, was attacked by more than 400 Communist troops at 4:00 PM on the 31st. The defending troops fought back and repelled them by 5:00 PM.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Army launched a major counterattack today, carrying out a large encirclement of the Communist troops in the rectangular area around the Pingjin-Shanhaiguan area. The purpose of this move is to remove the Communist threat to the railway line between Ping and Shenyang. From a military point of view, this move is extremely necessary, as this route is the only transportation line between Guannei and the Northeast.

[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is reported that the National Army in Rehe is stepping up its advance. General Zheng Dongguo personally went to the front line to command the National Army's advance on Chifeng. The National Army seems to be planning to break through the outer defense line of the Communist troops south of Chifeng, and it is expected that the city will be taken soon. The Second Army of the National Army, advancing towards Zhangjiakou, has already made contact with the Communist troops north of Changping. It is also reported that there have been local clashes in the suburbs of Beiping. Gunfire can be heard in the city.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The news of the fall of Datong has been confirmed to be absolutely untrue. Today, General Ma Zhanshan still received a telegram from the defending troops of Datong stating that, apart from the three strongholds of Shaling, Zhoujiacun, and Majunying, which were abandoned by Chu Xichun's unit because they were outnumbered, the three strongholds of Caofoulou, Beiyanmiao, and the Police Academy in the east and south are still firmly defended by Chu's unit. Ma's unit is defending the northern and western areas of Datong, including the train station. At 8:30 PM on the 30th, more than 800 Communist troops launched a fierce attack on the positions of the 5th Division at the train station, attempting to destroy the water tower, but were finally repelled by the defending troops. At 11:00 PM, the Communist troops launched a fierce attack on the strongholds of the company and the Mining Bureau, but were also repelled by the defending troops. On the morning of the 31st, the Communist troops gathered their remaining troops and attacked again, but after a severe beating, they retreated towards Zimatun, Wohugou, and the Catholic Church. More than 200 Communist troops were killed in this battle. According to General Ma's headquarters, there has been no report that the Datong airfield has fallen.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch, 31st] The spokesperson of the Jin-Sui Pacification Headquarters issued a statement on the 31st in response to the Chinese Communist Party's announcement on the radio broadcast to Madras, India, that Datong had been captured. The statement said that as of 7:00 PM on the 31st, the battles around Datong were taking place in the south at the south side of the airfield and in front of Beitaimiao, in the north to the north of the train station, in the east to the east of the Yu River, and in the west in various areas outside the West Gate, and had not yet reached the perimeter of the city.

Communist Offensive in Northern Jiangsu Thwarted; Situation in Rugao Gradually Stabilizes

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 1st] According to the front line in Taixing: (1) The Communist offensive in Rugao has been slightly weakened, and the situation is gradually stabilizing. (2) The Communist troops attacking Huangqiao have entered the southern suburbs of the town and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. According to a military expert speaking to reporters, the Battle of Taixing will begin for the second time. (3) Hai'an is heavily besieged by the Communist troops. From the morning of yesterday to the morning of today, there has been fierce fighting for a whole day and night, and the situation is serious.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 1st] Commander Li Mo'an and Chairman Wang Gong jointly went to Taixing yesterday to inspect and give instructions.

[Our Jingjiang Dispatch, 1st] Huangqiao was captured by the Communist troops at 12:00 AM on the 31st.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 1st] The outskirts of Jingjiang have become tense again in recent days. The Communist troops are attempting to sabotage the traffic on the Bagang-Jingcheng highway, hiding during the day and moving at night, with frequent small contacts occurring.

### Meeting with General Rockey Completed; The 25th Group Returned to Beiping Yesterday; Visit to Sun Lianzhong Today, Departure for Zhangyuan Tomorrow

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] Yesterday, a reporter accompanied the 25th Group of the Executive Headquarters, which is investigating the Anping incident, to Anping. They arrived in Tianjin that day, and due to the late hour, the group changed its plans and visited General Rockey, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, at 10:00 AM on the 1st to ask for his opinions and information on the Anping incident, and returned in the afternoon. Rockey received the group members in a rather pleasant mood, and Huang Yifeng, the Communist representative, explained the purpose of the visit as chairman (the chairmanship of the group rotates among the three parties), hoping that Rockey would formally express his opinions as the American party involved. Zhang Shuheng, the government representative, expressed the government's position, stating that the government had not prevented such incidents from happening in the first place, and had been slow to reach a reasonable resolution afterwards, and expressed his apologies.

Key points of Rockey's on-the-spot remarks: (1) The Communist troops were prepared. (2) Don't let this affect the relationship between the two sides. (3) In the future, we will still adhere to the attitude of "we will not offend others unless we are offended." (4) There were no National Army troops traveling with us. (5) It is not clear whether the Communist troops were permanently stationed in Anping before the incident. He first said: He had recorded the reports of those who personally participated in the incident and the responsible officers of the regiments and battalions. Then he said: His Marine Corps was passing through the Pingjin Highway entirely to transport supplies to Beiping. On the day of the "729" Anping incident, the strengthening of the Marine Corps' armament was a preparation in view of the past having been shot at several times. Usually, a commander leads 25 soldiers, so on that day, the number was temporarily increased to 40 (but not including the drivers and attendants). The purpose was to protect safety and prevent bandits, but he did not expect to encounter the Communist troops' "prepared action." After the incident, according to reports, there was quite a bit of resentment from the outside, and it was hoped that this incident would not affect the feelings towards the Communist Party. He then said: I (Rockey referred to himself) have always done my best to prevent American soldiers from having problems with the Communist troops.

Subsequently, Zhang Shuheng asked, and Rockey answered: Question: Some people say that there were National Army troops traveling with you this time. Is this true? Answer: All reports indicate that there were no National Army troops traveling with us. In order to avoid this kind of malpractice, I also specifically ordered American soldiers not to be stationed in the same place as the National Army. Question: It is said that there were vehicles from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration traveling with you. How did they join the ranks of the American military vehicles? Answer: I don't know, perhaps it was for safety. Question: Some people say that there were National Army munitions in the vehicles of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration? Answer: I suspect that this is not the case.

The following is a question and answer session between Huang Yifeng and Rockey: Question: General, do you know if there are Communist Party troops on the Pingjin Highway? Answer: I only know that the Pingjin Highway is protected by the National Army, but I also know that there are Communist Party troops, but I don't know if they are mobile or permanently stationed. Question: Is there any contact with the Communist troops in Hebei Province? Answer: Two American soldiers were shot and injured before, and one person came saying that he was sent by the Communist Party to apologize and hoped to maintain contact, but later, when we looked for him, we could not find him. Question: Did the vehicles fly the American flag that time? Answer: I don't know. Rockey also said: He had instructed his subordinates that, except for self-defense when shot at, they were absolutely forbidden to attack people first, but the opening of fire on those who entered prohibited areas to guard bridges was not subject to this restriction. Also, after the discussion ended, the Communist Party representative requested to speak with Rockey alone for 20 minutes. The group is scheduled to visit Sun Lianzhong on the 2nd and fly to Zhangjiakou on the 3rd to visit Nie Rongzhen.

[Central News Agency, This City] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Nanjing at 11:00 AM yesterday. At 4:30 PM, he held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at 107 Rue Massenet, reporting the Chinese Communist Party's attitude toward the reorganization of the government. He said: "Before the informal talks of the five-person group, it is necessary to clarify the preconditions, that is, the Communist Party still insists that the government must guarantee that a ceasefire can be implemented immediately after the reorganization of the government, and the government must withdraw its five demands before negotiations can continue." Zhou also stated that if these two points cannot be resolved, the future remains extremely pessimistic. He also said: The Chinese Communist Party's acceptance of Ambassador Stuart's proposal to participate in the five-person talks this time is only "a try." In addition, he criticized the US government's sale of surplus materials, saying that it violated Truman's statement of last December and the Moscow Three-Power Agreement. He then answered questions from reporters as follows:

Question: What are the Central Government's views on General Cai Wenzhi's statement yesterday?

Answer: I think the Central Government representative of the Executive Headquarters may have an answer.

Question: Ambassador Stuart proposed a five-person meeting to discuss only the issue of government reorganization, without involving other matters. Why did the Communist Party put forward two demands first?

Answer: Ambassador Stuart hopes to achieve peace immediately from this meeting, so he suggested that other issues not be discussed at the five-person group meeting, but this is not the attitude of the Communist Party.

Question: Will the five-person group be the last negotiation, and what is the attitude of the Communist Party?

Answer: The Communist Party believes that if the government does not change its attitude in this meeting, it will be difficult to achieve results. As for whether it will be the last negotiation, it will depend on the opinions of the people.

Question: Will Mr. Zhou attend this meeting?

Answer: I haven't considered it yet.

Question: When will the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group be convened?

Answer: If a ceasefire can be implemented immediately during the five-person meeting and the government can be reorganized in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Comprehensive Group will be convened to make a final decision.

Question: Can the outcome of the five-person meeting represent the opinions of all parties?

Answer: This is an informal meeting and cannot represent the opinions of all parties. The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group will be convened in the future for further discussion.

Question: What will be the future if the talks are unsuccessful?

Answer: The future is very bleak and unimaginable.

Question: If the talks are unsuccessful, will the Communist Party and the government still maintain contact?

Answer: We have confidence that peace is still possible, because the people of the whole country want peace, and this is an irresistible force.

Question: When will the five-person meeting be convened?

Answer: According to today's evening newspaper, it will be convened on the 3rd of this month.

Question: Why is the US sale of surplus materials to China considered to be of a combat nature?

Answer: It can be proven both directly and indirectly.

Question: What is Mr. Zhou's observation of the current international situation?

Answer: I have not studied international issues recently, but I believe that no country dares to launch a third world war.

Question: Is it true that the Communist Party is expanding its air force and training pilots, as reported in the newspapers?

Answer: I only know that there are a few broken Japanese planes in "North Manchuria." As for the training of the air force, I have not heard of it.

Question: Has Chengde been entered by the National Army?

Answer: The report says so about the situation in Chengde.

### Opening of the Second National Congress of the Youth League; The Chairman Personally Attended and Delivered a Training Speech; Instructed on Six Guidelines for the Development of the League's Affairs

[Our Guling Dispatch, 1st] The Second National Congress of the Youth League opened at 9:00 AM on the 1st. Chairman Jiang, in his capacity as concurrent head of the League, personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, instructing on six guidelines for the development of the League's affairs in the future. During today's meeting, all the youth representatives present contributed valuable opinions, which the head of the League greatly appreciated. A preparatory meeting was held at 11:45 AM to approve the agenda and rules of procedure, and to elect the secretary-general and deputy secretary-general of the congress and the presidium of the congress. The congress recessed in the afternoon, and the representatives divided into groups for discussion. The official meeting will be held at 8:00 AM on the 2nd.

The main points of Chairman Jiang's opening speech are as follows:

(1) The purpose of the establishment of this League is to unite the youth of the whole country (to concentrate the new forces of the National Revolution in order to achieve success in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and to concretely realize the Three Principles of the People). At the First National Congress, I instructed that we should awaken the youth of the whole country, call on the whole country to actively unite, strive forward diligently, seek victory in the War of Resistance, seek happiness for our compatriots, and seek independence for the country, in order to complete our mission of revolutionary nation-building. Since the First Congress to the present, it has been three years. Thanks to the efforts and bravery of our comrades in the central government and in various regions, we have made a great contribution to the sacred War of Resistance. It can be said that the mission of striving for victory in the War of Resistance has already been achieved. The key point now is to accelerate national reconstruction in order to preserve the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance.

(2) At the time of the last Congress, the War of Resistance was at its most intense, and the future was becoming brighter. The conclusion of the Equal New Treaty in the first month of that year opened up new opportunities for independence and freedom for China, and our China was fighting alongside the Allied nations, sharing the important task of the Far East theater of war. Internationally, our country was considered one of the four powers. The situation at that time was really exciting. At the time of this Congress, victory has been achieved for a year, but the work of restoration has encountered various obstacles and has not yet been completed. The government's hopes for peace, unity, and stability have also encountered many difficulties and have not yet been realized. The current political disputes, social disorder, the devastation of agricultural and industrial production, the suffering of the people after the disaster, the decline of moral spirit, and the loss of national self-esteem are all incomparable to the period of the War of Resistance. I once said, "The difficulty of post-war reconstruction will be ten times greater than that of wartime." Overcoming this difficulty is the responsibility of every one of our citizens, especially the undeniable responsibility of every Chinese youth.

(3) The nature and mission of this Congress is to thoroughly review the gains, losses, advantages, and disadvantages of the entire League's affairs in the past three years, to discover which parts have achievements, which parts do not have enough achievements, to discover what our difficulties are, and whether we have the strength to overcome these difficulties. We must also frankly and enthusiastically reflect on our shortcomings, expose our shortcomings, and study concrete ways to correct our shortcomings. Taking advantage of this opportunity to gather together, we must exchange work experiences with each other, diligently practice self-criticism and mutual criticism, in order to gather ideas and promote the future development of our League's affairs.

(4) In the past year, the international situation and the changes in domestic politics, from the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference to the recent Paris Peace Conference, have undergone many changes. Regardless of whether China participates or not, it has always strived to uphold human justice and realize world peace. In particular, this Paris Peace Conference is the key to the future safety and order of the world. We hope that the plan for lasting world peace can finally be realized, and the organization of the United Nations will gradually become sound. Our China must uphold the original intention of the War of Resistance and strive for international justice and peace. We should be aware of the importance of our country's international relations and must be confident that we have a stabilizing force in order to live up to the hopes of all friendly countries. As for domestic affairs, you have all personally witnessed them and do not need me to say much. As far as the current situation is concerned, there are certainly many areas that need to be improved, but compared with ten years ago, there are also many areas that have improved. Before the war, the Northeast was occupied by the Japanese, and some provinces in North China were also invaded by Japanese forces. The situation in the southwestern provinces was also quite special. Now, except for a few special areas, the central government's orders can be fully implemented. This is the foundation of national unity and is a great improvement.

(5) Looking at the domestic and foreign situations as a whole, as long as we can strengthen ourselves and stand on our own feet, we will surely be able to fulfill the legacy of the General. The most urgent tasks at present are: (1) complete unification; (2) accelerate national reconstruction. We should reflect on ourselves, intensify our efforts in positive aspects, and fully realize the Three Principles of the People. We must reform our shortcomings in politics, love the people, support the interests of the majority of the people, and solve economic problems based on the General's legacy of controlling capital, and deal with land problems based on the legacy of equal land rights, in order to achieve the goal of "land to the tiller." All followers of the General, whether groups or individuals, must uphold the spirit of integrity, openness, and frankness, abide by the laws and regulations, respect freedom, promote autonomy, cultivate civil rights, and establish the foundation of democratic constitutionalism.

(6) Youth is the life of the country's successors. This League was organized to unite the youth of the whole country and jointly shoulder the great cause of revolutionary nation-building. In the future, how to increase the confidence of our youth, how to relieve the boredom and suffering of our youth, how to establish an effective way for our youth to serve the country, how to enhance our youth's cultivation in knowledge, skills, and career, and truly enable our Chinese youth to strive for revolutionary nation-building is the main theme that this Congress must carefully discuss. Most importantly, we must maintain the inherent integrity and unyielding morality of our nation, promote the inherent culture of our nation, which is long-standing and extensive, emphasize propriety, know shame, be able to endure hard work, and be able to actively move forward. In the midst of the decadent and chaotic torrent that only talks about interests and does not talk about right and wrong, we must temper our upright integrity and establish the personality of self-respect and self-love among our youth in general.

### The New York Chinese Association Hosts a Banquet; He Yingqin Encourages Overseas Chinese; Develop the Motherland's Industry; Deeply Saddened by the Communist Army's Disturbance

[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 31st] Today, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (Chinese Association) hosted a banquet for General He Yingqin at the Louisville Restaurant in Chinatown, New York, from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM, lasting two and a half hours. There were 16 round tables at the banquet, seating 200 people. More than 1,000 people gathered in the streets outside, enthusiastically cheering for General He. He gave a speech on the spot, saying that if China did not have Communist troops disturbing everywhere, it could safely carry out construction work and maintain world peace in its position as one of the five powers. In the tone of a scholar, he gradually analyzed the three factors of China's victory over Japan: (1) Chairman Jiang's outstanding leadership; (2) The loyalty and bravery of Chinese soldiers and people; (3) The power of the Three Principles of the People. General He said: "The Communist troops did not destroy the railways or factories during the Japanese occupation, but now they are doing their best to destroy everything, which is a pity. This is the reason why haze is still shrouding China." He pointed out that Chairman Jiang is eager to achieve domestic peace by all means, because China's peace is the key to world peace. General He, on behalf of the National Army, expressed his gratitude to the overseas Chinese for their contributions to the War of Resistance against Japan. He encouraged the overseas Chinese to cooperate in developing the motherland's industry in order to develop China's resources. Chen Zhonghai, Chairman of the New York Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, compared Sun Yat-sen to Washington, Jiang Jieshi to Lincoln, and General He to General George Meade (a famous general during the American Civil War) for fighting bravely against the enemy and making great contributions to the country.

### People's Governance Party Announces Establishment, Holds First Press Conference Yesterday, and Releases Five Propositions on the Current Situation

[Our Newspaper Report] The newly formed People's Governance Party held its first press conference yesterday afternoon at the Hong Lok Restaurant. Among those present were Standing Committee members Situ Meitang, Zhu Jiazhao, Zhao Yu, and others. Situ Meitang gave a speech, stating that the party originally existed as a society with a history, organization, and power, with members spread across the country and overseas. The party estimates its membership to be over three million and is currently undergoing registration. The party holds a friendly attitude towards the government and all parties, hoping to be fair, sincere, and cooperative, so that it can contribute to the nation and lead China onto the path of true democracy. Subsequently, Zhao Yu rose and said that seventy years ago, the number of overseas Chinese was very small. Later, due to the failure of the Hongmen uprising, many patriots traveled overseas, thus establishing a good revolutionary foundation. During the Xinhai Revolution, the overseas Chinese contributed greatly, and during the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese compatriots also exerted great effort. Now, on the occasion of the victory of the War of Resistance, they are willing to participate in domestic politics with pure patriotic enthusiasm, aiming to strive for production and construction. Zhu Jiazhao continued: Overseas Chinese in the United States have a history of eighty years, and there are more than 300 Hongmen organizations in the United States with more than 100,000 comrades. There are also more than 500 organizations in Nanyang with more than 2.5 million comrades. They have always been concerned about the country and the nation, and have exhausted human and material resources to contribute to the revolutionary cause. Therefore, the Founding Father once called overseas Chinese "the mother of revolution." Overseas Chinese withdrew after their success and did not engage in politics. Last March, overseas Chinese of the Zhi Gong Tang established the Zhi Gong Party in the United States, originally intending to send representatives back to China to form a party as soon as possible, but this could not be realized due to traffic obstruction. After this victory, they returned to the motherland. After months of preparation, the work of forming the party was finally successful. However, the name of the party has been changed from Zhi Gong Party to People's Governance Party, with the aim of uniting comrades at home and abroad, focusing on economic construction, and creating a new China. Then, Zhang Shucheng of the party announced five points of proposition on the current situation: (1) Domestic military conflicts should be stopped immediately. Under the principle of peaceful unification, all political and military issues should be resolved as soon as possible. (2) To create a reorganized government, all parties should strive to genuinely innovate politics, and should not haggle over the distribution of quotas, delaying the realization of peace and aggravating the national crisis. (3) The reorganization of the army should be the responsibility of the state and the nation, and the reorganization committee should be organized by representatives elected by various parties to implement the army reorganization plan in earnest, in order to achieve the goal of nationalizing the army. (4) Disputed areas can be divided into several "New Administration Experiment Zones," where the government selects non-violent political figures to form a committee to temporarily take charge of governance. After the promulgation of the constitution, this temporary governance right should still be transferred to the democratically elected local government. (5) Any party should maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty. The party opposes submitting any internal disputes to the United Nations for discussion, or requesting direct or indirect intervention from the international community.

Director of the Central News Agency Zong Tongzi delivered a brief speech, emphasizing the point that "I hope colleagues can help the people understand right and wrong." The words were sincere and concise. Immediately afterwards, there was freedom, clinking glasses, and both inside and outside gathered in one hall, which was very rare. When colleagues met, the first thing they said to each other was "No news today," and the second was that more than a dozen newspapers in Nanjing may not be published in two days due to labor strikes, which became a topic of conversation. The cocktail party ended at 6 p.m. At 8 p.m., the Out-of-Town Journalists Friendship Association hosted a musical evening, still held at the same venue, and several beautiful singers participated in the performance.

The working environment was very difficult and the conditions were inadequate, but he has still maintained his health to this day. He hoped that news practitioners can maintain a happy mood in order to maintain their health.

The import tariffs on some servers and machinery will not be increased. Raw materials will be determined according to their nature, and no tariffs will be imposed on cotton. The purpose of this move is more protective than financial.

Editorial

### The New Political Party of Overseas Compatriots

The People's Governance Party is organized by various Hongmen groups of overseas compatriots. It held its first representative conference in Shanghai in August of this year, decided on its political program, passed its general constitution declaration, elected the persons in charge of the headquarters, and announced its establishment. It was not until yesterday that it invited reporters in Shanghai and telegraphed the whole country to officially announce its existence. This is a political association that is worth noting.

On the surface, this seems to be a new political party, but it is actually an old organization. As they said in their declaration, "Although the Zhou dynasty is an old state, its mandate is renewed." In Western terms, this is called "new wine in old bottles." This union should be rich in historical, revolutionary, and national characteristics. The Hongmen is a revolutionary group, aiming to restore China. It has passion, blood, and light, and has written a glorious poem in history. Whenever the times tested people's souls, they had several times saved their motherland.

The founders of this party, Zhao Yu, Zhu Jiazhao, Situ Meitang and others, are all overseas Chinese, and more than 70% of the party members are also overseas Chinese. There are nearly 70 units of branches scattered overseas, with 3 million party members. This party first conceived overseas and then returned to the embrace of the motherland to give birth, which clearly reflects their feelings for the motherland.

Our overseas compatriots, empty-handed, wander overseas, suffer all kinds of human suffering, suffer all kinds of bone-sucking, endure what others cannot endure, and live and die on their own until now. They don't blame heaven or others. They are used to this kind of life and don't think they are pitiful. The motherland does not think of them, and is even unwilling to give them the small amount of education and repatriation funds, but they miss the motherland at all times, and remit a large amount of donations to the motherland. Their patriotism is always high, like unrequited love, and they feel that everything about the motherland is good. They eagerly hope that the motherland will be strong, rich, and that the motherland will be respected in everything.

However, the god of victory in the War of Resistance brought a more sorrowful fate to overseas Chinese. From the shooting of our overseas compatriots in Batavia, to the Tanquilong massacre in the Dutch East Indies, the lives of overseas Chinese are still filled with tears. Looking at the motherland, it is still a mess, with a low level of political style and a low-pressure brute force struggle. One wave is not flat, and another wave rises, just like the Hydra in Greek mythology. Cut off one head and another grows. What is the sin of the nation? Seeing the fruit of victory rot, and overseas Chinese suffer even more indirectly.

Overseas compatriots hope that the motherland will be like waiting for dawn in the dark night. However, the motherland has long nights and many dreams. It says peace but there is no peace, it says not to fight but there is fighting. If it drags on like this, it will drag the people to death, drag down the country, and drag down the overseas Chinese. In this situation, even a mute will speak. Under the command of their high-spirited patriotism, overseas Chinese can no longer silently endure. They spontaneously organize political parties, participate in national affairs, and want to roar loudly.

They have bright political programs and remedies for ills in politics, military affairs, diplomacy, economics, culture, education, and so on. Their political mission is to "revive the nation and stabilize the country," which was originally their traditional mission for three hundred years. Today, they will promote the glorious history of the past in a new posture and promote the Republic of China to embark on the path of democracy, governance by the people, and service for the people. They have put forward five points of national propositions: first, peaceful unification; second, reorganization of the government; third, nationalization of the army; fourth, establishment of "New Administration Experiment Zones"; fifth, maintaining the freedom and independence of the nation.

Among these five national propositions, the first point says that peaceful unification should be realized according to public opinion. The four words "according to public opinion" are excellent. The current crux of the matter is the lack of sincerity. If public opinion is relied upon, there will be sincerity. With sincerity, there can be peace, and with sincerity, there can be unification. Because now the common people are sincerely praying for peaceful unification day and night. The second point, reorganizing the government, focuses on "electing the virtuous and capable," and the common people will definitely raise their hands in approval. People are the foundation of nation-building. Confusion can cause a government to die without illness; incompetence can make a government a target of revolution. We cannot get red-faced and angry, arguing over the number of seats. We must put talent first. Only with first-class talent can there be a first-class government and a first-class country. The "New Administration Experiment Zone" is an interesting thing. If everyone agrees, the disputed area may not be difficult to resolve. As for the nationalization of the army and the fact that all parties must not seek foreign forces to infringe on the freedom and independence of the country, that is even more a matter of course.

Looking at the text of this party, listening to the words of this party, tracing the history of this party, and carefully examining the members of this party, we can believe that they are frank and selfless, and can be said to be purely nationalistic, purely patriotic, and purely objective, standing on the position of the common people. However, what we are now worried about and also what we expect from them is that they will always stand their ground and speak and act from the solemn position of the common people. Because overseas Chinese are emotional and sincere, and are separated from the motherland, they are easily misled by their intuition and have their rights and wrongs confused. This needs to be guarded against and treated with utmost caution. We also hope that all their activities are for the country and all their interests are for the country!

### America Aids Our National Reconstruction

Negotiations between China and the United States regarding the specific methods for the U.S. to sell surplus materials to China have concluded. Despite the clamor and protests from the Chinese Communist Party, an agreement between the two countries was finally signed the day before yesterday. China, having suffered the sacrifices and depletion of eight years of war against Japan, is in a state of great devastation. Post-war recovery and national reconstruction require a substantial replenishment of resources. This time, the United States' sale of a large quantity of surplus materials to China will be of immense benefit to the stability of China's economy and the progress of national reconstruction. We should redouble our efforts to make the most of this substantial amount of supplies and lay a solid foundation for the future of our nation.

According to the provisions of this agreement, the surplus materials sold by the United States to China are very substantial, with an original total value of over 800 million US dollars. This includes: (1) Scattered liquid assets in China, Okinawa, Guam, Bataan, and other islands, originally valued at 500 million US dollars; (2) Fixed assets within China, originally valued at 85 million US dollars; (3) Other surplus materials worth 130 million US dollars; (4) Small ships with an original cost value of 90 million US dollars; (5) Surplus materials stored in western China, originally valued at 20 million US dollars; (6) Shipping costs for surplus materials, approximately 30 million US dollars. The total amounts to 855 million US dollars. As for what the United States receives, it will only offset 74 million US dollars in debts owed by China, obtain 35 million US dollars in funding for the U.S. embassy in China, and allocate 20 million US dollars for promoting Sino-American cultural and educational endeavors. The remaining balance will be considered a loan from the United States to China. This cannot be seen as anything other than a further expression of American goodwill toward China. Moreover, the United States is willing to provide a high degree of cooperation in how these materials are transported to China, and must complete the work within 22 months.

During the war, China and the United States fought side-by-side and had long become allies in adversity. The friendship between the peoples of the two countries, having been tempered by bloodshed, has become even deeper and cannot be alienated by any propaganda offensive. The 450 million people of the country are grateful for the kind assistance of the United States and harbor no doubts about any ulterior motives. Even if we sometimes ask ourselves why the United States is willing to sell so many materials to China, it is easy to find an answer. The United States hopes that China will become a strong, unified, and democratic nation, and China's most pressing need at present is the supply of materials. If foreign aid is not obtained, not only will national reconstruction be impossible to initiate, but also domestic resources will be exhausted, and it will be impossible to avoid inflation. This is the first reason. The United States' policy towards China is entirely focused on commercial and economic interests. If the United States wants to do business in China, it must ensure China's security and prosperity. Post-war China, because everything has not yet recovered, is like a patient suffering from anemia. The only way to treat it is to use blood transfusions to restore it first, and then there is hope of becoming strong. This is the second reason. During the war, American troops were scattered all over the world, so there were surplus materials on every battlefield. If these are not sold, it will be detrimental to the United States. It is better to sell them. In the European theater, most of the surplus materials, except for a portion sold to Britain, were sold to France, and the approach taken was generally the same. This is the third reason.

The United States has specifically stated that these surplus materials do not include military equipment, ammunition, aircraft, or other military equipment, but are entirely civilian materials, all of which are necessary for our country's recovery and national reconstruction. Therefore, it is expected that after this "blood transfusion," if we take this as a starting point, work hard to transform other people's blood into our own new flesh and blood, then a bright future will surely unfold in front of China's recovery and national reconstruction. In the history of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the signing and implementation of this agreement will undoubtedly usher in a more glorious chapter.

### Greek Citizens to Vote on Form of Government - UK, US, and USSR Watching Closely - Monarchist Tendencies Quite Strong - Terrorists Causing Trouble Throughout

[Report from Our Consolidated News Sources] London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: Greece held a referendum today to decide whether the country would be ruled by the monarchy or a republican government. At dawn, large numbers of Athens voters gathered at the polling stations. According to government estimates, roughly 85-90% of the country's 1.7 million eligible voters will participate in the vote. Ballots are divided into two types, one bearing the name "George" and the other bearing the name "Democracy." The movement to restore the monarchy appears quite strong. Last night in Athens, members of the National Liberation Front party drove trucks through the streets, urging people to vote for "Democracy," while monarchists also made fervent pronouncements, using bugles to sound "Da Da Di Di Di." The sound symbolizes the phrase "he will return" in Greek. Police were stationed at key points in the city to prevent unforeseen circumstances.

Paris, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: This morning, 40 armed terrorists in Chelsea Deauk attempted to block the voting process, but were eventually dispersed by the Gendarmes. No incidents occurred during the referendum in the Peloponnese region.

London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: This morning in Athens's Kasariani district, a right-wing individual was killed by a thrown explosive of unknown origin, while another communist leader was shot dead.

According to a United Press dispatch from Athens on the 31st, the government announced on the eve of the Greek referendum that recent clashes between royalists and communists over the past 48 hours have resulted in 31 deaths. Communists killed 10 soldiers and civilians in recent attacks.

According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 31st, well-informed observers anticipate that the Greek referendum will result in a majority vote in favor of King George's return. It is reported that Greek guerrillas are receiving large quantities of arms and ammunition from Albania, and volunteer soldiers from Albania and Yugoslavia have pledged assistance. Therefore, it is expected that if the referendum results in favor of the monarchy, large-scale unrest will be inevitable. US diplomats believe that Greece is the "vanguard" of the Soviet Union's "Dardanelles offensive." The pressure exerted by the Eastern European bloc on Greece, such as recalling ambassadors, filing complaints with the Security Council, and demanding border adjustments at the Paris Peace Conference, has fully exposed the face of pure power politics. In the context of this referendum, the Soviet Union's strategy is well-suited to make the general Greek population understand that only by establishing a monarchy can national independence be maintained; otherwise, Greece under a communist government will fall completely under Soviet control. US officials candidly acknowledge that the core of the Greek problem lies in controlling the Dardanelles. Greece is the only country in the Balkan Peninsula not under Soviet influence, and therefore, US foreign policy is paying the utmost attention to the Greek issue.

### Largest US Aircraft Carrier Schedules - To Sail Greek Waters - Readying for a Great Air Show

[United Press, Naples, 31st] The largest US aircraft carrier, the USS Roosevelt, will arrive in Greek waters on September 5th, four days after the Greek referendum to decide on the restoration of King George II. It will dispatch 125 aircraft to soar over Athens. According to Rear Admiral Cassady's announcement today, this aerial display will be carried out at the request of the Greek government and will last for approximately 30 minutes. The aircraft will spell out the letters "FDR" in the sky. Cassady is the commander of the US Navy's mobile force, and its Mediterranean cruise has drawn criticism from Moscow. Before returning home, the fleet may also visit the Dardanelles and Trieste.

### Molotov Returns Home for Instructions - Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Postponed

[Report from Our News Sources] London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, originally scheduled to resume tomorrow, has been postponed due to Molotov's sudden return to Moscow.

[Reuters, London, 31st] There are two rumors circulating here regarding Molotov's sudden departure from Paris to return home. One is that Molotov's trip is similar to Bevin's frequent weekend trips home during the foreign ministers' conference in April, as Molotov has not had direct contact with his government for over a month. The other is that Molotov's trip is a result of the diplomatic conflict between the Soviet Union and Greece and Western countries. During yesterday's plenary session of the peace conference, Molotov and British representative Alexander clashed over whether the foreign ministers' conference should discuss the Greek-Albanian border issue. The two theories are clearly mutually exclusive, but we can be certain that Molotov's return home is to seek instructions on diplomatic policy toward Greece. With Ukraine's accusation against Greece under discussion by the Security Council, Greece's demand for land from Albania on the peace conference's agenda, and the Greek referendum about to take place, the Greek issue has become the most attention-grabbing issue of the day. From the perspective of Soviet policy over the past week, the London Observer believes that the Greek referendum may trigger a crisis in Soviet diplomatic policy toward Greece. If the referendum result establishes a monarchy, the Soviet Union will have to put considerable effort into deciding what attitude to take, which is why Molotov returned home.

### Greek Crown Prince Arrives in Egypt - Preparing to Return to His Homeland with His Father

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 31st] Greek Crown Prince Paul and Princess Frederica arrived in Alexandria, Egypt, today from London. The Crown Prince is here on the orders of his father, King George II, to prepare for the entire family to return home after tomorrow's Greek referendum approves the monarchy.

[Reuters, London, Day 1] King George of Greece spent the weekend in the countryside with two or three attendants. He may return to London on Monday to hear the results of the voting. King George often enjoys traveling in casual clothes to express his democratic personality and usually does not bring bodyguards, only bringing them on formal occasions.

### Prohibition of Former Enemy Nations - From Developing Atomic Weapons

Decision Passed by Peace Conference Military Committee

[Reuters, Paris, 31st] The Military Committee of the Paris Peace Conference unanimously resolved today to prohibit former enemy nations from researching atomic weapons, but atomic research for peaceful purposes may still be conducted.

[Reuters, Baghdad, Day 1] The Iraqi government has recently received an invitation to participate in the Paris Peace Conference and will be represented by Foreign Minister Jamali to present opinions on Italian colonies.

### Foreign Minister Wang Decides - To Return Home Soon

It is also rumored that the candidate for our representative to the United Nations Security Council on September 23rd has also been assigned.

### Filipinos Bleeding from Civil War - Government Makes Last-Ditch Efforts

[United Press, Manila, Day 1] Local Sunday newspapers report that military police have received reinforcements and have recently used artillery, guided by reconnaissance aircraft, to bombard strongholds of the Hukbalahap peasant guerrillas. The fighting is most intense within the San Fernando-San Miguel and Cabanatuan triangle areas. It is reported that a large number of Hukbalahap have concentrated in the Arayat Mountains in Pampanga Province, but the military police have not yet approached the mountains. The situation throughout the provinces of Central Luzon is volatile because the Hukbalahap have adopted guerrilla tactics and do not hold fixed lines. Congressman Consunji, under heavy escort, arrived in Cabanatuan, saying that he carried a secret order from Roxas. This trip appears to be a last-minute effort to contact the leaders of the Hukbalahap in order to avoid widespread bloodshed.

[United Press, Manila, 31st] The new Republic of the Philippines faces a major test as an independent nation. Today, President Roxas sent a strongly worded letter to Hukbalahap leader Taruc, criticizing him for abandoning and undermining the pacification plan. Roxas had previously received a letter from Taruc, declaring that his subordinates would resist the disarmament order, hence this warning. He also announced that the government will confiscate all unlicensed firearms starting Monday and will prevent unauthorized gatherings of armed personnel.

### India's Interim Government on Eve of Inauguration - Riots Break Out Again Across Country - Nehru Delivers Important Speech - Willing to Maintain Friendship with US, China, and UK

[Report from Our News Sources] London, Day 1 Radio Broadcast: India's interim government is scheduled to be established tomorrow, with Nehru and a dozen others holding an inauguration ceremony. However, on the eve of this important event, riots broke out again in Bombay and other places today, resulting in over 50 deaths and injuries, as well as incidents of looting and arson.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st] On the eve of the inauguration of India's interim government, Nehru stated in a speech: "The new government of India must pay close attention to international events and adopt an independent policy consistent with its own national interests. We fully agree to recognize the Republic of Indonesia. India and the United States should cooperate economically and agriculturally to improve the living standards of Indians. In the past, Britain did not allow India to interact directly with other countries, so there was no opportunity for development. India should fully participate in world affairs, which will certainly contribute to world peace and the establishment of freedom. Although we are busy with domestic affairs, we must pay close attention to international events. This is what we are willing to do, and at the same time, no country can afford to ignore international developments. I am not yet in a position to elaborate on India's foreign policy, but the principles I stated in March remain largely unchanged. Of course, India should be closer to countries that support its independence. India's general policy is naturally to promote peace, prevent aggression, and assist the people of Asia and Africa in gaining freedom as much as possible. We are willing to maintain friendly relations with the three great powers on a basis of complete freedom. Regarding China, although we are not in a position to interfere in the internal affairs of others, we sincerely welcome the unity and establishment of democracy in China."

Hurley, now a Republican candidate for senator, is running against New Mexico's Democratic Senator Chavez. Chavez has accepted the foreign situation as a campaign topic. Hurley continued, "The Atlantic Charter stipulates that the Allies will never seek to expand territory or otherwise, but our State Department allowed the Soviet Union to acquire Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, part of Finland, half of Poland, and control over Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and part of Germany, making the Soviet Union the strongest nation in Europe. "Our representatives at the Yalta Conference again compromised with the Soviet Union, giving it half of Sakhalin Island, all of the Kuril Islands, control of half of Korea, and the right to enter China's Northeast Provinces and Inner Mongolia. We are now rapidly compromising with the Soviet Union, giving it control over China, making the Soviet Union the strongest nation in Asia."

Nelson recalled his conversation with Stalin, saying, "The clash between two major countries that have never fought each other is the most devastating thing that can happen. I believe we share this view. The fate of humanity truly depends on the continued friendship and cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union."

Journalists' Day: A Commemoration of Two Emotions

### Joyfully Celebrating the Festive Day; Mournfully Lamenting the Martyrs; Minister Peng and Mayor Wu Attended the Commemorative Meeting and Delivered Speeches; Thirteen Deceased Colleagues Received Memorial Certificates

Yesterday was the second "September 1st" Journalists' Day since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Journalists and news practitioners in this city celebrated enthusiastically. In addition to the Field Reporters Association, which held a pre-celebration party the night before, the Journalists' Association held a commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department and Mayor Wu attended the meeting. Over two hundred reporters from various newspapers attended. The auditorium was decorated with red and green colored silks, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious and pleasant. The meeting began at 11:00 AM, chaired by the Executive Directors and Supervisors of the Association: Feng Youzhen, Cheng Cangbo, Chen Xunxun, Zhan Wenhuan, Ma Shuli, Yuan Yeyu, Xu Zhucheng, Wang Jinqi, etc. Feng Youzhen, as Chairman of the Presidium, led the salute and delivered the opening remarks, stating: Today is the first Journalists' Day after the victory. We are very excited and very touched. In the past eight years under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, our colleagues in the Shanghai press, in order to fight for national freedom and national survival, did not hesitate to brave dangers and make sacrifices. Every word and sentence was controlled by the enemy and puppets. Many martyrs followed one another, undaunted. Their loyalty, bravery, and heroic spirit are truly excellent models for us. In the year since the victory, the Chinese press has undergone tremendous changes, and the goal of freedom of speech has been achieved. Therefore, I have two feelings: (1) Our press has the responsibility of leading society. Now that the goal of freedom of speech has been achieved, all reports in the future must be detailed and accurate. We must not listen to hearsay and record everything we hear, but we must have a sense of responsibility. (2) Many countries around the world have recovered after the war, and even Japan has embarked on the road to recovery. However, our country, as one of the four powers, is still in turmoil. We should work harder to lead the people onto the road of peace, unity, construction, and progress. Regarding partisan strife, we must distinguish right from wrong, and with the spirit of fighting for national freedom and national survival in the past, lead society and complete the important task of national construction.

### Memorial Service Held at the City Chamber of Commerce This Morning

The Journalists' Association held a memorial service at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 10:00 AM this morning to commemorate the loyal and heroic spirit of the members of the Shanghai press who sacrificed their lives for the country during the Anti-Japanese War. Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Cangbo, the Executive Supervisors of the Association, were appointed to preside over the ceremony, with all the Executive Directors assisting. The somber atmosphere was evident with white horses and plain vehicles.

### Journalists Bear Significant Responsibility During the Constitutional Period

Following this, Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department delivered a speech, stating: After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we are able to hold the Journalists' Day celebration in Shanghai today. This is the result of the wise leadership of the supreme leader and the sacrifice and struggle of the military and civilians throughout the country. The grand plan for the next century will focus on national construction. The government has decided to convene the National Assembly on November 2nd, promulgate the Constitution, and implement constitutional governance. All major national plans will be decided by the people. Government officials must be honest and abide by the law. The military will be solely responsible for protecting the country and must not interfere in politics. The safety of the country is the responsibility of the people. Therefore, the press has a greater responsibility to lead society during the constitutional period. All reports should be authentic and should have an objective and fair attitude.

### Pay Attention to Social Morality; Assist in the Implementation of Municipal Affairs

Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating: I have two hopes for the press as I participate in the Journalists' Day celebration today: (1) Pay attention to social morality and report as much as possible on news that promotes good and hides evil. For example, the charitable deeds of Mr. Gu Qianlin, the host of the Shu-Ping Scholarship, should be publicized and encouraged. (2) Whenever a problem arises, detailed records should be taken to provide the government with great assistance. Regarding the strict crackdown on theft at the docks and the banning of street vendors, Wu said that if the public opinion believes that the facts require it, then consistent publicity will provide great help in the implementation of laws.

### Memorial Certificates Awarded to Deceased Colleagues at the Meeting

Following this, honorary memorial certificates were awarded to the deceased colleagues during the Anti-Japanese War. First, Feng Youzhen reported that the colleagues in our press who were brutally murdered during the enemy's occupation of Shanghai would be commemorated at a meeting in two days. The Association specially awarded honorary memorial certificates to the colleagues who were arrested and subjected to torture, to express , Wang Kun, Wang Peiyuan, Gu Zhiwu, Wu Chengde, Shao Xiehua, Zhang Yiping, Zhang Cangping, Gu Junyuan, Jiao Chao, Gao Jilin, and Yan Guili. After the report, Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Cangbo, the Executive Supervisors of the Journalists' Association, presented the awards. Finally, two motions submitted by the Association were passed: (1) To pay tribute to President Chiang, the full text of the telegram is as follows:

### Respectfully Telegram to the President

To President Chiang of the National Government: The country is in distress after the war, and the people are impoverished. Thanks to your wise leadership, peace will surely return to the country, and construction will begin. Your grand plans are admired by all. On the occasion of the Journalists' Day, we respectfully send this telegram to express our respect. We respectfully ask for your attention. The Shanghai Journalists' Association and all members of the press kowtow. (2) To request the National Government to commend the martyrs of the Shanghai press who died during the Anti-Japanese War and to provide compensation to their families.

An ad hoc motion: On July 1, 1940, the puppet organization Wang Jingwei issued arrest warrants for 83 key figures in Shanghai from the Party, government, military, industry, commerce, culture, and press who adhered to the national policy of resisting Japan. Twenty-seven of them were from the press. Except for Comrades Zhu Xinggong, Jin Huating, and Zhang Sixu, who were killed, and one or two who were unclear about their attitude, the remaining comrades either went to Chongqing, disguised themselves and went abroad, lived in seclusion, stood their ground, or were captured and imprisoned, enduring all kinds of humiliation. Their spirit of hard struggle, loyalty, and unwavering commitment should be commended by the Central Government through the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly, and medals should be awarded to encourage them. The General Assembly adjourned at about 12:00 PM after playing music and completing the ceremony. In the evening at 7:00 PM, a garden party was held at the Nanhai Garden on Nanjing West Road, with dinner and entertainment such as games and raffles. About 500 colleagues from various newspapers participated, making it an unprecedented grand occasion.

### Ningbo City Councilors Seek Opinions from Fellow Townsmen

Since the City Council meeting is imminent, Ningbo City Councilors, in order to diligently seek public opinion and gather wisdom from all sources, requested the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association Council on the 30th of this month to convey to all Ningbo fellow townsmen in Shanghai their opinions on municipal administration and reform, so as to provide reference. It is reported that the Association Council has agreed to proceed.

### Shanghai Port Committee to Hold First Preparatory Meeting Today

In order to improve the situation of congestion of ships in the port of this city and to organize the order of loading and unloading materials at the various wharves along the river, the Executive Yuan ordered the Municipal Government of this city and the Ministry of Communications to be responsible for establishing the Shanghai Port Committee to specifically handle the import of ships, the unloading of goods at the wharves, and the clearing of warehouses, and ordered Mayor Wu to concurrently serve as the chairman. Since the order arrived, Mayor Wu immediately planned to convene various agencies such as the Dredging Bureau, Police Bureau, Garrison Headquarters, Jianghai Customs, and the Ministry of Communications to organize and establish the committee. However, the list of representatives nominated by the various agencies of the Ministry of Communications has not yet been delivered. Chairman Wu believes that the port situation urgently needs to be improved and that it is difficult to delay further. Therefore, it was decided that today, representatives from the participating agencies would be convened to hold the first meeting, with the aim of organizing and establishing the committee in the near future to be responsible for improving the efficiency of material transportation, so that imported ships would not be detained for a long time.

### Business Tax Transferred to Local Government; Tax Bureau Has Not Yet Received Orders

According to the person in charge of the financial authorities of this city, the reporter of Datong News Agency was informed that due to the hot weather this month, the business of entertainment venues has sharply decreased, resulting in a decrease in the entertainment tax, which accounts for a large part of the tax revenue of this city, compared to last month. The expenditure department has increased more sharply than last month. The business tax allocated by the central government to this city for collection was originally scheduled to be transferred to local collection on September 1, but it was not transferred by the Direct Tax Bureau yesterday. It is reported that the Direct Tax Bureau has not yet received orders from the central government.

### First Batch of US Congressmen Arrives in Shanghai; A Group of Six; To Inspect US Troops Stationed in China This Morning; President Song and Mayor Wu Invite Them to Lunch and Dinner

Eleven members of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, after inspecting various American-held islands in the Pacific, arrived in China in two batches. The first batch of six members was originally scheduled to arrive in China the day before yesterday, but due to bad weather, they arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Korea at 4:30 PM yesterday, landing at Jiangwan Airport. The second batch of five members will also arrive here at 6:00 AM tomorrow morning. After the six congressmen who arrived in Shanghai deplaned, they were entertained at a cocktail party by US Consul General in Shanghai Davis. In the evening, they were feted by General Gillen, the commander of the US forces stationed in Shanghai, and Ambassador Stuart, who recently arrived in Shanghai, was also present. This morning, they will inspect the US troops stationed in China and have important discussions with senior officials of the US military headquarters in Shanghai. At noon, they will be hosted at lunch by Mayor Wu, and in the evening, they will be hosted at dinner by President Song Ziwen. Because the congressmen arrived in Shanghai one day later than the scheduled itinerary, the work procedures have been slightly changed. After all eleven members have arrived in Shanghai and completed their work, they will fly to Beijing to visit President Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall for important discussions. They will then travel to Beiping for sightseeing and leave China around the 6th or 7th of this month to fly to Tokyo and return to the United States. They will make a report on their observations in China.

### One Hundred and Fifty Foreigners Apply for Naturalization in China

Among them, 30 are German and Italian expatriates, and the other 120 are Jews and White Russians. These foreigners have lived in China for decades and are well-versed in Chinese customs and habits.

Shen Xiaofeng is hereby appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff of this Headquarters." It is now learned that Mr. Shen will take office within days. According to this personnel adjustment, it is the first adjustment made by Commander Xuan after taking office as Police Commander.

### Universal Good Harvest Nationwide; Ample Grain Reserves in This City; Minister Xu is Optimistic About the Future of Grain

This reporter visited Xu Kan, Minister of Food, who arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month, to inquire about the current grain policy measures. Mr. Xu first stated that this year's nationwide harvest is universally good, especially in Sichuan Province. There is no need to worry about food shortages for the people, which can symbolize a peaceful scene. As the saying goes, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and disgrace." Food is the most important thing for the people. Ample grain is a great help in both politics and construction. As for the grain reserves in this city, they have always been extremely abundant. During the period of grain shortage, early preparations were made, and foreign rice was ordered and imported successively. Soon, another 50,000 tons of Annam rice and 30,000 tons of Siam rice will be imported. Moreover, the new grains of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are gradually appearing on the market, and the grain price will definitely not rise, and there is even a downward trend. Regarding the problem of the Communist Party controlling the grain-producing areas in North China and the South trying to help the people in various places, Mr. Xu said: This is a natural fact. However, the people in the North mainly eat flour, and the scope of exports is limited to wheat and sorghum. Mr. Xu further elaborated that the collection of actual grain in various provinces and counties is being carried out successively in accordance with the established national policy, and the situation is very good. The government has formulated reduction and exemption regulations for disaster-stricken areas to show concern for the hardships of farmers and ordered them to be followed. Wartime grain loans are also repaid with principal and interest annually in accordance with regulations.

### Liang Jingzhong Discusses the Grain Situation in the Northeast

[Another Dispatch] According to Liang Jingzhong, the Special Commissioner for Grain Administration in the Northeast who returned to Shanghai last week, he was ordered to go to the Northeast again from Beiping in March of this year to handle grain administration facilities in Liaoning, Liaobei, and Jilin provinces and successively went to various places for inspection, lasting for five months. The above-mentioned places are nominally three provinces, but in reality, there are only forty counties. The common crop is sorghum, followed by millet, barley, and rice in fourth place. Rice was not grown in the past. During the Japanese occupation, water and electricity were used to develop rice paddies and increase rice production. On the one hand, Korean people were relocated to promote planting. However, the local sorghum and millet have bumper harvests every year, and there is no problem with the people's food supply. There is also a surplus to be transported to North China for assistance. Recently, the Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group went to the Northeast for inspection. In response to the actual needs of various places, they have formulated a detailed plan for improving agricultural implements and seeds in the future. Once approved by the Sino-US government, it will be implemented. In the future, it will be of great benefit to the improvement of agricultural products in the Northeast. Mr. Liang said that the Japanese had an aggressive ambition to develop the eastern provinces in the past. The Xiaofengman Power Plant, the source of the Songhua River, is a clear example. The equipment in this plant is the best in East Asia and is enough to make the Northeast harvest abundant crops, and electricity is supplied to factories throughout the territory. In the future, when the political situation in our country is clear and various aspects enter a normal track, it is urgent to use this kind of equipment, and the harvest will be inestimable. Moreover, the people in the Northeast have a simple and honest style, the soil is fertile, the living standards are not high, and the factories are complete, which is enough to be a prelude to brightness. Mr. Liang added that soybeans are also a famous product, and exports to the United States and Canada were very large before the war. At present, soybean cake is only worth 10 yuan in circulating currency per catty, which is equivalent to 130 yuan in national currency. On the 15th of last month, it was approved for export by the Economic Commission. Such measures will increase the fertilizer for crops in Taiwan Province and increase the income of local farmers. As for the grain processing plants in the area, there are about 2,000 small-scale ones, which are regularly put into operation. The five larger-scale ones have been sold first in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan. Regarding the progress of the collection of actual grain, Mr. Liang said that due to climatic reasons, the autumn harvest is later than in the Jiangnan area and will only begin to be promoted around November. Mr. Liang's return south this time is specifically to report to the Ministry, and he will have to return north in a week.

### Soldiers Have Dispute on the Bus; Ticket Seller Is Detained

[This Newspaper] The French-operated Route 18 trolleybus was traveling from the Great World to the Xieqiao area at 7:30 PM last night. When it reached the Jinling Road intersection, the traffic light was red, so the driver stopped there temporarily. At that time, the Golden Grand Theater was just letting out, and twelve sailors came out and wanted to take the trolleybus. However, the ticket seller, Liang Guanghui, refused, saying that opening the iron door halfway was a violation of regulations. Who would have thought that these soldiers would climb in through the windows, and the two sides had an argument. When the trolleybus reached the intersection of Kangti Road and Father Du Road, the soldiers and the ticket seller started arguing again and almost clashed. Passengers intervened to stop them. But when the trolleybus arrived at the terminal, all the passengers got off the bus, and the soldiers dragged the ticket seller Mr. Liang off the bus and took him to the Nanshi area, and his whereabouts are unknown. Subsequently, another ticket seller reported the incident to the local police station, describing the incident in detail. The police dispatched personnel to investigate separately and found that the ticket seller had been detained in the naval training camp at the original site of the Jiangnan Shipyard. After receiving the news, the French trolleybus workers were outraged. The authorities are currently investigating the responsibility for the conflict.

### Shanghai's Firefighting Work is Constantly Improving; Many People Enthusiastically Apply to Become Firefighters

[This Newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Fire Department of the Shanghai Police Bureau, this city currently has about 700 firefighters, most of whom are experienced, and some have even served for 20 to 30 years. Because these personnel are insufficient, two open recruitment drives have been carried out successively, and they have been assigned to work in various districts. This recruitment is the third phase, and the number of applicants is extremely enthusiastic. Since the advertisement was published on the 26th, about 100 people have been going to the department to register every day, and some even come from Hangzhou. The criteria for admission are based on physical strength as a prerequisite, stipulating that the height is above 5 feet 5 inches, the weight is above 60 kilograms, and the age is 20 to 25 years old. Unmarried persons with a junior high school education or equivalent are qualified. After registration, the applicant must first be examined by the police hospital. After passing the examination, they must also test their physical strength and arm strength, such as weightlifting and rope climbing. Only after passing all the tests can they participate in the written test. After being admitted, they must enter the Fire Department training class for a period of three months, mainly to teach basic firefighting techniques, such as the use of different ladders. After the training period, those with good results will be allowed to be assigned to various fire brigades to practice at the fire scene, but it is stipulated that they are not allowed to leave their jobs within one year, otherwise they must compensate all the costs of their training period.

According to recent statistics, the department currently has the following number of vehicles: a total of 39 fire trucks, one heavy truck, one ambulance, seven hospital vehicles, two lighting vehicles, and six fire hydrant inspection vehicles.

The person in charge of the department also said: Firefighting work is different from other jobs. Firefighters must be prepared to depart day and night and must risk their lives. At present, their treatment is the same as that of civil servants. Because the cost of living is currently high, many people have recently resigned. If this phenomenon continues to occur, it is really worrying.

The only difficulty they currently feel in their work is that the fire hydrants are damaged from time to time. The reason for this is that citizens who are greedy for small gains often steal water without permission and do not turn it off afterward. And some naughty children put stones into the hydrants, causing them to be damaged. When they are needed, there is no water to release. During the fire on Huade Road, the surrounding hydrants were all damaged, and the water hose was extended to 1,300 feet. Therefore, in addition to sending fire hydrant inspection vehicles to various places every day for strict inspection, the department also hopes that citizens can cooperate closely and should deeply understand that the fire hydrants near their homes are also a guarantee for their own lives and property and must be carefully protected.

In order to improve the firefighting work, the department is planning to order several of the latest fire trucks from the United States. These vehicles spray carbon dioxide to extinguish fires and are specially used for extinguishing oil fires. He finally said that in this city's urban planning, the firefighting in Shanghai will serve as a model for the whole country, so the department has been working hard to improve it recently.

### The Largest Cinema in the Far East; MGM to Build in Shanghai

[This Newspaper] The American MGM Film Company is preparing to build the largest cinema in the Far East at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Meibage Road in this city. All plans have been decided, and it only awaits the approval of the Municipal Government before it can be realized.

### Gold Coins Road Bund Discovery - A Box of Hand Grenades

[Our Correspondent] The Huangpu Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau reported yesterday at 10:00 AM, based on a report from traffic police officer number 701 in West, that a box of hand grenades had been found at the Bund on Gold Coins Road. The bureau reported the matter to the Huangpu District Military Police, who immediately dispatched two military police officers accompanied by police officers to the Bund to investigate. They found a rectangular red iron box, about one inch high, at Wharf No. 1 on the riverfront. Six police officers had already temporarily cordoned off the area. After the military police opened the iron box, they found twelve slender wooden-handled grenades, wrapped in oiled paper. Each grenade was marked with red flame numbers and had several Japanese characters at the bottom. A wire with a small copper ring, presumably a "pull ring," was attached to the side of the grenade. However, they were slightly different from other wooden-handled hand grenades. The box of hand grenades was then transported to the armory of the military police headquarters for safekeeping. An investigation is underway to determine the source of the firearms.

### Speculation Failure Leads to Suicide - Indian Man Hangs Himself

[Our Correspondent] An Indian man named Mao Taibaike Kesa, 32 years old, who was the Deputy Manager of Xiangji Foreign Firm located at 671 Sichuan Road, took on the position after the outbreak of the Pacific War. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, he suddenly sent the store clerk, Qu Axing, out on an errand under the pretext of delivering something. Mao then hanged himself on the balcony of the foreign firm's second floor. When Qu returned to the firm, he searched everywhere for Mao but could not find him. When he went to the balcony, he was shocked to see what had happened and immediately reported it to the Huangpu Branch. Zhou Guanghui, the Chief of the Criminal Division, immediately ordered divisional members Song Yuanshan, Qian Sun, and Yi Hai to rush to the scene for investigation. They found that Mao was already dead. Qu Axing was taken to the bureau for questioning. He said that he had been working at the firm for 31 years. At 4:00 PM today, the British Manager of the firm returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. They had originally agreed to meet him together, but unexpectedly, Mao committed suicide. It is reported that the Indian man had engaged in speculative trading and embezzled public funds, resulting in excessive losses. When he suddenly heard that the British Manager was coming to Shanghai, he feared that the matter would be exposed, and therefore took this final path.

### Guardians of Navigation Safety - A Chat About Pilots

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] In the water transport sector, there is a profession called "pilot" or "water guide." Their position can be said to be the shipowner's advisor, and their task is to guide the ship's course when it enters a port or sails a waterway, avoiding all obstacles and dangers. Because each port or waterway has its own special conditions, and these are constantly changing, this situation may not be familiar to the shipowner. In order to ensure safety, it is necessary to hire a "veteran" pilot to guide the way.

Shanghai, as a large metropolis, has many ships entering and leaving the Huangpu River every day, so the business of "piloting" is naturally more developed. Since September of last year, this industry has undergone a great transformation. At the beginning of the victory, because the first to arrive in Shanghai were the American Navy, the task of "piloting" was entirely undertaken by them. Later, everything slowly returned to normal, and it was taken over by the Chinese people, managed and controlled by the trade association. Before the war, the government had a management agency for pilots under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. After the victory, it was reorganized into the National Water Guide Management Committee, which was transferred to the Ministry of Transportation. Due to the difficulties of transportation recovery, the Shanghai office was not established until April of this year, and after considerable twists and turns, it took over the management rights from the trade association. However, the pilot industry in Shanghai is currently divided into three categories: first, the piloting of ocean-going vessels, which is managed by the customs, with a total of 22 people, only two of whom are Chinese. Their work area is from the Bund to the Wusongkou. Second, the short-term piloting of inland river routes, which is managed by the Water Guide Committee, with a total of more than 100 people, all of whom are Chinese. Their work area is from Shanghai to Hankou. Third, the long-term piloting, which is directly hired by the shipping company with long-term contracts, totaling about 50 people.

Except for those with long-term contracts, the income of the pilots is collected monthly by the主管部门主管當局 in proportion, based on the size of the ship they piloted. Currently, the income of ocean-going vessel pilots is about 700 US dollars per month. The income of inland river pilots is much lower. The Water Guide Committee stipulates a monthly subsidy of 70,000 yuan, plus 20,000 yuan for each business trip, and an additional 100,000 yuan for dispatching naval vessels. In addition, the total monthly income is also distributed in proportion. It is said that the monthly income per person is not very good, only about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Most of the pilots are from boatswain or have been captains. The licenses issued by the customs in the past are still valid. For those who have not received a license, the Water Guide Management Committee will hold an examination in the near future to assess their abilities and issue licenses. The qualification requires at least two years of experience as a captain or seven years of experience as a boatswain. The subjects of the examination, in addition to Chinese and English, focus on waterways, followed by customs collision avoidance skills. If they fail the exam, they will still be given the opportunity to practice. As for the training of new talents, there are no specific plans yet.

### Xikou Road Scene is Desolate - American Goods Stall Prosperous Dream

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday was the first day of enforcing the ban on American goods stalls. The reporter visited the Xikou Road (Zhu Baosan Road) area and found the situation to be very good. All stalls had complied with the order to cease operations. A large team of police officers patrolled the area in the morning, but soon withdrew. Empty cans, garbage, and other debris scattered on the ground were also cleaned up by street sweepers. There were few pedestrians on the road, and the scene was desolate. Only a few vendors who had been banned were gathered in groups of three or five, discussing the matter. Some said, "This ban was initiated by those big companies," expressing their indignation. Others said, "Today is the first day, of course we have to give the mayor some face. Let's see what happens later. When our stomachs can't take it anymore, we'll just break up into smaller units and secretly set up shop elsewhere." Some also believe that the municipal government is determined to enforce the ban this time, and there is no reason to be optimistic about a resurgence. The reporter listened for a long time, and the biggest impression he got was that these people felt lost about their future livelihoods.

[Our Correspondent] The Wen Lanting traitor suspect case, which has attracted much attention, has had its public hearing postponed again and again due to the defendant's illness or refusal to appear in court. Although the court held the first trial on the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, it only summoned witnesses, and the defendant himself was not interrogated due to illness.

The inspectors will bring the forms with them during the inspection and fill them out, with a deadline of the end of the month.

### Q&A on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(58) Question: If there is a permanent personnel change that does not fall under the nine types of personnel registration, how should it be registered?

Answer: The Measures for the Registration of Migratory Population are intended to supplement the deficiencies in the nine types of personnel registration under the Household Registration Law with respect to population changes. However, permanent population changes should be classified into the nine types of personnel registration according to their nature. Other permanent population changes that cannot be classified can be registered as establishment of household registration.

(59) Question: If a person is adopted as a son and then taken back by his biological mother for upbringing, what type of registration should be made?

Answer: It should be handled in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 1083 of the Civil Code.

(60) Question: How should personnel changes other than birth, death, marriage, and divorce be handled?

Answer: Separate and appropriate personnel registration or migratory population registration should be made for each case.

(61) Question: When applying for adoption registration and termination of adoption relationship registration, how should the registered domicile of the adopted child be filled out? Also, when registering marriage and divorce, how should the registered domicile of the female party be filled out?

Answer: When applying for adoption registration, the domicile of the adoptive parents should be filled out. When applying for termination of adoption relationship registration, the domicile of the biological parents or their new domicile should be filled out. When applying for marriage registration, the domicile of the female party should be filled out as the domicile of her husband. When applying for divorce registration, the domicile of the female party should be filled out as her original or new domicile.

### Protecting Production, Assisting Government Orders: Joint Meeting of Cotton Product Industries Decides on Rectification Measures; Factories Without Production or Those That Have Suspended Production Are Not Allowed to Apply for Purchase; Product Prices Are Not Allowed to Be Raised; A Special Evaluation Committee Is Established

Since the foreign exchange fluctuations and the sharp rise in the black market price of cotton yarn, various cotton product reproduction industry associations have felt difficulties in obtaining goods, and the cost of products has lost a correct calculation standard. Applying to the Textile Construction Corporation for the allocation of purchases seems to be extremely popular on the surface, but in reality, the sources are limited and the destinations are numerous, so the gains are very limited. Moreover, because the actual allocation is small and the purchase orders are more numerous, those who apply but do not get them are asking the respective associations for relief. Leaders of the dyeing, knitting, underwear, handkerchief, towel, blanket, and handmade cotton weaving industries have held joint meetings to discuss solutions. They all agreed that production should be protected and that fueling the black market price of yarn should be avoided. Steps should be rectified, and the difficulties of the Textile Construction Corporation should be understood in order to assist the government's orders. Recently, the various associations have convened meetings separately. According to authoritative sources, the joint measures have been decided as follows.

(1) When members apply to the Textile Construction Corporation for purchases, the Textile Construction Corporation often does not have enough time to check the size of the factory and the degree of its operation, and allocates a minimum amount uniformly. This is due to insufficient investigation data. The association has decided to re-investigate and compile statistics for the reference of the Textile Construction Corporation.

(2) Factories without production or those that have suspended production are not allowed to apply for purchase and sale.

(3) The association will dispatch staff to secretly investigate the market. If members are found to be selling purchase permits or opening goods to the Textile Construction Corporation on behalf of non-members, strict measures will be taken to crack down on them.

(4) The selling price of finished products shall not be raised except for maintaining legitimate profits. The association will set up an evaluation committee to control the matter.

(5) Because of the lack of capital in the handmade cotton weaving industry, the association acts as a unit to open goods to the Textile Construction Corporation. However, the number obtained is often not enough for distribution. Assistance should be given after the production equipment is investigated and clarified.

The above measures have been discussed several times. The various associations believe that they should be implemented uniformly. According to those familiar with the market situation, autumn sales are about to be launched, and the supply of cotton products should be increased. The various industries also plan to express their opinions to the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association in order to establish contact with the centralized sales organization of private yarn factories.

### Meeting of Sponsors of the Securities Exchange to Be Held on September 3

[Our News] The Securities Exchange convened its 14th Preparatory Committee meeting at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, with all preparatory committee members present. During the meeting, the internal organization and personnel issues of the Securities Exchange were discussed. At the same time, the review of listed securities was also discussed. Those with incomplete procedures will be notified to complete them separately. Furthermore, the Securities Exchange has scheduled a meeting of all sponsors for September 3 in order to elect the directors and supervisors of the Securities Exchange.

### Reopening of the Bank of the Mainland's Hongkou Branch

[Our News] The Bank of the Mainland originally had a branch in the Hongkou area. It was withdrawn during the war. It is now planned to reopen this third branch, commonly known as the Hongkou Branch, on September 5. The manager will be concurrently held by Mr. Wang Zengqing, the assistant manager of the Shanghai branch.

### Flat-Price Sugar

Universal Sales Starting from the 4th; Purchase Two Jin with ID Card

The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is preparing to sell Taiwanese brown sugar to citizens through South Goods stores as the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches. The South Goods stores have already started selling at designated locations. It is generally expected that the universal sales will begin on the 4th of this month. The sales method for this period has been agreed upon by the Social Affairs Bureau and the South Goods Commercial Association. Each person can purchase two shi jin (approximately one kilogram) with a National ID card at a price of 850 legal currency per jin (30 yuan more than the previous period).

### Three Banks and Two Bureaus Express Dissent Regarding the Measures for Repaying Pre-War Debts

The financial and industrial circles of this city have expressed dissent regarding the recent court ruling on the measures for repaying pre-war and wartime debts. It has been learned that the authorities concerned have jointly sent a letter to the Four Joint Offices at the end of last week, requesting that it be forwarded to the government, demanding that the funds be returned according to the original amount of legal currency. The reasons are as follows: (1) It is considered inappropriate to repay the principal at a thousand times the original amount, as ruled by the court. The three banks and two bureaus do not provide long-term loans. The loans they handle are all short-term loans of three to six months, which were gradually recovered during the war. (2) The court ruled that additional interest should be paid on deposits, arguing that loans obtained during the war could yield exorbitant profits, and that creditors would suffer excessive losses if they were repaid at the original amount after this currency devaluation. However, the lending of the three banks and two bureaus has always been based on low-interest loans, and there are no exorbitant profits to be made. Not only is this the case for the banks and bureaus themselves, but the borrowers also cannot obtain exorbitant profits. This is because the borrowers of the banks and bureaus are not speculators or purely commercial organizations. The loans are provided to legitimate production enterprises, and the losses suffered by these production enterprises during the war are obvious to all.

### Recent Situation of Overcoating Fabrics

Overcoating fabrics are in greatest demand during the autumn and winter seasons and also occupy one of the most important positions in the wool fabric market. In previous years, they would have been launched on the market successively around this time. This year, due to the arrival of imported goods, general users and buyers are deliberately delaying their purchases. Therefore, only a few transactions have been concluded on the market. This is the mentality of the buyers, so the market is naturally even slower. However, inconvenient transportation and unstable situation are also factors.

### Prices of Dried Lily Flowers Are Firm

The market for dried lily flowers in Shanghai has been slightly stable recently. Because last year's production was scarce, the prices remain firm. According to reports from Xuzhou, the higher-quality goods are priced at 180,000 to 190,000 in Shanghai. The goods from Zhenjiang are in short supply, and there are no good goods at prices of 180,000 to 190,000. In the Wuxi market, good goods require around 200,000 to 210,000 yuan.

### Central Bank to Exchange Central Reserve Bank Notes Starting Today

The outstanding amount of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes that were not exchanged was previously registered by the Central Bank. The Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for handling them and instructed the Central Bank to notify all registrants to submit the original notes for exchange into legal currency. It is learned that the exchange period was originally scheduled from September 1 to the end of the month, for a period of one month. However, because yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, the Central Bank has scheduled the exchange to begin today (2nd). Those who have registered to exchange counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes can exchange them with the documents issued by the bank. After the deadline, they will become waste paper, and the exchange period will not be extended.

### Taiwan Land Bank Officially Established Yesterday

The Taiwan Land Bank was officially established on the 1st. The bank was reorganized from the Japanese Hypothec Bank of Japan, which was taken over by Taiwan Province. The Taiwan Provincial Government has recently appointed Huang Tong as the general manager.

### Tax Bureau Adopts Corresponding Measures to Cooperate with the New Exchange Rate; Deals with Price Gouging and Cracks Down on Street Vendors

[Our News] The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that at the beginning of the new exchange rate adjustment, in order to concretely implement this policy, the bureau has decided on three measures and strictly instructed its subordinates to handle them: (1) From the position of this tax bureau, it will fulfill its responsibility to maintain the stores and firms. In particular, it will pay attention to a kind and sincere attitude in its work in order to achieve the task of cultivating tax sources. It will also reiterate the previous order that absolutely no harassment is allowed. (2) It will closely monitor speculators taking the opportunity to raise prices and create disturbances, and deal with them effectively in accordance with the tax law. (3) There are numerous street vendors in this city, which has a great impact on the business of legitimate stores and firms. This bureau has long planned to crack down on them. Now that the city government has decided on measures, it will strictly order the offices in various districts to investigate and handle them effectively. The above three measures have been sent by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to various industry associations a few days ago for their information and to inform all members.

### Exchange Rates and Prices

The composition of prices is not solely dependent on exchange rates, but there is no doubt that exchange rates are one of the causes of prices. Therefore, with this exchange rate liberalization, there is a possibility that prices will fluctuate accordingly, but it will certainly not be equal to or exceed the increase in the exchange rate. If there is a phenomenon as described above, unless it is due to a temporary stimulus, it is done with ill intentions. The purpose of this exchange rate liberalization is to revitalize domestic industry and commerce and develop overseas markets, not to create opportunities for speculators and profiteers. Therefore, in addition to assuming the responsibility of cracking down on and punishing them, the government must also simultaneously implement other policies that are related to suppressing prices.

Prices are composed of costs (including raw materials, wages, depreciation), expenses, interest, taxes, and profits. As for the impact caused by supply and demand, it is only the elasticity of profits. Therefore, the increase in costs due to the exchange rate liberalization, if within the scope of profits, should not be raised in price in principle. However, the ultimate goal of an enterprise is naturally profit. In order to maintain industry and commerce, the government must protect its legitimate profits. With legitimate profits, it is not easy to create a black market. At the same time, in order to seek welfare for the public, it cannot but restrict its profits. With restrictions, it will not be cried all the way. Therefore, in the transitional period between war and peace, control and freedom, especially in the selfish China and the Shanghai that is obsessed with profiteering, the evaluation system seems to be the reason for promotion. Also, because of the evaluation, there is something to follow in cracking down on and punishing.

Goods can be simply divided into three categories: (1) imported foreign goods, (2) domestically manufactured goods, and (3) domestic agricultural products. Now, if we analyze the intrinsic situation of each type of goods, then we can understand the other related countermeasures that should be implemented in addition to the exchange rate policy, and the targets that should be under the evaluation system. At the beginning of peace, the profits obtained by importers were about three to four times as much. After that, as more goods arrived, the profits decreased slightly. Recently, private goods have been rampant, and theft has been prevalent, so that importers are no longer able to profit completely. Therefore, from the perspective of prices, if the government can eradicate smuggling and theft, there may not be drastic changes due to exchange rate changes. If we add an evaluation system, we may even be able to promote its decline.

Although the raw materials, machinery, and tools required by Chinese factories cannot be separated from foreign goods, they are not all foreign goods after all. Therefore, the result of the exchange rate changes will certainly not be equal to or exceed the increase in the exchange rate. Now, in addition to the government's exemption of export tariffs, it is also necessary to return export commodity taxes if necessary. Then it can directly develop foreign sales, indirectly encourage increased production, and reduce costs. If we add low-interest industrial loans or overdrafts and implement an evaluation system, we can ease the domestic stimulating prices and enable various industries to achieve a peaceful adjustment. The increase in the prices of products will certainly affect fertilizers and the cost of living of farmers. In the exchange rate change, it seems that the government's restriction on the price increase of agricultural products is lacking in fairness. However, the price fluctuation of agricultural products is relatively calm. If the government can eliminate harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and prevent disturbances, and at the same time hold low-interest agricultural loans that match the name and reality, implement evaluation, and investigate measures such as the cost of living index of farmers, or it can make the exchange rate stimulating fluctuations even calmer.

In short, in order to prevent price fluctuations caused by changes in the exchange rate, the government must pay attention to several countermeasures that are related to prices: (1) Eradicate smuggling and theft. (2) Crack down on unreasonable shipping costs. (3) Exempt export tariffs. (4) Return export commodity taxes. (5) Provide low-interest industrial loans or overdrafts. (6) Effectively provide low-interest agricultural tools. (7) Prevent disturbances and enforce the rule of law. (8) Prohibit harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. (9) Universally implement the evaluation system. But whether the so-called evaluation is a clean and competent evaluation of official-civil cooperation, otherwise it is more than enough to lead the price increase, and it is difficult to see fairness.

### The Pain of the Concerned

— Zhou Houjun

(I) A Comparison of Three Facts

I returned from Chongqing and, due to illness, resided in Suzhou and Shanghai. Recently, I returned to Zhenjiang, which I had been away from for nine years. What are the fruits of victory gained from the blood and sweat of millions of soldiers and civilians? This is the question I most urgently needed to answer upon my return. For example, in Suzhou, the masses held large-scale, frenzied processions to welcome the gods. A kind of fervent emotion and devout attitude made us suspect that this world was not yet in the atomic age. What was most shocking was the groups of young men and women, burning meat incense and striking hand-held gongs while laughing and chatting freely. This is probably regarded as a faithful expression of their devotion to the deities! From these welcoming processions, we can see that the collective recreational environment of the people and their new beliefs have not been established, which is indeed an important reason.

Upon returning to Zhenjiang, many refugees from northern Jiangsu came to weep and recount the situations of struggle and purges they had endured. The cruelty of these events seemed unprecedented even during the Japanese occupation, and I found it hard to believe. Inciting and rewarding tenant farmers to kill each other, especially smaller farmers, what was the purpose of this? Was it really just to fight over a bone? No, this is a conspiracy to get poor people to be cannon fodder, using them to exhaust the Kuomintang's bullets. It is a complete implementation of a policy of using famine and violence to drive the people to kill each other in order to seize power. I cannot help but ask, why is this kind of brutal force able to spread everywhere like a prairie fire? Where does the government's responsibility lie?

As for Shanghai, it is a paradise of extravagance and luxury for the rich (!). Taking glassware alone, it is draining away a large amount of the blood and sweat of our compatriots. This kind of phenomenon is, of course, because the rich have forgotten the disasters everywhere. What has been gained from eight years of bloody cleansing is merely the revival of a colonial slave mentality! At the same time, these kinds of consumer goods are invading everywhere, indirectly destroying the foundation of the vast countryside. What effective and concrete countermeasures has the government taken in terms of economic measures?

The welcoming processions in Suzhou demonstrate the feudal forces' counterattack against nation-building; the weeping complaints of the refugees in Zhenjiang demonstrate the obstruction of violent autocracy to nation-building; and the extravagance and unrestrained indulgence in Shanghai demonstrate the attack of the colonial slave mentality on nation-building. Although the three are expressed in different ways, the result is undoubtedly the same: suicide. Seeing the nation and people encounter this extreme crisis, can those who care remain indifferent? How should we struggle in the future? How can we be worthy of the countless soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the eight-year war of resistance?

(II) Three Things to Weep Bitterly For

Today's world, especially today's China, is in a state of extreme turmoil, with the danger of sinking and being destroyed. It seems that every problem has no proper solution, so everyone seems to feel extreme depression and worry, and is uneasy all day long.

For example, the realization of peace is originally the unanimous demand of the entire country, but today it has become a tool for ambitious people to seize territory, harm the country, and endanger the people. The ancients said: "If one values profit before righteousness, one will never be satisfied with what one seizes." In political consultations, everyone does not discuss how to truly implement the Three Principles of the People or effective ways to save the country and the people, but only haggles over the distribution of committee seats and the reorganization of a certain number of troops, seizing territory, fearing that it is not enough. There are even those who fan the flames and cheer, believing that this is a prerequisite for peace. However, they do not know that "valuing profit before righteousness" is only enough to fuel internal strife, prolong the suffering of the people, and make peace impossible for a long time. Using this kind of method to strive for peace, everyone should remember the story of "climbing a tree to catch fish." They only see the pitiful small plots of land of small and medium-sized farmers and do not hesitate to resort to cannibalism, forgetting the large tracts of virgin land on the border that have become a problem, and forgetting where the large number of machines in the three northeastern provinces have gone. Furthermore, no one has been heard advocating investigation. What kind of heart is this? This is the first thing to weep bitterly for.

Even more ridiculous, some people, under the anti-American movement, deliberately create alarming scenarios of a US-Soviet war, forgetting that their own house is already on fire. If this kind of argument really provokes a US-Soviet war, will the Chinese people be the first to go to war, declaring war on the United States first? At that time, please close your eyes and imagine what state the country would be in? If the nation and people really fall entirely into the arms of the Soviet Union and do not know how to be independent and self-reliant, who will be the favored ones? Currently, some people are openly selling out the personality of the nation and people, shouting the slogan of "international intervention." China, instead of being decided by the people, is decided by foreign countries. What about "democracy and independence?" All of this is thrown to the back of their minds. Originally, the purpose of using force is to promote "international intervention." What kind of heart is this? This is the second thing to weep bitterly for.

Burning meat incense to flatter the gods and using the means of liquidation and struggle to drive compatriots to kill each other in order to seize power are both "birds of a feather" in terms of rationality. Watching compatriots suffer from the oppression of famine without any compassion, living their luxurious lives in extravagance, this is the same as using famine to drive people to be cannon fodder, both being "cannibalistic" in human nature. Speaking of this, it reminds me of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The leaders of the Chinese-style Communist Party must know that playing with fire is not a joke, and the lives of the nation and people and tens of millions of ordinary people are important. Some people say: "Foreign systems and methods, although old, Chinese people like to use them as novelties to deceive their compatriots; but when they get into the hands of the Chinese, they all turn bad." What pitiful and heartbreaking words these are. This is the third thing to weep bitterly for.

Therefore, I thought of what Mr. Hu Shih said at a reception for the cultural circles in Shanghai, urging everyone to think more and study more: "If you think, you will gain; if you do not think, you will not gain. Since everyone's root cause of illness is in abandoning conscience, please use thought to find your conscience back." "There is no greater sadness than the death of the heart!" This is absolutely true. "Hanging meat incense," extravagance, and "struggle and liquidation," as well as those who consume white powder due to depression, are all seeking temporary pleasure, comfort, and excitement. The most pitiful and painful are those ignorant people who consume white powder, becoming more and more addicted, until they collapse! For now, rescuing people's hearts is the top priority!

(III) Returning to the Countryside

The ancients said: "In famine years, children are often violent." They also said: "Only when people are adequately clothed and fed do they know honor and shame." The Kuomintang has been in power for twenty years, and the legislation of the Three Principles of the People has achieved much. The resolutions of the Kuomintang's past national congresses, as well as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's past messages, and the book "China's Destiny," all extensively and repeatedly discussed things like the progress of cooperative enterprises, the resolution of the land problem, the promotion of agricultural industrialization, the determination of various social policies and agricultural and industrial policies, as well as so-called water conservancy, so-called finance, and so-called medical administration. If you study them carefully, there are indeed many good laws and good intentions. If they were implemented gradually, they would be enough to make the people prosperous and happy. Why is it that today there is still the fact of "leading beasts to eat people," happening in a raging fire? This is certainly due to the years of warlord separatism, imperialist aggression, and the mischief of the Chinese Communist Party, which has left the government no time for construction, but the government cannot deny its "incompetence." Waiting until the fire is on the house, without extinguishing it, yet still calmly allowing the division of the property inside the house; the flood has already broken through the embankment, without rescuing it, still arguing over the distribution of the land inside the embankment. In this situation, the government is duty-bound. Today, the only way for the government to free itself from blame is to quickly implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's messages, and fulfill the promises of past national congresses. There is no other way to go.

To quote another old saying: "The wise know everything, and know what is most urgent to do!" Now, in addition to military affairs, the work of putting out the fire should be done with politics. The current crisis no longer allows military setbacks or political toleration of evildoers! The current military setbacks have already disappointed the people; politics must not create sources of unrest. According to the current situation of the recovered areas in northern Jiangsu and the Communist Party's wandering in southern Jiangsu, their method of breaking up into smaller units can only be solved by "politics." Southern Jiangsu is again using military force to prevent riots! To be honest, if politics always relies on guns and does not revitalize itself, then internal strife will never have a day of peace! Strictly speaking, today we must not only implement "70% politics, 30% military affairs," but simply 90% politics and 10% military affairs. Because the governance and chaos of society depend on the support and opposition of the people's hearts. It must be known that the Chinese people are the most lovable. If the government can be clean and bright, the people themselves will rise up to curb the beginnings of chaos. If the government does not trust the people and the people have no self-defense force, then thirty to fifty armed unscrupulous people will be enough to coerce the vast number of farmers and start riots. Quickly re-cultivate the people's self-defense force! The people will choose their own path. It depends on whether the people used by the government truly love the people and can lead the people by learning from them.

As for the urgent tasks in terms of political measures, it is undoubtedly the rural problem. The Chinese revolution was originally meant to relieve the suffering of the majority of farmers. In terms of politics, the main task should be to revitalize agriculture. At the same time, in China, which is based on agriculture, the primary task in nation-building should also be to prosper the countryside. In response to the current situation, in order to save the crisis, the first priority should be to rescue the countryside.

Whether it is rescuing the countryside, building the countryside, or revitalizing the countryside, the first step is naturally to solve the land problem. Dr. Sun Yat-sen instructed us that the policy of "land to the tiller" should be implemented without delay. After World War I, many countries in Eastern Europe, such as Poland and Romania, used government funds to buy land and distribute it to tenant farmers; they issued land bonds and recovered the land of landlords that exceeded their ability to cultivate, and then redistributed it. This was what our Founding Father instructed long ago, and there are also good regulations. Today, there are three land problems in China: too much wasteland, weak productivity, and distribution problems. Now these three items should be resolved at the same time by taking the opportunity, and only by taking overall consideration can both ideals and facts be properly resolved. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and Industrial Plan, as well as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," are really great plans. The government should no longer delay matters by paying attention to some insignificant details and show some courage to do things practically. Great plans must be done by taking advantage of the situation and must not be achieved by delaying and perfunctory measures.

Furthermore, cooperative organizations are an effective way to "make the best use of people's talents," "make the best use of the land," "make the best use of things," and "make goods flow smoothly." Consumer cooperation takes the interests of consumers as a prerequisite, and production and marketing cooperation takes the interests of producers as a prerequisite, and is also a bridge to agricultural industrialization. Only by transforming small farmers into large farmers and combining the strength of many people into one can agricultural industrialization be completed. In this way, the function of cooperative organizations can be fully realized.

However, the current situation of cooperative organizations has not given full play to their functions, and has even become a tool for exploiting farmers and increasing the oppression of farmers. This should be immediately reviewed, improved, and expanded. Whether the current agricultural loans are truly benefiting farmers should also be reviewed. In the future, the targets of loans and the implementation of land tax collection should all be based on cooperative organizations as the target and as the tool, and all agricultural construction work should be coordinated with the promotion of cooperative organizations. In this way, cooperative organizations can develop universally and complete their functions.

Other constructions, improvements and guides such as water conservancy, transportation, and agriculture, as well as the management and cultivation of agricultural and sideline industries, all need to be reviewed, improved, and implemented practically one by one, and we must not relax the high-level coordination and appropriate use of various materials from international relief and assistance.

The four words "ignorance," "poverty," "selfishness," and "weakness" are the common symptoms of the Chinese countryside, so it is not enough to just solve the problems of livelihood and wealth, and we should also step up the work of "education." Past education was isolated, and rural mass education was even more isolated. The entire Chinese education system needs to be reformed practically in accordance with national conditions as soon as possible. Mass education should be closely coordinated with "medical administration" and various agricultural construction efforts and promoted simultaneously. Is it enough to set up some mass education centers to do some decoration to be considered doing everything possible? Rural mass education should focus on adult remedial education, and it must be closely coordinated with various rural revitalization efforts. Its educational content must be coordinated with the needs of various rural revitalization efforts. Like Denmark, the United States, and the Soviet Union, they divide adult and children's departments in national schools, and Japan has special remedial schools in national schools. In China, where farmers account for 80% of the population, is the proportion of education funds used in rural-related areas reasonable compared to the burden on farmers? This is a question that deserves our deep reflection and introspection.

However, the political system should also be re-examined. Taking various political measures related to rural construction as an example, has the lack of coordination in the past reduced much efficiency? Since the main political measures in the future are aimed at the countryside, various works related to rural construction should first be carried out in a unified manner. Only in this way can the expected results be achieved. This is what I solemnly propose as an aside.

(IV Reform of Political Conduct)

The fundamental problem in current politics is the problem of political conduct, and the problem of political conduct lies in being able to employ people wisely, using only the virtuous and the capable. The failure of current political conduct lies in the failure to distinguish between the wise and the foolish, the virtuous and the unworthy. Therefore, those who are speculative, opportunistic, flattering, and smiling all get the chance to advance through connections, while just and virtuous people are sometimes rejected. May I ask, how can this kind of personnel arrangement meet the needs of the work? How can this kind of work assessment achieve the practical effect of governance? Going a step further, the big disease in Chinese politics is "isolation." Those who bear great responsibility must first seriously examine their own past trusted people. Therefore, to select the virtuous and appoint the capable, please start with your own subordinates, and please start with those who bear the negative responsibility!

Mencius said: "A ruler who will accomplish great things must have ministers who are not summoned." The so-called ministers who are not summoned are precisely the virtuous and capable. The so-called "Nine Rank System" in the Wei, Jin, Sui, and Tang dynasties can still be used for reference today. Striving for the virtuous and capable is really a prerequisite for turning danger into safety and restoring order. Based on this, responsible officials must thoroughly change their style and emulate the spirit of the Duke of Zhou, who spat out food in his mouth and held his hair three times while bathing. The rise and fall of the nation and people also depend on this. A revolutionary party must always pay attention to refining talent and promoting talent. Refining talent is nothing more than six words: "democracy," "unity," and "unification." Seek democracy with an open mind, use democracy to strive for unity, and use unity to strive for unification. The so-called democracy must be closely coordinated with workers, farmers, division of labor, work assessment, and work competition, so that everyone has the opportunity to offer opinions and contribute abilities. If work assessment is democratized, then right and wrong will be clear; if work competition is democratized, then rewards and punishments will be fair; if talents are democratized, then they will naturally unite and generate strength. The power of unity is built on democracy. What cannot be unified? Only a high degree of democracy can achieve truly centralized unification, and only then can it innovate, eliminate the old, and continuously strengthen itself. This is the most reasonable principle of party organization and political system!

(V) Conclusion

Mr. Yen Hui-ching said at a welcoming banquet for Mr. Hu Shih a month ago that the problem of China is a matter of time. I feel that the problem of China has reached a critical juncture of survival and is not to be delayed or waited for. Today's problem is not a problem of right and wrong, but a problem of "affirming what is right" and "denying what is wrong." Since we know that robbing chickens is wrong, why wait? The ruling Kuomintang and the virtuous people of the whole country should take the hunger and drowning of others as their own, and after self-reflection and self-blame, work together and strive to eliminate selfish thoughts of the small self or faction, and move forward in unity. Under this kind of united struggle, all the corrupt and evil forces of "leading people to feed people" will naturally tend to disappear. However, when moving forward in unity, we must eliminate the "weeds among the seedlings," the "purple among the vermilion," and all the ambiguous gray elements. This kind of hypocritical, gray element has misled the Kuomintang and the nation and people in the past, and is most likely to speak for the enemy and discourage patriots. We must eliminate these fake revolutionary elements in order to establish a grand plan for democracy, strengthen revolutionary unity, unify the power of construction, and accomplish the task of revolutionary nation-building. Under our strong and just struggle, as Mr. Yen said, the solution to the problem is just a matter of time.

A Proposal for Constructing an Overpass

In the most prosperous areas of transportation, such as north-south and east-west interwoven routes, where all kinds of vehicles converge to an extreme degree, in order to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians, the police must temporarily cut off one route to allow vehicles on the other route to pass. Such repeated cutoffs cause vehicles to stop and go, with the time spent stopping being more than twice the time spent driving. Pedestrians lose their autonomy when crossing the road and sometimes rush across the road, which is extremely dangerous and can even cause injury or death. In order to avoid danger and congestion, and to allow vehicles and pedestrians to pass safely and smoothly in an orderly manner, the best solution is to construct an overpass. For example, in the section of Zhongzheng Road and Xier Road, where various vehicles go south and north and pedestrians connect, if an overpass is first constructed in this section, vehicles and pedestrians going south and north can pass over the bridge. The bridge surface can be paved with sidewalks on both sides, and the direction of pedestrians coming and going on both sides can be strictly regulated, as well as whether they should walk on the bridge or under the bridge surface. In this way, they can walk in order without being threatened by vehicles. The underside of the bridge can be equipped with fluorescent lights, with the right level of brightness. The pedestrian path under the bridge should be paved in the same way as the roadside. Then the movement of pedestrians and vehicles can be orderly, safe, and spectacular. However, whether the overpass requires additional precision design for small turns and interwoven roads with trams must wait for the research of experts.

Truth About the Suspension of Yucai Night School

To the Editor: Regarding the suspension of the night school at our school, we would like to provide the following explanation: In March of this year, our school, in accordance with the instructions of the Education Bureau, established a night school for the masses in order to cooperate with the work program of eliminating illiteracy and promoting education. Teachers and staff of our school, together with high school juniors and seniors, volunteered to teach. At the beginning, we originally planned to enroll illiterates in accordance with the bureau's order. However, fearing that it would be difficult to enroll students at the beginning and affect the opening of classes, we admitted those who had received three or four years of education, resulting in uneven student levels. Therefore, we divided them into three levels: high, medium, and low. The high level is equivalent to the fifth and sixth grades, the medium level is equivalent to the third and fourth grades, and the low level is equivalent to the first and second grades.

When the semester ended in July of this year, we originally planned to close the high level, graduate them, and enroll new students. However, the high-level students were eager to learn and repeatedly requested to continue their studies. The teachers and students who volunteered to teach, considering their suffering from dropping out of school and their eagerness to learn, used their summer vacation to hold a summer class for remedial instruction. Moreover, the subjects offered were not limited to those stipulated by the Education Bureau. Now that the end of the summer class is approaching, students in the business level have requested to continue running a junior high school. However, because the original intention of the Education Bureau in ordering the opening of mass schools is limited to eliminating illiteracy, and the formal opening of junior high school classes must first obtain the consent of the Education Bureau and go through registration procedures before it can be handled, we could not rashly agree. However, in order to take into account the students' desire to learn, we introduced the students to the Zhongzheng Night Middle School, which was established by the Youth Corps in the factory school. Therefore, if these students are interested in learning, they can enroll in that school. This is the actual situation. It seems that there are some discrepancies with the letter forwarded by your newspaper. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the truth, we have briefly stated the situation for reference. (Respectfully submitted by Zhi Fan, Principal of Municipal Yucai Middle School).

### Reader Proposes Installment Payments of Tuition Fees and Discounts Based on the Original Standard

Authorities Should Pay Close Attention to Excessive Burden on Parents

Reader Shao Bingjin wrote to our newspaper, saying: "To the Editor, although the issue of tuition fees this semester has been repeatedly raised by parents, it has received little attention. The media and the Education Bureau sympathize with the school's arrangements, which is of course partly justified. However, according to what I (an employee of a Qianzhuang) know, a certain school related to the Qianzhuang industry recently held a meeting to discuss and calculate that tuition fees of more than 10,000 yuan can be collected, and requested each Qianzhuang to deposit 200 to 300 yuan, with interest at a rate of one jiao per month. It is estimated that more than 1,000 yuan of interest can be collected each month, which is enough to cover expenses. All the tuition fees will be the school's profit. By this example, the school can be said to have entered a golden age. Now, reading the newspaper, I learned that the mayor convened a meeting of private school principals at 2:00 p.m. on September 2 to discuss the issue of tuition fees. My opinion is that it is best to pay in installments according to the original standard, and those who are willing to pay in one lump sum should be given a discount. The same should apply to meal fees. Now, in private schools, except for universities, the tuition fees of primary and secondary schools are mostly paid painfully in order to avoid my brother from dropping out of school. The discount part should be ordered by the Yellow Decree to be returned to the school based on the original receipt. Is this appropriate? Please ask readers to review it fairly for the mayor to adopt. Knowing that the Agricultural Newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people, and this matter concerns education, I trust that it will be published in advance. Please be safe."

### Current Status of Automobile Production in the United States

— By Ying Dai

The lack of accessories and some raw materials has caused difficulties for American automobile factories. General industrialists are even more convinced that this situation cannot improve in a short period of time. The annual output of automobiles will also be much lower than expected. If the current situation does not change, then the assembly rooms of major automobile factories will inevitably find it difficult to produce two million passenger cars. This is more than half less than the scheduled plan for 1946. Looking back at the end of the European War, the result of the United States' efforts to restore normal automobile production in ten months was the manufacture of 300,000 new cars.

General Motors experienced a labor strike for nineteen weeks during these ten months and only resumed work at the end of May. Naturally, automobile production was severely affected. Ford Motor Company has been making every effort to mass produce since July of last year, but due to the shortage of steel, it was once forced to shut down for a week. All assembly rooms were shut down, and there was no production. When production was halted at the end of May, the average daily production was 3,500 cars, while normally it could produce 5,000 cars. Chrysler, together with all its branches, produces 2,500 cars per day, but due to the lack of raw materials, it will definitely not increase in the short term. The large strike also caused the Airflow assembly room, which produces the most cars for Chrysler, to shut down for many days, and the impact was not small. Packard was shut down for nine weeks due to lack of parts. Although it tried its best to resume work later, production could not be increased in the short term, especially due to the shortage of steel. Although Studebaker has a plan to manufacture the 1947 model new car, the assembly room was once shut down.

The serious problem currently facing the American automobile manufacturing industry is the insufficient supply of steel plates for making car bodies and mudguards, as well as various other steel castings. Several automobile factories stated that their buffer inventory is running low, while other automobile factories are producing cars without buffers at all. Regarding the raw materials, parts, and accessories for manufacturing cars, no automobile factory has what can be considered an average inventory. Inconvenient transportation has also affected the production of various automobile factories. During the four-and-a-half-month strike period, General Motors had a large amount of raw materials and accessories in stock, so their car production work should not be affected for the time being in the coming months. Various automobile factories have paid special attention to the strike issue of coal miners because this could reduce steel production and indirectly affect automobile production.

### From Water Power to Atomic Energy

— Translated by Lin Han

Three hundred years ago, on May 23, 1646, America began its first patent grant.

Jiseph Jenkes, a restless young man, left his homeland—England—in 1642 and came to Lynn, Massachusetts, where he helped establish the flourishing iron industry of the British colonies in America.

Jenkes discovered abundant and untapped natural treasures in the land he moved to. His greatest need seemed to be for some machines to help humans work, so he devoted himself to this issue; until March 6, 1646, he applied for a patent for a water-powered sawmill, which he praised as a "water-powered grinding machine."

The Massachusetts government granted Jwnkes a patent for fourteen years. This was the first time the government had rewarded an inventor based on the National Patent Conference. Subsequently, other colonies followed Massachusetts and implemented patent laws to encourage new inventions.

George Washington and Thomas Jefferson firmly believed in the method of rewarding the work of authors or inventors with patents. When the United States Constitution was drafted, everyone insisted that it should include provisions empowering Congress to establish a patent system.

In 1790, the first United States Patent Law was enacted; the first patent granted by the United States government under this law was for the method of manufacturing caustic potash.

For forty-six years, almost all patent applications were approved, and little attention was paid to the inventions and their origins. Later, in 1836, all records of inventions and patents were destroyed by fire, marking the beginning of the reform of the patent system.

Congress established the Patent Office as an independent agency, and the patent numbers started from scratch again. Patent No. 1 was granted to a congressman named John Ruggles, who had made discoveries on the already rudimentary steam train.

Since then, nearly three million patent cases have been granted. In 1946, exactly three hundred years after Jenkes obtained the first patent in Massachusetts, the United States government approved the patent for atomic energy. In three centuries, mankind has jumped from the age of water power to the age of atomic energy. Who knows how far mankind will progress in the next three hundred years!

The protection of patent law is certainly a factor in the expansion of American industry. Patents are extremely important for individual inventors and smaller manufacturers. Patent protection often becomes the only way for them to compete with large industries in the business arena.

The United States has a strong patent protection system, but the concept itself is not new. Because before humans discover good ways of doing things, everyone has tried to obtain the benefits of their invented ideas. It is said that the world's first patent was granted to a cook in ancient Greece; he invented a new and delicious food, and the local emperor gave him the exclusive right to manufacture, use, and sell it.

On the plaque in the Washington Patent Office entrance, is engraved a famous saying by Abraham Lincoln, an inventor who has obtained several United States patents:

"The patent system adds the fuel of interest to the fire of genius."

### Worthy of Attention: Cultural Primary Schools and Industry

— By Fei Wen

More than a decade ago, the Chung Hwa Book Company had a scientific equipment factory. It recruited a group of apprentices aged thirteen or fourteen and taught them crafts such as manufacturing model specimens of scientific instruments, which were close to works of sculptural art. This group of apprentices was strictly managed, and they themselves were willing to work tirelessly. After work, they formed a research association, always had their fists ready for practice, and were always studying and reading related patterns and books. Among them, the colleagues considered the outstanding ones to be Zhou Shichen, Ding Peiqiang, Zhu Jinyu, Zhao Libo, Sun Boying, and Zhong Jiaqin, six people in total.

Unfortunately, the war broke out, and the Chung Hwa factory was forced to close down, so they lost their jobs—not only lost their jobs, but also lost their research base. For the sake of bread, they had to go their separate ways to find jobs and change careers, but on the one hand, they still gathered together in secret, studying their beloved crafts with like-mindedness. It was also because of their efforts as human beings that although they changed careers, they all rose up in their non-industry businesses. During the eight years of the war, most of them climbed to the positions of directors or principals of various companies or schools in the business community. In terms of fame and profit, they were no longer what they used to be. Until the victory, from an individual perspective, they had no reason and wanted to "return to their old jobs."

But one thought strengthened their journey. They believed that only if everyone dedicated themselves to the career in which they were "specialized" to seek development, and never took speculation and profiteering as the purpose of life, would it be true patriotism. What's more, the career they wanted to engage in was very obvious, and it was greatly beneficial to the motherland's education!

After deciding, they began to act, not hesitating to turn their years of savings into company shares, not hesitating to take off their long gowns and run back into the factory again. The concepts of fame and profit as directors and principals seemed very indifferent to them. Just like that, a newly established small factory was discovered by people in a damp street on Shaanxi North Road. Its capital was only 40 million, and there were only more than 30 employees, but their love for this cause and their spirit were infinite. The name was "New Chung Hwa Scientific Equipment Manufacturing Factory."

The factory building occupies three floors. According to Manager Zhou, it is enough for current use. In addition to the office, reception room, and material room downstairs, the rest is the rough workshop. The entire second floor is the fine workshop, and the third floor is the staff dormitory, etc. This type of work is extremely fragmented and complicated. The reporter, being a "layman," also found it difficult to describe it in detail. From the vertical aspect of the work, it can be roughly divided into sawing, shaping, coloring, and taxidermy, etc. From the horizontal aspect, there are stone-made, wax-made, paper-made, and collecting and planting native animals, plants, and minerals, and giving them preservative treatment, etc.

As for the products, in addition to various animal, plant, and mineral specimens, there are complete human anatomy, detailed skeletal charts, internal organ classifications, and pathological phenomena such as smallpox, syphilis, alcohol poisoning, etc. If a certain industrial production process uses physical objects to illustrate, as well as scientific instruments used in science, they are all within the scope of work.

Due to the convenience of company paperwork and administration, they also have the distribution of managerial, deputy managerial, and director positions, but there are two points that deserve our attention.

First, they all participate in actual work. Deputy Manager Gong Peiqiang is said to be an authority on wax products, so he spends most of his day in the wax workshop. His shaved head, paired with sleeveless hands, is carving out a child's face with a knife, stroke by stroke. Seeing his great interest and earnestness in his work, it seems that he has long forgotten that a month ago, he was still the accounting director of the Tai Le Dance Troupe!

Second, their life in the factory is like a living group. The reporter saw a factory regulation hung in the reception room, and what was strange was that there was a sentence inside saying, "During work, we are comrades, and after work, we are brothers." It can be seen how much they understand and care for each other. In terms of management, from various equipment, you can see some complete aspects, with daily administrative diaries, factory affairs diaries, and various reports, classified records, etc. This small industry for culture is worth recommending by the reporter, and it is even more hoped that the education community will give it the greatest assistance. All levels of schools and the medical community across the country have suffered losses during the war, and scientific instruments, specimen models, and other stationery that were previously stored have often been lost or damaged. Therefore, adding new ones and repairing them is an urgent need. The teaching method of natural science, as recorded in books, is only a system of sequence. Hearing is not as good as seeing. Having all kinds of physical models ready to give students a deep impression is actually more important than books. According to Manager Zhou of the factory, there are still less than a dozen manufacturers across the country engaged in this industry, which is enough to prove the backwardness of science in our country. Therefore, the new creation of the factory, from the internal words out of the starting point, from the external words out of the need, are worthy of attention. We give the highest sympathy and provide possible assistance, which should be everyone's duty.

### An Overview of Mutual Consultation and Management

— By Xu Baiyi

However, employing female workers or child laborers also has the following disadvantages:

A. Working ability is not as good as male workers. As a result of past factory experiments, the work efficiency of female workers is not as good as that of male workers. This may have a considerable relationship with the fact that female workers do not have to bear household expenses. Because they do not need to bear household expenses, their sense of responsibility is lower. After the sense of responsibility is lower, work efficiency is easily reduced. However, the fact that female workers are physically weaker and cannot cope with heavy work is also one of the reasons.

B. Ladies are prone to absenteeism: The second disadvantage of female workers is absenteeism. For example, during the production period and menstruation, both cause absenteeism. According to the statistics of several manufacturers, the number of absences of female workers is 50% to 100% higher than that of male workers.

C. Female workers need a better environment: Because the bodies of female workers are generally not as strong as those of male workers, the factory environment, such as temperature, air, and sunlight, needs to be better. At the same time, if a large number of female workers are employed, other facilities such as nurseries and breastfeeding rooms are also needed so that female workers can bring their children to the factory. In this way, they can work with peace of mind. This type of equipment requires an expenditure from the factory, but the amount saved in wages may still be worthwhile.

Places like textile factories and yarn factories employ the most female workers, and female workers are more suitable for packaging work.

Use male workers or female workers

Regarding this question, it cannot be generalized and depends entirely on the manufacturing situation. The following principles should be considered:

A. Are male workers or female workers more able to cope with the work that needs to be done?

B. What are the general habits?

C. In fact, is it easier to recruit male workers or female workers?

Regarding the second point, it is very relevant to work efficiency. For example, if a certain type of work is usually done by female workers, then naturally, it is appropriate to employ female workers, because skilled workers can be obtained in this way, and the training work can be saved. Unskilled workers, on the one hand, work slowly, on the other hand, inevitably work substandardly, and on the third hand, easily consume raw materials. These three points are a kind of loss for manufacturers.

Time required other than actual manufacturing

In general manufacturing plants, the time actually spent on the machine often only accounts for one-half or two-thirds of the total manufacturing time (the situation is different). For example, in a printing plant, the time required to print a piece of printed matter on the printing press does not occupy the total time required. For example, cutting the paper into small pieces, washing off the red ink before printing the yellow color, etc., all take a considerable amount of time. If the time on the machine is already extremely economical, and the time spent in other aspects is wasted, then the overall economy cannot be obtained, the speed will decrease, production will decrease, and the cost will increase, and the profit will therefore decrease.

Spring and Autumn

### Respectfully Addressed to Writers and Readers

This publication is a comprehensive literary and artistic supplement. Since the resumption of this newspaper, it has successively received enthusiastic contributions from writers in the literary and artistic circles, providing assistance in many ways; and has also been warmly loved and guided by readers across the country; the editors are grateful and are willing to take advantage of today's Journalist's Day to offer a few suggestions.

Originally, the creation of language and writing, as well as various forms of artistic expression, are nothing more than expressions of human life's will and emotions. The literature and art of any era reflects the influence of the era, and the style expressed in form and the consciousness expressed in content are the achievements of the writer's perception and effort in response to the era, and often enough to shift the direction of the era; therefore, a great era will inevitably produce great works, and great works can further promote a great era. Even in the history of journalism, there is no shortage of famous supplements that have influenced social dynamics. — Today, we are willing to work together with writers and readers across the country based on this understanding, hoping to initially make this publication:

1.  A public garden for writers across the country to publish their works,
2.  A supplement to the spiritual food of the readers of this newspaper.

In order to enrich the content and improve the standards, we especially welcome short literary and artistic essays, poems, novels, fables, essays, and reports of news from literary circles at home and abroad, as well as reviews of literary publications and art exhibitions. The content should be profound and meaningful, and the form may be popular and clear; serious commentary is certainly needed, and humorous and witty comments are also welcome, and those that are time-sensitive are especially welcome. As for the number of words, due to space limitations, it is best to be around a thousand words, which is suitable.

Here, we also hope that readers who love this publication will provide guidance and suggestions at any time and place, just like going to a restaurant or entering a battlefield, ordering food and reviewing plays. We feel that this is the right of readers. And we are willing to declare that we will do our best to follow it within the possible scope.

As for the position of the editor, it is like a waiter in a restaurant or a prompter backstage. As for whether today's nagging has any reference value, it still depends on the acceptance and advice of writers and readers. (Editor) (September 1)

### Summer Night

— Su Dan

The banana trees are green again, it's the season when cicadas are calling!

Do you love the summer breeze? So slowly, so slowly, it's like dragging a piece of light silk, especially at night, when you are enjoying the cool air at night, do you love the stars and the moon? Do you want to understand a little bit of life's revelation? Although the frogs are shouting too noisily. But don't pay attention to this annoying night music, just calm down and lie on a deck chair or lean against the window, silently gazing at the distant stars, that bit of infinite blue light is a long poem that can't be finished, try to use your imaginative key, use your clever wisdom to discover, you will get precious life's revelations, it will make you understand the noble emotions of human beings, the love and hate of the world, the barriers, distance, and envy between people...

When I was young, someone once told me: "A star shows a person's life. When your life ends, a shooting star will fall in the blue sky." Don't think this is an absurd statement. This mysterious symbolic meaning, think about it carefully, and you will feel the preciousness of life. People live among people, just like there is a star in the stars that is your life. Don't be attached to the flowers of spring and the moon of autumn. Only the stars of the summer night will reveal to you a more holy feeling...

Although the color of the summer night is faint, don't sigh the dim starlight. Life is the same. People live for themselves, but don't forget that you live among people. Although the brilliance of a star is weak, and life is not very long, if you can leave a little memory in people, and leave a little thought in other people's hearts... In this way, the course of your life will not be a blank piece of paper. Don't stop on the road of life, don't be lazy, and try to embellish the short years of life with the enthusiasm of life. A person should try to show their own brilliance, just like the stars in the summer night. Even if it is a little blue light, they should leave this bit of light in the world. In this way, you will not have wasted your life in vain.

When you are enjoying the cool air at night, you should appreciate a little more of the stars of the summer night, and you will understand the preciousness of life, and you will understand the revelation of life. For this profound revelation of the summer night, the noble emotions will be purified more sacredly!

### Morning Glow

— Shi Pei

Living in the city, watching the morning glow is just a monotonous or superfluous thing. If you are a person who lives a night life, or is nestled in a deep and solemn mansion, and has not opened your sleepy eyes until the sun is high in the sky, then you don't know what the morning glow is.

Living in the suburbs or in the countryside, getting up at dawn, standing on that wide expanse of grassland connected to the sky, or from those continuous purple mountains lying under the clouds, you can see the morning glow and know that the earth, which was a deathly gray color at night, has been awakened by the abundant light of life, and see the scene of "the plan for the day lies in the morning."

I am used to living in the countryside, and now I also live in a remote suburb far from the city. The grassland in front of the window is like an endless green carpet under my feet. A small forest in the distance leads my eyes to the horizon; every dawn, I open the east-facing window and quietly watch the morning glow in the distant sky.

At first, silvery-white light with a thin mist shines in, and slowly the morning glow is like a magical symphony, gradually entering the joyous, jumping, and sonorous scales from a soft harmony. The red and golden light rings spread out and expand. The colors of the spring of life and the music of the spring of life are playing together, and mankind enjoys the golden sunlight!

Pieces of clouds, some with distinct lines and graceful shapes, and others as fine as fish scales, spread out towards the silent sky. Looking at it, you can find what is beautiful and what is noble in the world. Even if your desolate life is in the twilight years of the fleeting years and has given rise to the idea of being tired of life, the flowing years of life are like passing water, however, quietly watching a piece of morning glow, it adds hope for rebirth and beauty to you.

Those humble villagers who live entirely on the soil of the land, in front of them, only cast a dark shadow of their own, just as they drag the shadow of disaster throughout their lives. However, the morning glow is dyed on their faces and sprinkled on their chests, so that they still work hard without worry. This is the strength that the morning glow gives them. They know how to cherish the hard work of life. When an old farmer carries a hoe and slowly walks across the grass path covered with golden morning glow, silently walking towards the distance, a distant view of a brilliant morning glow shines in front of him, and everything is so radiant. Do you say this is the beginning of life, or the end of life?

I love this morning glow that opens the door of light. Every clear morning, I stand by the window, although my mind is still lingering with the shadow of yesterday's worries, but I push open the window and still recite Tagore's lines: "Our desires lend rainbow-like colors to the life of only gray and white clouds!"

Morning glow full of hope, may you awaken the sleeping people!

### Mountain City Night View

— Haoran

If it can be said that this dull mountain city of Chongqing has something captivating, it must be its hazy, dreamlike night view. Indeed, if you closely follow the overcrowded bus belching black smoke in pursuit of prosperity, if you enter the noisy, chaotic teahouses of all kinds of people to enjoy leisure, if you go to the crowded, vulgar parks to appreciate scenery, then the door of disappointment will open for you, and troubling thoughts will fill your mind, because you are fundamentally on an impossible path. You are lost in the smoke and clouds of fantasy. You must understand that the greatness of Chongqing does not lie in its tall buildings and streets, not in its steep slopes and dangerous cliffs, not in its crowds and noise, but in its dignified and unyielding spirit, which is the only guarantee of the nation's eternal life. Similarly, if you want to appreciate the magnificent and majestic outline of this mountain city, you must stand outside the city and observe it from afar with the eyes of an artist.

Looking at the night view of Chongqing from Haitangxi on the south bank of the Yangtze River, it is truly a beautiful picture, stored in my impression album, and I have not forgotten it to this day. In the vastness of the night, the dense rows of electric lights emit a mixed yellow halo, permeating the sky. The halo is most dazzling above the city, then rises layer by layer, weakening line by line, until it merges with the floating clouds, and one can no longer distinguish where the clouds are and where the light and shadows are! This suddenly rising mountain city, in the vast night light, seems like a crown described in Western mythology, its imposing grandeur truly unparalleled! Yes, it is a crown of the people's century, it is worn on the head of every patriotic Chinese son! It stands tall in the dark days of the past, and no amount of storms and fiery bombs can shake it. It is truly the pride of China; it further projects its light to every corner of the country, giving people groping in the darkness a guide to move forward; giving people sighing in disappointment solace for their hearts!

Standing alone and quietly on the grassy slope, yet the city noise across the river still reaches your ears intermittently, as if telling you that the people of the mountain city are still working day and night to manage their busy lives. This human sound is precisely the melody of life, whether you are happy or annoyed, as long as it is a densely populated place, it will be playing in bursts. How can the mountain city be an exception? However, at this time, the sparse and dense sounds, riding on the gentle night breeze, drift slowly, and there is indeed a pleasant rhythm! When the night, this night of the mountain city full of sights and sounds, unfolds naked before your eyes, how can you not linger again and again, forgetting to return?

Only in the hazy night, only under the drowsy lamplight, is the scenery of Chongqing charming. The bright stars in the sky seem to be blinking their bright eyes in admiration of its majestic appearance, and the gurgling water in the Yangtze River seems to be singing a hymn of blessing for its spectacular sight. Oh, those who are immersed in the beautiful realm of imagination while watching the night view from afar, how can they bear to move and leave abruptly? Truly, if it were not for the mournful long cry of the Yangtze River night ferry, how would one know that the hands of the clock had already passed midnight?

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 20

Based on my observation, at this time, neither side's army has a unified front-line positional warfare. They are probably divided into several areas facing each other, with occasional skirmishes.

"Alright, old man," he seemed to breathe a sigh of relief, "We can get on the main road. I heard our people talking, and there are cars, like rickshaws."

I could also vaguely see the outline of a road about 100 meters away. After walking quickly for a few minutes, I saw a row on the road; judging by the movement, it seemed to be a row of rickshaws, a very long line, about ten or twenty.

Discovering the road and seeing this long row made me feel half as light. I vaguely heard the rickshaw pullers talking boldly about the war, running and talking; it seemed there were also the groans of patients mixed in.

When we cut diagonally across and were about to step onto the road, we suddenly heard the sound of a heavy truck traveling at high speed, coming from behind. In just a minute or two, the headlights were like water columns, shining on the rickshaw row in front.

"Ah... er...!" It was a military truck, with what seemed like a dozen Japanese soldiers on it, shouting and yelling, mixed with two gunshots.

We lay flat on the edge of the field beside the road. The rickshaw row ten or so meters away was already in disarray. Some in the front and back had stopped, some increased speed, some stopped and started. The truck screeched to a halt not far from where we were lying. Fully armed "Imperial Army" soldiers jumped out one by one.

Charge!... "Split into two lines to encircle!" Someone gave the order; the small spotlight on top of the truck had already been turned on, and the chaotic rickshaw row was in a terrible mess under the strong light of the spotlight, because some were still trying to pull their rickshaws and escape into the fields beside the road.

"The rickshaws are full of our wounded soldiers!" Little Tiger said twice, afraid I hadn't heard him clearly.

The "Imperial Army's" brave performance officially began; some used bayonets, some were slightly more humane, only using their guns to thrust and stab. The rickshaw pullers screamed and fled, and the wounded soldiers in the rickshaws either rolled out themselves, or were dragged out, thrown to the ground, stabbed with a knife, or finished off with a shot.

Only one thing I saw very clearly: none of these wounded soldiers and rickshaw pullers had any weapons, not even a bayonet.

"Alas...!" I sighed in hatred. For me, this was an insulting challenge, but what should I do? Even with the headquarters badge and identity, it would be difficult to reverse this tragedy. If I were to fight these crazed Bushido warriors, my personal life would be nothing, but I have a more important mission!

"Can I borrow your pistol for a bit, old man?" Little Tiger had already reached out and grabbed the grip of my pistol.

### Self-Reproach

— Shao Fu

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Chinese journalists can be said to have been worthy of the nation.

Taking Shanghai as an example, after the city fell, they stood bravely at their original posts and fearlessly fulfilled their journalistic duties. From Zhu Xingong to Cheng Zhenzhang, Zhang Sixu, and Jin Huating, one by one, they faced the enemy and puppets, relentlessly criticizing and never cowering! No wonder the senior figures in the journalism world, Mr. Chen Bulei and Zhang Jiluan, encouraged their colleagues in Shanghai who were fighting for national justice to be "first-class journalists."

Those who died heroically for their country deserve this praise, and those who survived that period of shocking and treacherous life also deserve this praise.

Colleagues in the occupied areas worked under the threat of pistols and bombs. In fact, colleagues in the rear, in addition to enemy air raids, air raid shelters, and subsidized rice, all chronically eroded the health of journalists, and their misfortune was no different. Today, as we mourn our fallen colleagues, we should also remember these living fighters who endured suffering.

One thing to be ashamed of is that in these eight years, we have not had a single colleague who died in battle. This fact shows that our efforts have been insufficient. If we had been able to grasp the war news reports more practically, perhaps at least one or two people would have lost their lives so gloriously. This statement is not cruel, and those colleagues who have had experience as war correspondents will admit it after a frank review!

### General "Qiu Ba" Feng Yuxiang

— You Fu

General Feng Yuxiang has been ordered to go to the United States and departs today. Feng came from the rank of private second class, hence the nickname "General Qiu Ba" [literally: General Soldier]. The general's achievements today are entirely due to hard study. General Feng is going abroad today to investigate water conservancy, and it is hoped that he will contribute to post-war construction. Here, we briefly describe some of Feng's spirit of hard study and his anecdotes to express our admiration for the general.

Feng's family was poor, but his father, although he had pawned items in the past, did not neglect his son's education. Even in extreme difficulty, the family still hired a teacher. Therefore, Feng Yuxiang studied late into the night as a child and dared not slack off. But unfortunate encounters followed one after another. At the age of eleven, he lost his mother, and the family became even more difficult. Soon after, the teaching teacher was dismissed, and Feng was forced to drop out of school.

At the age of sixteen, he joined the army and often read books such as "The Case of Peng Gong" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms."

Not Forgetting to Read While Serving in the Army

At that time, when Feng came across words he didn't know in books, he called them "roadblocks." He would temporarily ignore them and continue reading. When he finished a paragraph, he would settle the score with the "roadblocks." He would ask a cook in the camp about those new words. The cook knew more than him and became Feng's teacher. For decades, in his military career, Feng never stopped reading. Until August of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], when he took office as the Director-General of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army and resided in the Five Sages Shrine on Mount Tai for four years, this hard study was of great benefit to him throughout his life. When he came down the mountain, he was already very good at writing humorous poems and had excellent handwriting.

When the Shanghai War broke out in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], Feng took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone, commanding generals such as Gu Zhutong, Chen Cheng, Zhang Fakui, and Zhang Zhizhong, leading troops to defend Greater Shanghai. At this time, General Feng was most delighted, because he was the first person in China to raise the anti-Japanese banner. As far back as the Battle of Xifengkou in the 13th year of the Republic [1924], he struggled against the Japanese invaders with broadswords against cannons, sparing no sacrifice.

Personally Going Out to Raise Donations

When the government moved west, he followed them to Chongqing and still liked to read and write articles. He promoted the Save the Nation Through Thrift movement in Sichuan, and no one was not moved by it. I remember that on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway in Neijiang, he called on hundreds of elementary school students to raise donations for the donation movement, asking them to collect donations from people in the streets and alleys. One day, a privately owned car crossed the road, and Feng ordered the elementary school students to stop the car to donate money. The students followed his instructions and stopped the car. A richly dressed lady was sitting in the car. The students asked her for donations, but she not only refused to give anything but also ignored them, and finally said, "I don't have any money." Later, one of the students reported to Feng, and he immediately went out in person. He said, "Do you really have no money?" She replied, "Really not." He then asked, "The War of Resistance is so tense and enthusiastic, prices are so high, and gasoline is so expensive, why are you driving a car? Do you know that a drop of gasoline is a drop of blood?" The lady had nothing to say. Feng then said, "You drive a private car and you don't have any money? You have no conscience. Okay, if you don't have money, please take off the gold ring and watch on your hand! Our hope is that those with money will give money, and those with strength will give strength!" The lady, knowing she was ashamed, took off the gold ring and watch. The people present at the time all admired General Feng's patriotic enthusiasm!

In Chengdu, he went to the Central Military Academy to give a speech on the donation movement. The officers and students who heard it were heartbroken, and the entire school donated 100,000 yuan from the savings they had accumulated from their daily allowances.

But Feng said, "Comrades in arms should not donate. Shedding blood and sweat is enough."

The Most Eloquent Speaker

Once, he gave a speech at the Shaocheng Public Office. Because the audience had different levels of understanding, he spoke in extremely simple terms. He said, "Our country has been at war for seven years. Leaving aside everything else, let's just take a machine gun. A machine gun's rate of fire is 250 rounds per minute. A machine gun's rate of fire is 250 rounds per minute. From July 7th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937] to now, everyone calculate how many soldiers have sacrificed millions. So, how much ammunition does a machine gun consume, not to mention there's more than just one gun?" An old woman in the audience was so moved that she burst into tears and donated all her usual savings.

Now, General Feng is an old general in his sixties, so he is now semi-retired. But old and strong, he still wants to benefit China, because going to the United States to investigate water conservancy is also doing good for our future generations.

Currently, the general once told a reporter, "National affairs are like water conservancy. There are solutions for national affairs, and there are solutions for water conservancy." We hope that when the general returns home after completing his mission, there will be solutions for both national affairs and water conservancy!

### China's Baojia System is Something India Wants to Learn

— Zheng Fan

According to Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, August 27: "Due to incessant riots throughout India and public security concerns, Interim Government Chairman Nehru has initiated the implementation of a system resembling China's Baojia system to prevent disturbances." That China's "national essence" has actually spread to foreign countries is naturally something that Chinese people view as "sharing in the glory."

Speaking of China's Baojia system, organizations similar to Baojia existed long before Wang Anshi.

The well-field system of 3,000 years ago was the beginning of the Baojia system. Chinese military strategist Jiang Baili once called it a "national defense system that can both cultivate fields and eat and send out troops to fight." Later, the Zhou Dynasty's so-called "five families as a bi, five bi as a lv, four lv as a zu" organization was slightly more precise than the well-field system. The reason why Duke Huan of Qi was able to "restrain the princes and rectify the world" was also due to Guan Zhong's Baojia law of "gui, li, lian, xiang." Qin Shang Yang advocated the "collective responsibility law," although its purpose was to control the people, it also achieved considerable results.

It was not until the reign of Xi Ning in the Song Dynasty that Wang Anshi created Baojia, which can be considered "magnificent in scale and profound in thought," but Wang's Baojia system was still slightly different from today's. In the first five matters, he stated the advantages of the Baojia system, specifically highlighting two: "Observing wickedness and revealing righteousness, and garrisoning troops while concealing their use." However, it was later opposed by all walks of life and did not succeed, but it finally left a concrete framework for the Baojia system to future generations.

After Wang Anshi, there were two people who successfully founded Baojia: one was Wang Yangming in the Ming Dynasty, and the other was Zeng Guofan in the Qing Dynasty. Both of them were just "scholars," but they made many contributions to the technology of implementing Baojia.

China's Baojia system was also stolen by Japan once: the incident occurred after the Sino-Japanese War. After Japan occupied Taiwan, the youths of the island refused to be oppressed and organized righteous armies to resist. The Japanese army repeatedly failed to suppress them and felt very troubled. Later, the "Civil Administrator" of Japan in Taiwan, named Goto Shimpei, learned from the old Chinese rules and strictly implemented the Baojia system. In a few years, the disputes in various places ceased without a fight, and it became a "royal way paradise." Looking back at our country, which has Baojia but does not use it well, it is truly a matter of great emotion!

India also wants to imitate our country in implementing Baojia, and we naturally welcome it. It is just that India today is full of domestic crises, and the government is still subject to the shackles of the British Empire. If the country cannot cooperate, and only learns China's Baojia system as a tool to "prevent disturbances," then it will greatly lose the original meaning of Baojia.

### Where Did Sherlock Holmes Come From (4)

— Translated by Si Dao Ai from Yu Qiang's Original

The Article Had No Sales

This book was completed in the spring of 1886, and in July the publisher Arrowsmith returned it unopened, having not even read the manuscript "sniffed it a few times and ran away." The editor of the friendly Cornhill Magazine, who had paid 30 pounds for a shorter story by Doyle, felt that this book was too short to be published as a standalone volume and too long to be published in the magazine. So, it was placed next to the "Advanced" "Ge De Ge Si Dong Company." The disappointed author himself wondered if perhaps other publishers would be fooled. The newly born Sherlock Holmes almost died at this point.

The Walter Locke Company received the tattered manuscript and read it once. Then, on the last day of October, Dr. Conan Doyle, sitting in the waiting room and smoking gloomily, received a letter:

"Dear Sir:

We have read your story and are very satisfied with it. We cannot publish it this year because cheap novels are flooding the market, but if you do not object to publishing it next year, we are willing to pay twenty-one pounds to purchase the copyright."

Even for the impoverished Dr. Conan Doyle, this was hardly an appealing proposal. But after many setbacks, and with a broken heart, he finally replied accepting it. Sherlock Holmes was entrusted to publishers, printers, and the world: A Study in Scarlet became a chapter in Beeton's Christmas Annual of 1887. The author tells us in his autobiography that he never received another penny from this book. Had its author retained his name, Conan Doyle could have earned a considerable income from this small book due to its numerous reprints and translations around the world.

Today, the greyish paper of Beeton's Christmas Annual of 1887 has become a rarity. The world's discerning bibliophiles regard it as a gem. Equally rare, and perhaps even harder to find, is the second edition of A Study in Scarlet with annotations by the author's father, Charles Doyle. This book was published in 1888, and the publisher also wrote a short preface, a masterpiece of inappropriate rhetoric and comparison.

Limited Royalty Income

At that time, contemporary British literature was very popular in the United States, for one simple reason: because there was no copyright law, it could be reprinted as much as possible without any cost. But even in this situation, publication created many people of prestige. Conan Doyle was also so famous. In England, A Study in Scarlet was quite popular with readers, but was criticized by the critics; but in the United States, it was an undoubted success. Thus, in 1889, an agent from the American Lippincott Publishing Company appeared in London, and he came to visit because of the author's talent.
