### Gillin and Zhou Discussed in Chongqing, Northeast Conflict Resolved to be Stopped, Executive Headquarters to Send Task Force

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Lieutenant General Gillin, the acting replacement for General Marshall, held late-night talks yesterday with Zhou Enlai and Zhang Zhizhong. He further conferred with Zhou and Chairman Chiang today regarding the urgent need to dispatch an executive task force to the Northeast to prevent the outbreak of a large-scale civil war. It is expected that the official announcement will be delayed until tomorrow. It is understood that General Gillin, along with Zhang and Zhou, may personally fly to the Northeast within this week to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. Some sources predict that if the war in the Northeast cannot be stopped, it may trigger even greater conflicts in other parts of China, rendering General Marshall's efforts completely futile. If Zhang Zhizhong does indeed fly to the Northeast, his trip to Xinjiang will be postponed. It is reported that Lieutenant General Gillin strongly emphasized that the situation in the Northeast is currently very tense.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Zhou Enlai returned to Chongqing yesterday from Yan'an and immediately continued discussions with the government. It is widely rumored in the wartime capital that Marshal Marshall will return to China from the United States around April 15th.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Well-informed sources say that the Executive Headquarters will indeed dispatch an executive task force to the Northeast to mediate military conflicts. The task force may consist of five to seven groups. Specific locations have not yet been determined, and detailed measures are still being formulated by the Executive Headquarters. This information has not yet been confirmed by those responsible at the Executive Headquarters.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated: Regarding the Communist Party's recent proposal to extend the ceasefire order to the Northeast and to send an executive task force, the government, out of consideration for the people of the Northeast and to restore local order as soon as possible, has agreed in principle. However, this cannot conflict with the provision in the ceasefire order jointly issued on January 10th that National Army troops are not subject to any restrictions when moving to the Northeast. Furthermore, the Communist Party's troops must not use this as an excuse to obstruct the National Army from taking over areas evacuated by the Soviet Army or to attack areas already recovered by the National Army. All Chinese people desire national unity and complete sovereignty. The disruptive activities of the Communist Army in various parts of the Northeast violate the people's wishes. The Communist Party's Xinhua Daily News has falsely claimed on the 19th and 26th of this month that "the National Army in Shenyang is expanding the civil war by attacking the Democratic Allied Forces," which is a distortion of the facts and confusing to the public.

### Soviet Troops Continue to Withdraw, Personnel of Liaobei Provincial Government Arrived in Changchun Last Night

[This newspaper, Changchun, 25th] The widespread rumor that Soviet troops would suddenly withdraw from Changchun on the 26th has been proven false by the facts as of today. The Soviet troops appearing in the city in recent days are more refined than previously seen, and beautiful blue-eyed, blonde female soldiers with red lips and powdered faces are often seen strolling the streets, in shopping areas and entertainment venues. Based on various indications, there is no sign of a complete departure in the next few days. The troop withdrawal has continued in recent days. When leaving Changchun, most now depart from Kuanchengzi Station (north of Changchun Station), no longer from Changchun Station, which they frequented in the past. It is said that after boarding the train and leaving Changchun, they mostly travel east, passing through Jilin and Yanji to Vladivostok. People here generally hope that the Soviet troops will withdraw as soon as possible. Some people are anxiously wondering if the National Army will arrive in Changchun soon, but when this is asked of our officials, there is no definite answer.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th] The situation in Changchun is developing delicately. Soviet troops continue to withdraw, but in small numbers. Yesterday afternoon, when the Soviet troops in a certain printing factory in Erdahezi finally withdrew, someone witnessed eleven trucks filled with Chinese laborers wearing mixed-color military uniforms being driven away, each truck with two armed Soviet soldiers, along the Jichang Highway. It would be more accurate to call these laborers "troops." At the same time, many armed men of unknown origin are being transported into the city by various means. Yesterday, a sentry from the Second Security Regiment discovered three heavy machine guns hidden in a two-wheeled cart loaded with grass. In addition, there was a coffin transporting weapons and ammunition into the city. According to sources in the transportation sector, three military trains departed from north of Kuanchengzi Station last night, carrying more than twenty Soviet tanks.

[Another Dispatch] The personnel of the Liaobei Provincial Government left Siping by special train last night, but were stopped at the Gongzhuling Station. The railway authorities dispatched another special train to pick them up on the 26th, and they arrived in Changchun that night.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Officials here announced today that Soviet troops are now beginning a large-scale withdrawal from the Northeast. This news was revealed by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Kai in response to inquiries. A large detachment of Soviet troops, accompanied by tanks and artillery, is indeed advancing along the Jichang Highway from Shenyang to Changchun, heading towards Vladivostok, but detailed information is not available. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's announcement that the Soviet troops will complete their withdrawal before April and that a large-scale troop movement has already begun has greatly eased the international tensions caused by the Northeast. However, problems such as the dismantling of machinery and equipment in many mining areas and industries by the Soviet side remain to be resolved.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th] Dong Yanping, the chief of our military delegation in Changchun, held the seventeenth meeting with Soviet Chief of Staff Tiyuzenko at 3:00 PM on the 26th. It lasted one hour, the shortest of all meetings. Afterwards, Dong declined to comment.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 26th] Reports say that the New First Army has arrived at Siping Street, but people in Beiping believe this is premature. Most of the National Army started on foot from Shenyang, and the distance between the two places is 105 miles, requiring at least five days of forced march to reach.

### New Sino-American Commercial Treaty Negotiations Have Begun

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] It is learned that, according to the provisions of the new Sino-American Treaty, the United States and China should discuss a commercial treaty within six months after the end of the war against the common enemy. The U.S. government sent a draft of the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation to our country last spring. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, within its purview, conducted detailed discussions on the draft treaty regarding the restrictions on the acquisition and management rights of foreign property and the rights to enjoy free trade. Countermeasures were formulated, and negotiations with the U.S. side have begun to reach a compromise.

### Personnel of the Northwest Headquarters Are Gradually Going to Lanzhou

Director Zhang Zhizhong Will First Go to Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The Northwest Headquarters will be established in Lanzhou in the near future, and key internal personnel have been gradually going there to prepare. Zhang Zhizhong, the Director of the Headquarters, will fly to Xinjiang as soon as the Military Three-Person Team reaches a final agreement to continue discussing unresolved matters with the Yining People's Representatives, and then return to Lanzhou.

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 25th] Three representatives from Yining arrived in Dihua by plane on the morning of the 25th to continue discussing the resolution of the local incident in Xinjiang. In addition, the newly appointed Xinjiang Supervisory Commissioner, Masud, arrived in Dihua by plane this morning.

### Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group Scheduled to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Finance

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] After a three-hour meeting, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group unanimously passed only one item regarding the wording of the issues discussed: the Kuomintang can only elect Kuomintang members to the National Government Committee, and cannot elect members of other parties. The group is scheduled to meet again on the 28th to reach a final agreement on the organization and establishment of the National Assembly and to ensure that all parties support the organization of the Political Consultative Conference. The group will also seek to reconcile the discrepancies between the Political Consultative Conference and the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee regarding military issues.

### Adjustment of Living Expense Standards for Public Servants and Educators

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] At its regular meeting this morning, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution to adjust the standard for the payment of living allowances for central civilian public servants and educators. This measure will be implemented from March of this year, calculated as follows: Level 1, basic salary of 70,000 yuan, multiplied by 160 (Dihua, Guihua, Baotou, Kangding); Level 2, 50,000 yuan, multiplied by 160 (Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hengyang, Changsha, Kunming, Guangzhou, Xinjiang); Level 3, 45,000 yuan, multiplied by 150 (Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Guilin, Qingdao, Kaifeng, Lanzhou); Level 4, 45,000 yuan, multiplied by 140 (Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Gansu, Xikang, Zhejiang, Fujian, Suiyuan, Yunnan, Henan, Hunan); Level 5, 35,000 yuan, multiplied by 130 (Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Anhui, Ningxia, Qinghai, Chahar). Furthermore: (1) Police chiefs will receive 70% of the basic amount, police officers will continue to receive 60% of the food allowance, and laborers will receive 50%. (2) Shanghai police chiefs will receive 90% of the basic amount, and police officers and laborers will receive 80%. (3) There are already improved treatment principles for civilian officials, and the figures will be formulated separately. (4) The cost of food and non-staple food for officials and students of provincial schools and military academies at all levels will be adjusted separately. (5) Chongqing's allowance is more than 58% higher than in January, and all regions have increased by more than 100%.

### Yang Jie Discusses the International Situation: No War Likely to Occur in the Next Ten Years

[This newspaper, Kunming, 25th] Military theorist General Yang Jie discussed the current international situation and future world wars at a tea party in Kunming hosted by the Kunming branch of the Beiping Research Institute and seven other organizations to welcome Li Shizeng. He criticized the claim that a third world war is about to break out, stating: There are three issues among the great powers: (1) "Gain," (2) "Security," and (3) "Ability." First, they want to gain other people's things. After gaining them, they want to ensure security. To ensure security, they must have the ability. The atomic bomb is the ability of Britain and the United States to ensure security. Due to the competition for ability, international wars seem inevitable. However, given the current situation of various countries, a third world war will not break out in the next ten years. China should strive for peaceful national reconstruction in the next ten years and catch up so that it can cope with the new situation ten years later.

### Senior Government Officials Returning to the Capital, Air Transport to Begin in Mid-April, Chairman Chiang to Return to Nanjing Before the National Assembly Opens

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] In order to alleviate the difficulties of governance and relieve the suffering of the people in the recovered areas, the government can no longer spend Dragon Boat Festival in Chongqing. The transportation arrangements for returning to the capital have been decided. Starting in mid-April, 20 airplanes will be used to transport senior officials from various government departments to Nanjing. After April 20th, the number may be increased to 50. The government has formulated a plan to ensure that senior officials begin work as soon as they arrive in Nanjing. Staff members below the rank of section chief can leisurely enjoy the scenery of the Three Gorges and slowly come to Nanjing by air.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Sources in the wartime capital say that Chairman Chiang will go to the capital on April 20th and stay there until the National Assembly closes. It is not yet certain whether he will then travel to the United States or visit Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Based on appearances, Chairman Chiang has planned a trip abroad and will be accompanied by his wife.

### North China Begins Mass Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners of War Today

[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Deputy Chief of Staff Wu of the Eleventh War Area stated that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war was previously hindered by a lack of ships and slow transportation. Recently, a solution has been negotiated, and starting from the 27th, 4,500 prisoners of war and Japanese nationals can board ships at Tanggu Port to return to their country. Currently, the Eleventh War Area has over 90,000 Japanese prisoners of war and over 100,000 Japanese nationals awaiting repatriation, totaling over 180,000 people including the prisoners of war and nationals from Shanxi.

### Chongqing Post Office Brewing Strike

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Regarding the postal strike, although it has not yet materialized, it has gradually become apparent in recent days.

### Seven Groups Supervise Road Repair, Restoration of Transportation is Optimistic, Railways Will be Unobstructed Within 45 Days

[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Executive Headquarters will soon issue an optimistic statement on the restoration of transportation. According to the Railway Administration Department, North China can prioritize the repair of railways. 20% of its work has already been completed. If the situation is good, all railway lines in the North China and Central China regions will be unobstructed in 45 days. It is learned that there are currently seven groups working in Botou, Anyang, Nankou, Gaomi, Zaozhuang, Xuzhou, and Yancheng, responsible for supervising the prioritized repairs of various lines. The restoration of each line is quite optimistic. Taking Xuzhou as an example, the Longhai Railway is already open to traffic to Haizhou. The Jinpu Railway north of Xuzhou will be able to reach Lincheng in a few days. Trains traveling south from Tianjin can also reach Botou. In recent weeks, railway lines have been able to connect to new areas. In addition to the above-mentioned lines being prioritized for repair, other sections that have suffered minor damage will also be connected to restore transportation. In addition, the restoration of highways is also underway. The Ministry of Communications has sent a highway inspection team to Chengde, Shanhaiguan, Kaifeng, Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Qingdao, and other places for inspection. The Executive Headquarters has issued them travel permits. Sources in the Military Mediation Department stated that the manpower and material resources for the restoration of transportation work cannot be their responsibility. Furthermore, regarding the personnel issues of railways in the Communist-controlled areas, the Ministry of Communications may resolve them through methods such as screening and commissioning.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The road restoration project on the Xuhai section of the eastern part of the Longhai Railway is half completed. If there are no unexpected obstacles, it will be open to traffic at the beginning of next month. The Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway will be difficult to repair in the short term. Refugees are currently using oxcarts as transportation, and it takes ten days to travel from Ji'ning to Xuzhou.

[This newspaper, Ji'nan, 26th] According to sources from the Railway Bureau, the road surface on the highway between Ji'nan and Xuzhou is still passable, and there are plans to send vehicles for trial runs in the near future.

### Difficulties in Implementing Government Orders in Shandong Province, Communist Army Destroys Postal Service

[This newspaper, Ji'nan, 26th] Liu Daoyuan, the director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stated that before the victory, government orders in Shandong Province extended to over 80 counties and 14 special commissioner districts. After the victory, the Communist Army expanded its territory and gradually occupied it. Currently, the government only controls seven cities, six locations, and one municipality. Cadres are clustered in the uncaptured cities, approximately 5,000 people. There are over 14 million unemployed refugees, and the trend of increase continues. According to reporter's inquiry: There are currently more than 50 exiled county governments in Ji'nan, similar to the exiled governments of various countries in Britain during the war. However, their current work is to preserve archives and prepare for the stabilization of the situation before returning to their posts to carry out their duties.

[This newspaper, Ji'nan, 26th] According to those in charge of the postal service here, the postal business in Shandong Province is extremely difficult due to the Communist Army's interference. Before the war, there were over 140 post offices in Shandong Province, but now only 30 or so can maintain contact with the Postal Administration. After the victory, the average total monthly income of post offices throughout the province was only a few million yuan, and after offsetting expenses, the monthly loss was 70 million yuan. In areas controlled by the Communist Army, they forcibly use postal stamps issued by the Communist Army, expel excellent employees, and appoint employees who have been dismissed for embezzlement and malfeasance, disrupting the postal service more than the enemy puppets. Recently, postal employees in various places, unable to withstand the oppression of the Communist Army, have fled to Qingdao and Ji'nan in increasing numbers. They believe that the Communist Army's actions to seize power by any means are unwise.

He reported on the handling of disaster relief work in great detail. As soon as the report was completed, it was time to adjourn the meeting.

### Reorganization of the Military Progressing Smoothly, Returning "Difficult Soldiers" to the Field is the Current Difficulty

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Military News: The work of reorganizing the military south of the Yellow River is largely complete. The reorganization of troops stationed in Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces north of the Yellow River and in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces in the Northwest began in early this month and is proceeding very smoothly because officers and soldiers of all units are able to understand the greater righteousness and appreciate the overall situation. Remaining officers in various places have been provided with the convenience of schooling or career changes in accordance with the planned plan. However, the most difficult problem at present is that of the remaining soldiers in various units who are from Hunan or who are from rural households in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. Today, their hometowns have mostly suffered from the ravages of war and banditry, and there is a serious famine. According to reliable estimates, at least 50% of the farm families in some units are "difficult soldiers" who "have armor to disarm but no fields to return to." Although the Chinese countryside currently needs manpower, the current food situation and rural order in various places are extremely worrying. The best way to settle these "difficult soldiers" is either "farming" or "working as laborers," but it requires the early restoration of transportation. In the past month, the final drafts of the Military Affairs Commission's clear orders urging the restoration of road traffic on all lines have been filling boxes.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The nationwide reorganization of the military will include North China in the ninth phase, that is, from July to September. Deputy Chief of Staff Wu of the Eleventh War Area stated that the reorganization of the military is the demobilization work. The war zone will not be cancelled until this work is completed. Currently, the jurisdiction of the Eleventh War Area is Hebei and Chahar, and as for Shandong, it has been transferred to the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters.

### Indictment of Traitor Chen Bijun

— Our Suzhou Correspondent Qingping

Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Indictment Qi Zi No. 396

Defendant: Chen Bijun, female, age 56, native of Xinhui County, Guangdong, residing at No. 30 Fazheng Road, Guangzhou, former Executive Committee Member of the Puppet Central Palace Department.

Regarding the above-mentioned defendant, case No. 532 Zhen Zi of the 35th year of the Republic of China, regarding the matter of being a traitor, the investigation has been concluded, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be initiated. Now, the defendant's criminal facts and evidence, as well as the legal articles violated, are listed as follows:

The defendant, Chen Bijun, is the wife of the deceased traitor Wang Zhaoming. She once served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, she accompanied the traitor Wang to Chongqing. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the traitor Wang colluded with the Japanese chieftain Konoe, and secretly made peace. The defendant participated in the conspiracy. In December of that year, the defendant and the traitor Wang secretly left Chongqing, first to Hanoi, and sent the traitor Chen Gongbo to Hong Kong, where he issued a sensational telegram, responding to Konoe's proposed Three Principles of Peace. Subsequently, the defendant and the traitor Wang went from Hanoi to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. In March of the 29th year, they organized a puppet government in Nanjing, openly resisting the central government. At that time, the traitor Wang served as Chairman, and the defendant served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Puppet Central Party Department and a member of the Puppet Central Political Committee. Throughout the traitor Wang's life, the defendant invariably assisted in all the puppet government's schemes to betray the central government and ingratiate itself with the enemy. Observing that they used "Ming" (referring to Wang Zhaoming) and "Ya" (referring to the defendant) as code words in secret telegrams for communication with various parties, it is very clear that she and the traitor Wang jointly ruled and grasped real power, with immense influence. Even after the traitor Wang died and the traitor Chen Gongbo succeeded him as puppet chairman, the defendant, as a widow, still traveled to Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places, falsely advocating a "comprehensive peace" in order to deceive the public and ingratiate herself with the enemy. She also secretly established special agent organizations, cruelly harming underground comrades, causing our ancient country with thousands of years of culture to fall to the Japanese invaders, without shame, seeking personal gain by selling out the country, and failing to wake up until death. Her crimes of colluding with enemy countries and resisting her own country are truly unforgivable. Now, examining the most prominent of her treasonous acts during her tenure in the puppet government, they are described separately below:

(A) Guangzhou is an important town in South China, and Hong Kong and Macau are our country's gateways. Since our government moved west to Chongqing, the transportation of materials from friendly countries and the supply of armaments have almost entirely relied on this route. The defendant, seeing this, decided to reside in Nanjing for two months and in Guangdong for two months. All major military and political affairs of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government were decided by the defendant. Observing the various telegrams from the puppet Guangdong Provincial Governor Chen Yaozu to the defendant ("Ya") regarding the important military and political affairs of Guangdong Province, the facts are obvious. Her intention was nothing more than to cut off the source of supplies for our government, weaken our resistance, and assist the enemy's aggression. Her intentions are reprehensible, and her actions are particularly heinous.

(B) Upon investigation, when the puppet Guangdong Provincial Governor Chen Chunpu resigned and left Guangdong, the defendant returned to Guangdong with all speed and took charge of the government for four months. On one hand, she requested that the traitor Chu Minyi be appointed Governor of Guangdong (see the interrogation record of the Military Affairs Commission's Investigation Office and the defendant, as well as the investigation record of this court). It can be said that she spared no effort in seizing political power. Other matters, such as incorporating the bandit leader Zhang Yizhou, reorganizing the former Fourth Route Army of Li Fuqun, transferring their positions, and dispatching Wang Yingru to Thailand to handle liaison with the Japanese army stationed in Thailand, as well as the appointment of Xu Shaorong as the puppet Guangdong Provincial Committee Member and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and He Liwen as acting puppet Mayor of Shantou, all had to be reported to the defendant and Wang Zhaoming for approval. It can be generally seen that she and Wang Zhaoming were accomplices in evil (see Chen Yaozu's telegrams to "Ya" and to "Ming Ya," etc.).

(C) Upon investigation, the various intelligence reports from Liao Gongshao and Chen Gengting, and Jian Shu of the Special Affairs Committee Special Agent Headquarters South China Regional Headquarters of the Puppet Central Executive Committee, were all separately reported to the defendant for review and approval. It can be concluded that the defendant alone was in charge of intelligence work in South China. For example, in Liao Gongshao's report, it stated that the gateway to the war zone, Hong Kong and Macau, should be controlled to curb Yu Jiang's activities in Hong Kong and develop the forces of peace. Chen Gengting's report stated that seeking peace through struggle is like a surging tide. Furthermore, overseas Chinese deposits, which used to go to the Chongqing government, now support the banner of peace. Jian Shu's report included various absurd statements about being ordered to summon comrades of the peace movement to be responsible for special agent work. The defendant cannot shirk her responsibility with empty words such as never reading special agent reports.

(D) Upon investigation, the appointment of Gao Hanzong, of the Puppet 20th Division as Chief of Staff, and the transfer of Wang Qi as puppet Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Guo Weimin as puppet Chief of the Police Department, and Zhou Yingxiang concurrently as puppet Mayor of Guangzhou, all had to be approved by the Japanese liaison officer Yazaki and the military commander Sakai, etc. Other administrative matters such as planning for grain distribution based on population, general food rationing, transportation, economics, and education also had to be approved by Yazaki and Sakai (as evidenced by Chen Yaozu's telegrams to "Ya"). In everything from personnel appointments to administration, they followed the enemy's orders. This observation further demonstrates their collusion with enemy countries and resistance to their own country.

In summary, the defendant has committed the crime stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 220, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated, and a corresponding request is made for a trial according to the law. Prosecutor Wei Qing, Clerk Wang Buyun, March 27, 35th year of the Republic of China.

### First Act of the United Nations Security Council Meeting: Intense Debate Between the United States and the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Requests That the Iranian Issue Not Be Discussed; Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States Unanimously Oppose

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco 26th Broadcast: The second session of the Security Council, to which the fate of the world is closely tied, began its first act at 4:07 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time, i.e., 0:07 AM on the 27th Shanghai time). Byrnes attended, sitting next to U.S. Representative Stettinius. Byrnes originally had no seat, and a seat was added to the venue at the last minute. After the meeting began, Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech opposing placing Iran on the agenda. It is claimed that in the rumors in San Francisco and at the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet representative had clarified the Soviet position. In those statements, the Soviet Union had stated the importance of the United Nations in maintaining world security and peace. There has been no change in the Soviet position at present. Marshal Stalin has confirmed this in his talks with reporters. The Soviet Union is equal to all countries and opposes any country ruling other countries. At this point, Gromyko suggested that the General Assembly not place the Iranian issue on the agenda and announced that on March 24, Soviet troops continued to withdraw from Iran. Unless there is an "unexpected event," the withdrawal of Soviet troops can be completed within five or six weeks.

Byrnes then rose to oppose the Soviet representative's suggestion, strongly advocating that the Iranian issue be added to the agenda. It is said that Iran has submitted the issue to the Security Council, pointing out that the Soviet Union's actions have threatened world security and peace. The Iranian Ambassador to the United States sent a letter to the U.S. government on March 18, stating that Soviet troops continued to be stationed in Iran after March 2 and interfered in Iran's internal affairs. Although the Soviet Union has now claimed to have reached an agreement with Iran, since the Soviet Union and Iran have not jointly submitted a statement to the Security Council, we should not refuse to listen to the debate on the Iranian issue.

At this point, British Representative Cadogan also rose to speak, stating that the United Kingdom fully agrees with Byrnes's proposal.

[This Newspaper Report] London 26th Broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has telegraphed instructions to British Representative Cadogan attending the Security Council, proposing five inquiries to Soviet Representative Gromyko in rumors: explain the truth about the withdrawal from Iran; the negotiation process before the withdrawal; the conditions accepted by the Iranian Prime Minister; the reasons why Soviet troops failed to withdraw before March 2 according to the 1942 agreement; explain the true meaning of the Soviet statement "unless there is an unexpected event." It is reported that the U.S. representative will also raise similar questions.

Also, news: Since Sunday last week, Soviet troops have been withdrawing from northern Iran, led by forty tanks. More than fifteen hundred Soviet troops' trucks have withdrawn from Geran.

### Representatives of Eleven Countries Gathered Together; Guo Taiqi Delivered the Opening Speech

[Agence France-Presse New York 25th Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council opened at the Tillet Academy at 7:30 PM today. Representatives of eleven countries sat around a horseshoe-shaped long table. Present were French Representative Parodi, U.S. Representative Stettinius, British Representative Cadogan, Soviet Representative Gromyko, Chinese Representative Guo Taiqi, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, New York Governor Dewey, and New York Mayor O'Dwyer, who also attended the meeting and delivered speeches in the afternoon. Finally, Chairman Guo Taiqi gave a thank-you speech in English and then opened the meeting, which will continue tomorrow at 4:00 PM (midnight on the 27th Shanghai time).

Before his speech, Guo first read a welcome speech from the Chairman of the Bronx City Council, hoping that the United Nations organization would choose the city as its permanent site. Guo then immediately delivered a reply, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome from Lan. He also stated: President Truman's welcome speech can be regarded as the feelings of the American people. The Security Council is determined to maintain the organization as a united and indivisible body, and its mission is significant, to say the least. At present, the whole world hopes to see human rights and dignity guaranteed. After the world suffered an unprecedented catastrophe, all mankind wishes to establish a sound and permanent foundation for peace. The Security Council is responsible for this major mission, which is to maintain world peace and security and eliminate differences between countries of all sizes in order to cope with complex and difficult problems. Therefore, this path is not easy, but I hope that the Security Council can overcome all difficulties and succeed in fulfilling the expectations of the people of all countries.

### Byrnes Delivers a Speech: Must Abide by the United Nations Charter to Achieve Peace

(United States Information Service New York 26th Dispatch) When the Security Council held a meeting yesterday, U.S. Byrnes personally delivered a welcome speech and read President Truman's welcome speech.

Truman's Welcome Speech

"On behalf of the American people, I extend a welcome to the representatives of the Security Council member states, the heads of the United Nations agencies, and their colleagues for their visit to our country. The United Nations organization chose our country as its meeting place, and we are deeply honored. We will do our best to make your stay comfortable and pleasant. But if the United Nations cannot uphold the spirit of wartime unity and cooperation to fight for peace and freedom, then there is no comfortable place for the United Nations organization to be in. The American people especially wish you every success and, moreover, assure you that we will be able to cooperate sincerely to strengthen the strength and will of the United Nations organization so that it can maintain peace and freedom in this interdependent world."

Byrnes's Welcome Speech

This is truly a moment of utmost importance in world history. After the Security Council convenes this meeting, it will regularly carry out its tasks in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, it is very important for all member states of the Council to send representatives to reside at the location of this organization at any time, because the task of the Council is to protect world peace at all times. I (Byrnes referring to himself) am confident that upholding the Charter is the firm determination of the American people, and the United Nations people who are united to protect peace and law must also have the same determination. The Charter has not made ancient privileges sacred and inviolable, and at the same time, in a rapidly changing world, the Charter has not made any changes unconstitutional. The Charter stipulates that countries of all sizes should avoid resorting to force or threatening with force, except for those who defend public law. In resolving disputes, countries should strive to avoid resorting to war as individuals do, but no country has the right to do whatever it wants. If disputes cannot be resolved through friendly negotiations, they should be submitted to the Security Council, which is why the Security Council must continue to be active. If we want the United Nations to last, then no country should do whatever it wants under any pretext or need. The utmost responsibility for maintaining peace and security has fallen on the Security Council. The Council must deal with some problems, and these problems are the factors that countries previously prepared to fight over. It is the duty of all members of the United Nations to cooperate with the Security Council to complete its mission. All countries must discuss their grievances in the Security Council in a free and frank manner. No issue related to world peace should become an untouchable issue of honor. Issues of honor between individuals are no longer resolved through duels, so issues of honor between countries should not be resolved on the battlefield either. We must live in accordance with the Charter. This is the path to peace, and the path to peace is what people all over the world want to follow. We are gathered here to fulfill our responsibilities to the people, and we must not let them down.

New York Governor's Speech

[Associated Press New York 25th Dispatch] New York Governor Dewey today delivered a welcome speech to the representatives of the Security Council of the Painting Organization, saying: You have the responsibility to resolve the disputes of all nations suffering in the world, and you must treat the strong and the weak equally and resolve them with fairness and justice.

### 一位聰明美麗的意大利女郎　女間諜貝安卡　她說：她的美色，引起了許多緾繞；許多人因爲愛不到她而對她憎恨。
A Smart and Beautiful Italian Girl: Female Spy Bianca; She Says: Her Beauty Has Caused Many Entanglements; Many People Hate Her Because They Cannot Obtain Her Love.

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Guangzhou, Liang Feng

"Bianca has been arrested, this beautiful female spy."

"Is Bianca really a female spy?"

"Is Bianca more beautiful and more powerful than Kawashima Yoshiko?"

"Bianca..."

This news, like a novel, is not only published in the newspapers in Guangzhou, but Bianca's name is also mentioned in every teahouse, tavern, and street corner in Guangzhou, becoming their best conversation material.

On November 12th of last year, a plane from Shanghai to Guangzhou carried an Italian girl who claimed to be the number one patient in the West. This girl came from an Italian noble family. Her father was an Italian rear admiral, and her uncle was the commander of the Imperial Guard. Her beauty has turned many different kinds of men upside down. It is said that a Japanese man once used her story to write a very touching novel, which was later translated into English and became very popular in Europe. The title of this novel is "An Italian Girl's Sweet Dream."

Now, the protagonist of this novel is also the protagonist of this novel-like female spy case. Her name is Bianca Sannion.

How was Bianca discovered? From the interrogation of enemy spies arrested in Shanghai by our government, her name and crimes were provided by the enemy spies. Our government immediately communicated and strictly apprehended her. The Guangzhou headquarters indeed detected her whereabouts and secretly monitored her. As a female spy, Bianca is naturally the most sensitive. Seeing that the situation in Guangzhou was not good, she secretly tried to escape to Shanghai by plane in December of last year. Who knew that before the plane took off, she was arrested by our authorities at the airport. It has been four months since then. She was secretly audited by the headquarters once, but the outside world knew nothing about it. Recently, because of her mental disorder and loss of normalcy, she requested to go out for treatment. At 5:00 PM on March 5th, she was sent to Boji Hospital on Changdi. By March 16th, keen news reporters finally found the news, and on the 17th, the news of the Nazi female spy Bianca's arrest was revealed in various newspapers.

Regarding Bianca's crimes, the authorities have naturally collected a lot of information in the four months since she was detained, but it has not been officially interrogated, so it cannot be published naturally. According to the reporter's collection from all parties, it is roughly like this: Bianca is an Italian girl, 25 years old, and a Japanese spy. She can speak Italian, English, Japanese, and fluent Cantonese. In 1943, she interacted with Japanese military officials in Shanghai, and cohabited with the director of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Office (responsible for espionage work) Fuji and Lieutenant Colonel Kotani, the head of the Japanese naval intelligence department. She had close contacts with Major General Yazaki, the mastermind of the Japanese and Chinese intelligence agencies, and also cohabited with Japanese intelligence personnel Takahashi and Oguchi. When she was in Guangzhou last year, she also cohabited with Simon, the French Vichy government's consul in Guangdong. During the occupation of Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and other places, she was able to travel back and forth between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Bay on Japanese military planes and ships. At that time, these places were all in the hands of the enemy. If she had no relationship with the enemy, would she be allowed to travel so easily and use the enemy's military transportation? Therefore, according to the above points we know, this beautiful Italian girl is naturally not an ordinary person!

On the afternoon of the 18th, in the depressed and lonely Boji Hospital, the reporter met Bianca, the female spy who caused a sensation in Guangzhou. She lived in Room 8 on the second floor. The room was spacious, with windows on the northeast sides, and sparse green trees outside. Behind the screen was Bianca's bed. She had a long, pointed face, with rosy cheeks, and her blue-black eyes were like autumn water, setting off her soft golden hair. Her seductive posture was indeed a natural beauty. At that time, she was lying on the bed, covered with a white sheet, revealing a pair of snow-white arms. Her skin was even more clear and clean, as if she were a French girl. She once told the reporter about her life experience. She firmly said that she was not a female spy of any country. She also said that she was Chinese. Since marrying the Chinese Tan Jichao, she has joined Chinese nationality. She had a son and a daughter in Italy. Six years ago, she brought her children to Shanghai, and later had two more daughters. After the Nazis launched the war, she went to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government did not allow her to stay in British territory because she was Italian and asked her to leave the country. In 1942, she returned to Hong Kong again. Life was very difficult at that time, so she went from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, wanting to go to Guangzhou Bay to Guilin to find her husband. At this time, she met Simon because of the relationship between applying for a passport. But after a week in Guangzhou Bay, because the journey to Guilin was too far, she returned to Guangzhou. For the sake of life, Simon often gave her one or two thousand yuan of fake money to maintain her. Soon after receiving the news of her husband's death in battle, she lived with Simon and had another child. Now her eight-year-old son has died, and her nine-year-old, six-year-old, and four-year-old young daughters are being raised by friends in the French church in Shanghai. Finally, she also said that her husband, Mr. Tan, is now in Guangzhou and visits her every day!

In her short speech, she inserted many different expressions. When she was happy, she widened her eyes and raised her voice, as if she was infinitely excited; but sometimes she blinked her eyes and stretched her neck, as if she wanted to cry; and sometimes she made a deep memory. Her words exaggerated that she often caused many people to pester her because of her beauty, and said that many people hated her because they could not get her love; it is a pity that she pretended; but the reporter could not help but think: What a fickle female spy! (To be continued)

### A New Development in the Iranian Situation

The United Nations Security Council convened yesterday in New York, with Mr. Li Taiqi, the representative of our country, serving as chairman. The convening of this meeting was met with considerable expectations from all parties due to the deteriorating situation in Iran, with the belief that the effectiveness of the United Nations mechanism in handling international disputes would be judged by its handling of the Iranian situation. Unexpectedly, three hours before the Security Council convened, the Soviet Union suddenly took a surprising action, with the Iranian authorities officially confirming that the Soviet army had begun withdrawing from Iran; a Moscow broadcast also claimed that the Soviets had reached an agreement with Iran. According to a Reuters report from London on the 24th, a Moscow radio broadcast stated: "According to the treaty signed with Iran during the war, the troops of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States should withdraw from Iran by March 2nd. British and American forces have withdrawn as scheduled. The Soviet Union had previously announced that it would withdraw its troops by March 31st. Soviet troops in areas such as Meshek, Sharut, and Sannan began withdrawing on March 2nd and have completed the withdrawal. The remaining Soviet troops will begin withdrawing on March 24th according to the Soviet-Iranian agreement." The suddenness of this news has led us to admire the flexibility of Soviet diplomatic maneuvers. This news caused the representatives of the United Nations Security Council to turn from sorrow to joy, while also diminishing the interest of people in various countries in this session of the United Nations Council to some extent. We cannot predict whether the United Nations Security Council will further discuss the Iranian situation. However, according to a United Press report from New York on the 25th, the *[missing words]* will continue to discuss, and it is argued that any resolution of the Soviet-Iranian issue should be approved by the Council. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes insisted on the following points: The Council *[missing words]* the Iranian and Soviet *[missing words]* resolution *[missing words]* report; the report should convince the representatives of all countries that the agreement reached between the two countries is out of mutual sincerity and not coercion; the Soviet Union's report to the Council should be regarded as the same as an agreement reached by the United Nations mechanism and Iran.

Simultaneous with the news of the Soviet withdrawal from Iran came a report from Agence France-Presse in Tehran on the 24th, stating that a large number of right-wing Iranian leaders had fled Tehran, including Etreteh Party leader Taiquet and right-wing leader Shaf-pour, who were said to have fled to London. According to a United Press report from Tehran on the 25th, the autonomous movement in Azerbaijan Province will be recognized by the Iranian government. If we combine the Soviet withdrawal, the exile of right-wing Iranian political leaders, and the recognition of the Azerbaijani autonomous movement to observe the new developments in the Iranian situation, it seems not difficult to understand its trends and the subtle relationships within.

First of all, we must point out that the Iranian issue is an international issue. In order to carry out the anti-Axis war, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States agreed to station troops in Iran. When the Soviet Union was fighting the Nazis, much of the supplies provided by the United States to the Soviet Union through the Lend-Lease Act passed through Iran. When the Nazis surrendered, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw their troops from Iran. Britain and the United States withdrew as scheduled, but the Soviet Union, which shared a border with Iran, not only did not comply with the agreement to withdraw its troops, but also intensified its military activities. At the same time, the so-called autonomous movement in Azerbaijan appeared in the area occupied by the Soviet army. Iran appealed to the United Nations mechanism convening in London, while the Soviet Union insisted that the issue between Iran and the Soviet Union should be directly negotiated between Iran and the Soviet Union. Later, the Iranian Prime Minister visited Moscow, but the Soviet authorities treated him coldly. Direct negotiations were ineffective, and the Soviet Union resumed its advance into Iran. This state of affairs continued until the eve of the Security Council meeting. Trying to hide everything from the world's eyes is ultimately impossible. World public opinion was indignant at the Soviet Union's actions. The Soviet Union, seeing this situation, requested the Security Council to postpone the meeting. This was naturally opposed by countries such as China, Britain, and the United States. On the other hand, we saw Chairman Stalin's conversation with a United Press reporter, expressing his trust in the United Nations mechanism and seeking world peace. It was under these circumstances that the Soviet Union suddenly announced the news of its withdrawal from Iran three hours before the Security Council meeting.

If we were to ask what the Soviet Union's motives and significance are for this action, it might seem unkind. However, from the combination of various reports about Iran, and given that the information about Iran's internal situation is still quite incomplete and chaotic, we can roughly understand the trend of the Iranian situation. The exile of right-wing political leaders undoubtedly reflects the rise of pro-Soviet elements and the left wing. The recognition of the Azerbaijani autonomous movement, whether it will merge with the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan in the future, we do not need to predict. Undoubtedly, it is another success of a divisive movement. In summary, we can see that a pro-Soviet regime is preparing to appear in Iran; and the Iranian situation, which was originally an international issue, will evolve into a domestic political issue and thus lose its international character. The success of this strategy will make it impossible for the United Nations mechanism to advise on the Iranian situation again.

Here, we are reminded of the situation in the Northeast. The Soviet army's withdrawal from Shenyang and other areas in the Northeast is also as surprisingly miraculous as the withdrawal from Iran. The Northeast issue was originally an international issue, and has it not recently shown signs of evolving into a domestic political issue? Different tunes played with equal skill, truly a sight to behold. We must raise the awareness of our people and the international community regarding this situation.

### Enemy and Puppet Industry Reviewers Approved; Forced Sales of Real Estate by the Enemy; Original Owners Allowed Priority Repurchase; Third Batch of Eighty-Five Factories Put Up for Auction

The Review Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Industries in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region held its 59th meeting yesterday, passing multiple important cases, including measures for handling real estate forcibly sold by the enemy and puppets and materials seized from secret reports, and a third batch of eighty-five factories to be auctioned. Details are recorded as follows:

Measures for Handling Real Estate Cases

Regarding the review committee's decision on handling real estate forcibly sold by the enemy, two measures were decided: (1) For real estate forcibly sold by the enemy, if the original owner provides evidence and the amount of the transaction at that time and applies for the return of property rights, after verification, the original owner may repurchase the property at the then prevailing price, converted into an equivalent amount based on the current price index. If the evidence is insufficient, the handling bureau will estimate the fair price of the real estate and allow the original owner to repurchase it with priority. (2) If the enemy has constructed buildings on the real estate of Chinese citizens that they forcibly occupied, the handling bureau will estimate the fair price of the buildings and allow the landlord to purchase them with priority. Otherwise, the government may purchase the land at market price. If the original owner is unwilling to sell, the government may rent the land at market price. It is also heard that the handling bureau plans to sell off the enemy and puppet real estate that has already been confiscated as quickly as possible, including the Broadway Mansion. Detailed measures are being determined.

Reporting Materials for Sale

The handling bureau has seized a considerable amount of materials from secret reports. In order to handle them quickly, the review committee decided to organize a small committee for handling the seized materials, to be managed as much as possible by way of auction. Committee member Pan Xulun was recommended to preside over it. It is asked that the first batch of materials to be auctioned includes cooking oil, diesel, engine oil, paint, Western medicine, coal, wool, soap, pig bristles, raw rubber, yarn, socks, silk yarn, food, utensils, fuel, wood, cigarettes, motors, machines, etc. For those that are trivial, they will be entrusted to auction houses for public auction. Specific measures will be decided by the small committee.

The handling bureau has previously auctioned two batches of enemy and puppet factories, totaling eighty-two. Yesterday, it approved a third batch of eighty-five factories to be auctioned.

It should be sealed and put into the bidding box. If the winning bidder gives up, the deposit will be confiscated and not returned. If the bid is not won, it will be returned after the bidding is opened. In addition, the review committee reserves the right to cancel the winning bid of those who attempt to collude and submit multiple bids.

### Ticket Prices on Two Railways to Increase Next Month; No Official Order Received Yet

[This Newspaper] Recently, there have been rumors that the passenger ticket prices on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways will double. Yesterday, the reporter visited the railway authorities in charge. According to them, any increase in train ticket prices requires the approval of the Ministry of Communications. As of yesterday, the city had not received any official order regarding the adjustment of ticket prices. However, prices have risen dramatically in recent months, and ticket prices have not been adjusted in nearly five months. Therefore, the recent income and expenditure of the railway authorities have differed greatly. The rumor of a price increase seems very likely. However, the statement that the new prices will be implemented on April 1st is unfounded.

### City Tram Lines to Be Extended to the Suburbs

The Municipal Public Works Bureau is currently planning to reorganize the city's tram, trolleybus, and bus transportation routes in a systematic manner. This plan is currently being drafted and will be adjusted in accordance with the Shanghai City General Plan of the Urban Planning Committee. It is heard that the city's tram lines will be extended to the suburbs and connected to various airports, railway lines, and ports. In the main trunk lines in the urban area, trams will run, and branch lines will be run by buses. The original lines will be extended to connect them. The first step of the Municipal Public Works Bureau is currently planning to increase the number of vehicles and will order a large number of steel rails and other materials from abroad.

### Liu Zuoren of Guangdong Provincial Bank Discusses Overseas Chinese Remittance Situation; Large-Scale Tung Tree Farms in Lechang and Lianshan

[This Newspaper] Liu Zuoren, the president of Guangdong Provincial Bank, recently came to Shanghai for business. The reporter paid a special visit to inquire about overseas Chinese remittances and the general economic situation in Guangdong. He said: The predecessor of the bank was the Central Bank founded by the late Prime Minister. In 1929, it was changed to the Central Bank of Guangdong Province. In 1932, it was changed to the Guangdong Provincial Bank. After that, it actively operated and gradually expanded. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the bank went through hardships, moved to many places, and continued to operate, so as to regulate local finance. After the victory, the head office moved back to Guangzhou, and branches in various places also resumed operations one after another. In total, there are now 122 units. There are also agency offices overseas, such as in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macau. Speaking of overseas Chinese remittances, Liu said: Most of the overseas Chinese residing abroad are from Guangdong and Fujian provinces, especially the people of Dongjiang in Guangdong Province who live in the Nanyang area. Therefore, overseas Chinese remittances have made great contributions to the motherland over the years. The bank has always stood in a supporting position in the past, assisting the Bank of China in handling overseas Chinese remittances. In the future, it will continue to make efforts and guide overseas Chinese to remit funds so that they can be included in the path of production. In addition, it will also find ways to facilitate domestic remittances to Guangdong Province. In terms of production, the bank has large-scale tung tree farms near Lechang and Lianshan in northern Guangdong. The area of the two farms is estimated to be about 600,000 mu, with more than 6 million tung trees planted. It is expected that there will be a large harvest in the next two years, which can be supplied to the domestic industrial sector for collection or exported abroad. It is heard that the vastness of this mechanized forest farm is the world's largest.

Any public or private institutions and factories with legitimate needs can directly write to the department to apply without having to indirectly ask someone to help. Once the review is qualified, it can be sold as is. The only type of vehicle currently sold by the department is the one mentioned above. The rumor that there are also jeeps for sale is not true.

### Total Number of Repatriated Japanese War Criminals and Prisoners of War Has Exceeded One Million

The first ship has been unloaded in Shanghai, and the second ship is being unloaded. There are six more ships arriving in Shanghai, two ships arriving in Hong Kong, and two ships arriving in Qingdao. All railway equipment is urgently needed for China to restore transportation convenience.

General Meeting Issues Declaration

The declaration of the Shanghai Journalists Association comprises six points, which briefly state: Culture is entrusted with the life of the nation and is the way to maintain the life of the nation. We dare not underestimate ourselves, and being cultural warriors, it is our inescapable responsibility to maintain and promote the inherent culture of the nation. This is the first point. The path to national reconstruction has countless threads, but the primary goals are peace and unity. Without peace, there can be no unity; without unity, there can be no stability. Peace and unity are the consistent demands of the entire nation and the only conditions for completing national reconstruction. From now on, no matter who someone is or what party they belong to, their actions that go against peace and unity will not be tolerated by us. This is the second point. Fostering friendly relations and establishing good international relations to maintain lasting world peace is the unified aspiration of our entire nation. However, the so-called friendly relations and lasting peace should be built on the basis of equality and mutual benefit among nations. Frankness, impartiality, and fairness are the conditions for maintaining friendly relations. To deviate from this path is to go in the wrong direction. Our people will not be deceived by conspiracies nor intimidated by military force. The nation first, the people supreme, is the unwavering belief of our entire nation and the creed that all of us will never forget. This is the third point. News reports should be truthful. Distorting facts for self-promotion may deceive for a time but will eventually be exposed to the world. Our duty is to report the truth and inform the readers. Our conscience is not extinguished, and our integrity remains. Regardless of the importance of the matter or the identity of the people involved, we must report the facts without omission. We will not taint our writing with insincere words, so that everything is true and nothing is false. We will not let down the readers nor betray our conscience. This is the fourth point. Upholding justice is also the function of newspapers. We will surely denounce anything that endangers the nation, the people, or world peace, or those who put the interests of their party above the people. We will be the vanguard of the people, and we will not shirk our responsibilities or back down. This is the fifth point. Newspapers are the voice of the people. From now on, we will delve into the people, broadly solicit public opinion, and ensure that all our discussions are what the people want to say and all our records are what the people should know, so as to fully exert the function of newspapers and promote the realization of democratic politics. We hope to complete the construction of a democratic nation based on the Three Principles of the People under the leadership of one government and one leader. This is the sixth point.

### Divorced Couple in Court Dispute Over Daughter's Upbringing Expenses

[Our Reporter] An expatriate Jew in this city named Isaacs, formerly a patrolman and now a mechanic for the American military at Longhua Airport, legally divorced his wife, Louisa, two and a half years ago. They have a young daughter, who was awarded to Louisa's custody. It was agreed at the time that Isaacs would pay Louisa 200 puppet currency dollars per month as the daughter's upbringing expenses. Both parties also agreed to place the daughter in the Sacred Heart Orphanage on the Bund. Louisa would pay the foster care fees each month. Later, both parties agreed to increase the daughter's upbringing expenses to 400 puppet currency dollars per month. In January of this year, Louisa filed a lawsuit with the District Court to demand an increase in the daughter's upbringing expenses. The court accepted the case and ruled on the 20th of last month that the daughter's upbringing expenses would be 20,000 national currency dollars per month, starting from January of this year. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Meixue held a hearing for enforcement. Both Isaacs and Louisa, as well as a Chinese lawyer hired by Isaacs, appeared in court. However, Isaacs only agreed to pay 10,000 dollars. His reason was that, according to the report from the Sacred Heart Orphanage, Louisa had not been paying the orphanage with the upbringing expenses she received from him each month and was already 14 months in arrears. Therefore, the orphanage had notified Isaacs to take the daughter out. His lawyer also claimed that Isaacs only earned 70 US dollars per month. If he had to pay 20,000 dollars per month, it would be equivalent to one-seventh of his salary, which was unbearable. Therefore, he had appealed to the High Court. Louisa, around 35 or 36 years old, upon hearing that Isaacs was unwilling to pay 60,000 dollars (i.e., the upbringing expenses for January to March), started shouting loudly in fluent Shanghai dialect in the courtroom. The judge ruled that she pay 10,000 dollars on the spot and had the court clerk write a receipt. As for the remaining 50,000 dollars, she was ordered to pay it off when the hearing for enforcement was held on April 1st, before she left in a huff.

### Taiwan Administrative Governor Chen Yi Talks About the General Situation in Taiwan, Emphasizing the Restoration of Agriculture and Industry in the Future, and Promoting the Development of Foreign Trade

Taiwan Administrative Governor Chen Yi flew to Chongqing from Taiwan on official business and arrived in Shanghai on the 24th after completing his official duties. Yesterday, reporters specially visited Mr. Chen's private residence and were received. When asked about the general situation in Taiwan, he provided a detailed account.

Construction Work Has Begun

Mr. Chen stated: Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for over 50 years, and the people's thinking has been deeply restricted. They have little understanding of the country's political, economic, and cultural construction. In particular, the complexity of the language has had a significant impact on education. After the victory, I was ordered to take charge, and my first priority was to promote Mandarin education, which was listed as one of the most important tasks. Currently, all primary and secondary schools in Taiwan have resumed classes and lessons, and textbooks are all using Mandarin teaching. The language and writing are gradually being unified. The current population of Taiwan includes 5.7 million Han people, mostly immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong, and 220,000 indigenous people, including 60,000 Pingpu people (commonly known as "civilized aborigines") and 160,000 mountain people (commonly known as "uncivilized aborigines"). In reality, the indigenous people have mostly become sinicized, with only differences in dialect. There are no special political organizations in the area. In the past, all public security, education, and health work were managed by the Japanese police. Recently, there are plans to promote local autonomy. There were originally over 600,000 Japanese residing in Taiwan, including 180,000 Japanese prisoners of war, 60,000 family members, and 320,000 Japanese expatriates. All the Japanese prisoners of war have been repatriated, and the Japanese expatriates are being repatriated in batches, leaving only 30,000 people. Taiwan is currently lacking in technical and administrative management talent. The establishment of the Taiwan Administrative Cadre Training Group has gradually solved the talent shortage problem. Most of the talent is recruited locally to meet the needs. In summary, the political situation in Taiwan is quite stable, and the construction work in various sectors is just beginning.

Fertilizer Shortage, Orders Placed with the United States

Regarding the economy, Mr. Chen stated: During the war, Taiwan's industry suffered from enemy exploitation and was devastated. On the eve of victory, it was repeatedly bombed, resulting in significant losses. After the takeover, heavy industries such as metallurgy, steelmaking, aluminum smelting, and oil refining have resumed operations, but most of the machinery was manufactured in Japan, and it is difficult to configure damaged parts. Light industries such as ramie weaving, papermaking, and cement have mostly recovered to their original production standards. It is expected that large-scale industries will gradually develop after one year. Taiwan's agriculture requires 400,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer each year. In the past, it was all supplied by Japan. After the victory, the source was cut off, and there was a sudden fertilizer panic. Therefore, this year's grain harvest was poor. Taiwan produces three crops of rice a year, which can yield over 17 million dan. In previous years, over 5 million dan were transported to Japan, leaving over 10 million dan for self-sufficiency. This year, only 9 million dan were produced, and even if all of it is used for self-sufficiency, it is still short 700,000 dan. We can only supplement it with miscellaneous grains. Taiwan can produce 1 million tons of miscellaneous grains each year. This year, the area planted with sugarcane is not large, producing only 100,000 tons, which is only enough for self-sufficiency. To quickly restore agricultural production, we have currently contacted the United States and Canada to purchase fertilizer. In the second half of the year, we can obtain a supply of 200,000 tons of ammonium sulfate. It is expected that next year's agricultural production will be a bumper harvest.

Stable Finances, Stable Prices

Finance in Taiwan is currently quite stable. The exchange rate for civil servants' remittances is temporarily calculated at 1 New Taiwan Dollar to 30 National Currency Dollars. Also, 1 US military scrip dollar currently exchanges for 1 New Taiwan Dollar, which is equivalent to 15 New Taiwan Dollars per US dollar. The currency value is stable, and commodity prices are not expected to fluctuate drastically. However, due to transportation difficulties, Taiwan's foreign trade has not yet developed, and some special products still cannot be exported. As for future plans for the construction of Taiwan, Mr. Chen specifically listed four points: (1) Restore agriculture and industry; (2) Develop higher education (Taiwan has no universities); (3) Restore transportation; (4) Promote foreign trade.

[Another Report] Mr. Chen is scheduled to fly back to his post within days. Also, a batch of 1,200 staff members of the Governor's Office, traveling from Shanghai on the Taipei wheel, arrived in Taiwan on the 21st of this month.

### World Professional Women's Day: The YWCA Held a Commemorative Meeting Yesterday

[Our Reporter] Yesterday was World Professional Women's Day. The YWCA of this city held a commemorative meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday at the Ninth Floor of the YWCA at Baxianqiao. Over 200 women representatives from various agencies in this city, professional women, and women from various countries such as Britain, America, the Soviet Union, Australia, and Portugal attended. Dr. Tan Mingde served as the chairman. Speakers included Mrs. Fan Haige, one of the initiators of "World Professional Women's Day" in China, Mrs. Anderson, Ms. Peng Wangquan, a professor at St. John's University, and Ms. Lei Jieqiong, a professor at Soochow University. The central theme of the speeches was "In This World—My Rights and My Obligations." They deeply hoped that professional women around the world can work together to strive for peace and equality. Representatives from the International Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Soviet Women's Association also delivered speeches. After the speeches, a potluck dinner was held. Each participating member paid a potluck fee of 1,500 dollars. Afterwards, a variety of entertainment programs began, including violin solos, sword dances, and a short play introducing female heroes of Chinese history, directed by professional female artists and performed by professional women. The meeting dispersed in high spirits at 10:00 PM.

### Drunk Man Fell into a Well and Drowned

[Our Reporter] Zhou Hongzhi, a 52-year-old man from Shandong, who was blind in his right eye, worked as a watchman at Lane 58, Wujiang Road, i.e., Xiejiao Lane. He lived alone and struggled to make a living. He was fond of drinking and usually relied on the assistance of people in the neighborhood to survive. The night before last, he again indulged in heavy drinking until late at night. Unexpectedly, when walking to the entrance of the lane, he accidentally fell into a well and drowned. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a tenant surnamed Ke from No. 56 discovered the incident and reported it to the New Cheng Police Station, which ordered the police to go to the scene and retrieve the body. The body was sent to the coroner for examination.

### The Truth About a Human Leg Revealed

Foot Amputated from a Hospital Patient

[Our Reporter] On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 2:00 PM, a human leg was discovered next to the swimming pool in the Shanghai Experimental Drama School at 961 North Sichuan Road. The leg was already showing signs of partial decay. The incident was reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station. Station Chief Zeng Derong, along with Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan, patrol officer Liu Zhaonian, and Sergeant Chen Junfeng, led the way to the scene to investigate. The investigation revealed that the leg belonged to the right leg of a man. Although some of the flesh was blurred and difficult to identify, a close examination of the skin did not resemble that of a coolie, but it was also not like that of a scholar. However, the bone was very smooth, as if it had been sawn off. Section Chief Zhou led Sergeant Chen out to the Shanghai Municipal Fourth Hospital (formerly Fumin Hospital) next door to inquire whether anyone had had a leg amputated recently. According to the response, a person had had a right leg amputated three or four days ago. The patient currently resided in Room 110 upstairs. He was a soldier sent by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration named Gao Mingchun. Because the leg was fractured and medical treatment was ineffective, the doctor diagnosed that it had to be amputated. After the surgery, the leg was amputated and placed in the morgue in the back. Because the drama school and the hospital were only separated by an iron gate, it was carried out by a stray dog and placed on the wasteland. The flesh was blurred, likely due to being eaten by the dog. Subsequently, Dr. Shi from the hospital rushed to identify the leg as his and immediately took it back. This finally resolved the doubts.

### Newspapers and Weeklies Temporarily Suspended from Airmail Delivery

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently announced: Approved the Shanghai Office of China National Aviation Corporation's public letter dated March 15 of this year, which stated: "Our company only accepts airmail letters for transportation from post offices in various places. As for airmail parcels and newspapers, etc., we should immediately notify the senders to contact our company's Shanghai Office directly. If the aircraft has capacity, freight will be charged according to the cargo freight rates for transportation," etc. Approving this, our bureau has repeatedly negotiated with the company, but no results have been obtained. As of today, our bureau has accumulated many newspaper bags to be sent to various places, which cannot be cleared. Therefore, our bureau has no choice but to suspend the acceptance and delivery of all newspapers and weeklies to Shanghai-Chongqing, Shanghai-Guangdong, Shanghai-Beiping, and Shanghai-Taiwan routes from today. Also, the 29th is a regular holiday. The office hours of the Administration and its branches will be handled according to the Sunday regulations.

### Theater Owners Don't Actually Receive Much After Movie Ticket Prices Increase

Association Chairman Issues Statement

Regarding the increase in movie ticket prices, Liang Qitian, the chairman of the Movie Theater Business Association, stated that the increase in ticket prices was a last resort. This is because various expenses have increased sharply. If adjustments are not made, it will be difficult for various theaters to maintain operations. However, the current selling price is still cheaper than other commodity prices. Even in terms of the entertainment industry, the highest price for amusement parks before the war was 2 jiao, which is now sold for 300 dollars. The highest price for dramas was 1 yuan, which is now sold for 2,500 dollars. The highest price for movies was 2 yuan, which is now sold for 1,800 dollars. Moreover, out of the 1,800 dollars, 50% is entertainment tax, which is 600 dollars, 10% is stamp duty, which is 120 dollars, and 540 dollars is split with the film distributor. The theater actually only receives 540 dollars.

### Zhongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory Launches Special-Priced Sales to Teachers

The Right to Enjoy Special Price Purchase Certificates

Dear Editor: Seeing recent reports that the sacred teachers, due to livelihood issues, hope to obtain a slightly reasonable solution, and have engaged in strike actions, we, standing on the national standpoint, cannot but be concerned about this serious issue. The War of Resistance has been won, but the national finances are in a difficult and troubled period, and it may be difficult to immediately remedy this problem. Especially the parents of students, most of whom are also struggling to pay their children's tuition fees, so additional fees are out of the question. However, the cost of living index and the meager income of teachers are too far apart, and the strike wave will become a social problem for the entire society. We, as a production institution, are also a member of the current society, and are willing to automatically contribute to the sacred teachers, even if it is only a slight contribution. Although it is minimal, if all parties can do the same, the teachers' living burden can be reduced to some extent. Now, we will propose a method: All teachers in public and private schools in this city, the school authorities will contact various daily necessities production factories to widely issue them a daily necessities special price purchase certificate. With the certificate, they can enjoy a special price discount, in order to reduce their spending burden. Our Zhongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory produces Double Ten brand towels and various cotton woven goods, and we are willing to make an attempt. If other daily necessities factories adopt the same method, it can indeed help teachers in their living aspects. I wonder what readers think? Respectfully,

Zhongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory Co., Ltd.

### No Registration Applications from Dealers; Gold Market Weak; Hong Kong Currency Hottest Among Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, the exchange rate continued to depend on Bank of China's supply, and the black market sources were constant. Although the allotted price was still 1.6 million, it had not changed. Dealers had not registered, and there was no hope for the overall trend. Sellers were hesitant, and the process was consistently weak. It opened steadily in the morning, but soon after opening, a certain pressure increased, gradually falling back. After 10 o'clock, the Bank of China's allotment price did not change. Dealers, due to the low market price, did not register. However, the pressure was frequent, and the market gradually weakened, retreating to 1.54 million at noon, and then slightly recovering, but only temporarily. In the afternoon, it still proved unsustainable, first weakening and then stabilizing. The result was a slight decrease of 15,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 170,000 yuan, refined silver at 1,600, and silver dollars were bought at 1,050 yuan, showing great stability. The secret exchange rate was average, and the interest rate ranged from 1.6 to 2 jiao. The Bank of China had abundant gold reserves, and speculators could not operate. The gold market presented a clear, stable, and secretly weak image, and the trend was difficult to reverse.

Foreign currency U.S. dollars were initially strong and then weakened, initially hovering around 1,980 yuan. After entering the market, the gold market fell, and the U.S. dollar was also affected. At noon, it was around 1,960 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold market rose after falling, but the U.S. dollar still ended at a low price, falling 20 to 30 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong currency was consistently weak and could not be stopped, falling another 10 yuan. New issues recovered slightly. Although there was no new stimulus, the chips were scarcer, making it easier to pull up. In 1936, it once rose to 235 yuan and then slightly fell back. There was more currency in circulation in 1937, lagging behind by 20 yuan, and finally recovering by 10 yuan and 20 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers and rupees were calm.

### Bulls Successively Selling Off Securities Suddenly Decline; Chinese Stocks Recovered to Original State at Noon Due to Sichuan Group's Unwillingness to Release

Yesterday, major players in the government bond market deliberately created a trap to entice others. As soon as it opened, they raised prices. Type C bonds were raised from 3,000 yuan in the morning to around 3,150 yuan, and the bulls felt satisfied and sold off together. Soon after, it broke into the 3,000 yuan level. The Chinese stock market also weakened due to the bulls taking profits. Retail investors in the bond market panicked, and supply exceeded demand, gradually decreasing to 2,600 yuan. The noon close was slightly even. Compared to the previous close, Types A, B, D, and E all fell by 200 yuan, with the hottest Type C bonds falling by 300 yuan. The Chinese stock market was in a confusing situation. Part of the bull force left the market, and frequent drops occurred. However, the Sichuan group held onto the chips and refused to release them, using its huge capital to increase positions at low prices. The floating chips in the market became fewer and fewer. Speculators bought in to cover their positions before the close, and the market recovered. At low prices, Yong Yarn was 4,600 yuan, Meiya 3,580 yuan, and Jingfu broke into the 300 yuan level. The noon close was still able to recover to its original state. Compared to the previous close, popular stocks rose slightly, while unpopular small stocks remained flat. In the afternoon, forward transactions for Yong Yarn, Meiya, and Jingfu were quoted at premiums of 5% to 10%. Foreign stocks opened later, just in time for the Chinese stock and bond markets to recover, and showed a weakening trend as soon as they opened. Yisha gradually decreased from 10,200 yuan to 9,600 yuan, and finally hovered around the 10,000 yuan level, resulting in a decline of 5% to 10% compared to the previous close.

### Rice and Oil Steady; Flour from Lively to Dull

Although the rice market shouted tightly in the morning, there were still goods in the warehouses, and store demand was not strong, so the result was still average. Flour from other ports turned dull, and the situation softened. Oil prices tended to be flat with the continued arrival of goods from other places. Soybeans were initially high and then weakened, with both arrival and demand being sluggish. Raw peanuts were still stable. Corn was scarce and quite flexible, with prices rising by 700 to 800 yuan. Bran also rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Soybean cake was flat and weak. Most grains were mostly flat.

### Cantonese Demand Gradually Weakens; Yarn and Thread Decline Consistently

Yesterday, the yarn market turned weak again. Cantonese demand has gradually weakened. 20-count special Double Horse yarn fell to 1.1 million. Beijing dealers chose and purchased cheap coarse yarn. Cloth factories and weaving factories had no intention of stocking up due to the sluggish sales of finished products, so various counts of yarn and thread declined by 20,000 to 30,000. Prices have not stabilized. The Textile Construction Company opened for sale as usual a total of 11 types of cotton cloth and added 10 types of American cloth.

### Spot Cotton Transactions Still Good

Yesterday, New York's American cotton continued to rise by 6 to 12 basis points, with near-term cotton at US$27.08 and no market for far-term cotton. Midling spot was US$27.76. Spot cotton transactions in this port were still good, but the market was still lifeless, because the yarn and cloth markets were all downstream, and factories were unwilling to release prices and absorb inventory. Those holding goods were willing to compromise. Only the Textile Construction Company purchased 1,500 to 1,600 bales of Midling cotton at prices ranging from 76,000 to 78,000 to 80,000 yuan. No private yarn factories or cotton brokers were heard to be doing business.

### Silk Buyers Wait and See; Rayon Falls by 60,000

Yesterday, the silk market was uniformly weak, mainly because buyers were all waiting and seeing. Most prices were quoted but no transactions were made. Factory silk of 80 points or more, the foreign firm's goods, yesterday had a negotiated price of 2.55 million yuan per bale, but no one cared because the payment terms required several days' promissory notes, separate guarantees, and dry commissions. Quoted prices were short. 120-count Tianqiao rayon opened at 1.74 million yuan, then fell to 1.7 million yuan at closing, a decrease of 60,000 yuan from the previous day. Dull and semi-dull were short of goods and prices were held up. 120-count Laisi end dull had transactions at 2.78 million yuan. The price of Meiya quilt face in the silk market was the same as the previous day, but there were no transactions. Dachang lattice crepe factories sold off goods, and prices were 100 yuan weaker than the previous day. Business was not bad. The quality of power spinning and 205 foreign spinning fabrics was uneven, and the prices were also very different.

### Wire Nails Continue to Fall

Sales of wire nails to customers have been extremely prosperous in the past, but in the last half month, the purchasing power of customers has been limited, so the market has become increasingly worse, falling by another 10% to 20% compared to two weeks ago. The current price for 4-fen nails is 92,000 yuan per barrel, 5-fen nails are 82,000 yuan, 6-fen nails are 72,000 yuan, 1-inch nails are 65,000 yuan, 1.5-inch nails are 60,000 yuan, 2-inch nails are 53,000 yuan, and 2.5-inch and 3-inch nails are 50,000 yuan per barrel.

### Coal Market Calm; Coal Briquette Factory Prices Remain Stable

The coal market is quiet, with only a few scattered transactions. The market is gradually becoming calm, and price fluctuations are minimal. Although there is a shortage of white coal lumps, the market price is too high, which hinders actual sales, resulting in a shortage of both supply and demand. The market price continued to fall slightly by 10,000 yuan. Although the main raw materials for coal briquettes, Dashan and white coal layers, have fallen significantly in recent days, the factory prices remain stable due to the sharp increase in labor costs and the continuous spring rain, which has reduced production in various factories, and the rising price of firewood. It will be difficult to fall back in the short term.

### U.S. Needs Antimony Very Much; Regret Limited Price Is Too Low

(Reuters, New York, 26th) Antimony is currently in great need in the United States, and the only remedy depends on the return of the large amount of antimony ore produced in China to the U.S. market. However, the price of antimony on the current world market is much higher than the price limit in the United States, so the United States seems to need to reward its citizens for purchasing antimony from China.

### Glass Fiber Can Replace Rayon

[Reported by this newspaper] Rayon, the raw material for electrical wire weaving factories, is now no longer scarce. A large foreign firm in this city has begun accepting orders for glass fiber (Glorsfeber), which is a rubbery fiber with extremely strong tensile strength. It is an excellent raw material to replace rayon. The United States uses glass fiber to weave parachutes and also widely uses this raw material.

### 5,000 Tons of Pig Iron to Arrive in Shanghai Soon

[Reported by this newspaper] General iron shops on North Suzhou Road have ordered 5,000 tons of pig iron from a large British firm at US$63 per ton, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. This shipment will alleviate the shortage of raw materials needed by foundries and iron factories. It is also reported that a large batch of lead wire arrived in Shanghai this spring, which was surplus material from the U.S. military. A large iron shop purchased the entire batch at US$8 per dan, and it has already been sold out after being loaded, which shows the lack of metal materials in this city.

### Tea Sales Sluggish

The earliest Mingqian Longjing new tea is produced in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Generally, it can be tasted at the end of this month. However, according to news from the production area, although the weather last year was not severely cold, the spring rain has been continuous at the time when the new tea is about to grow, so production may be affected, and the harvest is not optimistic. As for the tea market in this city in recent days, sales in Tianjin and other places and in shops on this street are very sluggish. Generally, sellers' profits are frequently loose. Under the trend of supply exceeding demand, the market is weak, and prices have rarely improved.

### Soviet Gold Production Increased During the War Compared to Before the War; Gold Reserves About One-Fifth of the United States'

[Reuters, New York, 26th] The Soviet Union is one of the major gold-producing countries, but it never publishes production figures. According to Paul Hull's article in the New Pioneer Forum, the Soviet Union's gold reserves are second only to the United States. When the Soviet Union was a member of the League of Nations in 1936, the League's Statistical Yearbook recorded the Soviet Union's gold reserves as 47,371,000 ounces. According to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, the Soviet Union's production in 1936 was 5 million ounces. From 1937 to the end of 1945, the Soviet Union's production should have been 71.5 million ounces, of which only 4 million ounces were exported. Therefore, it is estimated that the Soviet Union's gold reserves should be 120 million ounces, about 21% of the United States' gold reserves. According to Hull's estimates based on reports from foreign engineers employed by the Soviet Union, the current Soviet gold production is equal to or even exceeds that of South Africa. South Africa produced 12 million ounces of gold in 1944. According to Soviet publications, Soviet gold production increased during the war, which is the opposite of other parts of the world.

### Mobile Homes

England Also Prepares to Export in Large Quantities

(Reuters, London, 26th) According to the "Standard Evening News": British mobile home manufacturers, with the support of the Ministry of Works, are currently planning to establish an export trade worth 100 million pounds. It is reported that the Australian government has ordered three types of mobile homes from the United States, and the models have already arrived in Sydney. Currently, there is a housing panic in various countries around the world. After meeting domestic needs, Britain can engage in large-scale exports.

### Market Intelligence Summary

Sugar: Yesterday afternoon, the Enemy Property Administration entrusted the Guild to hold the 16th wholesale auction, totaling 2,374 bags of medium sugar at 49,000 yuan per dan, but because dealers' demand was very sluggish, only 1,577 bags were actually sold. Medium sugar opened in the morning and fell to 48,250 yuan, and refined sugar was also dragged down by 3,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth: Because sales of colored cloth have been sluggish, almost no one is interested in white fine cloth, and prices are uniformly weak.

Woolen Cloth: Retail sales are few, and Yin Feng Paisley fell by another 2,500 yuan, with few other gains or losses.

Western Medicine: Penicillin's price has fallen sharply due to the impact of arrivals, and the rest are also trending downstream. Medical cotton has risen due to the shortage of goods.

Cosmetics: Snow powder is in short supply because dealers are still eagerly collecting, and the factory rarely supplies it, so prices have risen, and the rest are flat.

Dyes: The downward trend still exists, and prices continue to fall, but Three Doves Soap Yellow has strong sales and prices have risen.

Industrial Raw Materials: The market is mediocre, and prices are hovering. Also, a batch of caustic soda shipped from Rinira has been scheduled to be delivered and marketed in the next two days.

### Jiaotong University Tang Ping Two Colleges Prepare to Return; Abandon the Waterway Relocation Plan; Make Contact with the Sichuan-Shaanxi Railway Bureau and Transfer Northward

[Special report from Bishan] In order to adapt to the school relocation plan, Tangshan College and Peiping Railway Management College of Jiaotong University ended this semester early in early May. At the meeting of schools relocating inward convened by the Ministry of Education last month, the relocation order of the two colleges was set at 38 batches. According to the transportation tools transferred by the Ministry of Communications to the schools for repatriation, at the rate of 10,000 people per month, it will be possible to leave Chongqing in late August. After hearing the news, the teachers, students, and alumni of the two colleges were quite anxious. It is learned that the two colleges have abandoned the waterway relocation plan and have made contact with the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway Bureau. The Bureau has allocated vehicles to go through the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road to Guangyuan, arrive at Tianshui, and transfer northward along the Longhai Road. Food and lodging along the way are arranged and planned by the alumni association. It is said that Wu Jinghu and Liu Zhijing, who were specially sent by the two colleges to Tangshan and Peiping to receive school buildings, arrived in Peiping on the 12th. The two were quite successful in negotiating the school buildings in Peiping, but the Tangshan school buildings are currently borrowed by the US military and may not be released in the short term. President Gu Yisun and Chief Secretary Geng Shizhi also decided to fly to Peiping in early April to handle the repatriation matters. This summer, the two colleges are scheduled to recruit new students in Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping and Tianjin, so that young people interested in transportation can apply nearby. (Sealed)

### From Now on, Fujian and Taiwan Will Share Teacher Resources; Abbreviation of Fujian Teachers College

— Huang Cen

In the past, culture and education in Fujian were relatively backward. Leaving aside higher education, even in terms of secondary schools: according to pre-war statistics, there were actually less than sixty schools; and among them, most were private schools founded by churches or individuals. Actual public secondary schools were as rare as phoenix feathers, and these secondary schools were concentrated in Fuzhou, Putian, Xiamen, and other major areas. More than ten counties in eastern and western Fujian did not even have a single high school. Fortunately, the War of Resistance brought Fujian the desire to not fall behind. In the midst of turmoil, it slowly began to raise its head. The Fujian Provincial Education Bureau also gradually completed its plan in the first six years, on the one hand, striving to support the independent development of education in various counties, so that each county had at least one county-run junior high school and a simple normal class; on the other hand, dividing the province into nine secondary school districts according to administrative divisions, so that each district had at least one complete secondary school, ordinary normal school, and vocational schools for agriculture, fisheries, medical care, industry, etc., according to local special needs. As a result of the implementation of these plans, secondary education in Fujian Province and its popularization have undoubtedly been achieved. However, because of the excessive expansion of quantity, the quality has gradually declined. Therefore, the "Fujian Normal College," which aims to solve the problem of overall teacher resources, came into being.

Past History

The predecessor of the Teachers College was the "Secondary School Teacher Training Institute" founded by Chen Yi, the former chairman of Fujian Province. The original site was in Shaxian. At that time, there were several departments such as Literature, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Music, and Physical Education. It specialized in recruiting high school normal school graduates and selecting excellent primary school teachers from various counties for further study. The duration of study was two years. After graduation, the province assigned them to serve in secondary schools in various counties. During their time at the school, all food and clothing were provided by the province, so poor students from various places were often happy to study there. In 1942, in view of the fact that the original scale was not sufficient for expansion, it was changed to the Provincial Teachers College. The school site was moved to a small village in Hougu, Shuinan, Nanping. The first president was Tang Shouyi. Famous novelist Zhang Jin Yi and painter Wu Fuzhi and other teachers taught here at this time.

Internal Organization

Now the Teachers College has been expanded into six departments including Chinese Language, History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Education, Art and Physical Education. This semester, it moved to Fuzhou and added an English department, hiring Dr. Lin Tianlan as the director. However, in order to adapt to the actual teaching needs, except for the Art and Physical Education departments, students in each department can cross-select courses, such as Chinese Language majors can also select History and Geography and English, History and Geography majors can also select Chinese Language and English, and Education majors can also select Chinese Language, History and Geography, etc. The academic system also adopts a credit system, with graduation in three years. There are two methods for enrollment: one is the recommendation from each county of outstanding primary school teachers "with graduation qualifications from high schools of equal status", and the other is high school and ordinary normal school graduates. Those with equivalent academic ability will not be accepted. The current president is Lin Xilian, speaker of the Fujian Provincial Assembly, but the actual school affairs are handled by Yan Hu, the director of academic affairs. (It is said that Mr. Yan is the son of Mr. Yan Fu and has a deep understanding of Chinese Language due to his family's academic background). There are four departments and one office in the school. In the past, the selection of professors was not ideal due to regional limitations. Now that the school has moved to Rongcheng, solutions can be sought.

Student Activities

The number of students will reach nearly 400, most of whom are normal school graduates. Some of them have served in society for eight or nine years, and have been principals, section chiefs, and counselors, before returning to the gates of the school, so their experience, knowledge, and ability are relatively rich. In terms of academics: because they will soon become teachers after stepping out of the school gate, the second and third grade students almost bury themselves in books all day long, reviewing and dare not stop for a moment. In terms of service: because they have long been accustomed to it in peacetime, they often have special achievements in technology. As for student activities, because there are all kinds of talents, they are also particularly active. For example, publishing periodicals and printing teaching materials can be undertaken by Chinese Language, History, Geography, and Education departments; drawing and surveying can be the responsibility of History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry departments. Physical education competitions are handled by the Physical Education department alone. Practice exhibitions are hosted by the Art department. Everything is extremely automatic, active, and competent. Student life sweeps away the extravagant habits of the city. Not only has the act of wearing suits and leather shoes, and guessing fingers while drinking disappeared, but even daily clothes and utensils are washed and managed by the students themselves. The hard life of one or two students is particularly touching.

Future Plans

At present, all sectors of Fujian Province, in view of the need to improve the quality of education after the war, want to transform the Teachers College into a normal college. As for the path, there are two: (1) to merge with the Provincial Medical and Agricultural Colleges to form "National Linsen University", making it the highest institution of learning in northeastern Fujian. (2) to suggest that the central government change the Teachers College into an independent college so that it can meet the large-scale needs of teachers in Fujian and Taiwan provinces in the future. The former has been proposed to the central government by members of the Fujian Provincial Political Council, and once passed by the Executive Yuan, but has not been realized to this day. The latter has been discussed with the Ministry of Education by the members of the Fujian Province who attended the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and it is said that there is a good chance of success. We have observed the phenomenon of the depletion of secondary school personnel in Fujian Province, and in view of the urgent need for Mandarin education in Taiwan in the future (it is said that the Minnan students of the Teachers College in the two sessions account for one-third of the total number, and sending them to Taiwan can easily solve the teaching language issue), it is really necessary to transform the school into a college, and we hope that the education authorities will support it as soon as possible!

### Shenyang Soviet Army Withdrawal Station Damaged; Endless Sorrows of the Beining Railway

— Shenyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 18th (Airmail) — Special Correspondent Han Qingtao

The Beining Railway, this new lifeline of the Northeast, should be fully open to traffic today, after the withdrawal of the Soviet army from Shenyang. However, because the main station has been damaged, Huanggu Village Station is still used as the terminus. The distance between Huanggu Village and the main station is less than ten miles, but it is still "close at hand, yet worlds apart," and cannot be reached!

Inside Shanhaiguan, passengers are very crowded and road affairs need to be rectified. The section outside Shanhaiguan between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou has even more sorrows. Passengers coming by train from inside the pass generally have to change trains in Jinzhou, and cold and hardship attack everyone.

The blockage at the top of the Beining Railway has not yet healed, and problems often occur throughout the line. The problems mostly occur at important joints, that is, the Communist army's planned bombing of bridges, which prevents the railway from being smooth and unobstructed.

Plainclothes Team Bombs Bridges and Flees Immediately

The route is long, with more than 100 large and small bridges between Goubangzi and Xinmin alone. Except for the very long bridges, such as the Juliuhe Bridge, where the National Army has special guards, troops cannot be stationed everywhere else. This gave the Communist army an opportunity to take advantage of. They mostly use the night, sending a plainclothes team, carrying explosives, to walk to the predetermined target. In a deafening explosion, the task is achieved, and they flee immediately. By the time the National Army arrives, they have already disappeared without a trace.

The Zhao Village Machine and the Raoyanghe Bridge and the Liuhegou Bridge, which have been bombed recently, have all had the damaged parts temporarily supported from the bottom of the river with sleepers by bridge workers. What will happen when the water rises in the future? What's more, there is constant destruction, which is really frightening to think about.

Some people have also thought about the time when the "green gauze tent" rises. The six- or seven-foot-tall sorghum stalks are a good place to hide large numbers of people. In the past, bandits were rampant in the Northeast during the summer, which was a major reason. The enemy, Japan, did not allow farmers to plant sorghum within ten miles on both sides of the railway to maintain railway traffic. But now it is our own countrymen's business, and everything must be planned and solved reasonably by ourselves.

On the section outside Shanhaiguan of the former Beining Railway, it is a double-track hidden road. Except for two or three bridges that have not yet been repaired into double tracks and have to temporarily stop and run on a single track, the rest are for both up and down traffic, without any obstruction. However, many places have now been damaged, and there are also overturned locomotives and carriages lying there, which have not been repaired and cleared. Therefore, the train runs on the left at one station, and at the next station, it may have to run on the right again.

Station Equipment Stopped Being Used

The electrical management and equipment of large and small stations are now stopped from being used. The switches and signals are lost or broken. The wires leading to the outside of the station have been taken away, and even the red and green signal lights outside the station are gone. The more times the chaos occurs, the more difficult it is to calculate this confusing account.

Along the line, inspections inside and outside the stations are rarely done. The switches are rusted and no one cares, the equipment is broken and no one repairs it. Cleanliness and order are a mess. A railway worker lamented, "In the puppet Manchurian era, the stationmaster had to inspect the station affairs at least once a week, wearing white gloves. If yellow rust was rubbed on the switch, the personnel managing the switch would suffer. So they wiped it all the time, so it was bright, clean, and efficient. Alas, no one has cared about it for more than half a year now." The reporter personally saw a large station where locomotives get coal and water, and the switch was rusted. The person who switched the switch spent half a day's effort to barely cope with the job.

Railway Workers' Salaries Are Being Adjusted

All the railway workers are generally diligent, but some of the equipment on the road has been destroyed, and some has rotted and decayed, so sloppiness has begun, and everyone tries to cope with the situation, which is terrible.

The salary issue is said to be being adjusted now. In February, a stationmaster received only about 2,000 Northeast circulation coupons, which is equivalent to 26,000 yuan in national currency. The price level and the exchange rate of legal currency are almost the same as in the interior, so how can they eat and support their families. Therefore, many stationmasters and railway workers are dressed very raggedly.

The general opinion is that railway workers' salaries must be reasonable, and the good regulations on the road in the past must be retained and maintained, because the enemy puppets managed the railway in an orderly manner in the past, and the work was carried out quickly and effectively. Today, it cannot be "written off".

Frozen for Most of the Night; Baby Nowhere to be Found

There is a shortage of locomotives and wagons on the road. Many have been taken away by the Soviet army. A passenger train runs north and south each day, and passengers are extremely crowded. There is no room to stand in the carriage, and the door is also crowded with water. The place where the two armies handed over is also full of people. Some people don't even have anything to grab, so they have to use ropes to tie or hang themselves on the train. What's even worse is that the roof is full of passengers. This may be easily ignored in the interior, but here the weather is icy and snowy. When the train runs, the cold wind is like a steel knife cutting people, and they can be frozen stiff. A few days ago, a female passenger came from Jinzhou and was frozen for most of the night. When she arrived in Goubangzi, the sun was high before she realized that the two-month-old child wrapped in the quilt was gone!

Hanging a Military Car; One Section Is Not Enough

Where do these passengers come from? And why not add more trains? The answer is: there is a shortage of both wagons and locomotives. What can be used to run on the railway? The people of the Northeast are now very poor, so they travel to and from Tianjin and Beijing to do small business, carrying small packages of goods on their shoulders, enduring almost unbearable pain. Half of the passengers are this kind of people, and the other half are visiting relatives and friends, because travel was subject to many restrictions in the puppet Manchurian era. What's more, there is a "national border" between inside and outside the pass?

There are also many military personnel on official business traveling between Jin County and Shenyang, so a single car for military personnel is not enough, and they have to be mixed among ordinary passengers. Therefore, many military personnel are also sitting on passenger trains.

More Dangerous When Encountering Big Noses

It is extremely difficult to buy tickets when there are many people. A few days ago, the train from Jinzhou was scheduled to depart at 6:00 in the morning. General passengers would line up in the middle of the night. Some would go there and sit down after the night fell, tired, sitting on luggage or goods, taking a nap. It is impossible to describe the suffering, because it is still icy and snowy outside the pass, and the cold wind is piercing!

The train arrives at Huanggu Village just as it gets dark. Everyone cannot go into the city, because before the Soviet army withdrew, everyone was afraid of encountering the "big noses". If they unfortunately encountered them, they would have to offer most of the money on their bodies, and other things might also be taken away, so they had to stay in a hotel.

Living in Their Own House During the Day; Recruiting Passengers at Night

Huanggu Village was not originally the terminus, and there are not many hotels. All the people on the train had to live there. So the households slept in their own house during the day and recruited passengers at night, costing 15 to 30 yuan per person (13 yuan per legal currency). When there were more people, everyone sat. When there were fewer people, they could lie down. What could people do? Because the people who were going to Jinzhou the next day also had to rush to stay here, so every house in Huanggu Village was a hotel, and there were people everywhere. Everyone suffered, and the households received unexpected gains. Large and small houses made a lot of money every day.

From March 16th, the departure time from Jinzhou was changed to 10:00 AM. The train arrives at Huanggu Village at 8:00 or 9:00 PM, just in time for the evening curfew. In Shenyang, few people walk after 6:00 PM until dawn. Huanggu Village Station is so chaotic, so the stop was changed to Xinmin. There are formal hotels near Xinmin Station, but most of the merchants who are seeking small profits mostly stay in the wagons and on the roof. Otherwise, they would have to spend money and be afraid of not being able to get on the train. In their opinion, this method is already very satisfying, because in the end, they are all Chinese people and will not be bullied or disturbed. It is currently difficult for Northeast compatriots to make a living and travel.

There are so many problems on the Beining Railway between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang, and the passengers are suffering so much. We need to quickly rectify and seek ways to save and improve. This new lifeline of the Northeast cannot be allowed to continue like this. (Shenyang, March 18)

### The Gloomy State of Education in Guangzhou: School-Age Children Shut Out of the School Gates

— Special Dispatch from Our Guangzhou Correspondent, Liang Feng, Dated the 20th

Perhaps the destitution of the people is an unavoidable phenomenon in the aftermath of war! Everything in Guangzhou society is developing abnormally, morality is declining, and social customs are deteriorating, especially now. But to reverse this decline, to change this bad social atmosphere, and to reform the national mindset, the main thing is to start with education. Therefore, amidst the clamor for reconstruction on all fronts, the reconstruction of education is indeed a more urgent task.

Before the war, the educational standards of Guangzhou were considered the best in the country, but after eight years of resistance against Japan and the enemy's ravages, they have been steadily declining. Although the local education authorities have made their best efforts, due to subjective and objective conditions, this problem remains quite serious.

Indeed, anyone who tries to count the number of out-of-school youth and children will find the figure quite alarming. This reporter once visited the local education authorities to investigate, and although they gave the reply "not yet counted," one can get an approximate figure from a conversation the director of the Municipal Education Bureau had with this reporter. He said, "The number of out-of-school children in the city has not yet been counted. However, judging from the 970,000 population of this city announced by the Civil Affairs Bureau, children should account for at least one-fifth, which means there are at least 200,000 children. After deducting the 50,000 to 60,000 who cannot attend school due to family financial difficulties or various other special reasons, there are at least 130,000 to 140,000 school-age children who need to attend school..." If we extrapolate according to his statement, how many school-age youth are there? In the population of 970,000, youth should account for two-fifths! That would be 380,000 youth. Even if we halve that due to various other special reasons, there are at least 190,000 youth of school age who need to attend school.

But how many schools have actually been restored? According to investigations, there are seven schools above the specialist college level in the city, excluding Sun Yat-sen University. When Guangzhou was recovered, there were only 22 secondary schools. This semester, this has increased to 38, just half of the pre-war total, and only three of these are municipal and only nine are provincial. If each of the above schools is estimated to have an average of seven or eight hundred students, the maximum number of students they can accommodate will not exceed 50,000. Thus, it can be calculated that there are 140,000 out-of-school youth!

As for primary schools, before the war, Guangzhou had 100 municipal primary schools and one kindergarten. But now only 42 primary schools and one kindergarten have been restored, accommodating a total of 15,650 children, according to the Education Bureau's announcement. Private primary schools have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. According to the person in charge of the Education Bureau (now merged into the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau) who told this reporter: there are currently 69 private primary schools. If each school is estimated to have an average of 500 students, their capacity is only over 30,000 people. Combining the municipal and private primary schools in the city, only 40,000 to 50,000 children are attending school. Thus, it can be calculated that there are approximately 80,000 children who are excluded from the school gates!

Moreover, because there are so few municipal schools, private schools are rising up at this opportune moment, raising tuition fees. Although the Education Bureau stipulates that private schools should charge no more than 20,000 yuan per semester for senior high school, 18,000 yuan for junior high school, and 7,500 yuan for primary school, in reality, no school fails to charge extra fees, and textbook fees and ordinary miscellaneous expenses are not small. At a time when prices are rising daily, there are too few municipal schools and private schools are unaffordable, so many are forced to remain out of school.

The cries of tens of thousands of parents, as twenty-odd thousand school-age youth and children linger outside the doors of education, have attracted the attention of all parties. The local education authorities also seem to feel the seriousness of the problem, but increasing the number of municipal schools this semester is merely a fantasy. Although there is also a Youth Guidance Office here to register out-of-school and unemployed youth and guide them back to school and employment, its strength is limited, and the problem cannot be fundamentally solved. As for the relief of out-of-school children, good news did once come. The Municipal Education Bureau announced that it had been approved to add 22 municipal primary schools this semester, to open as many classes as possible, and to accommodate a large number of children, and that existing schools would also increase classes. When the general public heard this news, everyone rejoiced. However, in the end, due to funding, school buildings, the reorganization of the Municipal Education Bureau, etc., they only received the replies "the decision to increase schools has been postponed" and "the method of increasing classes is still being formulated."

But time flies easily, and once it passes, you have to wait another semester or even a year. No matter how you shout, all you get is a difficult and impractical answer. Thinking of the future of education, a shadow is cast over everyone's heart.

The bustling streets of London, a hub of traffic.

### The British Government Focuses on Urban Construction: London, a Case of Top-Heaviness

— Special Dispatch from Our London Correspondent, Xue Yan, Dated the 15th

After the end of the war, Britain is now busy with construction. The first thing is to build Greater London. Although the UK has a population of just over 40 million, London alone has over 13 million, giving it a sense of top-heaviness. Before the war, Sir Patrick Abercrombie designed the construction of Greater London, dividing London into four rings, to disperse many factories to the suburbs, but this was suspended due to the outbreak of war. Now that the war has ended, this proposal has been revived, and some factories that moved to the suburbs to avoid bombing may not need to return. According to Minister of Town and Country Planning Silkin's announcement in the House of Commons on the 5th of this month, the London County Council has approved an appropriation of over 2.47 million pounds for construction. According to the plan for Greater London, London is divided into four rings: the Central Ring in the middle, followed by the Suburban Ring, then the Green Ring, and finally the Outer Country Ring. It is said that at least over one million people can move to the outer suburbs as a result.

Elections for the London County Council were held on March 8th, and the Labour Party won 90 seats, the Conservative Party 30 seats, the Liberal Party 2 seats, and the Communist Party 2 seats. Before the election, the Labour Party had 76 seats and the Conservative Party had 48. As a result of this election, the Conservative Party lost 18 seats and the Labour Party gained 14 seats, sufficient to indicate the popularity of the Labour Party.

Churchill's Speech: Startling Even to the Bold

At a time when both Britain and the United States were uncertain and wary of the Soviet Union, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave his shocking speech at the University of Missouri in the United States on February 5th, which made people in Britain and the United States suddenly realize the depth of the conflict between the two sides. Many could not help but reflect, were they about to prepare for war again? The emotion Churchill represented in his speech was perhaps shared by people in both countries, but for someone of his political position and prestige to speak so boldly and straightforwardly was startling even to the boldest. Therefore, the reaction after the speech was great, and the opinions varied. Within Britain, it was especially complex due to party relations. The day after Churchill's speech, a well-known reporter for the left-leaning News Chronicle, Vernon-Barlett, said that to his knowledge, Churchill had not consulted the government authorities before giving the speech, but had sent a copy of the speech to the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax. The next day (i.e., the third day after giving the speech, also February 7th), the Daily Herald, the organ of the British Labour Party, said in an editorial, "This newspaper can say with good authority that Churchill did not consult with the government authorities before giving the speech." But the Conservative Party's Daily Mail said on the same day that the content of Churchill's speech had been telegraphed to the government authorities by Halifax, and that there had been multiple exchanges of telegrams between the authorities and the embassy regarding this matter. It also said that when Churchill was drafting the speech, President Truman and Byrnes had the opportunity to read it and expressed their agreement.

From these many dispatches, we can see that Churchill did not consult the government authorities in advance for his speech, because he stated at the beginning of his speech that it only represented his personal opinion and did not carry any government status, so strictly speaking, there was no need to seek government consent. But no one denies that he sent a copy of the speech to the British Ambassador to the United States, and it is possible that the British Ambassador to the United States telegraphed the British Foreign Office. As for President Truman and Churchill agreeing all the way to Missouri and knowing its contents in advance, it is also reasonable. But we know that whether the British government authorities or the US government authorities knew the contents in advance is one thing, expressing approval or having the same opinion is another. Since Churchill stated that it was only his personal opinion and that he would bear all the responsibility himself, who can interfere with him in a country with freedom of speech, who can ask him to change his opinion? On the contrary, the great reaction it aroused in all aspects shows that he did represent the powerful opinions of a large part of the people. As for the attitude of the two governments, in other words, what should the attitude be from an official standpoint, they can use other methods to express it in the future. As of today, it seems that neither government feels the need to issue a special statement to clarify its attitude.

British Loan from Canada: $1.25 Billion

Britain has successfully borrowed $1.25 billion from Canada. The conditions are similar to the US loan, but part of it can only be used after the US loan is established. If the US loan does not pass in the US Congress, the two governments will discuss the steps to be taken separately. In addition, the interest-free loan that Britain borrowed from Canada in 1942 will be postponed to January 1951 before it begins to be repaid, with the same conditions as before. According to this loan, the total amount is 700 million yuan. After the same part is repaid, there is now 560 million yuan left.

The Australian government has reached an agreement with the British government to welcome British people to move to Australia. Any British people who have served in the military or merchant ships during the war can apply to move there, and the two governments will bear the cost of the tickets. Other people can also apply, and once approved, adults only pay 10 pounds for the ticket and children only pay 5 pounds. However, applicants who are willing to move must have the intention of residing in Australia for a long time. It is said that during the war, Britain moved 6,000 children to Australia for refuge, but later, according to a government survey, a large part of them were willing to return to Britain when they grew up.

The British Imperial Conference will be held in London after Easter, and the Australian Prime Minister will be coming to Britain soon. The main topic of the conference is said to be the issue of world trade. After the abolition of British imperial preferences and the sterling bloc, trade between the British Empire will naturally be greatly affected, and there is a need to discuss countermeasures together. In addition, food issues and imperial defense issues will also be put to discussion.

### A Collection of Anecdotes from the People's Political Council

The press pass for the People's Political Council is much more elaborate than the one for the Political Consultative Conference. It is made of dark green cardboard, with the Secretariat's seal on the front and the Council's fire seal on the back. It was printed in Hankou for the first session of the first Council in 1938. The reporter's is number 7, which is coincidentally the same as the PCC's special number 7.

From the Second Plenary Session of the KMT to the People's Political Council, this reporter has been running to the Military Affairs Commission every day for a month. He is now very familiar with the geography of the venue and even the armed comrades guarding it.

The staff of the Secretariat of the People's Political Council were transferred to work for the Plenary Session during the Second Plenary Session of the KMT, and now they are back to work for the People's Political Council. All the equipment of the People's Political Council is the same as that used in the Second Plenary Session of the KMT. The street traffic station signs, the steamed buns and snacks during the break, and the stenographer in the black and red-edged cheongsam sitting in front of the stage are all the same as those at the Plenary Session. The only difference is that a temporary post and telegraph office has been added outside the venue.

Mo Dehui's graying short beard and Northeastern accent, Li Huang's briskness and competence, Wang Yunwu's "scientific management," Jiang Yong's spirit of the rule of law, and Wu Yifang's voice full of joys and sorrows all attract the attention of the entire audience. They presided over the conference separately, creating all kinds of different atmospheres.

At each conference, the first part of the report is mostly smooth and stable. Journalists listen without taking notes because the Central News Agency will issue a press release the next day, and it is mostly "historical documents" from not long ago. When the written inquiries are announced, the atmosphere begins to tense. During the oral inquiries, the entire venue is on high alert, as if facing a formidable enemy.

These few "anecdotes" were written when Shao Lizi and Zhang Qun were giving reports on the Political Consultative Conference and the cessation of conflict and reorganization, and were mailed from the conference post office.

### School Cannot Rent School Buildings: Female Students Sincerely Appeal

To the Editor:

Our school (Zhengzhong Girls' High School) was the most enthusiastic in doing underground work during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, the enemy often visited, inspected, and monitored us. Our teachers and students were arrested and imprisoned several times, endured all kinds of torture, and remained loyal until victory came. After the victory, the number of students increased a lot, so we requested the landlord of No. 2, Lane 15, Tika Road to rent it as a school building, but we were unsuccessful. At the beginning of this month, we learned that the house had been rented by an English woman named Mrs. Linden. Then, through mediation by the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee, the English woman signed in her own handwriting, agreeing to rent five rooms of the building to our school as a school building. However, to collect the rent, we had to pay six months of US dollars in advance, with a monthly rent of US$59. Our school's expenses have always been public. Each semester, we borrow in the millions, and we still have no way to repay the loans from previous years. How can we afford such a large rent? Therefore, the school authorities have pleaded with her several times, asking her to reduce the rent, but she not only ignored us, but also rented out our classrooms to others in violation of the contract, separating the field and hindering sports. The education of our hundreds of students is about to be interrupted. Therefore, the representatives of all the teachers and students in the school requested that she return the classrooms, but the English woman stubbornly refused to comply. Our students are restless and uneasy, so we sincerely ask for a corner of your newspaper to publish our appeal and ask the elders and seniors of society to uphold justice. (Chen Kunying, March 23rd.)

### Inaugural Statement

— Xin Zhi

The Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition, prepared for four months by colleagues from the Chinese Society of Technicals, is roughly complete in scale, and we are finally very happy to meet with all our dear compatriots.

Although the exhibition has only been open for three days so far, and although its content is far inferior to the exhibitions held in various places in advanced European and American countries, seeing the endless stream of visitors and hearing more praise than criticism, this sensational scene really makes people think deeply!

Originally, in China's nearly 100-year history of industry, national industries have always played a supporting role. The eight-year Anti-Japanese War did not make our national industries rise to a dominant position. Even the industrial sectors that were rebuilt in the vast areas of the rear were depressed due to the arrival of victory, let alone the industries that were devastated in the occupied areas! However, the wheels of history are always moving forward, and China is bound to industrialize. If it does not, China cannot complete the great cause of national construction.

Looking at the reality, the staff in our technical field feel that we should make a call for rapid national industrialization here in Shanghai, a place that can represent Chinese industry. Therefore, under the auspices of the Chinese Society of Technicals, we have held this first "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition." We have no extravagant expectations, but only want to take this opportunity to fulfill our initial wish of "exhibiting industrial products, promoting national construction, popularizing scientific knowledge, and promoting technical education." If someone can change their vision as a result and invest their funds in industrial construction or technical education, then the "Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition" will have completed its mission.

During this exhibition, many guests told us that on the one hand, they felt that China's industrial construction was just beginning to flourish, and whether it was light industry or heavy industry, it was far behind; on the other hand, they felt that there were indeed many problems with China's industrial technology. However, our colleagues in the Chinese Society of Technicals believe that as long as politics are clear, national strength will naturally be abundant, the economy will be consolidated, and the technical level of the people will inevitably be improved.

We, the colleagues in the Chinese Society of Technicals, also vow to promote the progress of technology with the unique vigor and vitality of young people!

At the same time, in order to give the people of Shanghai a deeper understanding, we have specially taken a corner of Shen Bao as a special issue of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. In this small space, we will give the people of the country a deeper introduction to this Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition and the sponsoring Chinese Society of Technicals. We also hope to take this opportunity to get more sympathy and guidance from seniors and advanced people at home and abroad, and from friends everywhere, whether we know them or not, whether they can visit the exhibition or not!

### Future Efforts of the Chinese Technical Association

— Wang Tianyi

After a full four months of preparation, the members of the Chinese Technical Association have finally presented the inaugural Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition to the nation. Since the results of this exhibition are fairly satisfactory, and its significance is understood and accepted by those concerned with the construction of the new China, people cannot help but have deeper concern for the Chinese Technical Association, which organized this exhibition. In the exhibition hall, many technicians and vocational youth requested to join the association. Although there has been considerable introduction in the special edition of the industrial exhibition, verbose elaboration is not something we admire. Here, we only wish to use the medium of the newspaper to give a general response to friends across the country.

Our purpose, according to Article 2 of the charter, is: "To unite technical personnel nationwide, dedicate ourselves to national construction, popularize technical education, promote academic research, and seek common welfare." What can be stated here is that there are a total of over 400 technical personnel from the chemical, electrical, mechanical, civil engineering, textile, agricultural, commercial, mining and metallurgy, and mathematical and physical departments who have joined the Technical Association as members. In this exhibition, there are nearly a hundred more who have applied to join. In addition, during the preparation period, we have received responses and participation from technical personnel in Chongqing, Kunming, and other places. Many members who joined in Shanghai have gone to work in Taiwan and other coastal ports due to job transfers. It is expected that in the near future, branches of the Technical Association in the aforementioned areas can be formed. We very much hope that friends in other regions who sympathize with the work of the Technical Association will contact us, gradually establish branches, and build a strong and solid national technical personnel organization.

Regarding dedicating ourselves to national construction, we believe this is the aspiration and ideal of every technical person. It is a personal disgrace and a national loss for Chinese technical personnel not to contribute to the construction of the new China. Therefore, the members of the Technical Association are all eagerly looking forward to the early start of a large and practical national economic construction plan. Our members will thus each have the opportunity to "contribute to the country with their skills." The gradual depletion of national strength and the unbearable living conditions of the people are the main reasons.

Popularizing technical education is a direction that the Technical Association and its predecessor, the "Workers' Leisure Association," have been working hard on, because this is the work that technical personnel can strive for at any time and place, standing in their own positions. In view of the enormity of the national construction system and the shortage of technical cadres, we have worked hard in this way in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future. The *Engineering World* magazine will continue to be published regardless of the high cost of paper and printing. The third Industrial Lecture series is an event scheduled by the Technical Association for April. The Chinese Technical Vocational Night School has been encouraged by the society because of this exhibition, and plans to enrich its content and expand its scale. In addition, the "Technical Association" also wants to publish one or two sets of popular technical books, if the publishing industry is willing to cooperate.

Speaking of academic research, this is where the members of the Technical Association feel relatively ashamed. Apart from the personal achievements and efforts of a few members, generally speaking, the members of the Technical Association are now overemphasizing service work and inevitably neglecting their own self-improvement. This needs to be overcome. In the future, in addition to lectures and publications for the society, we will also hold academic lecture meetings and build libraries for ourselves. We also plan to establish contact with academic institutions and organizations in various countries to exchange publications and collect data.

Regarding hopes for the Technical Association, many members have mentioned welfare work. Today, at a time when industry is stagnant and prices are high, the treatment of technical personnel is generally low due to various factors. We cannot therefore not make some plans for our own lives and status. The planned items include job placement and consumer cooperation. For these, we especially hope for the cooperation and assistance of the industrial and commercial sectors.

If the construction of the new China can be completed smoothly, it must be the result of sincere cooperation and persistent efforts from all levels of society. The colleagues of the Technical Association have worked hard for more than two years in difficult times. This effort has been proven by the facts to have not been wasted. It is believed that the future work will also be able to achieve the due effect.

At the founding meeting, Mr. Zhao Zukang and Mr. Zhao Zengjue, representing the engineering community, and Mr. Cao Liangxia and Mr. He Shangping, representing the scientific community, all believed that the Chinese Technical Association would become one of the three pillars of national construction together with the China Science Society and the Chinese Institute of Engineers. This is indeed an overestimation. Mr. Hu Juewen and Mr. Hu Xiyuan of the National Industrial Association especially hoped that the members of the Technical Association would maintain close contact with the industrial community. This is also a kind intention. We are not worthy of it, but we very much want to do so. We especially respect the achievements of senior scholars, advanced organizations, and progressive national industrialists, and hope that under their guidance and sponsorship, we can develop the strength of technical personnel and realize the ideals of technical personnel with each passing day.

The opening of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition has undoubtedly taken the Technical Association one step further. We firmly believe that since we have goals and are willing to work hard, our organization will inevitably move forward day by day, and our work will inevitably gain the sympathy and support of people across the country. Reaching a prosperous and happy new China, this journey is not far away.

### A Flood of Comments

"Technical education is the most important task for national construction in the future. The Chinese Technical Association, advancing under this banner, should not be complacent with past achievements, but should continue to work hard."

"The staff is indeed enthusiastic and numerous. If more effort could be put into instructional explanations, the visitors would surely gain more!"

"Many small industries have indeed progressed compared to eight years ago. It can be said that while the war destroyed some industries, it also established some. Relatively speaking, industry has lifted its head a bit. However, will this lifted head of industry continue to develop in the future to achieve the goal of building the country through industry? Or will it shrink and become a flash in the pan? This is a very important question, and it is precisely what the industrial community is most worried about at present."

"China must industrialize after the war. After visiting the exhibition now, I feel that the people of the country are striving to improve, which is very gratifying."

"We need such industrial product exhibitions to instill industrial knowledge in the general public, especially children."

"It is hoped that this Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition hosted by the Chinese Technical Association will not only provide the participating factories with an opportunity to promote their business and conduct research and observation on each other's products, but also provide the manufacturers with an opportunity to communicate with each other, unite and organize, so that China's national industrialists can be organized and embark on the road of truly promoting China's industrialization movement."

"Undoubtedly, in a China where industry is declining after the war, the industrial product exhibition does give people a new inspiration."
