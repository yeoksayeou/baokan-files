[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The work of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters has become slightly more tense than in the previous two weeks, but among the three commissioners, only the American Robertson has returned to Beiping from Chongqing to maintain normal work. Ye Jianying has been ill in bed for three days and has not gone to the headquarters to work. Zheng Jieliang has also not returned to Beiping.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] The Northeast Executive Group is about to begin its work. The CCP group leader, Rao Shushi, along with Geng Biao, Zhang Dewu, Xu Guangda, and dozens of staff members including staff officers and telecommunications personnel, flew to Shenyang on American transport planes at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. [Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] As the National Army prepares to depart from Shenyang to take over, the Communist Army seems to have begun sabotaging transportation.

### Soviet Troops Withdrawing from Harbin; Communist Army Night Attack on Changchun Repelled

[Central News Agency, Harbin, 2nd] Soviet troops here have been withdrawing in recent days, and the situation in the city is quite stable. Communist Army activities have not become obvious. However, the telephone line between Harbin and Changchun suddenly went out of service three days ago and has not yet been repaired.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] The general consensus here is that the final withdrawal of Soviet troops will likely be around the 10th.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd] This morning, the chasing troops of the 13th Security Regiment returned to defense at noon. The arsonists have fled far away. It is reported that the attackers last night were Communist troops, totaling more than 500, who launched attacks in four directions. One of the attacks was at the arson site, which is called Luyuan. Another was at Nanling. The other two were near the airfield. The Communist troops at each location retreated at dawn today. Also, during the engagement, Soviet troops deployed six tanks, patrolling the suburbs via Datong Street for a week as a warning. The Soviet City Defense Command also sent troops to patrol the city. The patrol troops mistakenly engaged the security forces responsible for guarding.

[Another Dispatch] Datun and Kaoshantun, located 19 kilometers south of Changchun, were just captured by the Communist Army yesterday morning. It was heard last night that several people attacked the suburbs. The situation in Changchun has suddenly become serious due to this. Also, there was fighting all night yesterday west of Changchun. The attackers carried many light machine guns. The first shot was fired at 1:45 AM (Chongqing time), followed by more gunfire, breaking the silence of the rainy night. According to official reports, an unidentified unit set fire to buildings along the Xingan Avenue West Station, from Xingan Bridge to the middle of the airfield. Two buildings formerly occupied by Soviet troops were burned. Sentries from the 13th Regiment of the 2nd Security Brigade went to stop them, and immediately clashed with the arsonists. Both sides deployed large forces, fighting all night until dawn, when the attackers were repelled. There were also gunshots in several locations in the city. The Mantan Building, where the headquarters and the military delegation are located, immediately deployed sentries to prepare for any eventuality. Hundreds of security guards entered the pre-arranged positions around the building, and some armed troops went upstairs to guard. Suddenly, the lights in part of the building went out, plunging half the city into darkness. Last night's battle caused panic among the city's residents. This morning, there were few pedestrians on the streets, and some shops only partially opened their doors.

### Unify Currency in Recovered Areas; Hope the Communist Party Stops Issuing Banknotes

Five Negotiations Still Yield No Results

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] With the aim of unifying the currency system in the recovered areas, stabilizing finances, and alleviating people's suffering, the Ministry of Finance provided opinions to the government representatives of the Political Consultative Conference's Three-Person Committee. Zhang Qun and Zhang Zhizhong then negotiated with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party, requesting that the Communist Party stop issuing banknotes in the Communist-occupied areas and lift the ban restricting the use of legal tender. It is heard that this negotiation has been held five times. Zhou Enlai expressed agreement in principle and has requested instructions from Yan'an. However, Yan'an has so far maintained a delaying attitude because the Communist Party is currently extending its influence in the Northeast, taking advantage of the opportunity to actively expand its military, and military expenditures are increasing to an uncontrollable extent. According to credible estimates, in the past eight years, the Communist Party has printed five kinds of banknotes, including anti-Japanese bonds and circulating notes, with a total issue amount that may have reached three trillion yuan.

### Senators Make a Painful Appeal: Do Not Sacrifice the People Again for Political Strife; Discussions on the Political Consultative Conference Report Cause Twists and Turns

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] At 4:15 PM today, the first plenary session of the Senate convened to discuss the review opinions on the report of the Political Consultative Conference, causing major twists and turns. The review document was drafted and passed by Special Review Group Three. However, when it was presented to the general assembly, the text had been greatly revised. Most senators believed that the secretariat had no authority to arbitrarily modify the review document of the small group. The Secretary-General of the Ministry denied acting on the orders of any presidium. Speakers in the meeting hall rose and fell, reaching a climax. As a result, after 5:40 PM, the original review was read and then amended and passed. In view of the fact that Communist troops continued to cause disturbances in various places after the Political Consultative Conference, a senator stood up during the discussion of the review document of the Political Consultative Conference and made a painful appeal, saying: "Politics must prioritize the interests of the country and the people, and the people must not be used as a tool for political strife, sacrificing the people to win [political points]." This won considerable applause from the entire audience.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] At 4:00 PM on the 2nd, the Senate passed the review opinions on the Executive Yuan's administrative report, which stated that colleagues in the assembly had doubts that the methods of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure proposed by Premier Song were sufficient to balance the budget.

### The Mystery of High Salaries for Employees of the China Textile Company

[Our Newspaper] At the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee last month, Committee Member Pan Gongzhan and Committee Member Wu Shaoshu asked about the monthly salaries of the general manager and employees at all levels of the China Textile Construction Company, saying that it was rumored that salaries in February were as high as one million yuan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs was responsible for providing a written response, with an attached comparison table of salary grades for the company, explaining: (A) Department heads, chief auditors, branch managers, and chief engineers receive salaries at levels 1 to 5, that is, 600 to 420 yuan; (B) Factory directors receive salaries at levels 1 to 8, that is, 600 yuan to 330 yuan; (C) Deputy department heads, deputy chief auditors, and deputy managers receive salaries at levels 2 to 6, that is, 550 yuan to 390 yuan; (D) Specialized committee members and engineers receive salaries at levels 4 to 11, that is, 450 yuan to 250 yuan; (E) Secretaries, auditors, section chiefs, master sergeants, specialists, and office directors receive salaries at levels 6 to 15, that is, 390 yuan to 170 yuan; (F) Office section chiefs receive salaries at levels 12 to 20; (G) Technicians and clerks receive salaries at levels 13 to 22; (H) Assistants receive salaries at levels 22 to 25. According to the table, the total salary and allowances for those with the highest base salary of 600 yuan is only 7,500 yuan, indicating that the salary grades of general employees are not very high. However, according to reporters' inquiries from reliable sources, the general manager, who receives a base salary of 800 yuan, and the deputy general manager, who receives a base salary of 700 yuan, are not specified in this table, which seems to be a near-evasive response. Furthermore, whether the salary grade table distributed at the plenary session is accurate and for what month are still questionable. This is because the company's salary grade table for February stipulates that (A) department heads who receive 600 yuan can receive a total of 282,286 yuan including salary and allowances, and even clerks who receive 100 yuan can receive 80,011 yuan. It can be seen that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' report to the plenary session that the highest salary paid was only 7,500,600 yuan is completely inaccurate. Furthermore, the company's February salary was calculated based on 899 times the total living cost index for staff and workers announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in January, and then calculated accordingly. The calculation method for the index allowance is stipulated as follows: (1) Salaries of 80 yuan are issued according to the index (as a basic allowance). (2) Salaries below 80 yuan are given additional supplementary allowances: Salaries of 50, 60, and 70 yuan are given supplementary allowances of 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. (3) For salaries above 80 yuan, in addition to the 80 yuan basic allowance, the remaining salary amount is given a supplementary allowance of 45%. The above index allowance is based on 899 times the total living cost index for staff and workers announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government in January 1935. Then the formula for calculating the index allowance in February is (1) Basic allowance = 899 * base salary; (2) Salaries and allowances below 80 yuan = Basic allowance + (Basic allowance * supplementary allowance); (3) Salaries and allowances above 80 yuan = Basic allowance + (899 * 45% * the number of base salary exceeding 80 yuan), which is the total amount of salary and allowances issued for the index allowance in February. From this calculation, if the company's March salary is calculated according to 1464 times the total living cost index for staff and workers announced by the municipal government in February, then the general manager who receives a base salary of 800 yuan can often receive as much as 592,256 yuan, not including the bonuses (that is, the salary for several months added at the end of the year) issued from the company's profits. No wonder it is rumored that the salaries of senior employees of the China Textile Company are as high as one million yuan, and the truth is not difficult to discern. This not only makes other public educators envious, but even employees of general private enterprises can only sigh with admiration.

Telegram of Thanks to Marshal and the U.S. Military

[Another Dispatch] The Senate today passed two telegrams: one to General Marshall and one to the U.S. military stationed in China. The original telegrams are as follows:

After the end of the war, you assisted us in handling the disarmament of the enemy, sending prisoners of war and enemy expatriates back to their countries. All kinds of meritorious achievements are admired by the people of our country. Now, according to the resolution of the conference, we send this telegram to express our gratitude. National Senate of the Republic of China, April 2, 1946.

### Director Dai's Achievements in Leading the Military Statistics Bureau for 14 Years are Outstanding; Rumors Suggest Remains to be Buried at the Foot of Zijin Mountain in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] After the announcement of General Dai Li's death, Dai's family has officially held a mourning ceremony. Nanjing will schedule a public memorial service. Whether Dai's remains will be transported back to his hometown has not yet been determined, as there are rumors from Chongqing that he will be buried at the foot of Zijin Mountain. Kang Ze was once expected to succeed Dai, but Kang is currently abroad and is rumored to return to China within the month.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Military Statistics Bureau, under the leadership of the late Director Dai, has made great contributions to the anti-Japanese war over the past 14 years. Its achievements are recorded as follows: The work of the Military Statistics Bureau under Director Dai began on April 1, 1932, after the September 18th Incident. Its work was to fight for the Three People's Principles. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the information and action work arranged in the occupied areas, the investigation of the enemy and puppet military, political, economic, and general trends and conspiracies, the sabotage and assaults on the enemy, the sanctions against key enemy and puppet military and political personnel, the rescue of allied flight personnel, and the investigation of bombing targets behind enemy lines, all efforts have been made.

Collecting Intelligence to Strike at the Enemy

(1) Intelligence: Over the past 14 years, the bureau has collected intelligence to provide for the Supreme Commander and relevant military agencies for reference. Among them, there were many benefits to the national army and allied forces in fighting the enemy. For example, in March 1945, the bureau learned that the enemy would invade Nanyang, Laohekou and other places with 70,000 troops, and detailed the serial numbers, qualities, and deployment of the enemy troops assembled in southern Henan. The Supreme Headquarters made appropriate deployments in advance based on this intelligence, and finally gave the invading enemy a serious blow, which was commended by the Military Order Department. For another example, because the bureau was ordered to cooperate with the United States to exchange information, in December 1944, the bureau learned that the enemy's joint fleet, after being severely damaged in the sea battles of Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy chief Yuta Fuzhi concentrated the remaining navy in the Ryukyu Islands to reorganize it. Kiyomizu Mitsumi was appointed as the commander of the first unit, with the Zhenhai Fortress Port of the Penghu Islands as the base point, and Matsumoto Masuyoshi was appointed as the commander of the second fleet, with the Ryukyu Islands as the base point. On January 7, 1945, the U.S. Navy attacked the Ryukyus and Taiwan based on this intelligence, sinking 83 enemy ships of all sizes and destroying 210 enemy aircraft. Afterwards, the U.S. side sent a letter of thanks. In addition, in the successive battles of northern Hunan and local battles, the bureau also obtained valuable intelligence for the Supreme Commander's reference.

Statistics on Actions during the Eight Years of the Anti-Japanese War

(2) Actions: During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the bureau carried out 2,107 sabotages against the enemy, 585 assaults, and 515 sanctions against key enemy puppets. The number of enemy puppet personnel who died was 17,873, the number of wounded was 4,916, the number of captured was 566, the number of enemy military vehicles destroyed was 492, the number of cars 1,627, the number of automobiles 477, 23200 boxes of gasoline, 1797 electrical machines, 2675 meters of electrical wire, 15 machines, 442 ships, a total of 51 blockhouses, a total of 2318 guns, 33 artillery, and various ammunition 48310 boxes, 71 aircrafts, 1578 barracks, 81462 loads of military rations, 1316 electric poles, 5550 military uniforms and blankets, 5051 boxes of toxic gas raw materials, 250 bridges, 1658 meters of railway, 19924 lengths of barbed wire, 547 boxes of kerosene, 56451 bolts of silk cloth, 7670 bales of cotton, and many captured trophies. As for the effectiveness of the enemy work of the Commando Army of the Loyal National Salvation Army and the Sino-American Cooperative Organization commanded by the bureau, the US side has disclosed to the newspapers, so it will not be described in detail.

Ordered to Preside over the Arrest of Traitors

(3) Punishing Traitors: After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Director Dai was ordered to preside over the arrest of traitors. Because he believed that if this matter was not handled well, it would not only fail to quell public anger, but also damage the discipline and integrity of the nation, he often personally went to important areas in the recovered areas to supervise his subordinates to handle it seriously. In summary, a total of 3,455 traitors have been arrested, and they are being transferred to local courts or military agencies for trial in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Regulations on the Handling of Traitor Cases. As for the property of the traitors, it has also been sealed up and checked by the relevant agencies, and transferred to the local enemy puppet property handling bureaus for processing. Director Dai was on this trip north to handle the traitor cases when he encountered a plane crash on the way from Qingdao to Nanjing. The above is a summary of the situation. The late Director Dai and the staff under his leadership sacrificed more than 4,000 people in the anti-Japanese war, but they also achieved the above results, which also had a price.

### Conflict of Opinions Between the Communist Party and the Youth Party; Political Consultative Conference Small Group Discusses Constitutional Amendments; Fierce Debate Between the Two Sides on the Provincial Autonomy Law

[This newspaper's Chongqing, 2nd] The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee held a joint meeting yesterday. After two and a half hours of discussion, a major agreement was reached on the principles of constitutional amendment: (1) Regarding the National Assembly's organization, representatives from all sides agreed to form a National Assembly composed of representatives from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, county representatives, overseas Chinese representatives, and representatives from ethnic minorities in border regions. At that time, the Youth Party representative proposed adding occupational representatives, but this was not adopted by all parties due to concerns about double elections. (2) Regarding the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, representatives from all sides agreed that the latter should be responsible to the former. If the President believes that there are difficulties in implementing a resolution passed by the Legislative Yuan, he may submit it for reconsideration. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan agree to uphold the original resolution, the Executive Yuan must still implement it. Representatives from the government and the Communist Party must seek instructions from their respective central authorities before a final decision can be made on this agreement. (3) The drafting of a provincial autonomy law was not agreed upon by all parties. At that time, the Youth Party representative argued that the provincial autonomy law must be passed by the Legislative Yuan to take effect, which was fiercely opposed by the Communist Party representative. The Youth Party representative angrily withdrew from the meeting. By then, it was late in the evening, and all issues remained unresolved. Discussions will continue on the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group continued its meeting on the morning of the 3rd. It is reported that the Youth Party representative sent a letter to convener Sun Ke today, stating that they will not attend the meeting. It is understood that this is because, during the afternoon meeting on the 1st to discuss the constitutional draft, the Communist Party put forward the following opinion on the "Provincial Autonomy Law" issue: "Provinces may formulate fundamental autonomy laws, which the central government may not alter." After an exchange of views, Youth Party representative Chen Qitian explained that "the provincial autonomy law must be passed by the Legislative Yuan to avoid conflicts with the national constitution. Once the provincial autonomy law has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, the central government may not alter it by order." Communist Party representative Qin Bangxian immediately stood up to oppose Chen's proposal, calling it "ignorant" and "muddled." Chen then rose to respond, saying, "Local autonomy bills must be passed by parliament, as is the precedent in Britain. It cannot be called 'ignorant,' let alone 'muddled.' Cursing people casually is not in line with a spirit of consultation or a democratic demeanor. I request that the chairman correct this." Chairman Sun Ke immediately rose to explain that Chen's proposal has a precedent to rely on. We can prove this by examining the British local autonomy bill, which was first passed by Parliament. As for the Communist Party's proposal, there is no precedent in history. We should study the history of autonomy in various countries more. Qin still did not admit his mistake. Finally, Youth Party representative Zeng Qi spoke, saying, "We are here to consult, we should reason, not hurl abuse. Under this unreasonable attitude, we cannot continue the discussion and have no choice but to withdraw." After Zeng finished speaking, he and Chen withdrew at the same time.

### Pacific Earthquake and Tsunami Cause Unprecedented Disaster; Epicenter in the Seabed of the Aleutian Islands; City of Hilo, Hawaii, Almost Completely Destroyed

[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, broadcast on the 2nd: A violent earthquake occurred on the seabed of the Pacific Ocean, with surging tides and white waves reaching the sky. Along the coasts of the Aleutian Islands, California, and other places, waves crashed ashore, sweeping residents into the towering waves. The waves have now subsided, and eighty-six bodies have been found, but the actual number of casualties is certainly more than this. The epicenter of the earthquake was near Alaska. Geologists say that the force of the earthquake traveled through the water at a speed of 400 to 500 miles per hour, and the height of the waves ranged from ten to one hundred feet. The city of Hilo, with a population of 25,000, has been almost completely destroyed.

Also, according to news from Pearl Harbor: At least 300 people in Hilo have died or are missing, and 10,000 people are homeless. The city's food supply is only enough for two days.

[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, broadcast on the 2nd: At 1:30 AM this morning, a violent earthquake occurred from the Aleutian Islands and Alaska in the north to Honolulu in the west and the west coast of the United States in the east. At the same time, gales and heavy rain swept the ocean, and tsunamis caused disasters along the coast. The number of casualties and material losses cannot yet be investigated because the earthquake and storm are still in progress.

The states most severely affected on the west coast of the United States are Washington, Oregon, and California. The lighthouse outside Seattle was completely destroyed, and the personnel on the lighthouse were swept into the sea. Waves were 10 to 20 feet high, and the beaches along the coast were full of broken debris swept in by the waves. All radio stations issued emergency signals, warning ships at sea. The most intense part of the earthquake was on the seabed of the Aleutian Islands, which is 15,000 feet under the sea. The waves on the sea surface were 90 feet high. Naval and air force planes were dispatched to search for ships in distress.

### Byrnes Meets with Truman to Discuss the Situation in the United Nations; The Contents of the Hour-and-a-Half Meeting are Closely Guarded

[US News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Byrnes today discussed the United Nations Security Council meeting and diplomatic issues with President Truman for an hour and a half.

[French News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Byrnes declared at a press conference that the Security Council had previously requested the governments of the Soviet Union and Iran to report on the progress of negotiations between the two countries. However, he was unaware of the widespread rumor that the Secretary-General of the General Assembly had already received replies from the two countries. As for his 90-minute meeting with the President today, the contents were inconvenient to announce, but the main topic of discussion was the situation in the United Nations.

### Soviet Troops Show No Signs of Withdrawal from Iranian Tabriz; British and American Embassies in Iran Have Made Extensive Reports

[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 2nd: Two British observers flew over northern Iran today. Flying over the cities of Qazvin, Tabriz, and Rasht, they confirmed that Soviet troops had indeed withdrawn from Qazvin. There was frequent movement around Tabriz, but no signs of withdrawal. The aviation visibility today was poor, but Russian military stations in the direction of Qazvin and Tangistan have been evacuated. A week ago, there were 22 tanks and fighters stationed in that area, but they are no longer there.

[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 2nd: The British and American embassies in Iran have sent extensive reports to London and Washington on the movements of Soviet troops, including the experience of US Deputy Military Attaché Captain Gatchalian, who personally inspected Tabriz.

[French News Agency, Tehran, 2nd] The Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office, Firooz, told reporters today that the Iranian government has received the Security Council's note requesting information on Iranian-Soviet negotiations. When asked whether Iranian Prime Minister Sadar al-Din and Soviet Ambassador Sazhikov are still in negotiations, and whether these negotiations are related to the issue of Soviet troop withdrawal, Firooz replied: The Prime Minister and the Soviet Ambassador are currently in contact, but the content of the negotiations only involves general issues related to both parties. The issue of future relations between Iran and the Soviet Union will not be discussed until after the fifth or sixth period, that is, when Soviet troops have completely withdrawn. When asked whether the Soviet troop withdrawal has been accelerated, and whether there are any signs of Soviet troops withdrawing from Iran to the Soviet Union, Firooz replied: Soviet troops in Mazandaran Province have almost completely withdrawn. Currently, six Soviet ships are docked at the port of Bandar Anzali on the Caspian Sea, loading Soviet soldiers. As for the government's recent appointment of Mr. Sai as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, it is because the Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Amran, is currently ill, so Mr. Sai was sent to assist him. Sai is a staunch pro-Soviet figure and a member of Prime Minister Sadar al-Din's delegation to the Soviet Union.

### Conference of Five Foreign Ministers May Be Convened This Month; However, Both the United States and France Deny This

[This newspaper's report] London, broadcast on the 2nd: The reason why the Five Foreign Ministers Conference in London last autumn failed was that the Soviet Union was unwilling to give the five powers equal say in drafting peace treaties with the former Balkan enemy states and Italy. As of now, there is no sign that the Soviet Union is willing to give the 21 countries participating in the Paris Peace Conference more rights than passing the final draft. A conference of the five or three foreign ministers may break the deadlock this month. Observers believe that this conference is very likely.

[US News Agency, Washington, 1st] Although Secretary of State Byrnes is here, Acting Secretary of State Acheson continues to perform his duties. State Department Press Secretary McDermott said at a press conference today that Acheson's continued acting as Secretary of State is to allow Byrnes, who is attending the United Nations Security Council meeting in New York, to freely handle all matters other than the routine business of the State Department. When asked about reports that French Ambassador Bonnet suggested that the foreign ministers of the four major powers hold a meeting in Paris on April 14th, McDermott said that he had not heard of such a suggestion. He pointed out that the Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to begin on May 1st, but there is no agreement on a foreign ministers conference before then.

[French News Agency, New York, 1st] Reports that French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet met with US Secretary of State Byrnes and proposed holding a foreign ministers conference in Paris on April 1st to discuss the Spanish issue and the German control issue have been denied by the French Embassy in the United States.

### American Rocket Weapons; "Little Jane" and "Holy Moses" Have the Greatest Power

[US News Agency, Washington, 1st] The US Army and Navy Department's Scientific Research and Invention Group released its first report on the invention and use of new rocket weapons during World War II. The report revealed that the US Army and Navy did not have a rocket launcher on the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. One of the best-performing new rockets is the newest and largest, nicknamed "Little Jane," an air-to-ground rocket launcher. Each pair of these rocket launchers is placed in the bomb bay of the aircraft. The projectile is 10 feet 3 inches long, 1 foot in diameter, and weighs 1,284 pounds. American fighter planes equipped with this type of rocket launcher have a power comparable to a single salvo from a light cruiser. During the Battle of Okinawa, the US military used "Little Jane" to strike the Japanese. Another powerful and widely used air-to-ground rocket launcher is called "Holy Moses." This rocket launcher is 6 feet long, weighs 140 pounds, and can reach a speed of 1,375 feet per second. In July 1944, the US military began using "Holy Moses" in combat. Each P-47 fighter carried eight of these rockets. They assisted in breaking through the Saint-Lô defenses during the Normandy landings and made great contributions. By the end of the war, the Navy had manufactured super rocket ships, each of which could launch 300 to 500 rockets per minute. A new type of bazooka was also invented at the end of the war. The effective range of the well-known anti-tank bazooka was 200 to 300 yards. The effective range of the new bazooka can reach 700 yards, and the projectile speed and explosive power are doubled compared to the standard bazooka projectile.

### Obstacles to Japan's Democratization

The Allied Council for Japan is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting in Tokyo on the 5th of this month. The Chinese Chief Representative, Lieutenant General Zhu Shimin and his party, arrived in Tokyo on the 31st of last month. On the eve of his departure for his post, Zhu made a statement to Shanghai reporters, praising General MacArthur's policy of governing Japan. Since Japan's surrender, MacArthur, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, has been stationed in Japan to implement governance. He represents not only the United States but also other allied nations that fought against Japan. The establishment of the Allied Council for Japan is not an organization to supervise MacArthur, but a machine to assist MacArthur in governing. Gathering representatives of the allied nations in one place is intended to pool wisdom and broaden ideas. Its purpose is to assist, not to supervise. In the past, the major allied nations, especially the Soviet Union, often held considerably different views on governing Japan. Now, with the establishment of the Allied Council for Japan, representatives from various countries can have the opportunity to exchange opinions, which may reduce some of the past differences. MacArthur's hard work and dedication over the past seven months in governing Japan should be universally praised by the world. The clearing of the remnants of feudal forces, the dissolution of the zaibatsu, and assisting Japan in its progress toward democratization are all aimed at fostering a democratic rebirth for defeated Japan. As the Allied Council for Japan is about to hold its first meeting, I would like to express my views on this issue.

Japan was the main culprit of this war, and now, as a defeated nation under control, it has lost its eligibility to participate in international activities. This is the punishment that the main instigator of aggression deserves, but from a longer-term perspective, this is only a temporary transition. Even if the allied nations need to control Japan for thirty, fifty, or even one hundred years, there will eventually come a time when this control must be lifted. Therefore, the success of the allied nations' control over Japan lies not in the length of the control period, but in its effectiveness. The meaning of control is more like carrying out education than executing a judicial judgment. It is essential to make the Japanese people thoroughly repent for the mistakes of their past actions, understand why their actions were wrong, and how to avoid making the same mistakes again. Only with this thorough self-awareness can Japan have a new birth. MacArthur's governance of Japan has focused on removing the various objective obstacles to Japan's self-awareness, such as the dissolution of the zaibatsu and the eradication of the remnants of feudal forces, which is a necessary foundation for Japan's self-awareness.

According to news reports, the Japanese people in Hokkaido have recently begun to stir and express resistance to the Allied occupation. Even if the number of such mutineers is not too large, or only a very small part of the Japanese people, the existence of such signs should be taken seriously. Coincidentally, when the news of the Japanese people in Hokkaido plotting rebellion came, the remaining Nazis in Germany were also starting to stir. According to a Reuters report from Berlin on March 31, British and American military intelligence personnel have discovered Nazi groups plotting rebellion. According to another telegram from Frankfurt, British troops have destroyed Nazi secret groups in their occupation zone with several thousand Allied forces, and there were many firefights, as if in combat. According to General Shepp, chief of US military intelligence, the purpose of this Nazi secret group is to implement the second stage of Nazi political strategy, hoping to seize power in the future by clever means. It is inevitable that groups of the same nature exist in Japan. Preventing the revival of Japanese aggressive imperial ideology is not simply about eradicating such secret groups. If such groups exist in Japan, we can be confident that the Allied authorities will take effective measures. But the real problem lies on the other side.

That is, we must remove the two main obstacles that will prevent Japan from democratizing: the Emperor system and State Shintoism. If the Emperor system and State Shintoism are not eradicated, then the Japanese militarists' dream of "Hakko Ichiu" will continue, just as the Nazi remnants are rekindling their hopes and want to implement the second stage of the Nazi political strategy. Although the Atlantic Charter proposed religious freedom, Japan's State Shintoism was created by the ruling militarists to implement their rule. Since this religion is a political tool of the Japanese rulers, the principle of religious freedom cannot be applied to Japan's State Shintoism, and it should be eradicated by external forces. The Japanese imperial system must also be eradicated by external forces. The Japanese people have been deeply poisoned by the imperial system and State Shintoism, and they themselves seem to have no power to clear this poison. Therefore, regarding the imperial system and State Shintoism, we cannot allow the Japanese people to act on their own. Japan's constitution is being revised. If these two poisons, which are actually two-in-one, cannot be eradicated, then the revision of the constitution will be equivalent to empty words.

Although our government has not explicitly expressed its position on abolishing the Japanese imperial family, the entire nation has a consensus. The Chinese representative to the Allied Council for Japan has taken office, and we are confident that he will express the wishes of the Chinese people. For the sake of peace and happiness in China and the world, we cannot allow the revival of Japanese aggression. Preventing the revival of Japanese aggression requires the eradication of the Emperor system and State Shintoism as a prerequisite. Japan must truly embark on the path of democratization only after these two poisons are eradicated.

### US Coal Miners Begin General Strike

Steel Production to Be Affected

[TASS New One Day Telegram] According to a New York radio broadcast, 400,000 US coal miners began a strike late yesterday.

It is expected that the coal mine industry strike will cause a sharp reduction in steel production.

### MacArthur Deeply Distressed by the Conduct of US Troops in Japan

Special Letter to Soldiers

[Our newspaper] Tokyo, 2nd Broadcast: General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, wrote a letter today to all US Army soldiers stationed in Japan, stating that he has recently received letters from American families expressing deep distress over the chaotic relationships between occupying forces and unfaithful Japanese women. Unfortunately, some people have misinterpreted the true meaning of "fraternization" and have engaged in various immoral behaviors. Now, Japanese brothels and all disreputable places have been prohibited to the soldiers. This is a matter of self-control, and no order prohibiting soldiers from cutting off social relations with the Japanese people can be effective. This matter is both inconvenient to implement and cannot solve the problem, but will only undermine the self-esteem and human rights of American soldiers.

### British Delegation Aims to Help India Formulate a New Constitution, Cripps Delivers a Speech, Negotiations in New Delhi Underway

[Our newspaper] London, 2nd Broadcast: The British Cabinet delegation continued negotiations with Indian opposition leaders in New Delhi today.

[French News Agency New Delhi, 1st Telegram] British Trade Minister Cripps recently told reporters: The British delegation's visit to India is not to represent Britain in negotiations with India, but only to help India reach a consensus internally. Therefore, the main purpose of this visit is to assist India in formulating a new constitution to achieve independence. As for the future of India, it is entirely in the hands of the Indian people. The British government believes that its mission will be completed as soon as the new constitution is established, and it does not want to bear any responsibility for future developments. Therefore, when we leave India and return home, we will allow India to be independent.

Hope for Relief for Refugees in Jiangsu Province

The disaster area in Jiangsu Province is vast, and refugees are everywhere, urgently in need of relief. The provincial government has previously contacted the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to launch winter relief work in the provincial capital, and has organized charitable relief associations in various counties and cities to actively handle relief matters. However, relief supplies are insufficient for distribution, causing disaster victims to be unable to benefit fully. For this reason, Chairman Wang specially sent an earnest telegram to the headquarters of the General Relief Association, requesting the rapid allocation of a large number of supplies to expand relief. The association has now telegraphed the provincial government, stating that it has ordered the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch to earnestly handle relief and set a deadline for reporting. If the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch can reform its past habits of procrastination and shirking responsibility, the refugees in Jiangsu Province will benefit greatly.

Severe Food Shortage Leads to Starvation Suicides

Since the price of coarse rice was set at 25,000 yuan per stone on the 19th of last month, rice and grain have disappeared from the countryside and are not available on the market. General speculators have taken the opportunity to raise prices, and the black market has risen to about 40,000 yuan. In the urban area in particular, not a grain of rice is sold. People have no rice to cook and generally eat flat grass bran cakes for a living. It is reported that cases of starvation and suicide are often heard of in various townships.

Difficult to Make a Living, Slaughter Cattle for Food: Farmers in the four rural areas of this county are selling off their livestock due to the severe food shortage. Some are slaughtering them for food, resulting in a severe shortage of cattle. Last month, cattle prices had already soared to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per head. Pig prices have also risen to 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Spring plowing is approaching, and there is great anxiety due to the lack of cattle for plowing.

### The Future of People's Food is Extremely Optimistic, Minister Xu Indicates, Subsidized Flour Sales to Resume Within Days

[Our newspaper] This reporter recently visited Food Minister Xu Kan, who was holding a meeting with grain merchant representatives and others and could not spare the time, so he appointed an important official of the ministry to meet on his behalf. He spoke with certainty, expressing extreme optimism about the future of food administration in China and Shanghai. He said: The minister's task here is, firstly, to review the supply situation of military and civilian food, inspect the ministry's business, present it to President Song, and convene relevant personnel to jointly study the food problem. Secondly, to strive to smooth the flow of rice and grain sources, it is expected that after the weather clears, grain prices will inevitably fall. The rice and grain reserves in this city are still abundant, and the sources are smooth. In the future, we will continue to make efforts to increase the reserves and smooth the sources. Therefore, the future of rice and grain in this city will fall, not rise. It is reported that President Song attaches special importance to the food problem during this visit to Shanghai. In addition to ordering the thickening of reserves and smoothing of sources, he also hopes that the provinces can reasonably hand over grain reserves that exceed normal consumption. For military grain in various provinces that have been paid for several months ago, he has ordered that the full amount be urged. It is reported that although the disaster situation in Hunan is severe, it is not as severe as reported by various parties. Now, in addition to the military grain in the province, which should be collected on its own, the ministry has made overall arrangements for the military grain in other major military regions. Regarding the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA) plan for the allocation of food to China, Minister Xu recently sent a special telegram to Jiang Tingfu, the director of the Chinese "Executive Headquarters" in the United States, focusing on two points: (1) Notifying the disaster situation in China, and (2) Having a minimum required number for the food allocation to China from the "UNRRA." Finally, it is reported that the "UNRRA" flour had previously stopped selling, but it has now been decided to resume selling it within one or two days. The selling price this time will be slightly lower than the market price, in order to curb the rampant black market and gradually reduce the flour price to a reasonable level. The Ministry of Food has also ordered a large quantity of rice and flour from abroad. It is said that the first batch of flour will have 180,000 bags, and the exact amount of rice is unknown. The purchase contract has now been signed and foreign exchange will be settled soon. It is said that since arriving in Shanghai, Minister Xu has repeatedly convened meetings with existing and past grain merchants and local people concerned in this city. He has discussed many issues related to smoothing the sources.

### Registered Opium Addicts Not Allowed to Change Residence, Deadline for Household Heads to Report Addicts is the 15th of This Month, Hospitals Pose a Problem During Compulsory Rehabilitation

[Our newspaper] According to news from the General Bureau, the registration of opium addicts for self-renewal, which was handled by the bureau, ended at the end of March. As of yesterday, the bureau had a total of 4,565 registered people reported by 17 branch bureaus. Among them, the Taishan Branch Bureau registered the largest number of people, with 555 people. The number of registered people from several other branch bureaus has not yet been reported to the General Bureau.

It is learned that there has never been statistics on the exact number of opium addicts in this city. During the enemy-puppet occupation period, the puppet opium prohibition bureau registered approximately 13,000 opium addicts. However, many of them registered in order to purchase allocated opium, and some have moved or died, so this number cannot be accurate. It is heard that the police bureau will order registered opium addicts not to change their residence. The investigators sent by the bureau will have formal official documents from the police bureau as proof. If there are unscrupulous elements impersonating and extorting money, they can be handed over to the police bureau for strict handling. The bureau is currently requesting the city government to allocate more than 17 million yuan in inspection funds to inspect opium addicts' opium addiction. Also, the police bureau has designated a period of two weeks, from April 1st to the 15th, as the period for household heads to report opium addicts in their households. If unregistered opium addicts are discovered after the deadline, the household head will also be subject to joint and several punishment.

It is also learned that the police bureau originally intended to use more than 100 boxes of opium seized from the puppet opium prohibition bureau as raw materials for opium cessation. However, after the opium was jointly received by the Jing'an Temple Branch of the police bureau, the garrison headquarters, the gendarmerie regiment, and the local baojia chiefs, the original site of the puppet opium prohibition bureau was used for other purposes, and the opium was moved to the garrison headquarters for temporary storage. During the relocation, more than a dozen small packages of fake opium were found. Therefore, the police bureau will consider using it after this matter is resolved.

This reporter then went to the health bureau to visit the authorities in charge of opium cessation medical affairs. They said that in addition to ordering the municipal hospitals under their jurisdiction to pay attention to promoting opium cessation, they have also notified all public and private hospitals and physicians who have obtained business licenses in this city to assist in handling the matter. The municipal hospitals under the bureau have a total of ten units, including a municipal opium cessation hospital that specializes in opium cessation, located at No. 907, Yokohama Road. It is said that the bureau is currently facing two difficulties in opium cessation work: one is the lack of anesthetics. The bureau initially planned to self-produce anesthetic opium cessation drugs, but the Ministry of Health ordered that opium cessation drugs in Beijing and Shanghai should be manufactured by the Ministry of Health and then allocated in a unified manner, so it gave up. The second is that hospitals are quite lacking when implementing compulsory rehabilitation. It is reported that there must be many opium addicts who voluntarily quit, but there are also extremely poor opium addicts who must be provided with free opium cessation. The bureau is now actively planning to build more opium cessation hospitals and add beds in order to ensure the smooth implementation of opium cessation matters.

### Employees of Two Foreign News Agencies Go on Strike Yesterday

Director Wu of the Central Printing Bureau Talks

The labor unrest at the Central Printing Bureau has lasted for many days. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, factories No. 1, 3, and 4 of the bureau have resumed work, but the wage issue has yet to be resolved. The workers' proposal to use the cost of living index as the standard for raises and decreases should be protected. He has ordered the factory to prepare a plan in accordance with this principle so that it can be submitted to the Wage Review Committee for rapid approval. In short, all reasonable demands will be accommodated as much as possible, but excessive demands are truly beyond our ability to help. We sincerely hope that all workers understand that state-owned enterprises are of great importance. Those who have not resumed work should resume work quickly. For those who have not been resolved, we will handle them impartially.

### Blood Splatters in a Brothel, Prostitute Killed and Self-inflicted Wound, a Tragedy Occurs in Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, Early in the Morning

Ding Fengying, a Yangzhou prostitute, 19 years old, was sold last winter by her father to Shao Xu, an old madam of a brothel located at No. 7, A, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, Jiujiang Road, due to poverty. Yu Rucai, a patron from Shandong (seen), who is in his forties, worked as a partner in the China Bird Shop at No. 18, Guangdong Road, and was a sailor on the Japanese ship, the Haruko-maru last year. He has known Fengying for three months and has spent a lot of money on her services. He wanted to marry Ding but she was unwilling.

On the 30th of last month, Yu went to Feng's place. It is said that he had a ship business and firmly invited her to go to Qingdao with him. Feng declined politely because she was not free, so Yu harbored extreme resentment. At about 7 pm on the 1st of this month, he went to Feng's place again to continue the joy. At about 6:10 the next morning, he took advantage of Feng's deep sleep and stabbed her in the chest with a sharp blade, causing her intestines to flow out. Ding cried out for help in great pain. Yu, fearing punishment for his crime, stabbed himself in the chest, about three inches deep. Blood splattered all over the bed. Shao Xu, the madam downstairs, heard the alarm and rushed to the third-floor attic to investigate. She was shocked by the sight and immediately ran to report to the Lao Zha Branch. The criminal division sent division member Feng Xiushan and police officer Xu Bingnan to investigate. They summoned an ambulance to send the two to Renji Hospital.

### This City's Provisional Council Held Its 45th Meeting Yesterday, Councilors Raised Many Questions Regarding Improving Sanitation and Eliminating Illiteracy

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Provisional Council held its fourth general assembly at 9:15 AM yesterday morning. Chairman Xu Jilun was absent, and Vice Chairman Xi Yushu presided in his place. A total of forty councilors were present. Councilors Feng Youzhen and Shen Chunhui represented the council yesterday morning in attending the memorial mass for the late Councilor Zhao Zhiyou at the Catholic Church on Luban Road and the funeral at the Lujiawan Cemetery. After a report by Yu Songyun, Director of the Health Bureau, councilors raised questions:

What Remedial Measures are There for Expanding Free Hospital Beds?

Councilor Xu Shihao stood up and said: (1) There is a lack of hospital beds. If adding beds requires payment, it will still not benefit the common people. What remedial measures does the Health Bureau have to expand free hospital beds? (2) It has been nearly seven months since the takeover. Has the work been completed? Why has the First Municipal Hospital not yet been taken over? Can the takeover of other hospitals be expedited? (3) Cholera is about to become epidemic. Is there any preparation for epidemic prevention? It is hoped that the tragedy seen in Chongqing will not be staged in Shanghai. (4) Fake medicines are rampant in the market, harming people greatly, and should be strictly banned. Zhou Xuehu said: Venereal diseases are prevalent in this city and universal free examination should be carried out quickly. The majority of women still give birth using old methods and rational methods must be promoted. More than half of children die from smallpox, so special attention should be paid. Zhao Banfu painfully stated that the equipment for the winter shelter on Jessfield Road does not meet hygiene standards. Workers who returned from Chongqing were sent to the shelter. How can they survive! The Labor Hospital will be built in three years, which is too long. Can efforts be doubled and completed within a year and a half? Doctors are terrible and scary when they see patients. How can patients dare to approach them? Can this be improved? Shui Xiangyun said: There is several times more garbage in the streets now than during the leased territories. There are only five ordinary hospitals, and even fewer civilian hospitals. Please pay attention. The treatment of cleaning workers should also be reasonable. Shen Feng suggested that the time for clearing garbage and manure should be advanced and there are too many prostitutes, who should be forced to receive treatment and clinics should be rectified.

DDT Insecticide Should Not Be Stored in Warehouses

Zhan Wenhau asked that DDT not be stored in warehouses and that it should be used universally. The results of inspecting fake medicines and fake wines should be announced at any time. Why has the First Municipal Hospital not been taken over? Ye Fenghu agreed that DDT should be sprayed on a large scale by airplanes. Flush toilets are not hygienic when they are available but not working. Can the work of clearing ditches be resolved quickly? Garbage cans should be matched with users to ensure convenience. Hou Junren asked why the Health Bureau did not go when schools in the suburbs requested vaccination? Health stations should be set up universally. Fan Caiji asked: The Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road does not serve all laborers, and the fees are high. Can this be improved? Are there plans to set up a labor hospital in the Pudong factory area? Xu Yongzuo asked the director to report in detail on the hospitals that have been taken over and those that have not, and how many there are? Can we ask the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate beds? It is reported that the system of public prostitution should be implemented. Should this system be established? Lu Enlan requested that publicity on maternal and child health and venereal diseases be expanded. Lü Entan proposed that unqualified doctors and hospitals with unqualified equipment be quickly banned. Cao Jun said that garbage in the suburbs should be thoroughly disposed of. Bars and restaurants should not arbitrarily post the words "In Bounds" of the US military-designated cafeteria. Zhou Feicheng said that school health is limited to 14 schools, which is too few, and should be carried out universally. Li Hao advocated that medicines should be inspected before being supplied for use. Attention should be paid to the attitude of doctors, nurses and staff. What effective methods are there for treating sexually transmitted diseases?

Director Yu's Reply

Director Yu Gao then gave a brief reply: There are not enough beds due to (1) a lack of houses. The Enemy Property Administration Bureau has been requested, but there have been no results. (2) There is a lack of funding. Plans have been drafted for the construction of a labor hospital, but there are insufficient funds, and the government has been asked to allocate funds. The First Municipal Hospital is located in the city center. After the former Japanese army occupied it, it was converted into an army hospital. The Military Command Department has taken over, and negotiations have failed several times. Cholera vaccine can be supplied for one million people. Various vaccines used in other places are manufactured and supplied by this bureau. When epidemics are prevalent, it is planned to merge all municipal hospitals into an epidemic prevention hospital. Although the greatest efforts have been made to clear streets and lanes, financial resources and materials are lacking, resulting in imperfections. We are determined to continue to handle it in order to achieve the pre-war state. If workers arbitrarily dump manure into ditches, please report it to this bureau, and they will be dismissed. You can send a letter to the bureau to clear the ditches, and people will be sent to clear them. In the future, the clearing work must be completed before 6:00 AM. The treatment of workers follows the central government's regulations, and each person can now get 41,000 yuan per month. In the Pudong area, there is now the Sacred Heart Hospital for the diagnosis and treatment of workers. In the future, a labor hospital will be built again. Four worker health clinics have been set up. The Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road is not run by the city and can be investigated. The winter shelter is not run by this bureau, but personnel have been dispatched to diagnose and treat smallpox and other diseases since yesterday. The kindness of doctors, nurses, etc. will be urged to be corrected at any time. School health is also planned to be expanded. If a letter is received, we will definitely go to serve. Not much DDT has been received and it has not been stored in the warehouse. Shanghai was sprayed by airplanes in the very beginning of the recovery. If you want to hold it again, you must consult with the US military authorities. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration plans to allocate more than 1,000 beds, but it has not yet been received. There is a portion of penicillin and DDT among the drugs received and it is a small amount. Other items include milk powder and typhus drugs. I strongly agree with the compulsory treatment of prostitutes. After a large number of drugs are shipped, it can be implemented. The "In Bounds" sign at the bar has been investigated jointly with the US military medical officer several times. The meeting was adjourned at 12:01, and other inquiries will be answered in writing.

Should Foreign-Run Schools Be Subjected to Additional Supervision?

The fifth congress was in the afternoon, and Mayor Qian, Deputy Mayor He, Secretary General Shen, and Chairman Xu Jiyi all attended. Secretary General Xiang Quan reported that a total of 31 proposals, 9 letters of opinion from citizens, and 2 petitions were received. After the report by Deputy Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau was completed, the councilors raised questions in succession: Councilor Zhan Wenhua asked: In the report, there is a Shanghai Japanese Middle School at Matsui Road in the city center. Why has it not been corrected until now? The demeanor of a great nation cannot be so generous. The enslaved education that primary and secondary school students received during the enemy-puppet period should be corrected quickly. Zhou Feicheng proposed: (1) Vocational education should be increased and the ratio should be specified with secondary education. (2) School equipment is too incomplete and efforts should be made to add it. (3) After the Western Children's School is taken over, should the expenses of Chinese people be used to train the children of foreigners? Is it planned to suspend it next semester? The Sino-French School on Ningxia Road has not been taken over, please investigate. It is traditionally believed that the Education Bureau is working hard in personnel selection and are admired. But it is proposed: (1) The treatment of teachers and staff should be adjusted. Teacher strikes are an implication that students do not obey discipline and affect their personality. Should the Education Bureau be responsible? Is it appropriate to raise money to support teachers in the movement to respect teachers and it should be considered. (2) What are the plans to subsidize excellent private schools and ban unqualified private schools? (3) Schools in Zhabei should be investigated and increased. Shen Chunhui proposed to quickly eliminate illiteracy and set up schools universally. Zhan Wenhua asked again: (1) The venue of this council is a French school, has it been taken over? If not, why? (2) The Education Bureau plans to establish large-scale museums, libraries, art galleries, etc. If there are such materials, it is of course good, but can we postpone it temporarily and use the material resources, financial resources, and manpower to eliminate the work of Yuyu first. (3) The Qing situation in the blind sector is sympathized by everyone. On the one hand, it is hoped to improve treatment, and on the other hand, it is proposed that the general assembly pass a motion to pay tribute to the teachers at all levels in this city. Wang Bing stood up to express his agreement. Pan Xulun asked to pay attention to running remedial schools. Ji Hao asked the Bureau to subsidize the expenses of private schools, otherwise, please consider slightly increasing tuition fees to maintain the lives of teachers and staff. He Bingsong asked what plans were there for the establishment of the Roosevelt Library in the city, which he had heard about before?

Deputy Director Li's Reply

Deputy Director Li then replied to everyone: The name Matsui Road was not changed in the report, which was indeed a mistake. The schools that were taken over after the false government school and the students were screened, examined, and subjected to ideological training. There are early plans to expand vocational education, but the development of secondary schools must be taken into account. There are 2,000 boxes of instruments at the Central Research Institute, which were stored in the house of an Englishman during the fall of Shanghai. They have now been taken out, most of which are instruments used in junior high schools, but they must be approved by the Ministry of Education before they can be distributed. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Education. Western children's schools should be run in accordance with Chinese education policies, but during the transition period, they will continue to operate as before. For example, the American Boys' School is entirely funded by Americans. In the future, foreigners should run schools to the point where they are supervised by Chinese. More than 50 Catholic schools have partially followed the Chinese system. The Sino-French School has not been taken over due to unclear property rights. In terms of treatment, government subsidies are limited, or tuition fees may be appropriately increased, but it should not be too much. At the same time, poor students should be given free or half-free tuition. There are plans to eliminate illiteracy. In addition to the existing public classes, it is planned to add 1,600 elementary school classes. Within this year, the number of children receiving education can be increased by 80,000, and 1,600 classes can be added for adults, with each class divided into two sessions, which can increase the number of people receiving education by 160,000. After the reply was completed, the chairman reported that the first group will hold a committee meeting in the auditorium this morning to review matters related to civil affairs, autonomy, and security, and the third group will hold a committee meeting in the auditorium to review matters related to education and culture. The second group will hold a committee meeting in the rest room to review matters related to finance, economy, and construction. However, news reporters are not allowed to participate. In the afternoon, there will be the sixth general assembly, and the Land Administration Bureau will report.

### Councilor Xi and Others Propose Extending the Exchange Period for Puppet Currency

[Reported by this newspaper] Council Vice-Chairman Xi Yushu and councilors Xu Yongzuo, Wang Bing, Luo Qinghua, Lü Entan and others have proposed that because the area is vast and the amount of puppet currency is huge, the deadline for exchanging it should be extended to alleviate the hardships of the people. It is reported that the Finance Bureau has sent a telegram to the municipal government. It is also heard that the deadline for the puppet currency can be extended to the end of May.

Councilors Zhan Wenhua, Shu Xincheng, etc. requested the municipal government to cooperate with the garrison headquarters to quickly investigate all the houses occupied in the city, and distribute them fairly to the citizens to alleviate the most severe housing shortage in the city at present.

### Zhao Zhiyou Was Buried Yesterday

Provisional Councilor Zhao Zhiyou passed away on the 28th of last month. At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhao's family members and relatives and friends held a memorial mass at the Catholic Church on Luban Road, and then his body was taken to the Lujiawan Cemetery for burial.

### Speculation Gangs Stirring After Long Inactivity: Gold Prices Rising Again; High and Low Prices Differ by 160,000

Gold, after a long period of decline, suddenly rebounded yesterday, turning from falling to rising. The main reason is that the nationalization of gold may take a considerable period of time, and the Bank of China's allocation price is not cheap. It is rumored that there is considerable replenishment in secret. In addition, the weather has been sunny in recent days, and the actual sales of jewelry stores have turned strong. There is considerable replenishment in the black market. Moreover, foreign goods are pouring in. In order to save the business community, there are rumors of resetting the exchange rate against the US dollar. Speculators, after a long period of inactivity, are stirring and becoming active again. The confidence of all parties has turned firm. Initially, inheriting the weakness of the previous day, Tianjin gangs and securities firms dumped gold, once breaking the 1.4 million mark, seeing a low of 1.38 million yuan. Soon, gold buyers emerged one after another. At noon, it entered a good state, jumping out of the 1.5 million yuan mark, rising by 160,000 yuan, reaching 1.54 million yuan. The price at noon was slightly reduced. The momentum in the afternoon was even more stable. In the end, it was raised by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Gold jewelry was listed at 165,000 yuan, silver ingots at 1,600 yuan, and silver dollars at around 1,050 yuan.

### Rumors That the US Exchange Rate Will Be Relaxed: US Dollars Turn Firm From Weakness; Hong Kong Notes Also Rebound

Foreign currencies, US dollars, also followed the rise in gold, turning firm from weakness. The Bank of China's exchange rate against the US dollar is still 2,020 yuan. It is rumored that it may be relaxed this month. Confidence is strong. At the slightest problem, it rose from 1,860 yuan to around 1,950 yuan, rising by 70 yuan. Hong Kong notes are also stable. Old notes rose by 5 yuan, and new notes rose by 20 to 25 yuan. Telegraphic transfers to Hong Kong and Robbie are still as stable as before.

### Unified C Bond Continues to Fall

Falling by 1,000 yuan in two days

Yesterday, the public debt market was still weak and unable to rise. Confidence was dispersed. Unified C bonds fell from 2,880 yuan to 2,420 yuan. When it was learned that the stock market had turned firm, the decline stopped at noon, but it still fell by 450 yuan. A, B, D, and E bonds were each 150 yuan lower, and the volume of transactions was very small.

### Chinese Stocks Turn From Falling to Rising: Jewish Merchants Form Dummy Companies to Short Foreign Stocks

Chinese stocks turned from falling to rising. The intention of the Sichuan gang to sell weakened. Speculators held chips and the atmosphere of selling short turned to lifting. The bulls once again used their old trick of pushing up prices. Moreover, the decline was too rapid. The rebound was also expected. The morning opening inherited the weakness of the previous day. There were only sellers and no buyers, forming a one-sided situation. Under the selling pressure of gold merchants, Wingson Yarn fell from 4,800 to 4,200, American Asiatic dropped from 3,800 to 3,200, King Fook fell to 320 yuan, New Kwong approached the 300 yuan mark, Kin Hing was at 220, Wing Fung at 1,200 yuan, and Sun Wah at 780 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the selling pressure from the Sichuan gang and short sellers weakened. After the price dropped, there was considerable absorption from outside investors. The price of gold rebounded very quickly, and securities firms rose up to lift prices. By noon, they had risen by about half. After the buying momentum was activated in the afternoon, the bulls competed to buy, pushing prices higher and higher. King Fook rebounded to the 400 yuan mark. The last price for yarn factories was 4,900, and American Asiatic was 3,900, which was slightly higher than the last price of the previous day. Among foreign stocks, only Cheung Tai Timber was still strong, with transactions at 7,000 yuan. It is rumored that Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco have Jewish merchants forming dummy companies to dump their inventory, and prices have fallen by 10% to 20%.

### Yarn Market Still Depressed: Spot Cotton Transactions Also Decrease

The yarn market was still lifeless yesterday. The main reason is that sales to customers were still weak. There were only a few transactions in Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou. Small factories were eager to sell, and had to depreciate prices to accommodate. For example, 20-count Double Phoenix Camel brand was reduced to 840,000, and there were some transactions. 20-count Double Horse closed at 1.11 million, down another 40,000. Prices of other brands fell by 20,000 to 30,000. The trend is still depressed. The Building Materials Company sold cotton cloth and American cotton cloth as usual yesterday.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton price rose by 25 to 6 pounds. The price was about 37.79 USD, Metterlin spot price 28.34 USD. The Mukden spot cotton market was steady, but transactions were greatly reduced. The price of foreign cotton rebounded sharply, and some merchants holding spot goods raised prices, making negotiations difficult to approach. The Jianfang Company also maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The private Zhongxin No. 2 factory had purchased about 102,000 USD at the Metterlin price 83,000 USD. The above prices are factory prices. The price of Brazilian cotton was 78,000 to 80,000 yuan, which is the price for delivery at the dock.

### Woolen Fabric Orders Too High

The woolen fabric market was still stable yesterday. Due to the depletion of inventory, the standard selling price of the China Textile Corporation has risen and not fallen. Moreover, they are all goods sold in autumn and winter, making it difficult to expect cheap prices. Fellow merchants have greatly increased their orders from British, American, and Polish foreign firms, such as French flannel, Harris tweed, various types of woolen cloth, and worsted fabric. The price ranges from 3.8 USD to 15 USD per yard. For most foreign orders, a 30% down payment is required. The shipping period is divided into July, August, and September. It is said that there are many non-down payment orders.

### Tea Market Slump Has Not Ended

The demand for Chinese tea is still very urgent in European and American countries. However, currently, because the new tea has not yet appeared on the market, and the old tea has been shelved for many years, its quality is inevitably changing. It is no longer suitable for their tastes. Currently, foreign articles should be urgently needed. It is heard that the New York Chechang has ordered more than 100,000 pounds of black tea from Taiwan and Ceylon. As for the tea market in this city, both this street and the sales to other areas were extremely stagnant. Only those who profit by depreciating sales are pouring in. In short, as the Mingqian Longjing tea in Wenzhou is about to be launched, fellow merchants have no intention of doing business with old goods, causing transactions to slump. The market sentiment is unusually inflated, and the slump in Qimen tea is even more intense, with each load falling below 120,000 yuan.

### Lake Silk and Pig Bristles Shipped to the United States; Large Quantities of Relief Supplies Shipped to Taiwan and Qingdao

A large batch of silk and wool was shipped to the United States. The China Post ship of the Fuk Lai Shipping Company, left Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday and sailed directly to Seattle. It was loaded with more than 200 bales of Lake Silk, more than 1,700 pieces of pig bristles, and about 300 pieces of cowhide and chicken/duck feathers for shipment to the United States. A large number of relief supplies were shipped to Taiwan and Qingdao. The Ninghai ship of the Taikoo Company sailed from Shanghai to Qingdao yesterday morning, transporting more than 28,000 bags of flour and more than 3,000 pieces of old clothes and shoes. The Haichen ship of the China Merchants Bureau is scheduled to sail to Haiphong today, passing by Taiwan, with a large number of relief flour, 100,000 bags, and 30,000 bags of regular flour, being shipped to Keelung.

### White Tung Oil in Zhejiang Is Popular; Hankou Tung Oil Is Still Fair

White tung oil has seen repeated improvements in the market due to the lack of sources from Zhejiang and Hangzhou. Recently, the price in Hangzhou has increased to 72,000-73,000 yuan. However, for foreign trade, it is only sold for 74,000-75,000 yuan for delivery at the dock, so it has not been able to get closer. However, recently, there has been a continuous arrival of goods from Hankou, from dozens to hundreds of barrels, arriving intermittently. The price of 70,000 yuan is still worth it, so exports are continuous and there are some transactions. The current focus of various firms has shifted from Zhejiang tung oil to Hankou tung oil. However, the transportation between Shanghai and Hankou is not smooth, because the number of transport ships is not complete, and the schedule is not fixed. Although there are arrivals, they are always intermittent. If shipping can be restored, the source can be more abundant.

### Good News for Price Stabilization: Rice Prices Continue to Fall; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Are All Weak

Yesterday, the supply of rice to the market continued. Actual sales at stores were weak. Moreover, domestic prices reported a decline, so confidence was unusually weak. Both japonica and indica rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White Yin Yuan rice was weak and lacked transactions, falling another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Flour was very slow to move, continuing to fall by 500 yuan. The oil market saw a gradual increase in arrivals from Qingdao, and stores took a wait-and-see attitude. Moreover, the Enemy Property Management Office continued to issue price-stabilized oils, and the price was still about 10% off, so confidence was not strong and continued to fall sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The arrival and inventory of soybeans were abundant, and there were no buyers, falling sharply by more than 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes followed suit by 500 yuan, and bran also fell by 200 to 300 yuan. Raw peanuts were also the same. The downstream of each commodity stopped rising and fell back, and prices were weak by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Cotton cakes also fell by 500 yuan. Red beans were originally a specialty, but now, because Little Luzon is slightly more efficient, they are temporarily stable.

In addition, according to market information, a total of more than 9,000 shi of eight types of white japonica rice arrived in the city yesterday. The types and shi are as follows: White japonica 4,797 shi, thin rice 1,749 shi, early rice 1,905 shi, mutton indica 160 shi, Du indica 538 shi, Wu indica 175 shi, white yuan 115 shi, yin yuan 70 shi.

### Coal Prices Falling Frequently

Yesterday, the coal market was consistently sluggish, and the market gradually softened. White coal, sieved and ash coal sellers kept coming, but buyers were hesitant. The market collapsed unilaterally. Bituminous coal, sieved and lump coal also fell because of the small number of arrivals. Bituminous coal dross was still hovering in a soft range.

### Brunner Mond Has Shipments; Caustic Soda Offered at Low Prices

A large batch of American caustic soda arrived in Shanghai. The Bund docks were lined up in a long snake formation, as reported yesterday. It is now heard that Brunner Mond will have shipments, with each barrel only costing 60,000 yuan, which is much cheaper than the market price, so the trend is very sluggish. However, it is heard that the inventory in Shanghai is very low, and the demand from factories is very large, so although there are continuous arrivals, the market will not plummet.

### Summary of Business Conditions

Sugar: Yesterday, the Enemy Property Management Bureau released 3,000 pieces of medium sugar, with a price of 48,000 yuan per load. In addition, arrivals were continuous, and the market became even more unsustainable. Most prices tended to fall. Only Dutch red sugar rose by 2,000 yuan due to the depletion of inventory.

Cotton Cloth: The cotton cloth market was still hovering. The reason is that the Textile Company is still selling a lot, fellow merchants are timid, and customer gangs are waiting and watching because ships are scarce and transportation is difficult.

Silk: The price of rayon fell again under the distribution of the Jianfang Company. Confidence in factory silk was firm, and prices rose slightly. The silk market saw a sharp drop in gold prices in the morning, and speculators panicked and sought to sell. American Asiatic quilt covers fell by 70,000 yuan. Dachang quilt covers also fell by 60,000 yuan. Dachang blue crepe fell by 222 yuan, falling below cost. Later, due to the rebound in gold prices, it became slightly firmer.

President Chiang previously inspected Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, and knew that food prices were soaring and people were struggling to survive. He has telegraphed to all provinces and cities that the hoarded grain that has been confiscated should be sold at stabilized prices to help the people.

Classrooms should be rectangular, usually 30 feet long and 25 feet wide. Pay attention to ventilation, open air windows, and the foundation should be high, dry, solid, and not prone to sinking or moving. The walls should be brick and pay attention to the color of the decoration to harmonize the light. The floor should be paved with wooden boards.

The plane can be longitudinal rectangular, transverse rectangular, or cross-shaped, depending on the arrangement of the classrooms and other school buildings. The location of the stage in the hall depends on the form and light of the hall, either in the center or on the side. The building points of the auditorium of a school with six classrooms, such as area, form, foundation, walls, doors and windows, and roof, are all stipulated. In addition, the building points of covered sports fields, teacher's offices, dormitories, dining halls, kitchens, toilets, other houses, sports fields, farms, and campuses are all stipulated and explained.

Military expenditure accounts for 43.52 percent of the total budget for this year.

### Recovery of Shenyang

— This Newspaper's Air Dispatch on the 26th Correspondent Han Qingtao

After the National Army entered and garrisoned the city of Shenyang, the citizens felt relieved. The receiving members of the "Liaoning Provincial Branch of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise Communist Unity Procurement and Receiving Committee" also arrived in numbers of over two hundred, and tensely began the receiving work, and the atmosphere was renewed!

The Sorrow of Tiexi Factories The Tiexi District factories are an important target, and the mining and industrial group of the unified receiving branch immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and carry out the receiving work. After working for a week in the dilapidated and incomplete factory buildings, everyone felt very distressed.

The large chimneys of several factories were smoking, including two breweries and a soap factory. At the entrance of the soap factory, the sign "Qiulin Company Manchurian Grease Factory" was hung, and armed Russians were guarding it, not allowing the receiving personnel to enter. The brewery was also labeled as a "Qiulin Foreign Firm" factory.

The wooden signs of "Xingye Enterprise Company" were hung in front of more than twenty incomplete factories. It is said that it was a masterpiece of someone joining with "the original factory owners. Among these twenty or so, some were completely empty, and the remaining items were discarded everywhere, sometimes taken away by people.

In an "Electrical Material Factory" the main machinery had been moved away, and the warehouse still had electrical materials, children could carry away a bag, several people from a certain paper mill pushed carts inside to find papermaking materials, and there was also a "Tractor Manufacturing Factory", there was also a lot of remaining metal materials, which needed armed protection.

"Hanzhou Chemical Factory" one making lubricating oil, one making , was received by the "China Changchun Railway", who sent a Soviet to be the director of the factory, with a Japanese as the deputy. The Japanese sent two Japanese women to accompany the director for fun. The director was not at the factory for five days, and the deputy director was also not often there, resulting in a fire, and causing great losses. This happened two days ago, and the embers have not yet cooled.

The Tiexi District factory chimneys are lined up, some factory buildings only have a shell left, there are still disputes for the complete or factories that could possibly be pieced together to be restored. Unified receiving personnel are planning a reasonable solution.

Struggles for Property and Houses When the Unified Receiving Branch sent someone to receive property and houses, there were already two or three seals on the doors and windows. In some places, it was "You stick, I tear, I stick, he tears", the enemy smiled gleefully, but the people cried for the motherland.

These are mostly the work of military organs, but some people are asking, why do they need those houses? But how can ordinary people figure out this problem, so everyone is just confused.

Many businesses, and many non-essential military organs or are competing to receive business venues, large and small, and have started business. We can only hope that they will temporarily run the "received" business departments well, and reasonably give them up in the future.

The receiving ugly dramas of Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places are also being performed in Shenyang, which is really even more distressing. Fortunately, some people are criticizing it, which is better than inside the pass. To what extent it is better is impossible to estimate.

The Headquarters and the Chief's Office are paying serious attention to this issue. In addition to restraining subordinates, they have specially formed a unified receiving agency with the receiving personnel from the economic, transportation, government and other departments, which is the "Liaoning Provincial Branch of the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Enterprise and American Assets Unified Receiving Committee" established in Jinzhou on March 16.

The unified receiving organization includes eighteen groups: military and political, educational, industrial and mining, financial and financial, social, agricultural and forestry, transportation, water conservancy, judicial, material, internal affairs, grain administration, health, publicity, relief, supervision, general affairs, and accounting. However, the personnel in some groups are not yet complete.

The people of Shenyang are all wide-eyed, watching the work of the unified receiving branch, hoping that it will accomplish its mission in a beautiful and reasonable manner. The people attach great importance to the people sent by the central government. They express their welcome and see the people of the Northeast as great and capable. How can we bear to disappoint them!

The Lovely People The absolute majority of people overvalue everything from the central government. They study in secret and treat the people sent by the government with sincerity, which can be seen anytime and anywhere. They have an even more enthusiastic love for the National Army. After the National Army entered the city, the people deduced that a large number of National Army must have arrived, so they automatically went to the Huanggu Village station with national flags to welcome the National Army. This time, when the National Army advanced north along the railway, the people in the Tie Ling area "treated them like family". It is hoped that this precious love will continue forever.

The staff who worked in the puppet Manchurian period, no matter what, must be used well. People from the original business organs cannot be considered completely unreliable, because their patriotic familiarity is too high, sometimes even higher than everything the overseas Chinese have shown in the past. At the same time, they also know too much, or even exceed the receiving personnel. They are the most ideal people to help with the receiving, not the people being received. Receiving personnel in various departments cannot discriminate against the original employees, otherwise there will be great losses. The reporter saw their doubts and heard their complaints. This point of emotion is the haze in work, and it must be eliminated and clarified.

The people of the Northeast are loving the motherland. Young students are competing to join the army. Ice and snow cannot suppress the fire of height familiarity. Unreasonable "receiving" is to stain their blank minds, causing others to laugh and making themselves cry. Success and failure are all gathered on this point! (Sent from Shenyang on March 26)

### Three Months of Hardships While Waiting for a Ship in Shanghai: Light Rain and Dust, Great Keelung

— Air Dispatch from Taiwan by the Newspaper on the 21st: Tongqiu

For a month, continuous rain has controlled the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Shanghai is no exception. It seems that God is making it difficult for the Shanghai people who love to enjoy life, imprisoning you in the house during the beautiful spring scenery, unable to be immersed in the embrace of nature.

But the most troubled are the personnel going to work in Taiwan, including the Education Department, Industry and Mining Department, Transportation Department, Agriculture and Forestry Department, Court, Post-War Relief Agency, Trade Bureau, Resources Committee, Post and Telecommunications Management Council, and various units of the Taiwan Provincial Government, etc. Except for the heads of each unit and some technical personnel who took a plane to Taiwan, all of us, about two thousand people, have been hired in Shanghai since the end of last year, waiting for a ship to go to Taiwan, and the waiting has been three months, causing our enthusiasm to serve the country to be reduced again and again, almost falling into disappointment. Does the government not have a ship? Is maritime transport not open? Is it difficult to合 like the "?!"? The facts tell us that none of these are true. We know that Taiwan urgently needs us to go to organize and construct it, but we cannot go there for a while, instead staying in Shanghai to wait.

Eating and Spending All Shanghai is not a place for ordinary people to live well. During the three months, the price of a meal has risen from one hundred to eight hundred, and the price of a hotel has risen from five hundred to three thousand yuan per day. The cost of living has soared six or seven times. Therefore, the comrades waiting for the ship, those who live close to home, constantly go home to take things. Those who have relatives and friends in Shanghai also borrow again and again. Those who have no relatives or friends are really eating and spending all. Although the Governor-General's Office has issued a settlement allowance and a pre-borrowed fee, how can more than one hundred thousand yuan support personal expenses for three months, let alone talk about settling down?

Like Escaping "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no road, there is a village with dark willows and bright flowers". We were disappointed with "Hai Xiang", "Taipei", and "Hai Yu", but we got "Hai Zhou". Finally, we boarded the ship on the 18th, and set sail at noon on the 19th, and sailed out of the Yangtze River estuary at 4:30. This ship was recently bought from the United States, and is one of the ten Liberty ships, with a deadweight of 10,000 tons. It is the first time it has sailed since being received by the China Merchants Bureau. Moreover, it was originally a cargo ship, but now it has been converted into a passenger ship, and there is no equipment to speak of. More than two thousand people are trapped in five large common cabins, with bedding closely connected. To get in and out, people have to trample on each other. The quilts, boxes, and sundry goods that pass by are piled around the berths in a mess, and are often kicked over. Many comrades shouted loudly: "We are simply escaping, isn't this like a refugee camp?"

Appreciating the Sea View for the First Time In fact, we are lucky to be living in a common cabin, because there are thirty people who are actually hiding in the slightly hidden places on the deck and corridors. On the first night, the wind and rain were strong, and they had to try the primitive life of human beings. Only a very small number of businessmen, actually "favored by heaven", paid a price of 100,000 yuan to live in the five or six rooms on the boat.

The wind was strong and strong on the night of the 19th, and the ship shook greatly. On the morning of the 20th, however, the wind was calm and the waves were calm. At noon, the sun shone brightly, reflecting the green sea water and embellished with flocks of white gulls, a beautiful picture, which was really moving. The deck was crowded with people, talking and laughing, eating and drinking, or leaning against the railing to look into the distance, as if all the troubles were forgotten.

Keelung in Sight On the 21st, the people on the ship said: "We can arrive at noon today. Sure enough, after ten o'clock, the island of Taiwan was faintly visible, but the Public Service always gave us trouble, with drizzling rain, without stopping. The fog shrouded the mountains and waters, and the telescope was ineffective. At eleven o'clock, we entered the port of Keelung, and at twelve o'clock, we berthed, the journey was exactly forty-eight hours. Keelung is an excellent military port, surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the scenery is comparable to Qingdao. At the pier, each unit had receptionists holding signs, and the situation was very lively. So we got on the four trucks of the Taipei County Government's receptionists and drove straight to Taipei.

### The 15th Session of the Political Participation Council Passes a Second Discussion on the Education Report (Continued)

(II) The Ministry of Education should already have rewards for accomplished researchers who have written and invented works. However, research work requires a lot of real costs. The amount of the reward is too small to be useful. Researchers should be allowed to list their work plans and budgets, which will be reviewed by the Central Research Institute's Review Council or the Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education. If they are recognized as having sufficient research capabilities, their work plans are applicable, and their work is particularly important, and the research costs are absolutely beyond the capacity of individuals, all their work expenses will be funded by the state.

(III) The funding of independent research institutes and university research institutes should be increased as much as possible to facilitate development. As for research students, they are excellent members of university graduates, and their treatment should be similar to that of teaching assistants in order to study with peace of mind. However, the current treatment is that teaching assistants are staff members and can receive 50,000 yuan per month, while research students are students and only receive 6,000 yuan per month for meals and 1,500 yuan for living allowances. This is not even enough to fill their stomachs. We should adopt measures to stabilize their lives and encourage their desire to learn.

(IV) The mission of secondary school teachers is not only to educate young people but also to gradually improve themselves to prepare for becoming university professors. However, the departments set up in normal colleges are too simple, such as history and geography being combined into one department, or physics, chemistry, or natural history being combined into one department. Graduates have limited knowledge and have no ability to study in depth. The normal colleges affiliated to universities have more complete departments set up by the universities to adjust the situation, which can avoid this problem. However, independent normal colleges do not have this convenience and must allocate sufficient funds to set up various departments so that graduates can have complete knowledge and a foundation for further study.

(V) The Continental Scientific Academy established by the enemy and puppets in Northeast China took the natural resources of Northeast China as the object of its research and the development and utilization of Northeast China as the purpose of its research, including geology, chemistry, industry, medicine, and dozens of subjects, which were connected with each other to form a highly systematic organization. The central government should order the Ministry of Education to reorganize it into the National Northeast Research Institute to maintain its original integrity.

(D) Social Education

(I) The best tools for promoting social education are radio and film. China lacks material resources, and radios are only used for entertainment by the rich. In remote provinces, some counties do not have a single radio, and news is blocked, making them seem like they are at the ends of the earth. Films are only available in large cities, and there are countless villagers who have never seen a screen in their lives. It is extremely difficult to develop social education in this way. From now on, the Ministry of Education should pay attention to this matter and do its best to promote it. It should sign a special contract with wireless equipment factories to ensure that radios are sold at extremely low prices and distributed widely. It should also produce a large number of films with practical scientific knowledge and distribute them to cities and villages for rotating screenings so that the people can all recognize modern culture and know their own responsibilities. We should especially promote or improve spoken dramas and Peking operas, which have the largest number of audiences.

(II) In addition to focusing on advanced research, scientific development should also constantly improve the level of scientific knowledge of the people. Museums use real objects as teaching materials and have the most significant effect on popularizing scientific knowledge. The Ministry of Education should be requested to order the provincial and municipal governments to first establish museums in cities with a population of over one million, such as Nanjing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenyang, and then gradually promote them in other places. (III) There are tens of thousands of Chinese characters, and many of them have complex strokes, making them inconvenient to write and learn. If they are not thoroughly reorganized, it will be extremely difficult to promote education. Although the Ministry of Education has set up a National Language Promotion Committee, its task focuses on promoting phonetic symbols and unifying pronunciation. It has not yet had time to reorganize the characters. However, since the late Qing Dynasty, there have been many people who have advocated simplified characters, and there are still many people who specialize in this issue. To promote popular education, it is appropriate to accept their achievements and jointly seek a standardized approach. The Ministry of Education should be requested to convene experts as soon as possible to hold a National Character Reorganization Conference to determine concrete plans. If a long-term review is required, a National Character Reorganization Committee should be established. (IV) The tripods, sacrificial vessels, and other items preserved in the Confucius Temple and the official residence in Qufu are invaluable treasures of Chinese culture. Recently, it was reported that after the Communist troops occupied Qufu, they were all taken away and transported to Teng County. These thousands of years of cultural relics have suffered such a catastrophe. If they are not recovered as soon as possible, the loss will be too great and will never be compensated. The Ministry of Education is requested to find ways to recover them and preserve them.

(E) Education in Border Areas and for Overseas Chinese

(I) The people in the border areas are too isolated from modern culture. If teachers do not learn to adapt to them and forget the distinction between themselves and the people, they will be working in vain. The first step is to learn their language and communicate their emotions. All courses should be taught in the local dialect of the border areas as a principle. However, how to train such teachers is something that the Ministry of Education should consider as soon as possible.

(II) The Ministry of Education has set up border construction courses and lectures in various universities, which is enough to arouse the attention of young people in the inland and border areas to the border areas, which is essential. However, seeing only a part of the leopard is not enough to satisfy those who aspire to study in depth. It is hoped that preparations will be made for expansion so that these schools can all establish specialized departments or specialized schools in the future and become centers for studying the border areas.

(III) Overseas Chinese have a deep love for their country and are most devoted to nationalism. Therefore, education for overseas Chinese should focus on instilling knowledge of Chinese history, geography, and cultural heritage so that their emotions can be guided by reason.

(IV) In the past, the agencies guiding education for overseas Chinese were not unified, and it was often difficult to handle affairs. In the future, the government should handle them in a unified manner so that there is a standard to follow.

(F) Other Matters

(I) Recently, many political groups have tried to use students as tools for their political disputes, resulting in many students abandoning their studies and rushing into the path of agitation, which is extremely distressing. The Ministry of Education is requested to strictly reiterate the ban that no political group may engage in political struggles in schools to avoid sacrificing the most precious time for students to study. Only then can the academic atmosphere gradually become solemn, and the foundation for students' studies can be laid.

(II) In addition to providing for living expenses, the income of each teacher must also be used to purchase reference research materials and make academic trips, which is not comparable to that of ordinary civil servants who only need to handle affairs. At present, prices are soaring, and not only is there no way to talk about studying, but even the minimum living standards are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The government is requested to realistically improve treatment with reference to the price index.

(III) It is inappropriate for the state to set up schools to educate talents and then collect tuition fees in the same way as private schools. Although in practice, most schools no longer charge tuition fees, since there is no explicit abolition order, remote provinces and counties may continue to charge fees according to惯例, which is far from uniform and not the way to govern. The Ministry of Education is requested to order all national and public schools at all levels throughout the country to no longer collect tuition fees. As for private schools, the maximum amount of tuition fees should also be restricted according to the situation in various places.

(IV) Cultural cooperation between countries should first pay attention to the selection of personnel. Those who are sent to Europe and the United States to give lectures should pay special attention to promoting China's inherent culture. As for the natural sciences, they must have sufficient research and definite inventions before they can be assigned to lecturing work. (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st dispatch.

Draft Design of Yichang Sluice Gate

The Yichang Sluice Gate is an unprecedentedly huge project and the largest facility in China's plan to rebuild the Yangtze River Basin. Once this sluice gate is completed, it will have a significant effect on water conservancy (including flood control and irrigation, hydropower) and agricultural benefits. This design and engineering have been contracted by our government and the US government and is expected to begin soon. The white line in the picture shows the power plant built by striking the mountain. The water of the Yangtze River will be injected into the power plant from the reservoir through the tunnel and then poured into the main stream of the Yangtze River and its tributaries on both sides.

### Glimpses of Chen Gongbo Before the Trial

— A dispatch from our Suzhou, 30th correspondent, Qingping

The traitor and giant villain Chen Gongbo, in the autumn when the Japanese army was approaching, did not regard the country as important, did not cherish the nation, only cared about his personal welfare for a while, willingly colluded with the traitor Wang Zhaoming to collaborate with the enemy and betray the country, colluded with "the bandits," and engaged in the treacherous activities of selling out the country for personal gain and leaving a stinking name for ten thousand years. He successively served as the President of the Legislative Yuan of the puppet government, a Central Committee member of the puppet party, and the Mayor of the puppet Shanghai. Finally, he achieved his greatest desire and served as the Chairman of the puppet National Government. However, during his term of office in the puppet government, no government order was not to sell out the country and harm the people. His ten major crimes have been filed by Han Tao, the chief prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, to the Criminal Court of the High Court on the 18th of this month, and President Sun has scheduled a public trial at 1:00 pm on April 5th. Before the trial, some fragments about him are collected below;

Punishing traitors was originally intended to revive national morale and warn the world. However, Chen Gongbo's biography is that of a traitor and giant villain with heinous crimes. He did not hesitate to sell out the country and the nation. This time, he received sanctions from the national law, which he deserved. Therefore, the Central Propaganda Department, in order to widely publicize and warn the world, specially dispatched the Central Film Production Company to film Chen Ni's interrogation and screen it in various places. Filming in the courtroom is considered to have started with Chen Ni in our country. In the future, people from all over the world will also be able to see Chen Ni's true face.

This major treason case caused a sensation at home and abroad. This time, the Jiangsu High Court opened the trial in Suzhou. The High Court made strict arrangements in advance. In order to avoid accidents and maintain order in the courtroom, the number of observers in the courtroom was carefully considered. Therefore, only 200 observer passes were prepared, including 56 for reporters from newspapers along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and the rest were for officials from various agencies. The court stated that the number of passes was limited and that registration was required in advance by letter. The passes have been issued since the 28th until they are exhausted. According to Secretary-General Yang, foreign capital will observe the trial on that day. The court hopes that observers must strictly abide by the observer rules when the trial begins in order to maintain the dignity of the court and show the demeanor of our great citizens abiding by public order.

Chen Ni Gongbo's trial judge was President Sun Honglin of the High Court, who personally served as the presiding judge. Presiding Judge Shi Meiyu served as the chief judge, and Judge Kong Rongzhao served as the accompanying judge. Clerks Qin Daoli and Cai Yiting served as recorders. The High Court considered the news reporters most carefully. In order to make it easier for reporters to hear clearly and record, the news reporter seats were set up on both sides of the judge's bench. Of course, the security was tight during this trial, and those without observer passes were absolutely refused entry into the court. The court specially prepared a car to escort Chen Ni into the courtroom for trial.

The diagram shows the arrangement of Chen Ni Gongbo's trial in the first courtroom of the Equal Court.

### Letter from the Salt Administration

March 7th To Your Newspaper Office,

Your newspaper's editorial on March 7th included sections that involved salt administration. I am writing to clarify the facts separately below, and I respectfully hope that you will understand. Your newspaper stated: "The price of salt has increased in various places, and there is a salt shortage everywhere, but the salt produced in the producing areas cannot be sold externally, resulting in many salt farmers abandoning salt production and turning to other industries." This may be a portrayal of the salt administration during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, coastal producing areas sought to restore salt production. In addition to following the established policy of opening up sales markets and encouraging free trafficking so that any merchant could go to the fields or warehouses at key distribution points to purchase salt according to regulations for transportation and sale, this bureau also established a supervision office in Shanghai, where officials and merchants worked together to actively transport salt from the salt fields in Fujian, Zhejiang, Huai, and Lu provinces, concentrating it in Shanghai and transferring it to the sales areas according to their needs. Currently, within the scope of this bureau's jurisdiction, we have not heard of any salt shortages leading to famine. As for the salt fields that this agency has not yet taken over due to special political circumstances, if there is a situation of "salt production cannot be sold externally and salt farmers have turned to other industries," the responsibility for this cannot be borne by this agency. Please conduct a detailed investigation to clarify the truth. Furthermore, the increase in salt prices is purely due to the impact of general price increases. However, the increase index is actually below that of general prices, and the increase rate is not as drastic as the fluctuations in general prices. Taking rice as an example, before the war, rice cost about 10 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) and salt cost about 10 yuan per dan (another unit of dry measure) in the Beijing-Shanghai area. Now, rice in Beijing costs 24,000 yuan per shi, an increase of more than 2,000 times, while salt costs 11,000 yuan per dan, an increase of more than 1,000 times. If we further calculate the burden on the people, ordinary people need more than 30 jin (unit of weight) of rice per month, which costs about 6,000 yuan, and about 12 liang (another unit of weight) of salt, which costs only more than 100 yuan. Comparing the two, the relationship between them and people's livelihood is self-evident. If we further analyze the factors that increase salt prices, we will know that the composition of salt prices, in addition to the amount of salt tax levied, is related to the entire national economy, which need not be elaborated. The majority of the price is for supervision and transportation costs, and these two items are closely related to general prices. In the past, the enemy puppets approved salt capital and transportation costs at the lowest possible level, but only for exploitation, and salt farmers and porters had difficulty maintaining a living, so they fled and "turned to other industries." Now, we are taking into account the overall situation. On the one hand, we do not want to make salt prices too high and increase the burden on the people. On the other hand, we make reasonable adjustments at any time according to the price increase index so that we can maintain the minimum living standards. At a time when prices are generally rising, since salt prices cannot be lowered independently, it seems unreasonable to demand a lowering of salt prices alone. As for what your newspaper calls "our traditional salt management system," it refers to the special merchant system that has been in place since the Ming and Qing dynasties. This system, as your newspaper said, "monopolizes and specializes in profits, and does not allow people to freely buy and sell." Its characteristics are monopoly of the market and exclusive profits. Its drawbacks are raising salt prices, mixing in impurities, and hindering the lives of the majority of the people. Since the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, it has poisoned society for more than 300 years and has long been criticized by the Chinese people. In the 20th year, the central government thoroughly reformed it, and on January 1st of that year, it announced that all special treatments and rights of the past special merchant system and other similar monopoly salt industries were abolished on the same day. After the victory, this bad "traditional system" remaining in the recovered areas should be banned and the accumulated abuses should be eliminated according to law. According to the current salt administration guidelines, everything is manufactured, transported, and sold by the people, and everything is returned to the people. Anyone who pays enough taxes can freely transport and sell without restriction. This proposition is entirely based on the principle of people's livelihood and opens the entire salt management system to the public. However, at the beginning of its implementation, we are afraid that the society still does not fully understand it, and we still hope that your newspaper will widely promote it to achieve significant results. Best regards, Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, to Shen Bao.

Spring and Autumn

### Mother Willow

—

I think of my childhood, which the fleeting years have taken away, and immediately I think of Mother Willow, the kind-hearted old woman from Sanhe County, who is the person I can't forget most in my childhood memories.

She came to our house as a servant when I was three and a half years old. First, she took care of me, then my older younger sister, and then my younger younger sister. After my younger brother was born, she also helped the wet nurse for a while before leaving us.

Near the entrance of Xinmen Road, there seemed to be a large bluestone. That was the only place Mother Willow took me to play, because she was afraid my mother would worry, so she didn't dare go far. Almost every day (except, of course, on windy and rainy days), when the dazzling sun filled the ground, Mother Willow finished her morning chores and took me to the street, sitting on that large bluestone, telling old stories, jokes, watching rickshaws on the street, and pedestrians walking by. When the wind messed up my hair, she would comb small braids for me. Sometimes I became restless. When a candy blower passed by, I wanted to buy some; when a peddler of small snacks passed by, I wanted to eat some; when a dough figurine maker passed by, I wanted to play with them. Mother Willow didn't have any coins (meaning copper coins) with her, so she couldn't fulfill my wishes. I wouldn't let it go. She would say, "Let's go home to get some!" But I was afraid my mother would scold me and refused to go home. She didn't have any money, but I insisted on buying something, and after arguing to the point of helplessness, Mother Willow would say, "Little mushroom head! Please have mercy! I'm going to find a crooked-neck tree to hang myself from!" making everyone on the street laugh.

Before I turned four, my mother taught me to recognize two examples of square characters every day. When my mother was too busy, Mother Willow would always take over. At that time, I thought all adults were literate. It wasn't until I was a few years older that I realized that other servants weren't as literate as Mother Willow. Her father was a private tutor in the countryside of Sanhe County.

Later, as I learned more and more characters, sometimes I would ask her about them, and she would say she didn't know them. I found it strange. Mother Willow said, "My dad thought I was the fifth daughter, and when I was nine, he sent me to my grandmother's house. After that, no one taught me to read." Her words seemed to carry a sense of her life story.

She instilled many good habits in me: not biting my fingernails, not leaving food in my bowl, never interrupting when others are talking, tearing off today's page of the calendar after dinner, closing the door and turning off the lights before going to bed, rinsing my mouth with cold water... If I am still able to maintain these good habits today, I must thank Mother Willow.

I remember one time I lied to my mother, and Mother Willow exposed me. My mother made me kneel for a full two hours. I hated her for it and cried and made a fuss with her. She said, "A seven-year-old child lying, who will believe you when you grow up?"

At that time, my younger sisters had all been weaned one after another, and I had started school. She and another wet nurse took care of them. The wet nurse was an irresponsible person, so Mother Willow always kept an eye on the two children.

I went to school at an affiliated elementary school of a church middle school across from Qianliang Hutong. Every day after school in the afternoon, Mother Willow would push the stroller to wait for me at the gate. My younger sisters sat in the stroller, and I hung my goose-yellow schoolbag with black characters on the handle of the stroller, helping her push the stroller home together. Sometimes I would pester her to eat douzhi [fermented mung bean milk], and Mother Willow would immediately make a face, saying, "Shameless! Only wild boys eat things at street stalls! You are a young lady!" I had no choice but to give up.

She taught me to dye my fingernails with henna juice, but I didn't like it. What I liked was helping the coachman, Han San, clean my father's chartered car, polishing it until it was shiny enough to reflect people's faces, and I loved the smell of oil. Mother Willow laughed at me for being born a boy, without any ladylike qualities. She also taught me how to weave dog teeth and pull zippers, but I couldn't learn any of them. Finally, she sighed, shook her head, and sewed a cicada-shaped green cloth needle cushion for me, which I still keep as a memento.

Since my school was run by the church, we had to go to church every Sunday. The principles the teachers taught didn't interest me. I loved listening to Mother Willow's stories about the White Lotus Sect every night, so I told her, "The Jesus religion is not fun. I'd rather believe in the White Lotus Sect. I want to be able to summon wind and rain and ride on a handkerchief like riding on clouds." She solemnly told me that I couldn't, because the White Lotus Sect was an evil cult, and decent people couldn't believe in evil cults. I didn't understand what an evil cult was at that time, but the words "decent people" were deeply imprinted in my mind, and I knew I should be a decent person.

Mother Willow didn't have any sons, only two daughters. The older one was four years older than me and had been given to someone as a child bride. The younger one was the same age as me, named Fengniu, with a fair face and a pair of slender eyes like her mother, and her smile looked like a crescent moon on the third or fourth day of the lunar month. However, Fengniu had bound feet.

One time, a soldier came to our house, a very tall and strong man. He spoke to Mother Willow in a very unpleasant tone. After he left, Mother Willow cried. The wet nurse said that the soldier was Mother Willow's husband, Liu Dianlin, an idler who didn't do any honest work. When Mother Willow married him, he was a cart driver. Later, she didn't know how he became a soldier. He didn't care about anything at home and only came back when he wanted money from women.

We were going back to the south. My mother liked Mother Willow's loyalty, carefulness, and reliability. She planned to take her to the south. At first, she refused because she couldn't bear to part with her children. Later, Liu Dianlin came to ask for money again, and she was even beaten. That summer, she gave her youngest daughter, Fengniu, to someone else as a child bride, and decided to go south with us.

At first, she missed home very much, worried about Fengniu, who had just become a child bride. She also wasn't used to life in the south. We often ate dumplings, noodles, and pancakes, but it still didn't reduce her homesickness. She often said, "Now it's hard to see a courtyard house." and "On the ninth and tenth day, if we were in Beijing, we should go to Longfu Temple!" I shared her feelings because there wasn't a single time I went to Longfu Temple that she didn't accompany me.

When Mother Willow couldn't speak the official language, she would often grumble, "Silly southerners, still laughing at northern bumpkins!" - To be fair, Beijing dialect wasn't as common in the south back then as it is now.

Despite her dissatisfaction with the south, she never said a word about wanting to go back or regretting coming. Later, she gradually got used to living there, and her homesickness wasn't as strong as before. - Until I was fifteen years old, Liu Dianlin found her in the south, insisting that she go back with him. She reluctantly left us.

Before leaving, she gave each of the four of us siblings a gift. She stayed up all night weaving a small hair tie sleeveless shirt for my younger brother, a pair of silver bracelets for my younger sisters, and a silver thimble for me: "Fifteen years old, you should be able to use this now!" - I'm very ashamed, because to this day I still don't know how to use that thing.

From the time she left until now, and perhaps forever in the future, our family has never hired a better female servant than her. My mother often sighed, "When she was here, I didn't feel it. After she left, I have to put in more than double the effort." She was in our family for almost twelve years. In this era where people's hearts are unstable, it's rare to see even twelve-year-long friends, let alone twelve-year-long masters and servants. How can people not miss her? Such a kind, honest, and good-hearted old woman.

She used to ask someone to write letters for her, but since the "July 7th" Incident, there has been no more news from her. Is Mother Willow still alive? Or is she already gone from this world? We have no way of knowing. A few years ago, we even sent a registered letter to Sanhe County, but the original letter was returned. Even if we are in Beijing now, what can we do?

In my suitcase, I still keep the thimble she gave me and the cicada-shaped needle cushion made of green cloth. Whenever I see these two things, my eyes involuntarily fill with tears. In the glistening tears, it seems like I can see Mother Willow's fair and gentle face, her pair of slender eyes, her smile like a crescent moon on the third or fourth day of the lunar month... But where is she? If she is still alive today, would she also remember that child who sat on the large bluestone at the entrance of Xinmen Road, who once made her say she was going to find a crooked-neck tree to hang herself from, and is now thinking of her words and deeds from that time?

### Impassioned Verses: Having Been a Guest in Chongqing for a Long Time

— Lumang

Wandering for ten thousand miles, I sigh as a lonely traveler,
For eight years, I have lived in Chongqing, surviving.
How can I bear to lean on the pillar and listen to the fish's sigh,
How can I help but hear the wind playing the kite's strings.

Dreams are unreliable, and I cannot awaken,
I let the wind and rain play with the clouds and sunshine.
Often I go up to a high building to look out,
Wanting to part the clouds and recognize my old home.

The prosperity before my eyes is not peace,
The new scenes do not bring joy.
I'd rather pierce the Red Sea with hot tears,
And see all living beings as straw dogs, treated the same.

Gaining or losing in essays, stubbornly pursuing fame,
Pitifully trying small skills like a fledgling insect.
Long songs are only fit to mourn for those deserving pity,
Who else can I discuss faith and loyalty with?

### One Night in a Mountain Town

— Ling Xing

Living in foreign concessions for too long makes one appreciate the simplicity of mountain towns. Often with this feeling, I like to get off the train in a mountain town during my journey on the Jinpu Railway, spend the night on the earthen bed in a thatched house, and abandon all the worries of intrigue, as if finding a bit of leisure to read Tang poems in the midst of a busy schedule.

This time, I actually only stayed in the mountain town for one night, and it was because of a railway accident that the train couldn't run, forcing me to stay. But it sowed a long-term memory, a long-term joy. Because, I found warmth and kindness again in the human world, which many scholars who explore human nature in foreign concessions have not found, but I unexpectedly and easily found in the mountain town.

The train was very crowded, and there was a longer journey ahead, so I was even more unwilling to spend the night on the train. The hotels around the station were already full, so I strolled down the main road. On the road, an old man sitting on a stone step smoking a pipe looked at me, a traveler from afar, with a surprised look, and smiled, saying:

"Can't find a place to stay, huh?"

I smiled wryly, seeing a warm light shining from his wrinkled face. I haven't seen it elsewhere, but sitting behind the teacher reading "Peach Blossom Spring" in my childhood seemed similar. I asked with a respectful feeling from the bottom of my heart:

"Old gentleman, is there any hotel around here?"

He smiled innocently, patted the dirt on his body with his dry old hands and said:

"There weren't many hotels here originally, and they were all full as soon as the train stopped."

Then he sighed!

"It's hard to be out these days, and no wonder you young people come out to make a living. Unlike me, I'm too old to do anything but smoke a pipe."

That's how I was invited to the old man's house. Sitting next to the square table in his thatched cottage, I felt a little uneasy, a few polite words hesitating on my lips, the old man had already hurried out. He was still shouting:

"Sit down, sit down;"

Sitting alone in the thatched cottage, I thought this was a bit like "Catching and Releasing Cao" in the Peking Opera, Chen Gong met Lü Boshe on the road, and the old man must have gone out to buy wine. So, is there "tie him up and kill him, bind him and kill him" in the kitchen too?

The old man came back, but he didn't have wine in his hand, just a plate of roasted chicken, two sesame cakes, and he pushed them to me with both hands:

"Eat something, I'll have them cook some millet porridge, travelers should eat something light!"

I'm just saying this is enough, I believe kindness must widely exist in the world, and coldness must not be more than warmth. Because turning over the map, leaving the foreign concessions on the vast land of China, there are countless small cities and towns.

I slept very soundly on the earthen bed in the mountain town, until the next morning, when the locomotive was calling with its summoning whistle. The old man came to wake me up:

"It's time to hurry on your way, it's a pity I can't keep you for a few more days!"

He kindly sent me to the train, watching the train go away with a hopeful eye. I, in the crowd, looked out the window, the old man's white hair fluttered in the morning wind, gradually fading, and then another old man's sincere and simple shadow came up.

Kind-hearted people in the mountain town, may God bless you!

### Poet Yang Yunshi (Continued Part Two)

— Tang Liyan

One can imagine when he was at the height of his career. Also, he gorgeously painted a red plum screen, painted four pieces through a night of spring rain, and added eight quatrains.

Protecting the screen, the mountain blows rain threads,
Upright gentlemen stand together, playing with rouge.
Jiang Yan's brush is still as wild as before,
Exhausting his long energy to paint folded branches.

Folding cold fragrance, the mist fills the lake,
Lonely Mountain, Su Xiao accompanies the forest path.
Lamb's wine melts the brocade tent,
Is it worth the unbridled Song Dynasty?

Spring is like the sea in the Misty Fragrance Cave,
Crimson brilliance can be seen before the scarlet screen.
Accustomed to the myriad styles of Shangyang,
A lifetime of joys and sorrows for plum blossoms.

Wang Gong walks in the snow, with all his charm,
The fairy Gugu descends to the ten continents.
I couldn't sleep last night because of the spring cold,
I put on sable fur.

The poet's bones are like clear ice,
Remembering the Jade Capital with rain, snow and spring lanterns.
Two rows of torches go to the academy,
The fragrance of large flowers is indistinguishable.

Two or three branches of sleeping Luofu Mountain,
The best time to view flowers is before they bloom.
Even if they can be picked, they shouldn't be,
Leave them to the east wind for good care.

In spring, one cherishes the fragrant beauty,
Flowers fill the river city, wine fills the clothes.
A new poem is passed on by word of mouth,
Every household of red powder talks about Yang Qi.

Yunlong has traveled the four seas,
Turning his head, he looked around and left the world.
Recently, his heroic spirit has been exhausted,
He only paints plum blossoms to give to beautiful women.

Mr. seems to cherish the plum blossoms. Except for the hundred paintings for Duke Wu of Wu, he only painted for the beautiful screen. Other poems such as "Farewell in Spring River", "Folding Willow Song", "Azalea Lyrics", "Untitled", "Intoxicated", etc. were all written for the beauty. Some sentences such as "Entering the door in the middle of the night, people are already drunk, leaning on the shadow of flowers under the carved saddle." "Unable to walk after drinking in the spring cold, the military watch in the army is already three shifts." "Why are soft words as sweet as honey? White teeth silently peel lychees." and other sentences, are all fragrant and charming to the bone. Because of this, the name of the romantic Little Du is known all over the world. Those who are jealous call Mr. a talented man from the red light district. At that time, Mr. was already fifty-two years old, not a young Pan An, nor did he have Shi Chong's Golden Valley. But the beauty was in love with each other, so he was not a mediocre person, as can be seen from the repeated requests for plum blossoms. Not long after, Duke Wu was defeated, and Mr. hurriedly left Hanyang. The beauty did her best to arrange things so that he could escape danger. Mr. wrote a farewell poem, and on the eve of his departure, A Mei asked for a painting of plums again, and wrote two of the four quatrains. (To be continued)

### A Pair of Lovebirds (23)

— Zhao Qingge

Lord Weng finished speaking and drank a large glass of wine. This was a hearty drink that he had never had before.

"But, brother! We also have daughters in our family!" Lord Mo said in a more clear tone with a melancholic voice.

This time, Lord Weng did not respond. His hand suddenly trembled brightly, almost smashing the cup he was pouring wine into.

"Brother, I think we can't just pretend to be ignorant and let them go on like this. We have to discipline them a bit. Because, although they are the ones being talked about outside, we are the ones losing face!" Lord Ma said even more thoroughly.

Lord Weng smiled bitterly, shrugged his shoulders, and remained silent.

"Are you afraid of her?" Lord Mo couldn't help but ask.

Lord Weng shook his head.

"Then what's your opinion?"

Lord Weng was forced to answer by Lord Mo, so he said with a smile:

"I have no opinion, but I'm not afraid of her either. I really haven't heard any gossip outside, and I don't want to ask about it. Because I want to live a few more years, brother. What is more worthy of indulgence than one's own life? Therefore, not only should Bo do this, but I also advise you to do so. Don't forget, this is a new world! The emperor has been abolished, what's the point of those old rules and old etiquette? We couldn't protect the emperor's throne, and that's why we ended up in this situation. Our own titles and property are gone, what do these trivial matters matter? If you can pretend to be ignorant, it's best to pretend to be ignorant." After Lord Weng finished speaking, he drank another large glass of wine.

Lord Mo thought that Lord Weng's words made sense. Besides, it's really not appropriate to interfere too much in other people's affairs. Therefore, he stopped pursuing the matter.

"Let's drink, brother! Nowadays, this is the only way we can live with interest. Listen to me, from now on you look for happiness in the cup; I'll spend my years in bed. Let others eat chicken and watch plays; let them go. The way to maintain health is to mind your own business and not be troubled by trifles." Lord Weng finished speaking and sighed to the sky.

Although Lord Mo didn't quite agree with Lord Weng's words, he saw that Lord Weng's face revealed some repressed emotions. He understood that Lord Weng didn't want others to break up his misty atmosphere, "mist," which had become a barrier to his life. He admired Lord Weng's cleverness, but he couldn't use drunkenness as a barrier to his life. He would often break through the realm of "drunkenness" himself! It seemed that he was uneasy about staying in the hazy state of drunkenness for a long time!

Therefore, Lord Weng was happy; Lord Mo was in pain!

Lord Weng had already forgotten everything they had just talked about. He regained his relaxed and cheerful mood, casually talking about the past wealth and fleeting clouds; talking about the political changes like wind and rain, talking about the fleeting human relationships like flowing water and falling flowers; he told all this mistily, he enthusiastically told a mysterious and elusive misty story!

"Everything is like a dream, and is a dream! For example, on the day you gave birth to your daughter Hua, didn't you have a dream similar to reality? Therefore, life is a dream, and a dream is life. I didn't quite understand this question before. I remember six years ago, I advised you not to dream. But I didn't know that people live in dreams! Unless a person dies, the dream will wake up and disappear. But, since we know that life is a dream, then we should treat everything as a dream. Dreams don't last too long, so there's no need to take everything too seriously. If we can do this, people won't be troubled while they're alive."

Lord Weng finally spoke about the "dream" once again in a preaching tone, then yawned a few times and returned to his misty life.

Lord Mo was now as silent as Lord Weng was when he first came! He silently drank wine without saying a word, she temporarily was safe in the drunkenness!
