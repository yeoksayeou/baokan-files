### Establishing Our National Naval Policy

Our naval fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Lin Zun, arrived at Wusong on the 19th. Yesterday, it sailed up the Yangtze River into Nanjing, and today it will be inspected by Chief of General Staff and Naval Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng in Nanjing. This fleet includes two escort destroyers and six minesweepers, Yongsheng, Yongbao, and Yongning, originally belonging to the U.S. Navy and gifted to China by the U.S. government after the war. They arrived in our country after traveling from the U.S. via Cuba, Mexico, Hawaii, and Japan. This fleet, flying the Chinese national flag, the naval flag, and the flag of a Chinese rear admiral, traversed the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Panama Canal, crossing the Pacific Ocean to reach the motherland, symbolizing a new era in the Pacific and the rebirth of our navy. As it undergoes inspection in the capital, we express our sincere welcome and take this opportunity to discuss the necessity of establishing our national naval policy.

Based on the lessons of the Anti-Japanese War and the experiences of World War II, if we want to build our national defense, we must actively establish our maritime defense and a navy to protect it. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense indicates our commitment to actively building our national defense, and the reconstruction of our navy, under the planning of Naval Commander-in-Chief General Chen Cheng, will certainly unfold actively. Various indications, such as the new fleet returning to the motherland, the U.S. government providing 271 naval vessels, floating docks, and other necessary equipment to our country, sending U.S. naval officers and personnel to China to assist in the training of our new navy, and our naval officers and personnel being sent to Britain and the United States for training, all demonstrate how much our government authorities value the role of the navy in their efforts to build our national defense. We support these government measures and express our infinite gratitude for the assistance given by our allies.

Some people believe that now that atomic bombs, long-range artillery, and air forces have reached their maximum power, the navy is outdated and there is no need for active construction. This is a seemingly correct but actually misleading view. World War II reaffirmed the importance of the navy's role and its indispensability. If Hitler had a strong fleet, his troops would not have been sighing as they looked across the sea at Churchill's homeland from the coasts of Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; he would have undoubtedly wanted to emulate William the Conqueror and cross the sea to conquer England. At the same time, because Britain had a powerful fleet that controlled absolute sea power, its homeland was ultimately protected from enemy invasion. Japan launched the Pacific War, and the initial victories it achieved were mainly due to its navy. At that time, the so-called "Imperial Navy" held all the sea power in the Western Pacific. The attack on Pearl Harbor devastated the main force of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet. Fortunately, the U.S. Navy had a high capacity for recovery and actively rebuilt itself, achieving victories at Midway and the Coral Sea within a year, eventually defeating the once-imposing "Imperial Navy." The decline of the Japanese Navy contributed to Japan's collapse. To date, the use of atomic bombs has not affected the power and role of the navy. The experiments on Bikini Atoll, although their details are not yet fully understood, clearly did not significantly diminish the navy's role.

We ourselves suffered greatly in the Anti-Japanese War because we had no navy. At that time, we had no maritime defense, and the enemy could freely enter our vast territorial waters as if it were uninhabited, allowing the Japanese invaders to transport supplies freely. We must not allow this painful experience to be repeated. We must actively build our navy. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, our navy was already leading East Asia. The disastrous defeat in that war and the construction of the Summer Palace caused our navy to stagnate for fifty years. During these fifty years, there was not only no naval construction, but also the reputation of the navy declined due to the deterioration of military discipline and poor leadership. The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time has swept away past malpractices, and with the assistance of our allies Britain and the United States, the birth of our new navy is a golden opportunity that comes once in a thousand years. To build our new navy, we must first establish our naval policy.

First, we must establish the mission of our navy in national defense and ensure that it can fully accomplish its assigned tasks. China is not a bellicose country; it has no ambition for aggression. Therefore, the construction of our navy should be solely for the purpose of strengthening our maritime defense. Unlike the former Japan, the reconstruction of our navy can be said to be entirely defensive. Based on this principle, our navy should focus on light and fast vessels. Current indications tell us that the reconstruction of our navy is heading in this direction, which is gratifying. What we want to point out is that we must also strive for training and equipping in the field of submarines. Our national strength does not allow us to possess a navy as large as those of Britain and the United States; to enable our navy to fulfill its responsibilities, we must especially focus on training and equipping in the field of submarines.

Second, with Japan defeated, it no longer has a once-powerful navy. In addition to its mission of strengthening our maritime defense, our navy should also, to some extent, assume the responsibility of securing the western Pacific waters after Japan. Because our national strength is not yet sufficient, the composition of our naval fleet does not need to rigidly adhere to British and American standards. We do not need to dream of possessing battleships larger than 50,000 tons, but we must maintain sufficient other types of ships for practical use. Naval ports are indispensable. Although the concept of naval ports may differ somewhat from what it was during General MacMahon's time in Japan, the number of our seaports that can be used as naval ports is actually very limited. Following the Tsar, Lushun is a naval port shared by the pseudo-Soviet Union and us. Therefore, the construction of our naval ports must be sought in the south. Consequently, if we actively build our navy, we must at least simultaneously build our naval bases in Sanmen Bay and Yulin.

Third, we must create a good naval tradition. In the establishment of the Chinese army, Baoding and Huangpu both have their glorious history, establishing the tradition of our new army. Our efforts to establish a modern navy have lasted for more than fifty years, and to this day, there is no glorious tradition to speak of. To create a glorious tradition for our navy, we must step up naval training. Greenwich in Britain and Annapolis in the United States are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Briton and American. The models left to the British and American navies by Nelson and Paul Jones still endure. To build our navy, we must establish naval schools in appropriate locations to train naval talent. Sanmen Bay, located at the crossroads of the North and South Seas, seems to be an ideal location for establishing our Greenwich and Annapolis. As for the cultivation of our excellent naval tradition, there are also many glorious examples in our history that can inspire the establishment of our new navy, such as Zheng Zhilong at the end of the Ming Dynasty.

Building a navy involves countless aspects, which cannot be fully discussed in this article. We are fortunate that, with Commander-in-Chief Chen's talent and integrity, he will surely establish our new navy.

### Foreign Minister Wang Leads Delegation to India and Then France to Attend Peace Conference; Amendments to Italian Treaty Prepared

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, head of the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, is scheduled to depart from Nanjing at 7:30 AM on the 21st, traveling to Calcutta and then to Paris. Wu Nanru, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Secretary Ye Yi, Zhou Shu, and Guo [blank] will accompany him. The newly appointed Ambassador to Britain, [blank] Xi, will also travel to Britain to assume his new post.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Ye Yi, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and newly appointed representative to Poland, will accompany Foreign Minister Wang to Paris to attend the Peace Conference and then proceed to Poland to assume his new post.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 20th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Chinese delegation's trip abroad includes several proposed amendments to the draft treaty from the Council of Foreign Ministers. China is only secondarily concerned with the Paris Conference and does not intend to mediate or facilitate a compromise between the four powers. China has little concern for the Balkan countries, which, although allied with the Axis powers, were never in a state of war with our country. Conversely, China has significant concerns regarding Italy, as the two countries were at war, and there is a long-standing economic relationship between them. Therefore, China is paying close attention to the Italian peace treaty. The Chinese government has received the draft peace treaty prepared by the deputy foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. After careful study by Chinese experts, several amendments have been proposed, which Foreign Minister Wang is carrying with him.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] According to official sources, the Council of Foreign Ministers has completed drafting the peace treaties with the enemy states and will submit them for discussion when the Peace Conference opens on the 29th.

### Report on Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor Released; Twelve Conclusions Prove Japanese Provocation

[United Press, Washington, 20th] A majority of eight members of the Congressional Committee investigating the Pearl Harbor attack made the following twelve conclusions in their formal report: (1) The attack on Pearl Harbor was an unprovoked act of aggression by the Japanese Empire. (2) Japan bears full responsibility for the attack on Pearl Harbor and its consequences. (3) U.S. foreign policy and actions provided no reason for the Japanese attack. (4) The committee found no evidence that Roosevelt, Hull, Stimson, or Knox used deception, provocation, stimulation, enticement, or compulsion to make Japan attack the United States in order to quickly obtain a declaration of war from Congress. (5) Roosevelt, Hull, and other senior government officials made every effort to avoid war with Japan on the principle of not harming national honor or endangering national security. (6) The misfortune was due to the lack of thoroughness and preparedness for the attack by the commanders of the Army and Navy in Hawaii. (7) Almost no one was surprised by the Japanese attack; however, both Washington and Hawaiian [blank] circles were aware of the danger of an aerial attack. [Missing section in the original UPI dispatch] (9) Their [blank] in [blank] judgment were not [blank] duty. (10) The War Plans Division did not instruct Major General Short, then commander of the U.S. Army in Hawaii, to be on alert, so Short could not respond promptly. (11) Army and Navy intelligence officers underestimated the value of the last intercepted Japanese telegram and did not attach importance to the earlier Japanese telegrams indicating an intention to berth American ships in Pearl Harbor. (12) The Army and Navy Departments were not sufficiently alert to the imminent outbreak of war on December 6, 1941.

### New British Ambassador to the U.S. Has Special Mission: Promote U.S.-Soviet Relations

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The newly appointed British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel (formerly Sir Archibald Clark Kerr), plans to spend one or two months driving across the United States to understand the state of mind of the American people and those on the street regarding Anglo-American relations. His predecessor, Halifax, set a new record by visiting all forty-eight states, but this was during the war. Now that peace has arrived, Ambassador Inverchapel's mission is different. The new post-war issue is the development of Anglo-American relations, and Inverchapel's mission is focused on this. Furthermore, at a time when the Anglo-American attitude towards the Soviet Union is drawing international attention, the issue of "one world or two" is a major problem facing the Soviet Union and Western democracies. Inverchapel has a personal friendship with Stalin and knows the Soviet situation in great detail from his time as ambassador to the Soviet Union. Therefore, many expect that he [blank] be able to bring the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union closer together in terms of politics and ideology.

### Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Returns Home for Consultation

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 19th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov has returned home for consultations, taking a special plane to Moscow via London.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy in the United States stated in response to reporter inquiries that he did not know why Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov was returning to Moscow or how long he would be away. Novikov took a plane to Moscow via London yesterday. [Blank] it is believed that Novikov has been summoned home [blank] the authorities' [blank] regarding the recent trend in U.S.-Soviet diplomacy.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th (broadcast): Prominent Soviet scientist Dr. Bogomolets died last night at the age of sixty-five. Dr. Bogomolets was the inventor of "Youth Serum," a drug that can prolong life and has been very effective. It is now widely used in the Soviet Union.

### Eighth-One Anniversary: U.S. Air Force in the Pacific Holds Demonstration; Flying Fortresses Show Off Their Prowess

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The U.S. Air Force in the Pacific will hold a demonstration on the Army Air Corps Anniversary on August 1. B-29 bombers will fly in formation from the Mariana Islands to Okinawa and then to the Takanosu area on the Japanese mainland, passing over Nagasaki, Hiroshima, and Yokohama, then Tokyo, before heading out to sea and returning to the Mariana bases. A large squadron of fighters, attack aircraft, and medium bombers will also fly in formation over Japan. The Pacific Air Force demonstration area will include the Philippines and other islands, or perhaps even a flight to Korea. Since the signing of the armistice treaty on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2 of last year, a small number of B-29 bombers have dropped medicine and food in Japan. However, this is the first time they will fly in formation over Japan. The weather on August 1 is usually suitable for flying, and the aircraft will fly low on this day so that the occupation forces and Japanese people can observe them.

### Japan Repeatedly Made Major Mistakes in the War Against the U.S.; Secretly Requested Soviet Mediation but Failed; U.S. Navy Releases Investigation Results

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The U.S. Navy today released information on the major mistakes made by Japan during the Pacific War and the secret negotiations that took place at the time. According to the results of an investigation conducted in Tokyo last fall by the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey team: (1) Japan attempted to have the Soviet Union mediate peace negotiations before the Potsdam Declaration was issued. (2) Japanese naval aviators were almost completely wiped out during the battles of Midway and the Solomon Islands, so that the Japanese [blank] could no longer [blank] the protection of aircraft carriers. Japan never recovered from this loss. (3) [Blank] during the battle of Guadalcanal, senior Japanese naval commanders knew that they had no chance of winning. (4) The Japanese Army and Navy once [blank] merged, but the Navy opposed this. (5) The United States' [blank] in the Solomon Islands offensive made the Japanese war [blank] [blank] [blank] pale in comparison. Because Japan [blank] originally [blank] to fight a [blank] [blank] [blank] war with the United States in the Central Pacific, in 1943, the garrison left by Japan in Truk was less than 1,000 men. Its main fleet was prepared to flee immediately when the U.S. [blank] landed, because the aircraft carriers [blank] [blank] were destroyed without residue. (6) The [blank] consumption of [blank] in modern warfare is so large that it [blank] [blank] [blank]. Japan lacked gasoline [blank] [blank] ship use. Moreover, because the US submarine [blank] effect was very [blank], it felt increasingly unsustainable. Japan's lack of trained [blank] aircraft pilots was the fatal injury of this war. About 3% of Japan's best pilots [blank] died in the Battle of Midway, and 40% were injured. Their food [blank] sacrificed in the Battle of Rabuel. The details of Japan's request for peace negotiations were described by Naval Chief of Staff [blank] Tian. It is said that "Japan decided to make peace as early as May 1945. The negotiations were held in Moscow and Tokyo in June, but after more than 20 days, nothing came of it. In July, the Soviet ambassador to Japan became ill, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to [blank] keep in touch with the Soviet Embassy, so it resolutely instructed our ambassador to the Soviet Union to propose to the Soviet side that our country send a special envoy to the Soviet Union. Our ambassador immediately followed the instruction and made this proposal to the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister on July 13. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister asked: What is the purpose of sending a special envoy? Is it to ask the Soviet Union to mediate? Our ambassador replied: Yes. The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister immediately declared: Stalin [blank] and Foreign Minister Molotov [blank] will all be going to [blank] Stan at this time, but they have agreed to answer after returning from [blank] Stan. In fact, our government received a reply from the Soviet Union on August 8. The so-called reply was to sever diplomatic relations with [blank]. For this reason, our efforts to request Soviet mediation to end the war failed. No conditions were mentioned during the negotiations. The Army advocated merging all the troops, but the Navy always opposed it. If the Army and Navy were really merged, the leading figures would probably belong to the Army. Under this leader, they may be divided into two factions, the Army and the Navy, but under the control of the Army, the Navy would inevitably look inferior. If the Air Force strength of the Army and Navy is not lost, then it is also possible not to merge."

### U.S. Senator Connally Proposes Plan to Prevent World War III; Strengthen United Nations Organization

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today reported to the Senate on the proceedings of the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference and submitted a plan to prevent World War III, containing seven recommendations. Connally declared that any great power wanting to abandon the goals of the United Nations organization at this time is "simply crazy" and inconceivable. It can be said that no great power wants to fight again. The United States should entrust its hopes and beliefs to the United Nations organization. To accomplish this purpose, the following seven guidelines should be followed: (1) The United States should firmly adhere to the principles of law and the spirit of the Atlantic Charter in all international negotiations and advise other countries to do the same. (2) The United States should supply the United Nations Security Council with its full complement of troops, aircraft, and warships to [blank] to maintain world peace. (3) The United States should maintain a strong army, navy, and air force to defend its territory and people and to [blank] [blank] the obligations of the United Nations Charter. (4) The international organizations stipulated in the United Nations Charter should be expressly stated in treaties. (5) The United States should submit to the judgments of the International Court of Justice in all purely legal disputes involving the United States and other related countries. (6) The United States should seek to conclude agreements with relevant countries as soon as possible, regulating the control of atomic energy and other weapons of mass destruction. (7) The United States should fully assist the economic and social welfare programs of the United Nations organization in order to complete the various conditions necessary to maintain lasting peace. Connally concluded by declaring that although the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference had encountered difficulties, resulting in little success, "we must not be discouraged."

### Mexico and South American Countries Stop Shipping Westbound Goods; Dockworkers' Union Resolution

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th (broadcast): Velázquez, Secretary General of the Mexican Workers' Confederation, and Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Workers' Confederation, discussed plans to stop moving goods to [blank] [blank] [blank], and decided that the Mexican dockworkers' union would stop loading and unloading goods between Spain and [blank] Mexico. Toledano said in a speech on Thursday that the Chilean dockworkers' union had stopped loading Spanish cargo, and Cuban dockworkers would also begin to stop shipping Spanish cargo.

### International Court to Continue Trial of Japanese War Criminals Tomorrow

### Second Atomic Bomb Test: Timer to be Used to Prevent Premature Explosion; Lieutenant General Blandy Says Preparations are Complete

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Broadcast: Regarding the premature explosion of the dummy bomb during the Bikini Island atomic bomb exercise, electronic experts have concluded that it was caused by rogue radio signals. According to Commander Blandy's announcement, wireless communication tests will not be conducted in order to determine the origin of these interfering signals. The triggering mechanism for this exercise was more complex, connecting the dummy bomb to the electrical circuit of the cameras on the target ship. As a result, a circuit error caused the explosion to occur fifty-one minutes before the scheduled time. Blandy stated that a simpler method would be used to detonate the atomic bomb during the official atomic bomb test on the 25th of this month, as a premature explosion would severely affect the photography of the atomic bomb test, and he did not want to take any chances. He also mentioned that he had received weather reports indicating that the cloud cover threat would hopefully dissipate by the day of the atomic bomb test. If this test can be completed as planned, he intends to return to Pearl Harbor in mid-August and then fly to Washington to resume his original post.

[Reuters, USS Appalachian, 18th] Atomic bomb test commander Lieutenant General Blandy told reporters on the flagship USS McKinley that preparations for the second atomic bomb test on July 25th were complete, and good weather was expected at that time. If the atomic bomb does not explode after being submerged, it can be rendered harmless remotely, posing no danger to anyone. A small number of ships will be sent in to inspect the area on the same day as the explosion, while the remaining ships must wait five days before entering to avoid the dangerous radioactive activity after the explosion. For the second test, 1,200 animals, some of which did not participate in the first test, will be used. When asked if President Truman planned to personally attend the second test, he replied that he had no knowledge of it. When asked about the condition of pig number 311 on the cruiser Sakawa, which was swimming several hours after the explosion, he replied that it was in good condition, just a bit noisy. Other officials revealed that a timer similar to those used in bank vaults would be used to prevent the bomb from exploding too early, as the dummy bomb exploded fifty minutes before the scheduled time during today's rehearsal.

### Interlude in Atomic Bomb Test: King of Bikini Island as a Guest on the Ship

[United Press, Atomic Bomb Test Command Flagship USS McKinley, 19th] Atomic bomb test commander Blandy announced today that King Judah of Bikini Island has been invited to observe the underwater detonation of the atomic bomb next Wednesday, or a seat will be reserved for him on this flagship. King Judah received this invitation after relocating to Ongelak Island (about 150 miles from Bikini). Mr. Blandy also visited him today, accompanied by another American official and a local interpreter, and presented him with gifts.

### France Demands Siam Hand Over Emerald Buddha; Territorial Dispute to be Resolved Through Direct Negotiations

[United Press, Bangkok, 19th] According to Siamese officials today, France has demanded that Siam hand over the so-called Emerald Buddha, which is known as the "Soul of Siam." The Buddha is twenty-three inches tall, carved from opaque jade, and is one of the most revered deities in Siam's largest temple. France bases this request on the claim that the Buddha was originally obtained from Luang Prabang, a province in French-protected Laos, Vietnam. However, Siam insists that Siam should not only keep the Buddha, but also demand the return of the Luang Prabang territory itself to Siam. The territory and the Buddha image were both incorporated into Siam over a century ago, until 1893 when Siam ceded them to France under duress.

[United Press, Saigon, 19th] French diplomatic sources announced today that the French government believes that it is still at war with Siam over Phibun, as the armistice treaty signed in 1941 by the Vichy government under Japanese pressure has never been recognized. The Siamese government has been aiding illegal elements in Annam and Laos, supplying them with weapons and money, making them enemies of France. France will firmly oppose Siam's application for United Nations intervention. France has informed Siam that it is willing, in the spirit of friendship, to discuss possible revisions to the Vietnamese border. Such revisions should be based on racial and historical grounds, and negotiations can only begin after Siam returns the Vietnamese territory it seized in 1941 with the help of Japan. France believes that the dispute can only be resolved through direct negotiations between the two countries, without the intervention of the United Nations. France has only two demands of Siam: (1) return the two areas seized by Siam in 1941, and (2) compensate for the damage to French property within Siam, although this is "very small."

### Soviet Position on the German Question: No Conflict with French Interests; Moscow Reiterates Clarification to Dispel French Fears

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] Regarding the position taken by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the German question at the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference, Soviet officials commented that Foreign Minister Molotov's position was the only solution that would benefit France, and that it did not conflict with French interests. There is no reason for France to be disappointed with Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal that Germany should remain unified under the authority of a central government. It is also absurd for France to believe that the Soviet Union's proposed solution to the German question conflicts with France's vital interests. In short, how the German question is resolved will be determined by the following factors: (1) whether France can prevent Britain from intervening in the Ruhr region, and if necessary, expel it from the region; (2) whether France can prevent Britain from treating the Ruhr region as an economic prize of war and prevent it from exploiting the coal produced in the Ruhr region; (3) if the Ruhr region is separated from the rest of Germany, whether France can control the region. In short, although the Ruhr region may theoretically remain autonomous and be jointly managed by Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, because the British government's influence is sufficient to sway the governments of the Netherlands and Belgium, France will inevitably be in the minority, and there is absolutely no guarantee that it will enjoy any benefits. On the other hand, the Soviet proposal would allow France to establish a strong foothold in the Ruhr region and protect its interests. Therefore, from the Soviet perspective, Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal is sufficient to proportionally represent the various forces in Europe, and it is the least detrimental to France.

### Bloody Battles Erupt in Central Luzon; Leader of "People's Anti-Japanese Army" Makes Final Efforts for Peace

[United Press, Manila, 20th] According to the Manila Post, military police engaged in a bloody battle with 500 Hukbalahaps in Bulacan Province, occupying villages that serve as bases for the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," which is now raising the banner against the Roxas government. Bulacan is located north of the province of Pampanga.

[United Press, Manila, 20th] Conflicts between the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" and the military police in Central Luzon appear to have reached a final stage today. "People's Anti-Japanese Army" leader Taruc is scheduled to meet with Provisional President Roxas today to personally appeal for an end to the fighting. Taruc declared that he would make a final effort in the central provinces to ensure that a peaceful solution is accepted, after a four-hour secret meeting with Interior Minister Sulluhay. Personnel from the Interior Ministry will accompany him on this trip. However, given the deteriorating situation, it is still unknown whether his trip will prevent a large-scale civil war.

### Discord Among Korean Parties: Fierce Fighting Occurs in Japan and Korea

[Remodeling Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Koreans belonging to the Federation of Korean Residents in Japan and the Korean National Construction Promotion Youth League have recently been engaging in fierce fighting in various parts of Tokyo, Kawasaki, Chiba, and other places using clubs and other weapons due to discord. There have already been several seriously injured in the last two days.

[United Press, Seoul, 20th] Local newspapers report that Liu Wang-sheng (transliteration), leader of the Korean People's Party, was attacked by a group of armed thugs last night. Liu is a representative attending the meeting of the United Front of Southern Korean political parties. The political parties intend to form a legislative body based on this united front. It is reported that Liu left the home of Lieutenant Zizki, a liaison officer with the US military occupation force in Korea, at 10:00 PM last night after attending a meeting and was carrying a "White Paper" to the residence of Kim Gu, a representative of the right wing. He was captured by the bandits on the way and attacked. He was not seriously injured and managed to roll into a cliff and was rescued. According to well-informed sources, Liu was attacked by radical leftists who wanted to participate in the legislative body. However, according to another source, it may have been an attack by the right wing, in order to blame the left wing.

### Some Schools in Japan Still Implementing Military Training: Students Stage Strikes to Protest

### Celebrities from the City's Cultural Circles Host Tea Party for Dr. Hu Shih: Don't Be Pessimistic or Disappointed, Do Your Best to Improve the Current Situation; Dr. Hu's Speech Encourages Diligent Research

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Hu Shih returned to China two weeks ago. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, presidents of various universities in the city, along with celebrities from the cultural, journalism, and education circles, jointly held a tea party at the International Hotel to welcome Mr. Hu. In addition to Mr. Hu, attendees included Mayor Wu Guozhen, Secretary-General He Dekui, Director Gu Yuxiu, presidents of various public and private universities Wu Baozhen, Li Shouyong, Zhu Hengbi, Dong Xifan, etc., presidents of various newspapers Cheng Jibo, Hu Jianzhong, Feng Youzhen, etc., leaders of various cultural organizations Yan Jingqing, etc., approximately forty people in total.

First, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, rose to speak on behalf of the dozens of hosts. He said: Since Mr. Hu returned to China, the cultural circles of Shanghai have been preparing to welcome him, and in fact, they have already prepared twice. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Hu arrived in Shanghai, he was not feeling well, and then he went to Nanjing in a hurry, so he was never able to meet with everyone. The day before yesterday, Director Gu and I returned from Nanjing and happened to be on the same train as Mr. Hu. Only then did we agree to hold a simple and sincere tea party today. Because Mr. Hu is afraid of being disturbed, the friends we invited are not too many. Mr. Hu has always been engaged in education and academic research, but at the same time, he is always very concerned about national affairs. At the time of the July 7th Incident, when everyone was summoned to Lushan, Mr. Hu was one of the strongest advocates of the national policy of resisting the war to the end and never compromising midway. After that Lushan meeting, the vigorous all-out war of resistance was launched. Mr. Hu first served abroad on a cultural mission, dedicating himself to public diplomacy, and later served as ambassador. Over the years, he further strengthened the friendship between China and the United States. After leaving office, Mr. Hu continued to engage in educational and academic work, indirectly contributing to diplomacy, which is a great achievement. This time, Mr. Hu returned to China after the victory, just as national construction is beginning. The progress of everything may not be as ideal as we would like. We are very willing to listen to Mr. Hu's great insights. We ask Mr. Hu to treat today's tea party as a conversation among family members, and to give us sincere guidance with the attitude of a thinker, so that those of us engaged in cultural work can receive a new inspiration. We firmly believe that Mr. Hu's return from overseas this time to head Peking University will contribute even more to the country. I respectfully offer a cup of clear tea and wish Mr. Hu good health!

Everyone cheerfully stood up and raised their glasses to Mr. Hu to pay their respects. After sitting down, Mr. Hu, with a warm smile, stood up amid applause to deliver his first public speech since returning to China:

### Nine Years Abroad: A Remembrance

Mr. Hu said, "For the past nine years, I have stayed abroad and have not worn Chinese clothes or spoken Chinese for a long time. This time, I may bring out some foreign words when I speak, please don't be offended. I am very grateful for your hospitality, but I had diarrhea within ten hours of returning to China, which was very embarrassing, so I could not attend the two scheduled events. I apologize to you all."

"During these nine years, I did not participate in the many war resistance efforts that you all made in the occupied areas and in the rear; nor did I experience the various hardships you suffered. It seems like the country gave me a nine-year vacation. Now that I have returned, I truly feel like the vacation is over."

"When I first went abroad, it was entirely for exploratory purposes, entrusted with an informal mission by the government to see the opinion and attitude of the United States towards our war of resistance. Later, I was ordered by the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica to attend the International Historical Science Conference held in Switzerland. That was in 1938, and it was the first time our country participated in this conference. After returning to the United States from Europe, I was ordered to return to diplomatic work."

"During those four years from 1938 to 1942, I was engaged in diplomatic work. The responsibility was actually very light. Every day, I would just change clothes a few times and attend a few tea parties or cocktail parties. I never negotiated a treaty, never contacted a loan, and never donated a sum of money. Moreover, I told them the truth, without using diplomatic language. We have difficulties, so we honestly tell them. I want them to know that China is a civilized country and that Chinese people are honest people."

"Later, my task was not as easy as before. The government had already seen that in addition to our country standing up alone to resist the war, we also needed to pay attention to the changes in the world situation. But honestly, I really have nothing to report to you."

"Guangzhou fell before I presented my credentials, and Wuhan fell three days before I presented my credentials. This was precisely when the country was most unlucky. Although we have always advocated speaking responsibly, not being afraid of being laughed at or scolded, and not being afraid of being disliked, I felt that this attitude was not enough when Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another. I felt that I should participate in the judgment. Whether my report is accurate or not can play a role in history. —I felt that just speaking responsibly was not enough. I felt that actually taking responsibility was even more difficult than speaking or writing. Writers often discuss things casually and often like to write revisionist articles, but those responsible for handling affairs cannot allow such things."

"In the autumn of 1942, I originally wanted to return to China, but I have a heart condition. The doctor said that it was not suitable for flying at high altitudes, and in Chongqing, I often had to run up many stone steps. Kunming is also six or seven thousand feet above sea level, which is not suitable for people with heart conditions. So, I stayed in the United States for a few more years. At that time, my desire to return to China to engage in cultural work could not be fulfilled."

### Not Speaking, Not Flaunting, Focusing on Reading and Research

"During the first five years abroad, I never engaged in academic research. I did not write an article, nor did I do any research work. Even when giving speeches, I never had any insights. Although I received thirty-one honorary degrees, it was not through hard work. So I made a decision to work hard in the years from 1942 to 1944 to be 'silent and odorless.' 'Silent' means not speaking, and 'odorless' means 'not flaunting,' focusing on reading and research, using the vacation that the country gave me to train myself and prepare to return to China to be a teacher."

"Last September, the government announced that I would be the president of Peking University. Before that, the Ministry of Education did not contact me at all. Because they knew that I have a weakness: when the country is in trouble, I never hesitate or deny anything that the government announces I will do. The position of Peking University is an honor, but it is also a very difficult job. I am willing to be a teacher, a historian. This is my 'ambition' for the rest of my years."

"The host wants me to talk about my views as someone who has just returned from abroad, and to say something about the domestic situation. The topic is too broad and it is not easy to finish. People abroad often see the big picture and miss the small details, so sometimes they see the whole picture and don't nitpick. But after returning to China, I realized that what I heard abroad is indeed very different in many ways. What I was optimistic about ten months ago may have something to be pessimistic about ten months later. I arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, and it has only been two weeks. I have met many friends. The pile of visiting cards in Shanghai is two inches high, and the pile of visiting cards in Nanjing is also two inches high. Most of what I have heard is pessimistic, and there is also a lot of disappointment about the future. But although I have been away from China for nine years, I have not been isolated from China, and I have never reduced my concern for China. I think that looking at it from the perspective of studying history, we don't need to be too pessimistic."

"Nine years ago, or fifteen years ago at the time of the September 18th Incident, we carefully considered the situation, and I never advocated for easily going to war. Why? Because our economic, cultural, industrial, and other foundations were not confident enough to accept this challenge and fight this unprecedented war. When the Lushan Conference was held, we felt that we had endured enough. It was like a person suffering from appendicitis, knowing that surgery could be life-threatening, but in order to preserve their life, they could no longer be afraid of taking risks. So, we accepted the challenge and participated in the war, and we fought for eight years."

### Victory is Not a Rest

"Looking at it from the perspective of studying history, the suffering we are experiencing now, a part of it may still be due to our insufficient efforts, but most of it may still be due to historical inevitability. Even the wealthy and powerful America has not yet returned to normal after the victory. Therefore, although we have already won, it is by no means time to rest or 'relax.' With this in mind, we may not be so pessimistic."

"We should study where our shortcomings lie, whether it is talent or knowledge, and then work hard to overcome them. If we continue to suffer without exploring and researching, then the time of suffering will only be prolonged. We in the cultural and education circles should grit our teeth and do our best to salvage and improve the current situation in the next five or ten years. If we ourselves are pessimistic and feel that nothing can be done, then the national affairs will truly be even more pessimistic and make people feel that nothing can be done."

### Military Law Department Feels Deeply Troubled: No Concrete Evidence Found in Grain Loan Case; Authorities Consider Consulting Various Review Committee Members; Garrison Headquarters Seals Up Lizhong Grain Store in Suzhou

[Report from this newspaper] The interrogation of the Grain Loan Case has now come to an end. The account books of only fourteen grain merchants have not yet been fully checked. It is reported that no concrete evidence has been obtained regarding the suspicion of corruption against Wang Daren and Ren Xingya, and the suspicion of hoarding against Changjiang and Santai. The Military Law Department and the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters have tried to investigate the private deposits of Wang Daren and his wife, but have not found any large amounts of money coming in or going out. At the same time, Wu Rongsheng of Santai claims that all the grain was entrusted by the authorities, and the Zhejiang Grain Loan Office recently issued a certificate proving that the grain of the Housheng Company, which is affiliated with the Changjiang Company, was purchased with loans from that office. Although the highest local authorities have ordered that this case be handled strictly, legal trials must emphasize evidence, so the Military Law Department feels extremely troubled in handling this case. It is also heard that the Garrison Headquarters is currently considering inviting the members of the committee who reviewed the grain loan measures at the time to consult with them.

[Report from this newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] The Songhu Garrison Headquarters sent Shan Baoyuan and Ye to Suzhou yesterday to seal up the Lizhong Grain Store outside Qimen. They first requested assistance from the Suzhou County Government, which sent the Grain Department and the Police Bureau to go together. They only found temporary account books and cash of more than 95,000 yuan, which were sealed up piece by piece. A reporter visited the relevant authorities to inquire about the case and the situation. It was reported that it was because of the illegal use of grain funds from the Shanghai Santai Company that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters discovered it and sealed it up pending investigation.

### There are Too Many Ways to Save the Country, But It All Comes Down to Two Words: Yan Huiqing Expresses Admiration for Hu Shi's Observations

After Mr. Hu returned to his seat amidst applause, Mr. Yan Huiqing stood up and said: "My relationship with Mr. Shi Zhi is quite long. When he was a student, he came to Tsinghua to take the examination to study abroad. At that time, I had some connection with Tsinghua (reporter's note: at that time, Mr. Yan was probably the president of Tsinghua). Later, we often met at the Pacific Institute. Six or seven years ago, when I went to the United States, I saw Mr. Hu even more often, and it can be said that our friendship is quite deep. It has been more than seventy years since China sent diplomatic envoys to the United States. In the second year of the Xuantong reign, when I went to the United States as a counselor, several old ladies in the United States often asked about an Envoy Zhang. Envoy Zhang was handsome and dignified, and they missed him very much, but he could not speak English. Later, Mr. Wu Tingfang wore a long robe and a dark jacket, with a small melon-skin hat with a jade tablet on it. He spoke fluent English and received countless honorary degrees. At that time, I was a small staff member in the embassy, ​​and Mr. Wu's speeches were all drafted by me. However, Mr. Hu should be considered the first person in our country to serve as a national representative abroad as a scholar. Before he went abroad, we all had some doubts: Of course, Mr. Hu's knowledge and morality are not a problem, but can he be competent in diplomatic duties? It was not until I went to the United States six or seven years ago that I realized that he had truly succeeded. He represented the personality and knowledge of the Chinese people. I think the number of his honorary degrees is probably twenty or thirty? Dr. [Pu Si], an American, believed that this could promote cultural exchange between the two countries and best connect the feelings between countries. Mr. Shi Zhi has already done this for China. Mr. Hu's speech has now been influenced by his diplomatic career. He just spoke very euphemistically and very 'not easy to understand', but his meaning is very correct. Twenty years ago, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, Mr. Zhou Jimei, and several other gentlemen often talked about ways to save the country. Some said to save the country through science, and some said that there were too many ways to save the country through reading, but in fact, there was only a small four-letter English word 'Time'. I think Mr. Shi Zhi's meaning is probably referring to this. We are fundamentally too backward in everything, and we are far behind others in every aspect. However, China's future is absolutely no problem, and we can definitely be optimistic. However, it would be very difficult to jump to the first-class power in one leap. H.G. Wells also gave advice to the cultural circles in his new book 'Destiny of Homo Sapiens'. He said that the starting point of a nation lies in 'brain remnants', that is, thought and culture. I hope everyone will put in such fundamental effort, and the country's future will definitely have great hope."

Finally, Mr. Cheng Cangbo said: "We don't need to be pessimistic, and we don't need to sigh. Those who lead the nation's thinking should be more energetic. We thank Mr. Hu and Mr. Yan for their earnest instructions."

The two ambassadors talked very enthusiastically after the meeting. They shook hands warmly with every guest present. When the meeting ended, the clock was pointing to six o'clock.

### Madam Xu's Eightieth Birthday - President Sun Will Celebrate His Mother's Birthday Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] The 22nd of this month is Madam Lu, the wife of President Sun, is her eightieth birthday. President Sun Zhesheng has specially welcomed her to Shanghai and will celebrate her birthday. During the Anti-Japanese War, Madam Lu avoided the enemy in Macau and often took walks on the street. Because she was amiable and approachable, the citizens all expressed their love and respect for her. This time, she transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and was able to be with President Sun day and night, and her spirit was particularly happy. Recently, she often goes out for excursions or attends banquets of various relatives and friends.

### Strengthening Security in the Suburbs - Military, Police, and Gendarmerie Form Patrol Teams

The Songhu Garrison Command, in order to strengthen the security of the suburbs of this city and crack down on straggling soldiers and vagrants, has specially joined forces with the 146th Brigade of the garrison troops in the suburbs of Shanghai, the 23rd Regiment of the Gendarmerie, and the Municipal Police Bureau to form suburban patrol teams, which officially began their services yesterday. They will regularly patrol Wusong, Dachang, Zhenru, Fahua Town, and Longhua to ensure the security of Shanghai. There is also a similar organization in the Pudong District.

In addition, since the encirclement regiment in this city was ordered to be disbanded, the follow-up matters have been handled by the police bureau. It has now been gradually reorganized and is about to be completed. 1,800 members of the standing encirclement regiment will be placed and used as police officers to strengthen patrol work. More than 2,800 people will be incorporated into the 15th Police Team.

### Verdict on Parade Assault Case - Four Defendants Sentenced to Imprisonment and Compensation for Medical Expenses and Losses to the Victims

[Report from this newspaper] Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu, the main culprits in the vicious assault case that occurred during the grand parade in this city on the 23rd of last month, were brought to trial by the local court. Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, the original Judge Wu Shaochang announced the verdict. The main text of the verdict reads: "Xu Damao, jointly and continuously injuring the bodies of others, is sentenced to ten months of imprisonment; jointly and continuously illegally depriving others of their freedom, is sentenced to one year of imprisonment; the combined sentence is one year and six months of imprisonment, the rest of the charges are not guilty. Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng, jointly assisting in the illegal deprivation of others' freedom, are each reduced to eight months of imprisonment, the rest of the charges are not guilty. Ruan Guangyu, assisting in injuring the bodies of others, is reduced to three months of imprisonment, the rest of the charges are not guilty. Xu Damao shall compensate Zhang Yong and Yu Jinrong for losses and medical expenses of 378,000 yuan. Ruan Guangyu shall be jointly and severally liable with Xu Damao to compensate Zhang Yong for medical expenses of 9,000 yuan. The rest of the plaintiff's claims are rejected. Ruan Guangyu shall provide a written guarantee of 300,000 yuan. If you do not agree with the verdict, you may file an appeal within ten days after receiving the verdict." The original text of the verdict is recorded below:

### Facts

The defendants Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu, on June 23 of this year, because they were celebrating the "People's Representatives" Ma Xulun and others going to Beijing, participated in the parade in succession. In the morning, after celebrating at the North Railway Station, while passing near Nanjing Road on Henan Road at noon, Xu Damao saw the student Yu Jinrong distributing leaflets to the paraders. He injured his head, arms, back, and legs, tied his hands behind his back with ropes, and forced him to follow the parade to the Great World, pushed him onto a truck, and was guarded by Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng. While passing the YMCA, he saw someone distributing leaflets from upstairs. Xu Damao and dozens of people, including the parade team leader and disciplinarians, rushed to the second floor of the YMCA. They saw the accountant Zhang Yong and questioned him. Zhang Yong told them that the association did not issue leaflets. They went to the ninth floor to check and quarreled with the tea server. After being persuaded by others, they returned to the second floor and assaulted Zhang Yong, pushing him out of the door and injuring his back, chest, and head. He was tied up with ropes and forced to follow the parade to Malang Road. Someone said that Zhang Yong was a "national agent" and searched his body. They wrote the words "Special Agent" on his back with red paint and pushed him onto a truck. After the parade reached Fuxing Park, Xu Damao hired a tricycle due to exhaustion. While passing near Gu Ba Road, Gu Qinliang and Huang Jiaqing saw him and told him to stop the car and send him to the police station. While the paraders were publicly trying Zhang Yong and Yu Jinle in Fuxing Park, the police found out about it and also boarded the truck and drove to the police station, detaining Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu on the truck. While parading to the YMCA, they saw people beating Zhang Yong and helped shout and beat him. After watching football and drinking tea at the association, they went downstairs. After Li Zhaolin and others saw that they had shouted and beat him before, they were escorted to the police station. The student He Xuechun saw the parade passing by from the building at home and was dragged down, injured, tied up, and had his shoes put on his back. He was escorted onto the school truck and paraded to Fuxing Park. Qiu Shengqing, who was pulled off the truck, was also entrusted by someone to distribute leaflets in front of the YMCA at 2 pm and was beaten and had his shoes placed on his chest and brought to Fuxing Park and placed on the truck. The police took the car away and sent the victims to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, filled out forms, and transferred them to the prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. Zhang Yong filed an incidental civil lawsuit, requesting compensation for losses, including a suit, 300,000 yuan in national currency, a shirt, 4,000 yuan, a Parker 51 fountain pen, 120,000 yuan, two seals, 10,000 yuan, an advertisement fee for lost seals, 18,000 yuan, medical expenses, 9,000 yuan, and 37,000 yuan in national currency lost on his body, totaling 498,000 yuan in public funds. Yu Jinle and his legal representative filed an incidental civil lawsuit requesting compensation for medical expenses of 260,000 yuan in national currency, a shirt, 22,000 yuan, an undershirt, 2,000 yuan, a Parker sapphire fountain pen, 80,000 yuan, and 24,000 yuan in national currency lost, totaling 378,000 yuan. He Xuechun and his legal representative filed an incidental civil lawsuit requesting compensation for losses as listed on the list, totaling 105,000 yuan in national currency.

### Reasons

After investigating, the defendants Xu Damao and others all admitted to participating in the parade on that day to celebrate the People's Representatives going to Beijing, but denied injuring the bodies of others and obstructing freedom. However, the witnesses Zhang Peixin, Tang Guifen, Sun Jing, Xu Huiqing, and Gu Liang, who were cited by Xu Damao, were either at the end of the parade or at the very end, which is not enough to prove whether Xu Damao is guilty or not. Liu A'gen, who was traveling with Xu Damao, gave conflicting statements about the situation in Fuxing Park, with Xu Damao stating that he did not enter the park. These statements are not credible. The two victims Yu Jinrong and Zhang Yong both clearly testified how Xu Damao and the paraders jointly beat them, tied their hands behind their backs, paraded them in the team, and how they were escorted onto the truck to Fuxing Park, vividly depicting the scene.

Moreover, witnesses Gu Qinliang and Huang Jiaqing saw Xu Damao committing the crime at the YMCA. They encountered him on Gu Ba Road and immediately told him to stop the car and turned him over to the police station. Yu Jinrong and Zhang Yong also had medical examinations at the hospital and filled out consultation forms, which should be subject to legal discussion and prosecution. Yu Jinrong also testified that the defendants Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng jointly guarded him on the truck and paraded with him to Fuxing Park. The police then drove the truck to the police station and detained the defendants. This cannot be denied that they assisted in illegally depriving others of their freedom, but their sentences should be reduced. However, they did not injure Yu Jinrong, and are not jointly responsible for harming Zhang Yong. The defendant Ruan Guangyu left the parade at the YMCA. He went to the association and saw people beating Zhang Yong and helped shout and beat him. This is proven by Li Zhaolin's testimony. Ruan Guangyu also said, "I watched football and drank tea at the YMCA and came down from the elevator. On the second floor, many people said that I was distributing leaflets and was taken to the police station by Li Zhaolin." This is enough to prove the crime of assisting in injuring others, but since it was assistance, the sentence should be reduced. Also, since he was under eighteen years old, the sentence should be reduced again. Although He Xuechun and Qiu Shengqing were also harmed by the paraders, it was not done by the defendants. He Xuechun and Qiu Shengqing also stated during the trial or at the police station that they could not identify who harmed them. Therefore, each defendant does not accept this formal responsibility, and He Xuechun and his legal representative's incidental civil lawsuit requesting compensation for losses is difficult to be considered reasonable. Zhang Yong's incidental civil lawsuit against Diao Minzhi, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Ruan Guangyu for compensation for losses, except for the part on injury, is also unreasonable and should be rejected. As for his claim for compensation for losses from Xu Damao, as stated in the fact section, except for the suit that has not been completely destroyed and should be reduced appropriately, are all considered reasonable. He is ordered to compensate for losses and medical expenses totaling 300,000 yuan. His incidental civil lawsuit against Ruan Guangyu, requesting joint and several liability for medical expenses of 9,000 yuan, is justified and should be ordered to be jointly and severally liable with Xu Damao. The rest of the losses were allegedly incurred when someone said he was a "national agent" on Malang Road and was searched, and the resulting losses cannot be claimed from Ruan Guangyu and should be rejected. Yu Jinrong and his legal representative's incidental civil lawsuit against Xu Damao requesting compensation for losses, as stated in the fact section, should be deemed reasonable and ordered to be compensated, while the request for compensation from other defendants is unreasonable and should also be rejected.

Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 291, the first paragraph, Article 293, paragraph 1, Article 506, paragraphs 1 and 2, Article 507, the first paragraph, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 28, Article 18, paragraph 2, Article 30, Article 50, Article 51, paragraph 5, Article 66, the first paragraph, Article 70, and Article 277, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

This case was executed by Prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen in court, Judge Wu Shaochang.

### A Thief Killed in the Southern District - Stray Bullet Wounds a Rickshaw Puller

[Report from this newspaper] At Hong Taifeng Cotton Cloth Shop, No. 379 Zhongzheng East Road, three robbers suddenly broke in at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Two of the robbers each pulled out Mauser pistols, forbidding any noise. They then robbed 1 million yuan in legal tender from the accounting table. The robbers then fled with the stolen goods. The shop owner Zi Ziming followed closely behind. When the bandits reached East Zilaihuo Street, one of the gun-wielding bandits looked flustered. At this time, plainclothes police officer Zhang Shusheng from the Penglai Branch passed by and saw this situation. He knew that the person running wildly in front was definitely not a good person, so he drew his gun and chased after him, ordering him to stop. However, the thief fired his gun first. Zhang also returned fire. When he fled from Xinqiao Street to Minguo Road, all the police officers from the Luxiangyuan Road Police Station of the Yimiao Branch opened fire and also assisted in the pursuit. When the thief was surrounded in Liufen Lane, he was shot in the chest and fell to the ground. Guo Jitian, the head of the second section of the Yimiao Branch, rushed to the scene and seized a Mauser pistol with ten bullets from the wounded thief's hand. After the wounded thief was sent to the police hospital, he died. During the fight between the two sides, a rickshaw puller named Ji Jiating was hit in the left leg and left back by stray bullets. He was sent to the hospital afterward and is said to be out of danger. The Taishan Branch is currently investigating the whereabouts of the two escaped robbers.

### Bricks as Chairs, Benches as Desks

Primary and Secondary Schools Face a Major Crisis

Nearly 480,000 Children Out of School

[Our Newspaper's Report from Beiping, 20th] Alongside the turmoil and hardship facing university education in Beiping, primary and secondary education is also facing a major crisis. Municipal schools are struggling to survive due to excessive expenses, while private schools have drastically increased tuition due to the lack of government subsidies, making it impossible for ordinary citizens, other than wealthy officials, merchants, and the nouveau riche, to afford to send their children to private secondary schools. Beiping education, which was once a national model, is not only facing difficulties in recovery, but is also in danger of becoming unsustainable. According to estimates by education authorities, approximately four-fifths of school-age children are out of school. Out of the city's 119,000 primary and secondary school students in public and private schools, only one-fifth of school-age children are attending. The number of children out of school is close to 480,000. Seven to eight out of ten of the young people in school are attending private schools, but these private primary and secondary schools have had to drastically increase tuition (without government restrictions) because they can no longer receive government subsidies (which were previously 20 million yuan per month for four months starting in March). Tuition ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 yuan, and when combined with the cost of boarding, uniforms, and books, it is simply unaffordable for most lower and middle-class families. Even textbooks have increased in price by 480 times. As a result, there is unprecedented competition for admission to municipal schools, with the number of applicants being twenty times the number of available places. This has led to rampant corruption, turning once-reputable schools into engines of favoritism. However, municipal schools are also beginning to face difficulties. The 200 schools need 210 million yuan per month in funding, but only 160 million yuan is guaranteed, and there is no solution for the shortfall. In April of this year, there was already a "mass sick-out." The school buildings are also a problem. Out of the 200 schools, 108 are in rented buildings, and the landlords are constantly pestering the Bureau of Education to move out. The school equipment has been severely damaged and there is no money for repairs. The tragic scene of "bricks as chairs, benches as desks" can be seen everywhere. Yesterday, the Beiping Military Headquarters held a meeting and ordered troops and government agencies to occupy as few buildings as possible, and to hand over the remaining buildings to the Bureau of Education for allocation. Beiping received over a thousand buildings, and allocating some of them for school use should not have been a problem.

### Municipal Bureau of Education to Hold Summer Workshop for Social Education

### Purge False Textbooks

Old Approved Editions Should Also Be Re-examined

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] Enemy and puppet textbooks used to enslave the population were printed in large quantities before the enemy's surrender. When the enemy surrendered in August, the schools had not yet started, and the books had not yet been sold, so there were many remaining books. According to people in the book industry, this is closely related to the scarce number of nationally approved textbooks printed in recent years, the failure to implement a responsible supply system, and the panic in the book industry. Recently, the Nanjing authorities were outraged by news reports that false textbooks were still being sold and used in Ningbo and other places, and have ordered a strict investigation. In addition, when the nationally approved textbooks were first published in Chongqing, the printing companies signed contracts with the Ministry of Education stating that their national branches should not sell textbooks from false organizations. However, it has now been discovered that the same "printing house" name that distributed the nationally approved textbooks is printed on the last page of the false textbooks, so many parties are calling for legal action to be taken. Furthermore, for subjects in the nationally approved series that have not yet been published, bookstores on the market are generally using outdated pre-war editions to fill the gap. Moreover, because the Shanghai printing plates were closely scrutinized during the enemy and puppet era, many of the current editions still contain modifications made by the false Ministry of Education, with many absurd and inappropriate texts. This situation has attracted the attention of the educational administration authorities, who are seeking solutions. As for the selling prices of books, although they are allowed to adopt a mark-up method of selling at 1,600 times the fixed price, the base price should be the original price approved before the war. Any fixed prices that were increased by the enemy and puppet regime should be invalid, in order to comply with the law and reduce the burden on students.

### City Sports Association to Convene an Extraordinary Board Meeting This Afternoon; Reviewing the Organization of a Charity Football Match at the Request of the China Welfare Fund

The City Sports Association previously resolved at a plenary board meeting, in response to the China Welfare Fund Committee's request to hold a charity football match to raise funds for disaster relief in Hunan and Northern Jiangsu, that the season was over and that the event should be held in late August. However, due to the fact that the South China Team from Hong Kong, invited by the Welfare Fund, has already arrived in Shanghai and needs to play as soon as possible, the Welfare Fund made a request to the City Sports Association for assistance with the charity match yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Therefore, the Sports Association has decided to convene an extraordinary board meeting this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the association's meeting room at 303 Shaanxi South Road. The letter from the Welfare Fund to the City Sports Association and the Sports Association's announcement are recorded below:

"To the City Sports Association: With regards to our request to hold a charity football match to raise funds for the disaster victims in Northern Hunan and Northern Jiangsu, we were notified by your association on the 15th of this month that the football season was over. However, when we were planning the charity football match, it was still the football season. Due to inexperience and difficulties with the procedures, the preparations were not completed until after the football season. We regret this. Li Huitang has accepted our invitation and brought the South China Football Team to Shanghai to play in the charity match and appeal for the victims. If we abandon it halfway, there will be losses in both time and money. Therefore, we are requesting your association to convene an extraordinary meeting to reconsider your decision of the 12th of this month, with a view to amending the resolution and approving the event. In order to benefit the disaster victims, we sincerely hope that you will understand our situation and make the matter perfect under law and reason. We would be most grateful." Therefore, we have decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of the entire board of directors at 4:00 PM on the 21st of this month in the association's meeting room at 303 Shaanxi South Road, at the Municipal Gymnasium. We respectfully invite the chairman and vice-chairman to attend and provide guidance. Please make time to attend."

(Additional News) According to Mr. Shao Rugan, the secretary-general of the City Sports Association, due to the sudden nature of the event, some directors may not have received the notice. Please attend after seeing the news.

### Dismissed Personnel Due to Cases by the Municipal Government Must Not Be Employed; Order to Subordinate Agencies to Comply

The Municipal Government previously found that personnel dismissed from the government and its affiliated agencies due to cases were often dismissed from one agency only to be employed by another, which significantly affected personnel management. Therefore, special regulations were established regarding notification of dismissed personnel and restrictions on employment, as follows: (1) Personnel dismissed from this government due to cases shall be notified to all subordinate agencies by government order. (2) Personnel dismissed from each agency due to cases shall immediately provide their name, age, place of origin, position, and a detailed description of the case, and report it to this government for notification to all subordinate agencies. (3) Personnel dismissed due to cases shall not be employed by this government or its subordinate agencies. (4) After receiving the government order notifying dismissal cases, each agency shall forward it to the personnel management department for special registration in a register. (5) The personnel management department must check the dismissed personnel register before handling proposed appointments to avoid confusion. A general order was issued to all subordinate agencies to comply. Recently, to ensure the earnest handling of this work, another directive was issued yesterday to all subordinate agencies that, in the future, when encountering personnel dismissed due to cases, in addition to reporting them in the ten-day report form for the appointment, dismissal, transfer, and adjustment of officials at all levels, a special report should also be submitted to this government simultaneously with the issuance of the dismissal order to ensure prompt notification.

### The Sixth Bao of the Fourteenth District Requests Establishment of a Vegetable Market

Feng Dianbin, Bao Chief of the Sixth Bao of the Fourteenth District (Zhabei) of this city, Hu Liang, representative of the district residents, and Xu Liansheng, a resident of the district, stated that before the war, Zhabei had densely packed houses, numerous shops, and a prosperous market, no less than Binan. There were originally five publicly operated vegetable markets: Gonghe Road, Changan Road, Wuzhen Road, Gongyi Lane, and the Daxing Vegetable Market on Zhongxing Road. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, public and private buildings were completely stolen and dismantled by the enemy and puppets. Since the victory, the market has recovered, and the population has increased, but the necessary vegetable markets are lacking. Recently, vendors have been setting up stalls along Nanxing Road, which obstructs hygiene and traffic. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the district office yesterday, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, requesting permission to establish public vegetable markets as soon as possible to benefit residents and improve the appearance of the city.

Actively Prevent Epidemics

The Fifteenth District Office (North Station) of this city has been ordered to use the Baojia organization to actively promote epidemic prevention work.

Recently, the district's executive secretary, together with the heads of various departments, drafted a report on the first half of the year's work and a work plan for the future. Once drafted, it will be submitted to the Municipal Government and presented to the District Residents' Representative Assembly for review.

Investigating Filled Wells

Within the Nineteenth District (Ganlin) of this city, there are more than 150 earth wells. Among them, 44 wells have turbid water quality and are unsuitable for use. The district office dispatched staff member Zhang Peifang to supervise, instructing each Guan Baojia chief to find ways to fill the wells. Other wells with suitable structures are to be disinfected daily by the Health Office to improve the hygiene of drinking water.

### Tong Xingbai and Others Host Autonomous Personnel from the Third District

Answer: When no one in the entire family has reached the legal age, the relative with the closest kinship shall be the head of the household. If there are no relatives, the Baojia chief shall temporarily be the applicant and the head of the household shall be left blank.

(2) Question: When the declarant does not know the date of birth of an absent person during the investigation, or only knows their age but not their birth month and day, how should it be investigated and filled in?

Answer: According to Article 29 of the Household Registration Law, if the date of birth of an absent person is not known, the reason can be noted in the remarks column and omitted. If only their age is known but not their birth month and day, when calculating their actual age, the provisions of Article 124 of the Civil Code can be followed: if the birth month and day are not known, July 1st shall be used; if the birthday is not known, the 15th of the month shall be used.

However, the total export value of this city in May has increased to 11.1 billion yuan, which is nearly twofold compared to the total export value of 4 billion yuan in April. This is indeed a good phenomenon amidst the sluggish export business. Proportionally speaking, the import and export figures for this city in May are approximately in the ratio of eight to one. In terms of value, cotton still leads in the imports of this city in May, reaching 44.7 billion yuan. Next is gasoline, accounting for approximately 3.2 billion yuan.

### Many Profiteers Take Profits; Stocks Fall Again

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were initially firm but then weakened. The process was extremely chaotic, with fierce struggles between both sides. The bullish side advanced and sold intermittently, making it difficult to predict. During the peak times, Yongsheng Yarn reached a new high of 735 yuan, Meiya 5170 yuan, Jingfu 330 yuan, Xinguang 325 yuan, and Qinxing 245 yuan. The situation suddenly became miserable near noon, with a large release of chips and a sharp decline, showing signs of no one maintaining them. Yongsheng Yarn fell to 650 yuan, Meiya to 4450 yuan, Jingfu to 275 yuan, Xinguang to 265 yuan, and Qinxing to 205 yuan. The market rebounded slightly at noon. As a result, Yongsheng Yarn fell slightly compared to the previous close, Meiya fell by half a percent, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about ten percent. Small and medium-sized unpopular stocks initially stabilized and then retreated, also showing slight declines in the end. The veteran stocks were high and then low, but still rose slightly in the end. The ask prices rose slightly after the close.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were initially firm but then weakened. Many profiteers took profits, and high prices were difficult to sustain. In addition, the Chinese stock market retreated, making it even more difficult to rally. Yisha gradually fell from the high price of 11,300 yuan and Yinglian from 11,500 yuan, reaching low prices near noon. As a result, although Yisha, Yinglian, and Asia fell, the declines were not large. Yeguang Paper and Jardine Matheson fell by about half a percent, Steel fell by ten percent, and Yipi remained flat.

Gold and Cash are Both Stable; Slightly Higher than the Previous Close

Yesterday, saffron fluctuated from flat to stable. In the early morning, it opened at 1.955 million. After the opening, the securities market was active and once saw a high price, retreating to a low of 1.945 million. Silver shops had a slight appetite for it, and then it stabilized. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 35 bars at a price of 1.955 million. After that, it fluctuated. At noon, the securities firms slightly replenished their positions, rising back to 1.975 million. It was slightly stable in the afternoon, but it was relatively quiet due to Saturday. As a result, it rose by 17,000 compared to the previous close. Ornaments were slightly higher, and fine silver and silver dollars were flat. The secret interest rate remained at around 1.2%.

Foreign currency was also initially flat and then stable. It opened at 2500 yuan to 2520 yuan in the morning. After the opening, it briefly showed weakness, but after 10:00 AM, it gradually rose from a buying price of 2490 yuan, rising to 2550 yuan at noon. It rose slightly in the afternoon, but trading was sluggish. As a result, it rose by 40 yuan compared to the previous close. The price ratio to gold was 774.5 yuan per ten taels, and the price ratio to British exchange was 3 yuan and 54 cents. Hong Kong millet was initially flat and then firm, and as a result, it rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange was still at 550 yuan to 560 yuan, Indian exchange was at 660 yuan to 670 yuan, British exchange was at 8800 to 9000, and the US exchange remained largely unchanged.

### Government Bond Trading is Quiet

Yesterday, government bonds remained deserted, with less than one million yuan in transactions. Tongbing initially retreated from 840 yuan to 820 yuan. Near noon, it slightly replenished its positions, rising back to 870 yuan before stabilizing. The overall trend was stable. Dingzhong was the same. Jiayi and Wu struggled slightly, and the results were slightly lower.

### Ordering is Not as Good as Receiving Cash

Hardware is Cheaper than American Prices

According to authorities in the import and export industry, a large number of American goods have recently arrived at the port, and there are many buyers. The reason is that the prices of American goods have increased dramatically, and the arrival dates are generally not accurate. It is better to purchase spot goods in this city. Also, the prices of American hardware such as hinges and screws exceed those of domestic products. Before the war, these items were exported to the Nanyang Islands and other areas, and they had a good reputation. Although wages have increased sharply, the prices are still lower than those in the United States.

### Edible Oil Distribution Resumes Next Wednesday

The China Vegetable Oil Factory, in order to improve delivery efficiency, reorganized the original numbering of Jia, Yi, and Bing groups, each with 200 oil shops, that rotated to distribute edible oil. It has been decided to resume the distribution system next Wednesday. Each household will still be limited to one barrel, containing three and a half dans. Prices will be announced on the same day, and goods will be delivered the next day. To save time, checks will be used instead of promissory notes. According to yesterday's market oil prices, each dan is priced at 61,000 yuan, which is the same price when the factory started distribution on March 20. It is also understood that since the factory temporarily suspended distribution on the 8th of this month, it has been gradually selling a total of several thousand dans of edible oil on the market every day.

### Asphalt Market Trend is Slightly Weak; Future Outlook Remains Stable

Since the return of tight money, the rising trend of asphalt has stopped abruptly. In recent days, due to the reduced demand for soap, transactions have not been as active as in previous weeks. As traders have sufficient stock on hand, they are all thinking of selling, and the market has turned into a state of oversupply. The situation is slightly weak. However, this is only a temporary trend, because the inventory in various places is very low. The Zhejiang road market is showing strong momentum, and the Hanshi market is also very stable. Therefore, although the situation in this city is weak, it is not easy to expect a decline. The market is still expected to be stable, and the sales plans of various firms have not changed. The prices are listed below: Heben asphalt 85,000 yuan, Neiping asphalt 80,000 yuan, Duzhu 78,000 yuan, Diqian asphalt 75,000 yuan, ordinary Lan asphalt 72,000 yuan, and Macheng asphalt 70,000 yuan.

### New Record for American Cotton Prices; Highest Price in 23 Years

[Reuters, New York, 20th] The New York cotton market was very stable when it opened yesterday, but it soon became volatile and rose sharply. Due to selling, prices once retreated, but were limited, and the market became active again.

[Associated Press, New York, 19th] The New York cotton market rose sharply today due to outside competition, and prices set a 23-year record.

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The Senate has passed the repeal of cotton control, and the bill is now being sent to the White House for signing.

### Central Sand White Sold at Fixed Price; Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan Sugar Transported Continuously

[Our Report] Yesterday, the tight sugar market did not weaken, and green sugar continued to rise. Chao Gang opened the market for eight packages of "Tizhuang Qing" at 90,000 yuan, "Chong Ti Qing" at 88,000 to 89,000 yuan, up 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, dozens of packages of Huanggang Qing at 86,000 yuan, and two or thirty packages of "Ci Chao Qing" at 81,000 yuan. Jian Gang opened the market for 60 packages of "Diao Qing" at 86,000 yuan. Yesterday was the day for the fixed-price sale of Zhongsha White. All those who applied for the sixth phase at 80,000 yuan were sold at 86,000 yuan, with buyer's proof documents for verification.

Also, it is reported that more than 40,000 packages were shipped from Taipei by the Taiwan Wheel, and 15,000 packages were also transported by the China Merchants Bureau's Yan Yue Wheel, which arrived in Shanghai earlier. It is said that not only is Taiwan sugar arriving continuously, but also Fujian and Guangdong sugar are arriving in Shanghai in succession, although sugar prices remain high.

It is reported that the seventh phase of Taiwan edible sugar will be directly distributed by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to more than 600 South Goods and Tea Food stores in this city. The responsible persons of the respective trade associations have twice discussed the implementation methods with the Social Affairs Bureau in the past two days. It is said that it can be realized in the near future. According to Director Gu of the Economic Administration Department of the bureau, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has now allowed the price to be 75,000 yuan per dan and is currently working on negotiating the retail price. The Taiwan sugar that each store plans to apply for this week (i.e., the first time) is approximately 3,000 packages, and the prices are still being considered.

### New Source of Timber; Philippine Islands Resumes Exports

[Reuters, Manila, 20th] In early 1946, there were 12 sawmills in the Philippine Islands, producing 120,000 feet per day, approximately 12% of pre-war production. Although the output of these sawmills is all for the needs of the Philippine Islands, at the end of 1946, several of these factories, after adopting a double-shift system, will be able to resume a small number of exports. This may become a small source for the current timber shortage in China.

Also, it is reported that yesterday's timber market was sluggish for foreign pine, and the price of fir was also depressed. Recently, Hongxing brand red willow boards have been popular, because many short bungalows on the market use this board as doors.

### Export Tea Prices are Difficult to Approach; Medium-Grade Domestic Goods are Most Popular; Tunxi Stock is Difficult to Sell

Yesterday, Tianjin Gang and others were actively buying and selling Baozhong green tea from Xiang Xiao Ke Gang. However, the supply of high-quality teas is still available, while the inventory of medium-grade goods is thinner. Sellers are insisting on their prices, and the market is slightly rising. Other domestic sales of various varieties have not decreased, and there is not much change in the market situation. In the foreign tea market, Indian merchant Yulong Yangxing has inspected and bargained for Taiwan Medium Red, but the price offered is below 50,000 yuan per dan, while the seller requires a price above that, so whether the transaction will be successful is still being negotiated. As for Wenzhou Xinzhenmei, exporters continue to purchase it at the original price.

The Tunxi tea market has been unusually quiet recently. Tea companies have very little appetite. Currently, Xia Hongqing (Zicha) is 110,000 to 120,000 yuan per dan, Zhenglu Maocha (spring tea) is 100,000 to 110,000 yuan per dan, and second-class tea is 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Tea merchants and tea vendors have about 2,000 dans of Maocha that have not been sold. Foreign companies such as the Great China Tea Company, Xinghua Company, Anhui Company, Dadi Tea Factory, and other private tea companies have accumulated hundreds of dans of Maocha and have not yet started refining. According to general observations, if foreign companies do not improve, they may switch to producing domestic tea.

### Foreign Xian Rice Declines Across the Board; Early Rice Enters the Market at 60,000

Yesterday, the total registration of goods in the North and South rice markets reached 11,715 shi, including 7,128 shi in the North market, 4,063 shi in the South market, and 524 shi transported and sold by rice companies themselves. The decline in the South market was particularly strong, with early rice entering the market at 60,000 yuan. Foreign Xian rice declined across the board by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. In the North market, high-quality Buxian rice was slightly better, and Baiyuan also showed vitality.

Flour remained at a tentative price. Bran was firm. Wheat digestion in various ports was still moving but not prosperous, and prices were being raised sharply. Broad beans were flat, while medium and low-grade goods fell sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Raw kernels and sesame were similar. Soybeans were mediocre. Oil prices stopped rising and turned down, retreating by a little over a thousand yuan. Distribution oil has been issued, and demand has turned weak. Digestion in various ports has also stopped, and the situation is becoming weaker. Soybean cake, which is used for fertilizing fields, has a firm trend.

### American Tung Oil Production Increases Greatly; British Price is £235 Per Ton

[Reuters, London, 20th] The current tung oil stock in the UK has reached a dangerously low level. In order to quickly remedy this situation, the Supply Department has been searching the market for Far East tung oil. For several periods, the UK purchased Far East tung oil at a price of £214 per ton, but Chinese exporters are still insisting on £235 per ton. Currently, China's tung oil production has shrunk to a quarter of the pre-war annual production. However, after a large amount of oil is put on the market, the current high price level is expected to fall. In recent years, there have been several developments in other oil sources. Among them, the tung fruit industry in the American Gulf Coast and Brazil has progressed rapidly, and production has tripled. The progress of production in Brazil is also very satisfactory. If all tung trees can bear fruit, the quantity exported to the United States is expected to be very large.

### Yarn Market Stabilizes; Cotton Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable, and customers' appetite opened up slightly. People's hearts also saw stability. 20s yarns recovered by 10,000 to 20,000, but transactions were still sparse.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegram rose again by 10 to 22 points, with near-term US$35.80 and long-term US$35.90. The spot price of Metrin hit a new peak of US$36.47. Due to the depletion of stock in this city, the market has continued to rise. Tongyi Yarn Factory and Changre Wuxi and other small factories have slightly replenished their stock, but transactions seemed dull due to Saturday. Prices still rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

### New Look of the Ancient Capital

— Special Dispatch from Xi'an by Our Correspondent Li Chi on the 10th

The ancient capital of Chang'an witnessed brilliant days in politics and culture during the Zhou, Qin, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Unfortunately, it gradually declined, sometimes almost becoming a relic in the Wei River basin between the mountains and plateaus. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, this ancient city stood firm, like a revival without official recognition, rivaling those "nouveau riches." Its population suddenly increased from less than 200,000 to 400,000. In the late period of the War of Resistance after the Central Plains Campaign, it almost exceeded 500,000. After the victory last autumn, some residents continued to move eastward, temporarily reducing the population by tens of thousands. But then, unexpectedly, the population began to increase daily. According to the latest statistics, the urban population has exceeded 510,000 and shows signs of further growth.

Digging Cave Dwellings, Pulling Carts as Laborers

The current situation is probably due to three reasons: During the recovery period, many people originally from Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces remained here due to "disrupted transportation." Also, many people were unwilling or dared not return due to unrest in their hometowns. Although the eastern section of the Longhai Railway is still open, many people from Henan are still hesitant, especially those from the flooded areas of the Yellow River. They would rather continue to borrow a corner of this ancient city wall, dig a cave dwelling to live in, with the men pulling carts and working as laborers, and the women washing and mending clothes for others. Life is tough, but they still seem satisfied: "Sir, are you telling us to return to our hometown? What would we eat and what would we do back there? Our fields and houses are still under the water! The Yellow River, with such a rush... We can still manage here..."

Returning Home, Returning to Chang'an Again

Would you find this ridiculous? Many people who ran from Xi'an back to their hometowns have now run back to Xi'an again. They are mostly because the political situation in their hometowns has changed, public security has not been restored, and livelihoods are gradually unsustainable. Anyway, they have been accustomed to being displaced outside for many years, so they look to return to Xi'an, this second hometown. Here, they think there are more solutions. There are also people from the lower Yangtze who have taken their entire families back to Xi'an, reasoning that the cost of living here is lower and easier to manage. There are also some passers-by who have been sent from the west via the Longhai Railway, who stop here, inquire, and temporarily hesitate to move forward. With these kinds of people, how can the population of Xi'an not increase? But we must point out that this is an abnormal phenomenon, a reflection of many major problems in China today.

More Women than Men, Large-Scale Women's Movement Unfolds

In this new statistic of over 510,000 residents, what's interesting is that there are more men than women, with men outnumbering women by one-tenth.

However, in the last month or two, under various forms of support and encouragement, the women's movement is unfolding daily for these female citizens, who are less than half the population in number. Women from all walks of life have participated in a women's movement training class. Following that, the Provincial Women's Association was established on the ninth of this month, and several core members of the Xi'an women's movement put in a lot of effort. Currently, the association includes representatives from 52 counties (Note: There are a total of 99 counties and one city of all sizes in Shaanxi Province). It is worth noting that some representatives clearly come from factories and rural areas. They will certainly not be "decorative items" of the urban women's movement. May they work hard to fight for the well-being of their sisters in factories and farms.

New Grain on the Market, Flour Prices Rise

As mentioned earlier, one reason for the increase in Xi'an's population is that the cost of living here is relatively low. In fact, this is only relatively speaking, and the difference is gradually shrinking, especially since mid-June. Taking flour as an example: At the end of May and the beginning of June, each bag was only 5,000 to 6,000, but in mid-June, it rose to around 8,000, and then continued to rise. Currently, machine-made flour is selling for about 12,500 yuan per bag. There are several points worth noting in this round of food price increases: The period when it started to rise was not a "lean" month, but precisely when the new wheat was on the market. Generally speaking, although the dry-land harvest in the Wei River and Jing River basins this year was not bountiful, the average statistics show that the harvest volume was more than 70% or 80%. We have no reason to blame artificial manipulation on the unkindness of the heavens. There is a clear fact that proves that the rise in grain prices first started with the price of flour in the city, especially in Xi'an. After a short period, it then pulled up the price of wheat in the countryside. If the price increase was due to a poor harvest, it should have been the wheat price that rose first, which then led to an increase in the cost of flour.

Exposing the False Pretense, "Grain Shortage" Is Not a Shortage

At that time, some people attributed it to insufficient transportation capacity on the Longhai Railway, because the railway bureau was rushing to repair a section of the railway between Shanzhou and Luoyang, transporting road repair materials, and could not free up enough freight cars to transport wheat into the city. This is a fact, but it should not be the main reason for causing such a significant result, because the new wheat in the city and nearby countryside, which does not require railway transportation, was sufficient and more than enough at this time.

Wheat and flour, at this time and in this place, definitely do not have "shortage worries." The flour mills and grain stores are full of inventory. The "newly emerging" small flour shops are everywhere. A soy sauce and grocery store "expanding its business" by adding a few bags of flour to sell in front of the store is still acceptable. But when you see small hotels, small inns, and even consignment shops piling up bags of flour at the entrance to join in the fun, people worried about a "grain shortage" can rest assured, and the false pretense of the so-called "grain shortage" should be exposed.

Of course, the fluctuation of grain prices has had an impact on the lives of the 510,000 citizens, especially government employees after the cessation of in-kind grain rations. There is no longer a direct "chain proportion" between their income and the rise and fall of prices. However, on the other hand, if we take grain prices as the benchmark to extrapolate the prices of other commodities in the past six months, it is not difficult to understand how strong the purchasing power of customers from the countryside is in the cloth market and even in "silver shops."

People from the Lower Yangtze Eat Recklessly, Almost Ruining Their Stomachs

A lady from the lower Yangtze region, who came from Shanghai, ate pork recklessly in Xi'an to the point of almost ruining her stomach. She said that the money used to buy one catty of meat in Shanghai could buy two catties in Xi'an. Beef is only 600 yuan per catty, and mutton is less than 500 yuan, "cheap." Speaking of clothing, taking 20-count yarn as the standard, yarn produced in Shaanxi has recently fluctuated around 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan, which is not much different from the Shanghai market. The prices of cloth and cotton fabrics have recently been only about 20% to 30% higher than those in Shanghai, due to the increasing convenience of transportation from the east, which is significantly lower and more stable compared to grain prices.

Thinking back to when grain prices began to rise, some gentlemen and elders with a "sense of morality" ran around appealing, hoping that this ancient capital could "preserve a pure land" while other provinces were experiencing inflation and famine. Unfortunately, the "pass" of Guanzhong has long become a historical relic, and their efforts were ultimately in vain. However, thanks to the heavens, Xi'an is still a "blessed land" on the "price contour map" of major cities across the country. Thus, the 510,000 citizens can live here in peace.

### Turning the Decayed into the Miraculous

After reading Mr. Canglong's feature article "Don't Be Afraid of Too Much Garbage, Waste Can Be Put to Good Use" yesterday, I couldn't help but deeply agree. However, I feel that it hasn't been fully explained, so I'll briefly contribute my humble opinion below.

Shanghai's garbage reaches about 2,000 tons per day, which is a shocking number. If we can come up with a thorough and fundamental method of disposal, dividing the city's garbage into five major categories: (1) animal waste, (2) plant waste, (3) cloth scraps and paper scraps, (4) tin cans and waste cans, and (5) coal cinder and mud ash, it would be best to add a category for broken glass. If we can go through such a practical separation, it can be said that none of it is superfluous. For example, the output of the (1) and (2) categories of garbage is particularly large, but its uses are also particularly broad, because this kind of garbage can all be used as fertilizer. If the bone waste of animals can be made into a large amount of bone meal, it is the most valuable fertilizer because the components contained in bone meal are most essential to the nutritional needs of plants, and are indispensable base fertilizers for fruit trees, crops, flowers, vegetables, etc. Because there is no bone meal production in the near suburbs of Shanghai, it is rarely used. In other places, bone meal is a major fertilizer. Now that there is a large amount of bone waste, a bone meal manufacturing plant can be established. As for plant waste such as vegetable roots, it can be used for composting, which is also the most suitable base fertilizer or top dressing. It is not only a nutrient for plants, but also promotes soil improvement. At this time when the rural economy is extremely difficult and fertilizer is lacking, it is even more necessary. In the past, most of the fertilizer needed by farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai was supplied by soybean cake from the Grand Canal. Since the war, transportation has been inconvenient and the source is lacking, resulting in reduced production. Now, using waste, two tons of compost can be used as one piece of soybean cake. Assuming that there are a thousand tons of compost per day, then 500 jin of soybean cake can be produced in one day, which amounts to a huge 180,000 pieces per year. The current market price of soybean cake is more than 5,000 yuan per piece, and its value is considerable. The value of bone meal is also quite considerable. (3) and (4) categories, as well as broken glass, can all be restored to manufacture. This kind of product is especially needed due to the lack of raw materials. As for (5) coal cinder and mud ash, it can also be of great use. The roads in various places, after eight years of the War of Resistance, have been damaged due to disrepair for many years. At this time of restoration and construction, road construction is the most essential and important work, but there is a lack of raw materials. Like the previous use of Japanese prisoners of war to step up construction, the local soil was used for temporary filling, but after the rain, it was still unusable. Now that there is this kind of coal cinder and mud ash, it can be transported to various places for repair to facilitate transportation.

From this point of view, Shanghai's garbage not only has a fundamental method of disposal, but can also have multiple benefits in one fell swoop. Why not do it?

### Chickens and Ducks Fill the Lanes

My relatives live in a lane, but their neighbors are chicken and duck dealers. Dozens of cages of chickens and ducks are sold out in less than half a day, but the remaining dirt and odor are never cleaned up, until the new dirt and new odor of the third batch of chickens and ducks arrives! In the past, most of the chicken and duck dealers were located along the Jiangbian area of ​​the Bund. After the war, the Tianjin North Migration became the situation today, but in a densely populated lane, it is related to public health. I hope the authorities will find some more appropriate places to let them gather markets so that the residents of the lane have difficulties in declaring it. (Shi Sheng)

Weekly Forum

### Two Points Suggested to the Government

— Lu Shihao

(I) Saving the Dying Countryside

Before the war, the Chinese countryside, after suffering all kinds of blows, was already facing the danger of collapse. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the areas that experienced war disasters were both destroyed by the war and suffered from the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes. In the rear areas, the meager wages of a large number of conscripts, the supply of huge amounts of military grain, coupled with the threat of famine, have turned the entire countryside from critically ill to a path of death.

The destruction suffered by the Chinese countryside due to war is unprecedented in history, but never has the situation been as terrible as it is today. Take the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's revolution as an example. More than ten years of turmoil should be considered a "war disaster" of considerable duration. However, because the war in the past did not suffer the high degree of destruction and oppression from the Japanese invaders as it has in these eight years, and the areas that did not experience war disasters did not make such huge "contributions" to the country as they have in this war, after a certain period of time, those wounds were healed as usual under "artificial potential."

But today, the countryside, which was already extremely weak before the war, coupled with eight years of suffering, can no longer rely solely on those "artificial potentials" to allow time to naturally bring about recovery.

Will the government let these dangerous signs take their natural course, watching the entire countryside die or brewing a "complication"? Or will it think of a solution?

We believe that we must work hard to get rid of all terrible phenomena. There is only one way here, and that is: the government must take all responsibility, treat the entire countryside as the object, and formulate a strict method and mechanism to prescribe the right medicine for the disease.

Analyzing the current ailments of the countryside, they are: the lack of farming tools and seeds, the lack of funds, the harshness of land tax collection in kind and borrowing, and the exploitation of corrupt officials. The source of this series of ailments is only one: the government has never had a good system and mechanism.

Let's talk about the lack of farming tools and seeds first, which is an inevitable state after all disasters occur. In the past, farmers had the ability to replenish purchases or borrow money to replenish, because taxes were not as heavy as they are today. They could repay it after one or two years of hard work, but today it is different. The government must collect in kind, and they also know that debts such as "borrowing grain from empty granaries" and "borrowing money for oil and rice" with repayments of one for three are a way to quench thirst with poison. They therefore abandon farming, flee to the cities, and become beggars.

China's national banks organize agricultural loans every year. But these banks want collateral, and they don't trust those real farmers who are eager for "funds" to turn things around. As a result, this batch of funds all falls into the hands of special classes in the countryside. These special classes are already old hands at exploiting farmers. Now they borrow a sum of money at a low interest rate, which only increases their capital for exploitation. In this way, in the rural social class, those who enjoy the benefits without labor become richer, while those who work hard become poorer?

Secondly, harsh government is as fierce as a tiger, and is the most fatal wound. Regardless of the amount of harvest, collecting four dou of grain per mu, plus requisitioning and military grain purchases, will be a death warrant for the countryside. China will always be a country without statistics. The government does not know how many mu of land there are in each province and each county, how much output there is, how much military grain needs to be supplied, and how to solve and remedy it in famine years. They don't know how much surplus grain may still be available in a certain place. For the supply of military grain, they launch a whirlwind-like purchase, and one wave comes after another. The people who grow the grain have no rice to eat, and the unfair pricing makes it impossible for them to even buy other substitutes to fill their stomachs.

Under this dark and disorderly system, a group of corrupt officials get rich, while farmers who have worked hard for several years suffer even more unspeakable hardships!

Therefore, we would like to suggest prescribing the right medicine:

First of all, what should be adjusted is the rate of return between landlords and tenants. At present, the "profit sharing rate" between landlords and tenants in the countryside is about 40/60, 60/40, or 50/50. That is, the landlord's income is 40%, 60%, or half of the harvest. Under this kind of "unearned income," the landlord's investment interest is really too high. We should first reform this abnormal status quo.

Let us explore a new distribution rate, which is: cultivator, 50%; government, 35%; landlord, 15%. With this distribution rate, the landlord suffers a loss. But based on the principle of "land to the tiller," the government's policy of buying land and distributing it to farmers must be implemented. However, given the Chinese government's economic distress, when can it actually be implemented? If the government forcibly buys land and pays the landlords with public bonds, it may cause social unrest in China, because China is different from other countries. Most of the land is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, but is scattered in the hands of countless "small bourgeoisie." Forcible purchase without paying cash may have a drastic impact on the economy of the majority of people, bringing about all kinds of unrest. Therefore, there is only this method, which on the one hand lowers the income of landlords and alleviates some of the pain of cultivators, and on the other hand slows down the trend of land concentration, reduces the interest in investing in rural land, and achieves the goal of land to the tiller.

There is also a malady in the countryside that must be eradicated at present, and that is the profit-seeking of "sub-tenants." Many people obtain permanent tenancy rights to considerable land from landlords, but they do not engage in cultivation themselves, but sublet it to tenants. As a result, in addition to paying rent to the landlord, the tenants also need to offer a portion of the harvest to the "sub-tenants." This is really the most intolerable phenomenon. Therefore, we must merge tenants and cultivators into one, so that even permanent tenancy rights are limited to a specified number. Permanent tenancy rights that exceed this number should be taken back by the landlord and given to the actual cultivators in recent years.

At the same time, in order to turn cultivators into actual owner-farmers, the government can stipulate a law, that is, after the promulgation of the "New Cultivation Law," if a tenant has obtained cultivation rights for five years, he may purchase the land from the landlord at any time. The price is based on the sum of the landlord's income over the past five years as the standard. The method is as follows:

(Number of harvests in five years × landlord's income) × rice price = land price

Assuming that the total income per mu in five years is five shi, and the local rice price at the time of purchase is 50,000 yuan per shi, then

(5 shi × 15%) × 50,000 = 0.75 shi × 50,000 = 37,500 yuan

Such a law makes non-cultivators dare not invest in rural land again, and can also avoid landlords from being angry and refusing to sell their land. On the landlord's side, it is equivalent to receiving five years of benefits first, and they are also happy to sell. However, the land price should be paid in one lump sum, so as not to split the landlord's economy.

With this distribution rate, the government will levy a tax on the main crops once a year on land that is cultivated twice a year, and appropriately add a low rate of levy in places that are cultivated three times a year.

Before the war, the land tax was only five to one dou. If we follow the current collection rate, then in a bumper year, the yield per mu of land can be as high as one shi and two dou, and the government's 35% income will reach more than four dou, which cannot be said to be not generous. Therefore, under this high rate of collection, the government should make every effort to help farmers. On the one hand, it increases the income of farmers, and on the other hand, the government also increases its income accordingly, benefiting each other.

Now let us try to set up a new agricultural food agency for the government to adapt to this new law and environment:

Ministry of Agriculture and Food - Provincial Agricultural and Food Management Office -

Crop Research Institute

Fertilizer Factory

Farm Tool Factory

Cultivated Land Expansion Committee

Granary Tax Management Office (County)

Agricultural Supervision Office (District)

Transportation Bureau

Mediation Committee

Merging the countryside and the Ministry of Food into one can streamline the agency and facilitate work. (The fishing income work of a part of the Ministry of Agriculture can establish a fishing income department to adapt to China's needs.) In the future, the person in charge of the work is the province, and the agencies below the province will truly take responsibility for improving everything in the countryside.

At present, the Chinese countryside still uses ancient farm tools and feces as fertilizer, which reduces the amount of harvest. Therefore, the Crop Research Institute should take the responsibility of improving seeds and cultivation methods. At the same time, the products of the farm tool and fertilizer factories are best distributed to farmers free of charge, or sold with subsidies, and paid in installments without interest.

The most important part in the future is the Agricultural Supervision Office, which will be responsible for directly guiding and supervising farmers' cultivation, with the district above the county as the unit, and directly responsible to the province. The reason for being directly responsible to the province is that many institutions in China have more layers and more exploitation. In the future, the distribution of farm tools, fertilizers, or seeds will be implemented by the Supervision Office. If an extra layer of organization is set up in counties above the district, the malpractice of exploitation may occur.

Because collection in kind is necessary, a County Granary Tax Management Office is set up to manage the land tax in peacetime and to be responsible for the storage of grain during collection.

At present, many people are against the system of collection in kind, saying that it is too harsh. But we believe that the government will have to buy military grain anyway, so rather than a whirlwind-like agency, we hope that the government will use collection in kind to meet the needs of the army. At present, the land tax revenue is 70% for the local government and 30% for the central government, so the military grain is purchased within the collection in kind, which is nothing more than a "transfer transaction" between the government, and will not be harsh on the people.

What needs to be reformed in the collection in kind is the change in transportation and weights and measures. In the past, the grain collected often required the people to send it hundreds of miles away, and the harassment along the way and the difficulties of the grain collectors made the people feel extremely painful, which made the collection in kind condemned as harsh government. In order to avoid these malpractices, granaries should be built by the county, and the collected rice should be handed over by the people for storage, and the adjustment and transportation should be entrusted to the Adjustment Committee and the Transportation Bureau. At the same time, the instruments of weights and measures should be revised several times to avoid malpractices from arising from this.

In this way, the relationship between the government, landlords, and farmers becomes not a relationship of paying taxes, but a group of joint investors. Farmers are those who use labor as capital, and the government is responsible for adjusting and managing all expenditures. Therefore, both parties have more income, and landlords are like investors who do not care about things, and can only sit back and receive less dividends.

Through this agency, the government can know the total amount of harvest in the year, so it can plan comprehensively how to remedy in famine years and how to maintain in bumper years. At the same time, using the reports of the District Agricultural Supervision Office, it can directly provide loans to farmers, and know in detail the soil quality in the area, so that farmers can invest appropriately in a certain crop. The expansion and guidance of agricultural leisure production can also be based on evidence and actually carried out.

We do not approve of unified control of the rice in the hands of farmers, and allow free trading by the people. However, for the convenience of adjustment, cooperatives can be organized with the county as the unit. All the rice in the county is handled by the cooperatives, and a commission is slightly taken to subsidize the handicraft products supplied by the cooperatives, so that farmers can obtain fair and fair supply when purchasing. In this way, the number of stored grain in a county is known in detail, so that the tragedy of forced purchase of military grain will not occur.

The above is based on rice, but it can be applied to other products by analogy.

The government's final and greatest responsibility is to maintain the exchange rate between crops and handicraft products (see the next chapter), so that the price of rice will not sometimes stimulate and increase the price with handicraft products, or the grain will be cheap and hurt the farmers, and there is a risk of a sharp price drop in bumper years.

We hope that the government will face reality, especially when the Communist Party is strongly redistributing land, it must compare plans, consider and implement them, and demand that those who extend the "hands of malpractice" of non-"investors" be executed at any time during the execution!

(II) Looking at Industry from the "China Textile" Surplus

Following the pace of the countryside's death, China's industry is also approaching the brink of collapse. The influx of a large number of foreign goods, under the conditions of cheap and good quality, coupled with the Chinese people's craze for worshipping foreign goods, if this crisis is not prevented, we can assert that capitalists and workers will definitely not happily spend the second New Year after this victory!

At the 301st meeting of the Legislative Yuan on June 8, the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Wang Yunwu, reported on the surplus of the China Textile Construction Company in recent months, saying that "China Textile" had a surplus of 9 billion yuan in April and 14 billion yuan in May, and may gradually increase in the future. How was this huge surplus obtained? Wang did not explain, he only used these numbers to answer the "anxiety" of some committee members. From the beginning to the present, "China Textile" has been criticized for "competing with the people for profit," "bureaucratic capital," and "leading price increases." Although many people have defended the government's good intentions and the inaccuracy of price increases, these surpluses have exposed some of its weaknesses and shown a path to industrial rebirth.

Many people blame "China Textile" for leading price increases, which is wrong. We can definitely say that if "China Textile" were handed over to private management, no matter what, it would definitely not have so much profit. We should know that "China Textile" is using its superior conditions as a state-owned enterprise to obtain many opportunities to reduce costs. At a certain period, if China Textile did not increase prices, it might cause those private factories to close down completely in an uncompetitive situation. For this reason, coupled with the desire to use the surplus to make up for the national treasury, it had to shoulder the condemnation of "leading price increases."

However, the surplus of "China Textile" is of no help in making up for the imbalance of finance. On the contrary, handing over the "preferential treatment" of China Textile to private management and expanding it, and reducing prices to curb the rise in living standards, can achieve the dual harvest of curbing inflation and saving the industrial crisis.

At present, the black market price of coal per catty is quite different from the price of coal supplied by the Fuel Committee. But the current supply of coal per catty is sufficient to maintain. Why not supply general factories with "official price" coal? Therefore, we propose that all factory necessities that the government can supply at parity prices be distributed to various factories, and for those who rely on overseas, the government will settle foreign exchange at a lower rate to reduce costs.

In order for everyone to concentrate their efforts to fight, and to avoid merchant violence, we suggest that the government divide the country into several industrial zones, forcibly merge the factories in the zone, and make them into an organization that the Japanese used to call "integrated," and at the very least, each factory should establish an "organization" for joint procurement of raw materials and distribution of markets, in order to concentrate and exert strength and avoid the internal competition of domestic manufacturers.

Japan implemented such a plan in Taiwan and North China, using all its strength to strive for a goal. However, we do not need to learn from Japan's "colonial" squeeze, nor do we call on capitalists to form "trusts" or "syndicates." "Colonial" squeeze is to build the foundation of imperialism by sacrificing the blood and sweat of others. Capitalists' "trusts" and "syndicates" are monopoly groups. We can supervise the cost of industrial products by the government, strongly implement price limits, and severely punish monopolists. In this way, neither the government nor the capitalists suffer losses. Capitalists certainly cannot get huge profits, but the crisis is gone. The government seems to have lost in subsidies, but the drop in prices is equal to the contraction of currency, and the biggest harvest is the people, who will no longer taste the pain of soaring prices. Why wouldn't the government be happy to do it?

When the government implements "price limits," it should fairly stipulate an interaction rate between industrial manufactured goods and rural crops. Many industrial raw materials are related to rural crops. Stipulating the exchange rate between the two crops can stabilize the rural economy on the one hand and avoid prices from sometimes stimulating each other and rising on the other hand. Take flour as an example. Recently, because of the reported increase in rice prices, urban flour merchants appropriately increased the price accordingly. But in fact, the raw material of flour - wheat, did not increase in price in the countryside. When the price of flour rises, the price of wheat also rises, leading to an unnecessary price increase. This is due to the government's lax management of industry. By closely monitoring the cost of factories and stipulating the exchange rate between industrial and agricultural products, this malpractice can be avoided.

Many people are clamoring to shorten the exchange rate in order to save the dying industry. But if the government cannot control industry and production, suddenly increasing the price of foreign exchange is harmful and useless. In the minds of the Chinese people, a psychology of "despising national currency" has been universally formed, and many industries are related to foreign exchange. Once the price of foreign exchange is increased, the cost of foreign goods increases, but everything rises accordingly. The people do not benefit from it, but suffer from it first. As for raising tariffs and restricting imports, they are not fundamental countermeasures to suppress foreign goods. There is only one way to give the factories supplies domestically at low prices as much as possible, to settle foreign exchange with manufacturers at low prices to purchase raw materials, to adapt the merged industrial organizations to the current environment, and to strictly supervise and avoid the realization of violence. Then, when these conditions have considerable results, increase the price of foreign exchange.

Is this strategy suitable for long-term application in China? That still needs to be decided depending on the situation in the future. However, in order to increase the interest of investors, under circumstances that permit, capitalists can be given higher profits (but on the principle of not harming the national economy), and it is stipulated that those profits must be invested in the generation of new industries.

Some people doubt whether the government can shoulder this heavy responsibility economically? That is impossible to explain. However, given China's current economic situation, no undertaking can be held! The situation has reached a point where it must change. This is like a person who cannot make ends meet. If he wants to purchase a necessary item, if he calculates in every possible way and hesitates, then he will not be able to purchase any items for himself. There is only one way, that is, when he feels that something is really necessary, buy it quickly, and force himself to find a way with the established fact. This is the best example when China wants to undertake something and economic doubts arise.

### White and Black

— Ren Yu

I deeply love white.

I love the color white because it represents purity and innocence.

Snow is beautiful because it is purely white and crystal clear. Cotton is beautiful because it is pure without a speck of dirt, and it contains unlimited warmth.

I love white swallows. I love their pure white feathers and their freely flying white wings. When I see them flying in the sky, I am as happy as a prisoner trapped in a dreary hell, suddenly seeing the sunlight and feeling immense comfort.

I love women in white. I love their white dresses fluttering in the air. When I see them, I immediately embrace them with my soul. I caress their white clothes, kiss their white skin, hold their white arms, and admire their clean, white teeth...

On snowy days, I wear white clothes and go out. I walk barefoot, letting my skin kiss the earth. In the vast white wilderness, I leave behind footprints. I pass through forests dressed in white and climb hills wearing white caps. I see a white plain and houses covered with a layer of white. Ah, I am excited to the point of madness. I proudly possess the white world.

I detest black.

I deeply detest the color black because it harbors disaster, meanness, and filth.

I detest the black feathers of crows and their annoying "caw, caw" sounds from the rooftops. They symbolize darkness and bring disaster to people. They are the friends of ugliness and the enemies of kindness.

I hate the black dogs that bark "woof, woof..." at the entrance. They often demonstrate against passersby who have no malicious intent, bully innocent and lively children, curse the loud songs that drift in the middle of the night, and bark madly at the poetic shadows of trees swaying beneath them. These purchased black dogs have no appreciation for beauty. Only in front of their masters do they basely wag their tails with their tongues lolling out, trying to please their masters.

I despise the black pigs lying in the mud. They never leave filth. They are friends of filth. They specialize in searching for food in dirty garbage piles. Their whole bodies contain countless seeds of filth. I abhor their stupid, lazy personalities, detest their self-proclaimed "beautiful" faces, and their pitch-black color.

I detest black flags, black clothes, black clouds... and all black colors in the world.

I especially hate those dyers who specialize in turning white things black. They are experts in manufacturing darkness. White clothes, white gloves, white socks, white cloths... all pure white things turn black in their hands. Their horrible black hands are truly worthy of curses.

Fortunately, bleaching powder exists in the world. It serves all lovers of white, washing any stained things clean.

I love white, and I will always embrace white.

I detest black, and I will bury black with the hoe of wisdom.

### Morning

— Wang Qi (carved/engraved - likely referring to a woodblock print accompanying the text)

### Aging

— Liu Jiagan

I don't know why, but recently, I often feel a sense of aging.

Looking at my appearance, my hair is still as black and smooth as lacquer. Not a single white hair appears on my head; on my forehead, "wrinkles of suffering" have not increased. My sideburns are still as neat as before, and the movement of my hands and feet has not become stiff at all... From all of this, I still retain the breath of youth. Where is the aging?

However, I do learn that I am aging—the shadow of aging grows deep in my heart.

I cannot estimate how heavy my heart is now (of course, it is much heavier than before), but I can detect the traces of its aging and feel the uneven scars on its surface. Not long ago, my heart was like a freshly cut piece of iron, the cut surface flashing with electric light, illuminating the hearts of others; however, after a year of wind and rain, patches of rust have covered the cut surface of the iron block. People are starting to feel unfamiliar with it, and the iron block itself has lost its dazzling brilliance.

My current mood is like that of a shepherd leading his flock home when dusk is falling, so desolate and lonely.

Exactly one year ago, I stepped out of the university gates. Due to circumstances, I had to run back and forth in the rolling sea of people like a calf.

If the encounters of people in the world can be divided into fortunate and unfortunate, then I can probably be said to belong to the former. Without using all my strength, I found a job. In this environment, I saw speculation, opportunism, amusement, and ease. Money is the soul, and enjoyment is above all else. My immature and innocent heart began to undergo a kind of baptism, a kind of exaggerated, hypocritical, and ultimately unfortunate influence; I felt that my mood was no longer as young as before. The sound of victory resounded throughout the heavens and the earth. In addition to my original duties, I also started working as a newspaper reporter at a newspaper and later switched to a magazine editor. At this time, I saw factions and infighting between people, no emotions, only exploitation; no courtesy, only tactics! Although I worked for only a very short period of time, I had seen enough. I didn't want to continue. I looked at my own heart and felt a sense of regret because it had aged a little more. Soon, I left Shanghai and went to a public institution to assist in the handover work. Here, piles of official documents chased away some of the vitality. The prevailing trend of emphasizing procedures over efficiency also changed my temperament a lot. I became cautious, prudent, timid, silent, and even learned some perfunctory skills. Although I was full of indignation at the darkness and corruption, the greatest fluctuation in my mood in the past eight months has probably been sadness over the aging of my heart.

Every time I returned to Shanghai, my friends patted me on the shoulder and said that I was much more "experienced." All I could answer them with was a silent bitter smile.

"Experienced?" Isn't that just a euphemism for "old at heart!"

Aging, aging! I am carrying this old age, and the pace of my steps also appears slow. I look forward to the future and feel a kind of embarrassing ridicule.

Am I really old?

On a certain midnight, I silently counted the past years: one year, two years... God: I am only twenty-five years old!

### Life, Music, Tears

— Shuwen

——One of Short Memories

Only a person who can truly love music with all their life can truly feel the existence of life in music.

I once saw a girl learning piano. When she shared two months with the piano and then sat down at the piano to play the exercises from two months ago, she realized that her skills had become rusty and declined. She painfully shed tears.

When I saw the crystal-clear tears glistening in a pair of large eyes filled with the brilliance of wisdom, and finally could not restrain them and fell onto the piano keys, I seemed to hear the tear drops on the luminous keys, eliciting a kind of sound that, although slight, could make the soul tremble.

"A beautiful diamond, people can see all the joys and sorrows of the world from within." When tears and the spirit of music melt together, music shines because of tears, and tears soar because of music.

I love those who can truly love music with all their lives because they truly understand life.

### Nostalgia

— Jingxing

For a friend whose life or death is uncertain

Do you remember eight years ago, on the moonlit Huangpu River bank, you leaned against the iron railing by the river, your bright dark eyes gazing at two or three small merchant ships, shining with faint lights, reflecting the rising night tide. You stared at the flowing water in a daze, and I stood aside gently stroking your shoulder.

Do you remember five years ago, when the enemy's iron hooves stepped into the southeastern half of the country, and the call for resistance reached its climax, you and I, with fragile hearts, escaped from the massacres of those crazy pirates, and stopped in the ancient wilderness of northern Hunan. We listened all day to news about the war. You were busy asking groups of refugees, later observers, about the situation in our hometown. I was busy writing letters, entrusting friends to find a job. You were so haggard and I was so thin:

Do you remember three years ago, the late Chengdu-Chongqing train boarded a ferry in the darkness and carried us across the Tuo River. The night was gloomy, and the Tuo River seemed even darker and boundless in the gloom. The faint lights on the opposite bank and the stars in the sky shimmered. We could vaguely see the smiles on each other's faces until our footprints were imprinted on the small town called Baimu. It seemed that under the carbide lamp, you were in a joyful mood. I happily peeled the last mandarin orange and shared half with you.

Do you remember a year ago, the dawn penetrated the top of the mountain, and in the early summer park, there were soft bird calls chirping among the trees. A cool morning breeze blew past us, and your temples were scattered. I quietly swept them up for you. In the morning air, the mountain city belonged to solitude. So we embraced in solitude.

In those long days, we depended on each other and traveled through half of the country. The artillery fire at the front line and the bombing in the rear could not take away our loving hearts. We will always live together! You said, and I also said, although when the news of victory came, for the sake of our aging parents at home, I agreed to your suggestion to return home alone because I knew that the organization I served would also move east in three months! If I had realized at that time that we would never see each other again, how could I have let you go alone?

You left for more than half a year without any news. Our organization was also stranded here due to traffic problems. For half a year, I have been busy inquiring about your news. Some people said they met you in Hankou, and some said they seemed to have seen you on the express train on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, but they couldn't be sure. I wrote letter after letter in confusion to your home, but the answer I received was always the four big characters written by your aging parents: "Not yet returned home."

Worry, disappointment, confusion, and depression have made me a completely pessimistic person. I resigned from my job and wandered around the gate of the shipping company all day, hoping that among the thousands of compatriots returning home, one day I would be able to go home as well. Let me rush back to my hometown, which I have been longing for for ten years, to see the truth. Although I know very well that the Yangtze River is turbulent, and if you really haven't returned home, I believe that you may have been buried in the whirlpools of the rapids.

May God bless you with peace! Before I have had time to rush back to my hometown to see you. June 25, 1946.

### Tears

— Mou

Anger and depression are forged into silence, forged into stubbornness.

Stubbornness can hold back tears, unwilling to fall easily. Pain, can clench teeth, heavy oppression, will risk heart to bear

The滔滔Jiang River; how浩荡, how majestic, and so温柔和舒畅. But, can't be塞获, look, it angry, it哮嚗, the whole world are tumbling.

Human emotions, are just the same.

Being able to laugh indulgently is happiness; being able to cry indulgently, this is also happiness.

Hypocritical laughter, restrained tears—these are all pain of pain.

Things in the world are not necessarily smooth; everyone's mood is often misunderstood, and tears cannot help you solve these, but with the washing of tears, it may be more frank and consoling.

If even this basic right is deprived, then the calm appearance contains a very complex and dangerous emotions.

Years leisurely.

Childhood is worthy of reminiscing and recalling.

I don't know when, half seems to be people's good intentions, half seems to be their own desire. Gradually became an adult.

Yes, desire.

Seeing adults laugh, seeing adults feast and entertain, who doesn't feel moved, but who knows that this is just sugar-coated bitter medicine.

Childhood, laugh as you please, cry as you please; now...

You won't know the preciousness of what you get until you lose it.

Ordinary things, over time, often become unattainable. Life is a drama, looking at the people in the game from the outside, maybe you will laugh and laugh, but if you are in the game yourself, how can you not suffer the same fate?

Being able to cry indulgently is happiness.

Happy people, may God bless you!

### Fire

— Yang Mou

Fire, the symbol of life, who does not greet it with joy.

Even if it is just a small point, a star, it has heat, it also has light, it will also become a blazing torch, it will also warm the world.

The world is so small in its eyes. It is able to tolerate and cleanse any amount of dirt, baseness, and filth.

If there were no fire in the world, who could imagine what a dark picture this would be.

When power oppresses it, it will lurk, it will endure, but unless it is the end of its entire life, it will still rise up with all its life's strength to weave a beautiful and brilliant pattern.

Fire, our ancestors once worshiped it. This is the symbol of life.

### Double Flying (91)

— Zhao Qingge

After Lihua sent them off, she returned to the house, stood by the window, and gazed with tearful eyes at the staggering figures returning on the silvery earth. She vaguely felt that she was also being taken away by them, along with her heart.

Zhang Xian returned to the house and quietly stood behind Lihua, sneering:

"They're gone, my Boss Mo! I advise you not to fall head over heels!"

Lihua turned around angrily, opened her mouth, wanting to say something but swallowed it back.

"Master, please say less. Why bother making her angry?" Mrs. Mo also felt uncomfortable and advised Zhang Xian.

"Who's teasing her? Other people ask her to socialize, and she scolds them for forcing her to be indecent. Now, she herself is hooking up with guests at home late at night, and doesn't allow anyone else to be around. That's upper class! Humph! 'Only the officials are allowed to set fires, and the common people are not allowed to light lamps.'" Zhang Xian babbled, pushing his melon-skin hat to the top of his head, fully revealing the air of a rogue.

"They are school teachers, they are visiting my house for the first time. It's neither to recognize a goddaughter, nor to make friends. They kindly came to see me, is that also considered 'socializing'? Tell me, what reason do you have to be so impolite to my guests? And what are you to me?" Lihua was simply annoyed. She argued, slamming the table. She rarely got angry like this.

"I am your master! I have the right to be impolite to those indecent people." Zhang Xian also shouted back, not backing down.

"A master can only manage a disciple's artistic matters, not private actions! Besides, I haven't been learning opera from you for a long time now." Lihua said loudly.

"Alright! Alright! Everyone say less." Mrs. Mo kept advising, pushing Zhang Xian out.

"Even if I can't manage, I still want to!" Zhang Xian said grumbling as he walked away.

### The Bond of Slaves

— Wanliu

Reading "Mountain City Story"

Slaves are good people under the devil!

Good people are slaves of the devil!

Treacherous, despicable, shameless villains are not slaves of the devil, but running dogs of the devil!

The dog is a dog with its tail between its legs crossing the street!

The characters in "Mountain City Story" are not fabricated, idealistic, or illusory. It seems that they have not used rendering, manufacturing, or other superb techniques, but are活生生的, flesh and blood, real society, our intimate friends who are 朝夕相共.

So, when we watch this drama, it is not热息奔腾, 呼吸屏息... These are many active responses, but a kind of deep soul, a kind of life sympathy, a kind of human nature pity; you are happy, you are sad, as if you are encountering the same fate of slaves.

This is a strange and subtle discovery.

Because of this, its story cannot stimulate you, and the image of those miserable slaves is difficult for you to forget.

"Mountain City Story" is a poem of humanity, a beautiful movement, a淡的sketch.

He is a fragment of the絮诉, he is an uninterrupted sigh of human life.

We must see his whole in his fragments, we must seek his continuity in his discontinuity.

Its method of expression is sideways, hidden, suggestive; and our appreciation of the road should also be to seek profound in the plain, to seek complex in the simple, to seek light in the dark.

Don't seek intuitive induction, but seek far-reaching understanding, don't seek temporary excitement, but seek lasting aftertaste.

This pair of poor slaves, one died, one lonely.

The tragedy of mankind: that is, the tragedy of slaves.

New Movie Introduction

### Cover Girl

— Zhu Xi

Please instruct the ladies, a major transformation is possible. Before watching the film, first change your target.

This film is said to be Rita Hayworth's first "luxurious work" in transforming her on-screen style. In fact, this film is all about "luxury." As for "splendor," strictly speaking, it seems insufficient; it can only be boasted about in advertisements.

The story is very simple, with the theme of the struggle between fame, fortune, love, and affection, set against a backdrop of song and dance scenes. On the surface, it seems to say that the female lead's inclination towards fame and fortune is wrong. However, after watching the film and reflecting on it, isn't the female lead's departure the best method? She not only gains both fame and fortune but also suffers no damage in love. Stories of this kind of separation and reunion are numerous in color films; "Cover Girl" has nothing particularly outstanding.

The opening of the film is not bad, with women appearing on stage one by one, first in long robes and then in short dresses, which is still considered novel. The close-up of Gene Kelly shaking his head frequently backstage can be considered a good shot. However, the introduction of his appearance seems inadequate, and the appearance of the cover girl, Rita Hayworth, also suffers from the same problem—lack of "prominence."

The director places many shots in a "fashion show" style. Whenever there is an opportunity, he finds a position, aims the camera at a woman, and films her statically for a few seconds. This gives the impression that they are all fashion models. Therefore, the costume expenses for the female characters in the entire film can be said to have not been wasted, as the director tirelessly utilizes them. "Cover Girl" uses the fashion show style as the main method for capturing shots, but the methods adopted have both "skillfulness" and "inferiority." For example, the lady who tests the cover girls is often taken by the director as a model to capture her still photos, which is where the director lacks cleverness. According to the plot, this character can be exaggerated, creating a characteristic that makes her easily discovered, which can enhance the dramatic effect. As for the methods to exaggerate this lady, I think there are two common paths to take: (1) create her as a "Dong Shi"-type woman whose walking and actions are completely "lens expression" oriented; (2) create her as an "expert" who instructs others on clothing, criticizing the other party's clothing and makeup every time she sees someone. This path, of course, requires the joint responsibility of the screenwriter.

The biggest shortcoming of "Cover Girl" is that no one in the entire play is prominent, and the female lead is also ordinary. Speaking reluctantly, the comical fellow can be said to be a quarter of a "prominent figure."

Because the story is ordinary and the characters are ordinary, most of the play is performed in mediocrity, making the audience in the theatre feel only one part excitement out of ten, followed by nine parts mediocrity, one part excitement... The long intervals between bursts of excitement are a major reason why this play cannot be called a "successful work."

The best scene in the entire play is Gene Kelly's shape and shadow when he is frustrated. This is the only "prominent" point that this film gives me. The shape and shadow dance on the street one after another, depicting the inner conflict extremely well. After watching this play, I feel that this is the place where the director used the most dramatic skills in the entire film and is also the place that left the deepest impression on me.

In contrast, the scene of Gene Kelly dancing alone with a clothes rack can be said to be terrible, completely the same as in "Thousands Cheer" (if this film was shot first and "Thousands Cheer" was shot later, then the guilt could be reduced by one level). Moreover, the entire process and the rhythm felt by the audience are not as good as "Thousands Cheer." Why is it that Gene Kelly is performing a plagiarized scene in two films?

"One Person, Three Shapes"! On the left is a small full-body shot, on the right is a close-up of the head, and then the close-up of the head is replaced with the magazine cover—this can also be said to be a prominent place, but this achievement is not as great as the former. Because according to the theme of his photography technique, he should be able to capture this type of shot, which is not very special. Therefore, I say: "One Person, Three Shapes" is just a good shot that should be there, and the technique is not necessarily novel; the director can easily think of it, not a unique ingenuity. The reason is just like in our Peking opera, a good performance of "Si Lang Visits His Mother" is a good action that a singer should have.

The two old man's memories are good, setting off the final third wedding memory and instigation, which is also good. If the play ended here, or if other writing was added, it would be better. Now, the film ends with another singing girl returning, singing and dancing together, which is simply too ordinary and too cliché, just like a child who can't write an article starts with "Life in this world." At most, it is different from others in that others are female singing, and the male returns, while he is male singing, and the female returns, but what does this change really mean?

In terms of actors, Gene Kelly is the best, probably only about seventy points. Fengtai Hai Huasi seems unable to grasp the personality well, the scene of acting drunk is good, but the singing and dancing are not outstanding. Fei Erbi, who plays the comical role, is good in "One Thousand and One Nights," but it is also just average. Imagine what it would be like if we changed this role to Luke Okey or Stuart Erwin? In this way, we can know the horror of Fei Er's acting. Li Baowen's "frame" is not bad, and the acting is also okay, with a promising future.

A few scenes of color are good, probably belonging to the scenes with red, of course, the reason why red is easy to attract people is very large. On the whole, the color is not bad.

If we consider this film as an introduction to women's clothing and makeup, then it is a successful film. If you think it is a film that "sells color and art," then this film has failed. I wrote these words to tell the reader that if you haven't seen this film and are thinking of watching it, then be sure to shift your target to the fashion show, and you will definitely have a very satisfactory harvest.

### Formalism in Acting (Continued)

— Ye Zi

The principle of stylization requires setting the main, fundamental things in a script and in each act. In order to bring out the most basic things in the script, the performer uses strong colors for contrast, simplifying the form into a diagram. People generally call his theatre a mysterious theatre. The painters he recruits regard the stage as a frame for expressing their own color composition, pushing the actors behind and letting the main artists and painters express the drama's intentions. Moreover, in order to create a certain atmosphere, they use lighting to the maximum extent.

Although the conditional performance began as flat and painterly, it gradually tended towards three-dimensional installation, proposing architectural composition to replace painterly decoration. Everything must be sculptural, and the ambiguity of painting must be pushed behind the scenery, which represents a move towards constructivist theatre. In the performance of "Sister Bottis," the actors do not appear in a flat, decorated setting but within a circle, using harmonious dialogue and clear, correct sculptural postures. This sculptural method brings the actors to an empty space. When staging Andrei's "The Life of Man," no decoration is used at all, attempting to abolish decoration and express the actor's detachment from the shackles of the background. Defining the contours of the actor's body and limbs and the meaning of all movements and the highs and lows of the voice, so as to give them a noble expression, this is the starting point of theatrical kinetics. The walls around the audience's seats are covered with gray curtains, the only source of light, and the design of the furnishings is extremely exaggerated. The actors' makeup is almost like masks, and the beards seem to be carved. The reason for this is to convey the sadness and emotion of dreams. At this time, Meyerhold suddenly thought of actors using stage stairs of different heights to perform. Undoubtedly, he felt that using stairs could develop his attempt to make actors break away from the sculptural method of flat scenery. And he used all his skills to unify the actors and the audience. He brought the actors to the apron stage, revealing everything to the audience. He abolished the front of the stage and the heavy curtain. He illuminated the actors with lights, making them as clear as sculptures. He was constantly experimenting, and finally, he almost turned the performance into a puppet show. In short, during this period, he was roughly influenced by mysticism and symbolism, so he hid in pure art isolated from reality. This artistic creation is mysterious, misanthropic, abstract, and symbolic, created with aesthetically refined formalism. He firmly believed that actors on the stage should become a visible symbol of the poet's thoughts. He sought stylization on the stage, so he searched for confusion in Italian "Commedia dell'arte," Eastern and medieval theatres, puppet shows, and Greek plays.

During the Soviet Revolution, he took advantage of this opportunity to develop his art to its peak. He strived to accept the entirety of life, and all phenomena within sight were reproduced with extreme precision and vividness. What the theme of the script shows is not a continuous progression of structure but a continuous picture that conforms to the principles of association and contrast. He looked at life from a cross-section, not from a straight face.

Based on the attempt to connect the stage with the audience, he had previously used the front of the stage. Now he tried to move the action out and integrate it with the audience seats and the audience. So he abolished the background and the curtain, without a proscenium. The stage was extended by the audience seats; or the architectural barriers were removed, and the stage was set in the center of the theatre, with the audience surrounding it on all sides. The performance was also staged in the boxes, so that the stage space was not restricted. The actors came out of the dressing room in the audience's line of sight, waiting to go on stage. In this way, the illusion of the stage was eliminated. The art of theatre changed from secrecy and dreams to production exposure. All the machines of production were deliberately emphasized and made public, which led to the constructivist stage design.

The constructive method is suitable for the needs of real people performing freely in space, not for photography or decoration. He sought to make cylinders, open diagrams, squares, stair planes, inclined ladder steps, rotating bridges, or gear teeth from different metals, wood, and glass, making the device seem mechanical in nature in order to obtain a style. He replaced flat painting with the constructive method. His purpose was to treat society as a primary machine, expressing it with the structure of industrial and technical organization. He regarded the device as an important part of appreciation, treating what was extracted and conveyed as the spirit of the machine. Based on extreme simplification, he attempted to be serious, clear, and used to stimulate a powerful life, in order to resist the increasingly complex and wasteful modern lifestyle. Construct the stage, each part must be used for action, making the action convenient. Zhang's harmony and explanation have become the object of acting. (To be continued)

### "Professional Woman" Suggests the Difficulties of Professional Women

— Tao Tai

The suggestion of "Professional Woman" is not women's understanding and knowledge of society, nor is it the happiness and satisfaction that society gives to women. Rather, it is saying that women's love and career cannot have both; professional women cannot fulfill their wishes to enjoy themselves in the sea of love due to their job responsibilities. This seems to be telling women: if you want a career, don't have love, if you want love, you have to give up your career; otherwise, you will encounter the situation in "Professional Woman."

The difficulties encountered by professional women in our China are more than this. I remember that in Chongqing, there was a time when the Ministry of Communications had a message that it would not use married women as female staff, which caused a great panic among the "professional women" in the directly affiliated and subordinate agencies of the Ministry of Communications, who saw their jobs about to be broken immediately. Fortunately, it was soon raised by female senators at the Senate, and the Ministry of Communications had no words to answer, so it withdrew the order. In addition, civil servants during the Anti-Japanese War could receive family rice, but female staff members could not. I think this is probably because traditionally there was no precedent for women to bear the burden of family life, so the authorities maintained this legacy! In the future, they can go to their ancestors to report their achievements!

People's feelings need to be entrusted, so they love; because of physiological requirements, they want to get married. This is not an unreasonable thing! Since they are married, they are also a member of the family. Of course, they must have the same responsibilities as men for everything in the family. At a time when rice is expensive and firewood is scarce, the strength of the husband alone is not enough to support a family, so the wife should help, and the adults and gentlemen in society often look at them differently, which is extremely despicable!

If this "professional woman" has three or five children and cannot spare time to work outside, this is when the real difficulties descend!

The point mentioned in "Professional Woman" is only to increase the interest of the plot, so it was written in by the playwright, and it does not raise a difficult problem for professional women. The difficult problems of real professional women are countless in China! Because at this time of transition between new and old knowledge, external oppression, the stubbornness of elders, and their own contradictions are all difficulties for professional women!

### Once Out the Door

— Shao Fu

The traffic problem in Shanghai is too serious. We urge Mayor Wu Guozhen, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, and the 3.7 million citizens to work hard together!

The current municipal authorities can be said to be excellent municipal workers. Their past experiences and achievements are enough to explain it, and they deserve our respect and belief. At the same time, they know many things, perhaps even more than we do. Their enthusiasm for improving the traffic situation may be more urgent than any of you or me. Therefore, on the other hand, it is up to us, the 3.7 million citizens, to cooperate with them and wholeheartedly support them.

People often say that Shanghai is tied to international impressions. This is too selfless. If you ask the other way around, isn't it tied to international impressions? If it is not tied to international impressions, we still live here. Living here, everything here must be related to our survival.

The traffic problem, in this small world, is the first problem we need to solve.

If this problem cannot be solved, we will become patients with paralyzed limbs, and we will encounter undue difficulties in doing anything.

Here are two articles, both talking about trams. I hope there will be other opinions raised. But one point is valuable, that is, it represents the general opinion of the citizens. We dare to believe that even if it is not raised, all those responsible will still go in this direction. We dare not believe that because of these articles, the trams of Shanghai will be immediately improved.

But it is still raised, and prepared to be raised constantly, because we are afraid of forgetfulness: self-forgetfulness, other people's forgetfulness.

### Tram Scarcity What is the Reason?

— You Fu

At any time, as long as you stay on the road for a minute or two, you can see trams coming and going. In short, trams are running on the streets from morning to night. However, when people are waiting for a bus at some small stations, they often wait for a long time and still don't see a tram coming, especially route 1 trams. Sometimes they can't see its shadow for an hour. At this time, passengers feel quite strange, and even think that this is a "tram scarcity."

According to informal statistics, there are about sixteen route 1 trams and about twenty-six route 2 trams. Route 1 takes one hour and thirty minutes from the starting point to the end point, and it can take more than two hours when it is slow. Route 2 takes one hour from the starting point to the end point, and it takes one hour and twenty minutes when it is slow. On average, at most, a tram will pass a station every three minutes. According to this number of vehicles and driving speed, the phenomenon of tram scarcity should not occur. What is the reason for this? Maybe there are too many people in Shanghai!

Now, based only on my personal experience of taking trams and the conversations with the staff in charge of tram work, I have collected the following main opinions:

1. Traffic obstruction at intersections. To go from Jing'an Temple to the Bund and Hongkou, you must pass Nanjing Road. When the car is heading from west to east, it will often encounter many cars heading from south to north or from north to south that are running. Under the command of the police, the green light does not come out, and you cannot drive past.

2. The driver's driving speed is not very fixed, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, and cannot properly control and grasp the speed.

3. During the time when civil servants go to and from work, it is particularly crowded. Passengers desperately squeeze into the carriages in order to save time, and as a result, half of the last person's body is inside and half is outside. The tram door cannot be closed, and the car cannot start immediately, which delays a long time.

4. The allocation of cars is uneven. There are often seven or eight route 1 trams or more than a dozen route 2 trams following one after another, and sometimes there is no car for a long time.

In addition, two witnessed facts are written below:

1. While waiting for a car on Jiangxi Road, I have encountered five times when a route 1 tram sped past, did not stop at the station, and stopped only after driving a considerable distance. This distance makes it impossible for passengers to even run after it.

2. Still on Jiangxi Road, always on Sunday mornings, waiting for a car to Hongkou for more than an hour, more than a dozen route 2 trams passed, but a route 1 tram was still not seen. This has happened more than four times. However, they skillfully deceive the passengers. When the route 2 tram arrives at the Bund and then drives out, the route sign in front of the car is changed to the number "1," indicating that the car is coming from Hongkou.

However, smart passengers, no matter what tricks your tram drivers play, they can always see through them.

Therefore, let's not do magic tricks, let's open the skylight and speak frankly, and come up with concrete ways to solve this problem. Here, I offer a little opinion from a personal standpoint.

1. Properly allocate cars, so that there are both route 2 and route 1 trams running during operation.

2. Please ask the drivers to concentrate on their work, cooperate with each other, and roughly unify the speed, and never allow it to be too fast or too slow.

3. When there are too many passengers, the ticket seller should really control and sincerely advise guests not to get on.

4. It is best not to skip the station, otherwise, the station will become an empty check, and the order will be chaotic.

These are my humble opinions. Does the tram company think so?

### Do Tram Riders Feel the Same?

— Ji Zhi

In today's Shanghai, except for the rich, ordinary citizens must try to save money on the considerable amount of car expenses spent each month. It is too expensive to take a rickshaw, not to mention a tricycle or a car. Although walking is good for physical and mental health, unfortunately, the cost of shoes is too great, so they have to rely on the relatively cheap tram.

I am now recording some things that happen in trams without exaggeration. I don't know if readers feel the same?

When the car is about to drive to the station, if someone squeezes out of the carriage, then the passengers on the left and right must complain to him, "It's not the station yet, why are you so anxious." However, when the car arrives at the station, the people below swarm up, and at this time, if they can't squeeze off the car, they will be complained about, making them laugh or cry.

People who take trams are mostly selfish. People who are already on the car often encourage the driver not to stop at the station. As a result, the people waiting at the station can't get on the car. Sometimes even the people who have to get off the car are messed up. I once saw two elementary school students who got on the car on Maigen Road and were originally prepared to get off at Kade Road. As a result, they were sent all the way to the Nicheng Bridge. The two were so anxious that they were crying, fearing that they would be late for class.

Also, people who want to get on the car always like to push other people's backs and shout "Run inside." Once they step on the platform, their thinking changes immediately and they shout to the people behind: "It's too crowded, take the next car!" People who take trams are also very good at arguing. At first, they would loudly rebuke people who didn't follow the queuing rules. When they couldn't stand it and went to squeeze, they would argue: "Other people don't follow the rules, why should I follow them?"

It is commonplace to see people who are eager to get on the car pulling other people's clothes or collars, and even pulling other people's ears.

In the past, tram passengers always had the habit of giving up their seats to the elderly, weak, women, and children, but now it has gradually decreased, and even disappeared.

Bad habits have replaced good habits!

### Pickpocket Arrested - Dressed Impeccably, Doesn't Look Like a Thief

— Submitted

About pickpockets, it's really better not to mention them. Bringing them up makes everyone deeply resent and loathe them. Some people, because they are often robbed, become indignant and even wear paper hats, shouting to others, "Beware of pickpockets!" From this, you can see the extent to which people hate pickpockets.

This evening, as I was returning home from work, I passed the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road. A large crowd was gathered by the roadside, saying that a pickpocket had been caught. Out of curiosity, I also peered inside. Now, let me give a simple description of this pickpocket:

He was wearing white canvas trousers, a white short-sleeved shirt, and a light blue shirt collar turned out. He was very young, no more than twenty-five years old at most. Without being told, who would believe he was a pickpocket? The victim was a villager, holding a small paper package in one hand and a carrying pole in the other, standing blankly to the side.

The pickpocket refused to admit it and argued with the villager, but he was eventually taken away by the police, with the honest villager following along. Since it was on my way home, I also followed behind them.

Along the way, the pickpocket initially argued with the police and the villager, and then whispered to the police, but the police ignored him. He seemed very disappointed and turned back to plead with the villager. By this time, they had reached the entrance of the Sincere Company. A rickshaw drove up, and a man in a Western suit suddenly jumped off. "Is this the pickpocket?" Without waiting for an answer, he raised his hand and slapped the pickpocket in the face, repeatedly and forcefully. Then, he laughed "Heh heh!" The laugh contained a sense of revenge, suggesting that he must have encountered pickpocketing before, and more than once; hence his hatred and anger towards pickpockets.

After the pickpocket was beaten, the police continued to lead him forward. He still used cunning tricks, hoping the police would let him go, but to no avail, because they had reached the entrance of the police station. I watched as the three figures walked through the gate of the "Old Zha District Sub-Bureau."

Brief Collection of Opinions

### Hoping for Calm Winds and Quiet Waves - No Further Developments from the Stockade

— Wuling Ren

Reports say that Zhang Zhiben, the head of the investigative team for the takeover work, has arrived in Shanghai, and the rest of the team will arrive within days to begin investigating the handling of enemy and puppet assets. Let's hope for calm winds and quiet waves, and that there will be no further developments from this.

China's fourteen major export commodities are currently preparing to hold an exhibition, with invitations to famous people to give speeches and take turns entertaining foreign guests. Whether this will lead to a sharp increase in export figures is still questionable. On the other hand, the glass counters on the streets specializing in imported goods are full of all kinds of items, and without the need for advertising, Chinese people flock to them. The reason for this is self-evident.

It is said that most of the cases in which the legal guidance center run by the city's women's association provides pro bono representation for women in court are abandonment cases, and it is likely that many of them are caused by "anti-Japanese war wives."

In the embezzlement case of the two railway bureaus, one employee named Wang Sanchuan was released on bail after being interrogated by the court. The three characters "Wang Sanchuan" put together seem like the character "Nong" (弄, to play with/get). No wonder people suspect that he is good at "playing" with money.

Counterfeit US dollars of various denominations, such as twenty and fifty dollars, have been discovered. I am not at all concerned about this news, but my ten-year-old child at home is flipping through the business section of the newspaper every day. When asked why, I learned that he had exchanged a dollar for coins on the street.

### Car Accidents in America

— Dongfang Jing

Since the addition of a batch of Jeeps in Shanghai, the number of pedestrians injured by cars has been increasing daily. However, in America, car accidents are even more frequent, with one person dying and forty people injured every fifteen minutes.

During the war, due to gasoline restrictions, the rate of car accidents plummeted; now, it has soared again. Although there are now four million fewer cars in America than before the war, traffic experts believe that car accidents in 1946 will exceed the peak of 1941—in that year, 40,000 people were killed and 1.45 million injured by cars.

The reasons for the increase in the number of car accidents this year are simple: many roads are damaged; many vehicles are in disrepair, with an average age of more than eight years; speed limits have been lifted; and, most importantly, drivers have reverted to their old ways: recklessness and carelessness.

People aged sixteen to twenty are the most dangerous drivers. They kill one person for every two million miles they drive. Drivers aged twenty to twenty-five kill one person for every eight million miles they drive. As for people aged forty-five to fifty, they are much more stable and reliable drivers. They average 21 million miles before having a major accident.

One person dies and forty people are injured every fifteen minutes.

### One Mistake After Another

— Hua Mei

At a banquet, a guest chatted with the person next to him, criticizing the beautiful and expensively dressed woman who was singing to entertain the guests.

"Her singing is terrible; she's giving me a headache. Who is she?"

"Yes! She sings terribly. She is my wife."

"Oh, she is your wife, no, I didn't mean she sang badly. I was referring to the song, the song is so childish. I wonder which writer wrote it?"

"I wrote it..."

### Sent to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (14)

— Zhou Shoujuan

For twenty-nine years! You have simply been my slave, providing attentive and thoughtful care in every aspect of my life, from my daily routines to my diet, leaving nothing to be desired. Every morning, I am accustomed to eating bread and milk powder. After the bread is baked, it must be spread with sweet jam and savory scrambled eggs and meat sauce. Everything is prepared on a plate. During the years we lived in the country villa, you would always personally carry the plate, in one breath, up three floors from the downstairs room to serve me, while you yourself were still hungry. Every day when I went out, you would pay attention to the weather and choose my clothes. Sometimes I felt that I was wearing too much, but when I came back, I felt it was just right, otherwise, I might have caught a cold. Whenever there were dinner parties or appointments with friends, I would always procrastinate at home, forgetting the time, and you would always urge me to leave half an hour early, so I was always on time, without delay. Alas! Now, I feel all alone and nothing is convenient. I have to prepare my own meals, pay attention to my own clothes, everything is out of order. Alas! Feng, oh Feng, how can I live without you! Last December, I saw that you were emaciated and weak, and after getting up every morning, I always volunteered to make the bed and fold the quilt. You had tears in your eyes, saying, "Master, I have served you for twenty-nine years, but now I am too weak to do it. It hurts me to see you making the bed and folding the quilt yourself!" I quickly said, "Feng, you have served me for so long, now it's my turn to serve you. After returning to Suzhou, I hope you rest well. Even if you lie in bed for ten or twenty years, I am willing to be your special nurse, serving you for ten or twenty years!" Who knew that only three months after returning to Suzhou, you would leave me, leaving me unable to do any more for you. Heaven, I hope that in the next life we will still be husband and wife, and that you will be my husband, so that I can serve you well for a lifetime, to repay your kindness in this life!

Although you did not often put yourself in social situations, mingling and entertaining, you would generously host guests who came to our home. When relatives came, you would chat and talk with them until evening, when they had to stay for dinner. Knowing that there was not much good food at home, and there were no restaurants nearby, I didn't have to worry. You would arrange everything yourself, impressively serving a table of dishes, which I secretly admired. Although you didn't read much, when the Shen Bao newspaper was delivered every day, you would flip through it and concentrate on reading it for ten or twenty minutes. To this day, I still remember you sitting on the sofa, reading the newspaper with your glasses on. You could distinguish right from wrong and never admired vanity. After seeing the extravagance and wantonness of the family of a traitor next door, you would constantly scold them behind their backs. The fact that I was able to maintain my integrity for nine years was not without your subtle influence.

Over the years, there have been too many events in our family. We married off two daughters and took in a daughter-in-law, fulfilling half of Xiang Ping's wish. I don't know how much effort you put into it. The year before last, my mother suffered from terminal jaw cancer and eventually passed away. In addition to assisting with the funeral arrangements, I don't know how many tears you shed. In addition, with rising prices and a difficult life, you were always cautiously supporting the household. Although I often comforted you, saying that there were economic solutions and that I would never let you starve, you were like Fan Zhongyan, the person in our family who worried about the world before anyone else and enjoyed the world after everyone else, and you could never feel at ease.
