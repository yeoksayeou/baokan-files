Trial of Traitor Zhou Fohai Concluded; Interrogation Lasted Six Hours; Sentencing Scheduled for the 7th [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Traitor Zhou Fohai was tried again on the 2nd. From early morning, Chao Tian Gong was bustling with activity, with police and soldiers maintaining order. Except for those with passes who could enter the courtroom, over ten thousand spectators gathered on the steps of the Dacheng Hall, listening to the proceedings through loudspeakers. At 8:05 AM, traitor Zhou was brought in, wearing a narrow-striped taupe-gray gabardine jacket, light blue Chinese-style pants, gray socks, and round-toed leather shoes, sitting in the waiting room reading a newspaper. At 9:00 AM, defense lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Wang Shanxiang, and Yang Jialin arrived together. The court session began at 9:00 AM and concluded at 3:00 PM, with sentencing scheduled for the 7th. Court President Questioned Sternly; Traitor Zhou Still Denied Selling Out the Country and Being a Traitor After the court session began, Presiding Judge Zhao Chen, along with Judges Ge Zhisheng and Jin Shanding, and Prosecutor Chen Shengzu, and female clerk Huang Qianju took the bench and brought traitor Zhou to the court. First, they questioned him about his crimes of issuing counterfeit currency, disrupting finances, resisting legal tender, and demeaning national banks, using documents from the puppet government and his personal statements. Zhou remained silent. Then, they interrogated him about organizing the puppet government, publishing fallacies, and signing the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty." Zhou vaguely stated: "We didn't form the government as a game, we had to have something to gain, we had to have harmony before we did it; after joining the enemy, I knew I was facing death, and you can't die more than once, so I decided to do something for the country and the people. I was initially hesitant, but once I did it, I didn't shirk responsibility. I'm not responsible for signing the 'Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty,' but I did consider it, and it wouldn't affect national sovereignty. The puppet government was fake, so the treaty was naturally fake as well. I'm not out of my mind, and I don't admit to selling out the country and being a traitor." Favorable Evidence The court then investigated the results of the investigation into favorable evidence and questioned him about them one by one. Zhou confessed: "After the puppet government was established, seeing that the Japanese were still fighting wildly, and Wang Zhaoming was a pitiful puppet, I knew my actions were wrong and thought about doing something to serve the country." The facts show a letter from Du Yuesheng stating: Zhou had entrusted Li Botao and Duan Honggang to ask them to request his surrender in the 30th year of the Republic. A letter from Ma Yuanfang stated: He was released after being arrested because Zhou found a way, but he said: "I (Mr. Ma) originally did not dare to affect the public affairs of the nation with personal matters." Letters from Wu Shaoshu and Jiang Bocheng stated: Zhou had found a way to assist in concealing work. A reply from Wu Kaixian stated: After being arrested, Zhou found a way to have him detained in Nanjing and then found a way to release him. A letter from Li Mingyang stated: After being captured and imprisoned in Lieutenant Colonel Ishikawa's house in Shanghai, Zhou found a way to rescue him. A letter from Gu Zhutong stated: In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic, Zhou contacted the Third War Area to coordinate a counteroffensive. It is true that he assisted in the takeover work after the Japanese surrender. A letter from Chen Baohua stated: Zhou had concealed his work and asked him to take a letter to Chen Bulei, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, and Shao Lizi. A document from the Military Intelligence Bureau stated that his work: "Since being contacted by Cheng Kexiang and Peng Suli and approved for use, there were no initial achievements. Later, after the bureau strengthened its use in many ways, it gradually had confidence in the central government." Zhou vigorously defended himself, saying: "After receiving the handwritten letter from the late Director, I actively made atonement for my sins and began to make arrangements, so there was a lack of achievements. Later, I installed a radio station in Yang Xinghua's and my own private residence, and concealed and supplied military and economic intelligence, and truly fulfilled my mission. If the Military Intelligence Bureau has anything to say, please summon Cheng Kexiang." Two-Faced Policy Then, after describing the case of the murder of Li Shiqun, the court pointed out various illegal and disturbing acts committed by him after his so-called surrender, and the acts of undermining the government, based on various puppet documents. Zhou either argued sophistically or claimed that it was a smokescreen necessary for his work, and insisted that he was not responsible for clearing the countryside and waging actual war against Britain and the United States. The court questioned: "All your actions can be said to be a 'two-faced policy'." Zhou quickly replied: "Taking risks is not a game, and if it can still be said to be a 'two-faced policy', I am not convinced." The court then questioned: "Since you are not afraid of death, why didn't you serve in Chongqing and resist Japan?" Zhou replied weakly: "This is the sacrifice of the initial mistake. I deeply regret it. For the sake of the country, even the reputation of my ancestors and descendants has been sacrificed. Even now I am still called a traitor. I am not reconciled even in death." The court further questioned: "Looking at your history, you went from the Communist Party to the Kuomintang in Guangzhou, then rode the fence in Hankou, then went to Shanghai to be a puppet official in Chongqing, and in the puppet government you came over to be a special agent. It can truly be said that you are 'talented and adaptable'." Zhou then lowered his head and said nothing.Ê∏ù Garrison Commander's Residence Burglarized Valuable Items Missing [Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] Two leather suitcases and many other valuable items were stolen from the residence of Chongqing Garrison Commander Sun Yuanliang in Shangqing Temple on the 31st of last month. It is said that on the night of the burglary, Commander Sun's wife was in the countryside for some business, and no one was taking care of the house, so it was taken advantage of by thieves. After this case occurred, many people in various circles thought it was talk data and were amazed. Four Counts Summarized; Prosecutor Requested the Harshest Sentence At 11:11 AM, Lawyer Wang Shanxiang stood up and said: "Two replies from the Military Intelligence Bureau of the Organization Department have not yet arrived. They concern contact with the Central Statistics Bureau and those who surrendered. Should we begin the debate? Please consider." The court ruled: "This court has already obtained indirect evidence of these two matters. Commander Gu has already replied. There is no need to wait any longer. The investigation of this case is concluded. Begin the debate." First, Prosecutor Chen stated his military situation according to the indictment, and then summarized it into four points: (1) Zhou's claim that he organized the puppet government to serve the country and benefit the people was actually harming the country and the people, a ridiculous crime of violating national policy; (2) the conditions for surrender did not meet the legal requirements; (3) acting as a special agent was a repeated flattery and opportunism; (4) after the enemy surrendered, he did not escape and serve the central government. He hopes to reduce his sentence with a small effort. Finally, he said: "The defendant's crime is serious. I represent the people of the country and should ask the presiding judge to maintain discipline for the country and preserve the righteousness of the nation and give him a severe sentence." Zhou's Defense At 11:40 AM, Zhou defended himself vigorously, distorting his actions as reducing the suffering of the people, without affecting the country, and that he had restrained the enemy's actions in many ways and assisted in the war of resistance. and emphasized his achievements as a special agent and the process of his surrender, and deeply "regretted" the court's "treating him favorably where he could be forgiven, only discussing politics and not law when it was favorable, and only discussing law and not politics when it was unfavorable, and only asking about motives and not actions when it was beneficial to his meritorious deeds, and only asking about actions and not motives when it was not beneficial, and erasing his loyalty and hard work with one stroke." The court presented a reply recently received from the Military Intelligence Bureau's closing office, which stated: "The claim that he had surrendered to the central government has not been found to be true after investigation." After hearing this, Zhou said helplessly: "Then there is no way!" Lawyers' Arguments Lawyer Zhang Shizhao then argued three points: (1) The word "approved" on the Military Intelligence Bureau's document includes approving his surrender, otherwise, why would he be ordered to work? (2) Cheng Kexiang was the one who did not work hard, and he has now been detained; (3) The Military Intelligence Bureau should reward and punish accordingly since it ordered him to work. Zhang also listed many historical examples, all of which requested a reduced sentence. Lawyer Wang Shanxiang also cited Article 57, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Code, "If the attitude after the crime is repentance, the sentence should be reduced." "Please, the court, base on reasonable and definite favorable evidence, give a reduced sentence, in order to show credibility to the puppet troops who are working for the country's tribulation." Lawyer Yang Shanlin then presented a copy of Cheng Kexiang's report on inciting rebellion to the court, saying: It was handed over by the defendant's family, requesting "quantifying the law and considering the circumstances, and reducing the sentence." Taking Out of Context After the lawyers finished their arguments, Prosecutor Chen then defended Zhang Shizhao's first point; the original text in the investigation opinion of the document was "approved to incite and use," and "approved to surrender" cannot be taken out of context. Afterwards, Presiding Judge asked Zhou if he had anything to say? Zhou shouted "I have something to say, I'm not in a good mood, I won't say it!" After a while, he pointed to the lower couplet of the couplet in the courtroom and exclaimed: "Clear punishments and compassionate punishments", what is the meaning of killing people, death doesn't matter, but you can't talk about loyalty, if you are guilty, you should be sentenced, and you shouldn't erase your merits, unless you are Jie and Qin Shihuang, only then you are so arbitrary. In the future, the country will inevitably have internal strife and foreign troubles. If the law does not distinguish between merit and demerit, who will turn back if they take a wrong step? Zhou then commented on the political situation after the liberation of the Philippines, and even gave a big speech on democracy, and a small number of audience members who didn't understand it actually shouted and applauded. At 2:45, after the court clerk finished reading, Zhou signed and sealed, and the court ruled "The debate in this case is concluded, and the sentence will be announced at 9:00 AM on the 7th." Activities are Useless At this point, President Zhao put on a solemn expression and said: "Finally, the President of the Court has a few words to say. The defendant must listen carefully, and the family members must listen carefully: Recently, I heard that your family members have used a lot of gold bars and have been running around in many ways. This is useless. I hope you don't use money to conduct activities. You must know that the judges of this court cannot be moved by poverty, cannot be subdued by power, and cannot be moved by money and emotion. No matter what, we will decide to make a fair judgment, and all activities are superfluous." Zhou repeatedly said "This is not true." The court ruled: "It's good if this is not true. The defendant is taken back into custody." At this time, it was exactly 3:00, and the hungry audience members dispersed like a receding tide. Investigating Traitor Li Xinghua; Traitor Zhou Was Summoned to Testify [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The High Court of the capital opened an investigation court at 4:00 PM today, and specially summoned traitor Zhou Fohai to testify, one for the case of traitor Yang Xinghua, who had confessed to introducing Peng Shou as traitor Zhou's secretary to conceal his underground work. Zhou testified: It was true. One was for Shen Changgeng's accusation that traitor Zhou presided over the puppet securities exchange, which was harmful to the people. Zhou defended the business of the puppet securities exchange. The interrogation concluded at 5:10 PM and he was taken back into custody. Traitor Qian Daosun Sentenced to Ten Years [Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] Qian Daosun, the president of the puppet Peking University, was sentenced to ten years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for six years by the Hebei High Court today. Taipei White Day Robbery Case; All Criminals Arrested [Central News Agency, Taipei, 1st] The major case of the robbery of 300,000 Taiwan dollars from the Changhua Bank here on the 31st of October was solved by the City Police Department within ten hours. Of the five criminals, except for the ringleader Jian Liang, who was shot dead on the spot, all the rest were captured. According to their confession, the case of the daylight robbery of 100,000 Taiwan dollars of public funds from the Monopoly Bureau in July was also committed by them. Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch Established Working Plan Committee; Subdivided into Three Groups to Handle Transportation, Industry, and Post-War Affairs [This City News] The Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch, in order to promote post-war reconstruction work in Shanghai, specially convened relevant agencies to discuss methods. The first meeting was held yesterday, and it was decided to establish the Executive Yuan Shanghai Branch Post-War Reconstruction Working Plan Committee, which will be jointly drafted by Liu Hongsheng, Wang Renlin, Zhao Zukang, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) representative Nush to establish the committee's regulations, the key points being: (1) Named the Shanghai Branch Post-War Reconstruction Working Plan Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, attached to the Shanghai Branch. (2) Established a committee of nine to fifteen members, organized by representatives dispatched by relevant agencies in this city, one to two from the Public Works Bureau, one to two from the Works Bureau, two to three from the Industrial Association, one to two from the UNRRA Office, and three to five from the Shanghai Branch. (3) The post-war reconstruction work to be handled is divided into three major categories: First, post-war reconstruction of transportation, including repairing bridges, building roads, building dikes, and expanding ferry services; Second, post-war reconstruction of industry, restoring and expanding public utilities and major factories damaged during the war; Third, post-war reconstruction of agriculture, helping farmers and fishermen, increasing agricultural and fishery production, and improving seeds and fertilizers. (4) Established three groups: consultation, design, and distribution. Recess Today; National Federation of Commerce Held a Grand Meeting Yesterday; National Sentiment Fully Displayed; Hunan Representative Proposed to Stop Japanese Ships from Entering the Country [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The National Federation of Commerce held its second meeting at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, and continued to listen to reports from various representatives. When representatives from the Northeast, who had been separated from the motherland for fourteen years, and representatives from Taiwan, who had been separated from the motherland for fifty-one years, took the stage to report, thunderous applause came from all corners. When compatriots from Xinjiang, Ningxia, other border provinces, the Philippines, Vietnam, and other places reported, they also won a lot of applause. The meeting place was always filled with a strong atmosphere of unity, and national sentiment was brought to the peak. Some representatives even demanded action against the fact that the Northeast and Taiwan had returned to the motherland, while Hong Kong had not yet been recovered. The Hunan representative made a temporary motion requesting the government to strictly stop Japanese ships from entering Shanghai and Hong Kong ports without authorization. Until the afternoon, a representative from the Tumote Special Banner rushed from Suiyuan, and the atmosphere of great unity was rare in recent years. The meeting adjourned at about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. In the afternoon, nine groups were held to conduct reviews, one group for industrial and commercial laws, two groups for industry and mining, three groups for commerce, four groups for export trade, five groups for finance, six groups for transportation, seven groups for donations and taxes, eight groups for industrial and commercial organizations, and nine groups for special categories. The meeting will be adjourned for one day on the 3rd, and will continue on the 4th. Northeast Representatives Made Somber Reports Heilongjiang representative Lu Xunruo said in an infinitely somber tone: The security of the Northeast is the basis for talking about the security of China and even the world, but the current situation in the Northeast is still extremely critical. Of the nine provinces and two cities, Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Hinggan, Harbin, and Dalian have not yet been recovered, and the compatriots are still living in dire straits. We hope that our compatriots can extend their sympathy, so that those who cannot make a living can live in peace as soon as possible, and those who are displaced can return to their homeland as soon as possible. The Northeast has extremely rich resources, and there are unlimited prospects for development in agriculture, forestry, mining, and industry. We hope that the entire country will not abandon it. Liaoning representative Li Zaofang said: You don't know how precious the motherland is until you are occupied. In the fourteen years that the Northeast was occupied by the enemy, tens of thousands of compatriots sacrificed themselves to resist the enemy. I would like to shed tears for the people of the country and say: The enemy has now surrendered, but the situation in the Northeast is still not optimistic. The Northeast has unlimited resources. There are so many chimneys in Shenyang alone that they are as dense as forests. At present, due to various reasons, those that are destroyed are destroyed, and those that are rotten are rotten, which is very sad. This matter will not only be laughed at by the world, but also by the Japanese invaders. We hope that the people of the country will know the meaning of "China will exist only after the Northeast exists", and engage in the revival of the Northeast. Instead of committing suicide by buying foreign goods overseas, it is better to save ourselves by developing domestic goods, and the Northeast is the best base for revival. Dalian representative Han Gangyun appealed on behalf of 1.8 million compatriots in Lushun and Dalian, not to forget a good piece of land that had been occupied for 52 years. Compatriots in Taiwan Province; A Mixture of Joy and Sorrow Taiwan representative Huang Madian said: During the enemy's occupation, the Taiwanese compatriots had twelve revolutions, and many people threw their heads for freedom. The suffering they suffered is hard to describe. Now that we have regained our freedom, we are truly filled with a mixture of joy and sorrow. Taiwan is extremely important in terms of national defense, and its wealth of products is also amazing. We hope that the country will value Taiwan. Since the recovery, due to various reasons, production has decreased. Sugar has decreased from 1.42 million tons per year to 100,000 tons, and coal has decreased from 300,000 tons per month to 100,000 tons. There is still much work to be done. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Vietnam; Severely Oppressed Xue Fenshi, the leader of the Philippine overseas Chinese merchants who was once arrested by the Japanese, reported: The national sentiment of the Philippine people is increasing day by day after the Philippines was recovered, and incidents of anti-Chinese sentiment are also emerging endlessly. Although the overseas Chinese have assets, they have no way to engage in industry and commerce, and there are various difficulties in returning to the country to invest. We hope that the currency system can be stabilized as soon as possible, and the economic policy can also be established as soon as possible. The overseas Chinese in the Philippines are very happy to return to the country to invest. In addition, after the Japanese surrendered, they lost all their markets in Southeast Asia. This is the best opportunity for us to seize foreign markets. We hope that we can pay attention to this as soon as possible before the Japanese invaders make a comeback, otherwise we will regret it too late. Vietnamese representative Chen Zhaoqi said: There are 600,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and they have a great influence in the Vietnamese business community. The rice mills they run are also the largest in Vietnam, but they suffered heavy losses during the war. After the war, they suffered heavy losses due to the conflicts between France and Vietnam. In three major events, more than 200 overseas Chinese were killed and more than 400 shops were destroyed. Now, the French are intensifying their anti-Chinese sentiment, and incidents of mistreatment of overseas Chinese are emerging endlessly. All shops are subject to control, and even donations to the country for disaster relief are not allowed. Recently, overseas Chinese planned to transport rice back to the country for disaster relief, but it has not yet been shipped, and they have raised 8 million Vietnamese dollars, but they have no way to remit it back. We hope that the government can directly demand that the French government quickly implement the new Sino-French treaty and abolish all controls. Xinjiang Hopes to Invest and Develop Representatives from remote provinces such as Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Xinjiang reported today, all hoping that the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad can invest in and develop the border regions. Xinjiang representative Zhou Haidong reported: Xinjiang is located in a remote border region, and its economy and culture are extremely backward. Everything is stagnant in the medieval state. Industry and commerce are extremely immature. The main reason is inconvenient transportation and special politics. In twelve years, the president of the Chamber of Commerce has been replaced eight times, and commerce has been difficult to develop. Since Chairman Zhang took office, the people have had a chance to breathe. For example, suspending taxation for half a year has been of great benefit to merchants. At the same time, transportation between provinces and regions has become more and more convenient, and commerce has become more and more prosperous. We hope that we can adhere to Chairman's instruction that "the foundation of national construction lies in the Northwest", attach importance to Xinjiang, and hope that the industrial and commercial circles can invest and jointly develop it. In addition, representatives from Qingdao, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Guangdong also gave wonderful reports. Tianjin Zhong Textile Mill Operated Spindles At Full Capacity; A Total of Over 320,000 Spindles [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] The Tianjin Branch of Zhong Textile Company has jurisdiction over seven mills, with a total of 323,832 spindles. During the Japanese occupation, more than 200,000 spindles were operated at full capacity. After Zhong Textile took over, only more than 30,000 spindles were operated at the beginning. After more than ten months of hard work, on the Chairman's birthday, all the spindles in the seven mills were completely operated at full capacity, which not only broke the record of the Japanese occupation era, but also was a miracle in the national industrial world. Economic Construction Association Holds Annual Meeting; Weng Wenhao Points Out Three Key Points for Current Economic Construction; Also Suggests Opening Zhoushan Port and Building the Beijing-Xiamen Railway [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The sixth annual meeting of the China Economic Construction Association opened at 9:00 AM on the 2nd at the Bank of China in Nanjing, with more than 80 members attending, including Weng Wenhao and Gu Zhenggang. Chairman Shen Junyi reported on the brief history of the establishment and the purpose of this annual meeting. Weng Wenhao gave a speech, pointing out three key points for current economic construction: (1) Strive to increase production and reduce inflation; (2) Recommend that the government reduce transportation costs, subsidize the coal industry, and reduce the consumption of foreign oil to reduce the cost of various goods; (3) The biggest crisis at present is the sharp decrease in exports. We should immediately increase the production of local products, and the government should buy them in large quantities and sell them abroad to fight for international status. Finally, he suggested that in order to improve domestic and foreign transportation, Zhoushan should be opened as a free port to connect with the Southeast, and the Beijing-Xiamen Railway should be built to communicate with the Southeast. After Gu Zhenggang gave a speech, he continued the business report and discussed the central issues. In the afternoon, he discussed specialized issues such as capital, trade, industry and mining, public utility systems, and Japanese compensation to China, all of which had good conclusions. The election will be held in the evening, and there will be a comprehensive discussion at the general meeting on the morning of the 3rd. After the meeting, the entire group will travel to Wuxi. Changlu Salt Exported to Japan; 600,000 Dan Have Been Transported; Another 300,000 Dan Will Be Transported to Korea [Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] Since the restoration of Changlu Salt Administration, 600,000 dan of edible salt have been exported to Japan, and another 300,000 dan will be transported to Korea recently. The salt fields under the jurisdiction of the administration currently have more than 400,000 mu, and are expected to produce 7.56 million dan in the 35th year. In addition to supplying food for the people, some chemical plant raw materials also depend on it entirely, making it the largest salt production area in the country. Editorial: The Re-Proposal of International Disarmament Since Stalin published a letter and a conversation with the president of the United Press, due to the mild wording, many people think that the publication of this conversation may promote the adjustment of US-Soviet relations. In his written answers, Stalin did not think that US-Soviet relations were becoming tense, and even stated that the Soviet Union still intended to lend money to the United States. However, on the other hand, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the representative of Belarus criticized the British and American troops stationed overseas at the meeting, and Molotov also made a speech at the meeting, criticizing the British and American measures. In Molotov's speech, in addition to raising the issue of disarmament, he also criticized the British policy in India, the Dutch policy in the Dutch East Indies, the United Nations' control of atomic energy, and the failure to establish the trusteeship system. This is tantamount to dropping a bomb on Western countries. If Stalin's written words can cause some adjustment in US-Soviet relations, the publication of Molotov's speech has launched a diplomatic struggle between the Soviet Union and Western countries such as Britain and the United States. The first answer to Molotov's speech was the speech by US representative Austin, who said: "Molotov's speech yesterday seemed to have distrust and misunderstanding of the motives of the United States and others. I do not believe that mutual accusations between allies can promote the realization of unity." He bluntly gave a frank answer to Molotov from the beginning; but in fact, he made a deeper counter-proposal to the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal. Molotov's first point in his four proposals was to ask the General Assembly to consider the issue of general disarmament, while the US representative's counter-proposal was one step further than the Soviet Union's proposal, advocating that in addition to general disarmament, there should also be effective guarantees and international investigation of armaments. Under this position, the US representative supported the Soviet Union's proposal, but added counter-proposals for arms investigation and other safeguards. All of this seems to us outsiders a bit like attacking your shield with your own spear. The proposal of the disarmament issue, if it is intended to create a kind of international moral force to reduce the armaments of other countries, then in view of the past history, it may not be a guarantee for peace. US representative Austin saw this point clearly and first gave the Soviet Union's Molotov a frank answer: "Our unilateral disarmament after the First World War was a mistake. We must not allow this mistake to be repeated today." This is US representative Austin's frank talk. In fact, according to Stalin's speech, the Soviet Union has stationed 60 divisions of troops in various European countries; and the number of people contained in the so-called division is estimated to be inconsistent. According to Churchill, it is generally estimated that the Soviet Union has more than 2 million armed forces in various European countries, and the details of the troops in the Soviet Union itself are still unknown. Then, if you want to reduce armaments, the Soviet Union itself should first have a factual expression. The tragedy and comedy about disarmament after the First World War is still fresh in my mind, just as US representative Austin said: "We must not allow this mistake to be repeated today." Therefore, in addition to supporting the proposal for disarmament, there must be investigation and guarantee measures. In Molotov's speech, he also mentioned the conspiracies of "imperialists" like Churchill who were making trouble and undermining peace; this echoed what Stalin mentioned in his written speech. Churchill is an person out of office, and any of his remarks cannot directly have a practical political impact; and the Soviet leader and his foreign minister have repeatedly criticized him, which can be said to be an overestimation of Churchill. No matter what his political views are, Churchill is still an experienced old politician. In this Second World War, he also had close contact with the Soviet Union, especially with Stalin. Therefore, the criticism of Churchill is tantamount to criticizing Britain and the United States. As for the issue of atomic energy control and the establishment of the trusteeship system, the distance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is still very far. At the United Nations meeting, there was another repetition of the style of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the Paris Peace Conference. Can this distance be bridged? Or should we choose to continue this situation and make the distance farther and farther? For the sake of world peace, we must use all our strength to bridge this distance. However, the most important issue is still the change in psychology. If we do not change from psychology, all efforts will be in vain. Wallace advocated using "appeasement" to change the heart of the Soviet Union; but in view of the past painful history, how can we use appeasement to change the heart of a country again? It has been more than a year since Germany and Japan surrendered, but there are still no signs of peace in the international situation. Now there is only an armed truce. The United Nations organization is the hope for maintaining world peace. We hope that under the auspices of the United Nations, there can be genuine international coordination to achieve world peace. Good Lighting, Good Life! Light is loved by everyone; darkness is hated by everyone. Light is morality, darkness is sin. Light has hope; darkness is doomsday. The ancestors of electricity, Westinghouse and Edison, racked their brains, spent their energy, and tested and retested before turning night into light. We Chinese also enjoy the fruits of their labor. We should prostrate ourselves and admire them, and at the same time thank God for giving us this unearned blessing. However, we are too disappointing. After fifty years of "reform", "revolution", "westernization", "construction", etc., we are still living the lives of our ancestors when we step into the interior. At night, the streets are pitch black and you can't see your fingers. The room is dimly lit, and you feel sorry for yourself. It's simply not like the world of civilized people! Now things are getting worse and worse, and life is getting worse and worse. The originally bright cities have also degenerated into a dark world. The dignified capital is having trouble generating electricity, and there are power outages every other day. Shanghai, which was built for us, also has a power shortage panic. Not only are red and green neon lights being banned, but starting this month, ordinary citizens will also be forced to use electricity at a "30% discount." Who can guarantee that there will not be rotating power outages in the future? Seeing this little thing of lighting, our hearts ache, like a sesame seed cake that is scorched on both sides. A country is not afraid of foreign enemies, but afraid of foreign enemies and not trying to improve itself. Many modern countries have been built up from wars. Now we have been beaten by others. We have finally won, but we have not been able to build anything in the long year after the war, and even the lights are still dimming. It's really sigh! A power outage is an unavoidable and necessary measure during wartime. This is a morbid state. Could it be that this disease is going to be or is it contagious? It has already spread from the capital to the capital, and it will also spread to Shanghai. Who dares to guarantee that it will not spread chaotically like a plague in the future? I remember on the morning of May 19, 1780, the eastern part of the United States, New England, suddenly became pitch black. By the afternoon, the blackness was even deeper, like a starless night, like a large and heavy magic hand covering people's eyes, like an ocean of ink pressing on people's chests, causing great fear. This day is commonly known as "America's First Black Friday". Many people ran to the church to pray, confessing their sins and begging God for forgiveness. What sins do we ordinary people have to suffer long-term "Black Fridays"? The lack of electricity is due to the lack of coal, or there is a problem with the machines. China has coal, and foreign countries have machines. Why do we have to create an "artificial" shortage of coal? "Artificial" lack of machines? Who is causing internal strife? Who is preventing the transportation of coal and machines? Who is controlling the transportation and sale of coal and not allowing everyone to rush to buy and transport it? Who is creating sin and darkness? As fish swim in water, they know whether it is cold or warm. In the atomic age, some people are cursing the fact that the lights are not good, which leads to a bad life, in a country where it is as bright as day at night. Recently, two writers, G. Nelson and H. Wright, complained about unsatisfactory lighting. They said that people neglect lighting, that the fluorescent lights in the "Holland Tunnel" are not ideal, and that the electricity in the Gang Province is the dumbest thing in the world, because it will slow down reading, make your eyes tired, and the iris will initially adapt and open to the largest hole, and produce a lot of retinal fluid, which is so unhygienic. The Dodge factory is manufacturing B29 bombers, and the factory spends 2.7 million US dollars just on lighting equipment; if the reward for production is not enough to compensate for this consumption, how can the factory owner spend this huge sum of money? Nara and Liang advocate using three-way lamps, light bulbs with reflectors, and recommend silver and crystal lamps to concentrate the light. They advocate installing various lights in refrigerators, wardrobes, drawers, and even next to the mirrors in bathrooms. Most modern cars have lights installed on the mudguards to illuminate the ignition

### Government States Further Concessions, Agreeing to Immediate Reorganization of the National Government Committee; Mediators from All Sides to Convene Again Tomorrow for Discussion

[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 2nd] A new avenue for peace talks emerged again on the 2nd. Zhang Junmai arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd and paid a visit to the Chairman at 3 p.m., presenting a new proposal. It is said that the proposal is simple and easy to implement, but Zhang is unwilling to disclose the details. Government representatives visited the Chairman on the evening of the 1st and, after learning of the Chairman's policy on the current situation, Shao Lizi and Lei Zhen visited Mo Dehui to inform him of this opinion. In the morning of the 2nd, the Third Party convened again to listen to Mr. Mo's report and discuss everything. In the afternoon, Liang Shuming and Shen Junru visited Zhou Enlai to convey the government's views. It is understood that the government has made concessions on the reorganization of the National Government Committee, agreeing to immediately reorganize the National Government Committee, but due to the urgency of time, it intends to reorganize the Executive Yuan after the National Assembly convenes. However, the Communist side still insists that both should be reorganized at the same time, so there are still discrepancies in fact. According to a certain relevant source, the Party is currently in a position to consider the cessation of hostilities on the ground, so everything is still in a delicate balance. The Democratic League and others have decided to hold another meeting on the 4th to discuss everything.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, dispatch on the 2nd] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, told the press that the central government has agreed to reorganize the National Government Committee before the opening of the National Assembly, and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized after all parties participate in the National Assembly.

[United Press, Nanjing, dispatch on the 2nd] The government accepted the proposal of mediators from all sides on the 2nd, and intended to conduct direct negotiations with the Communist Party, but must base the discussion on the eight points proposed by Chairman Chiang. In view of the fact that this method will inevitably be rejected by the Communist Party, the leaders of the mediators from all sides suspended all meetings on the 3rd and will discuss this issue again at 3 p.m. on Monday.

[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 2nd] U.S. Ambassador Stuart visited the Chairman at 9 a.m. on the 2nd, and after an hour-long meeting, went to the church to attend the wedding of an American, serving as the officiant.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] A source from the Third Party told reporters: the informal consultations in the capital have not stopped, and all parties are still maintaining close contact. Recently, the Third Party has suggested convening a comprehensive group of the Political Consultative Conference or an informal comprehensive talk, which is also a way to solve the problem. In short, the Third Party is still willing to make its best efforts to make the consultation a success as soon as possible and to achieve peace as soon as possible. Judging from the general trend, if the current situation can take a sharp turn for the better, so that all practical problems can be preliminarily understood, then the future of the overall situation can be optimistic. According to reporters' investigations, the representatives of the Third Party returning to Shanghai, except for the representative of the Youth Party who needs to stay for a few days to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Tenth Congress of the Party, Hu and Zhang Junmai have already arrived in Beijing on the 1st.

### Zhang Jia'ao Passes Through Beiping to Go to Beijing; Gan Jiaxin Talks About the Principles of Reconstructing the Northeast; Political and Cultural Education Should Be Given More Importance Than the Economy

In addition, Zhongwei Gan Jiaxin went to the Northeast to inspect and recently came to Beiping. He spoke to reporters about his views on the reconstruction of the Northeast, saying: The Northeast has a deep foundation and economic recovery is easy to succeed. However, it should be in line with national policy. Currently, there seems to be a sign that people are competing for things that are profitable, and let things that are slightly difficult survive on their own. This is really a big problem.

This is a major progress in the National Army's aid to the Battle of Baoding. It is understood that Xushui is only one stop away from Baoding by the Caohe River, which can be said to be very close. However, Xushui and Gucheng are said to be places on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway where the terrain is suitable for combat. The Communist army has built fortifications and stationed heavy troops here. Whether there will be a fierce battle is of great concern to people here.

Now that the county seat has been recovered, a county magistrate is urgently needed to take over the county administration. In addition, the National Army attacking from Baoding and the National Army recovering Xushui may meet in Caohe on the 3rd. The Communist army in Caohe adopted a pocket defense. The National Army has considerable confidence in breaking their defense. After the recovery of Xushui City, order is gradually being restored. Most of the city walls have been destroyed. The National Army first occupied Xushui Railway Station and then completely occupied the city. Military Commander Mu Tingfang inspected Gucheng with Cui Shichang, Commissioner of the Sixth Administrative District of Hebei, and reporters from this newspaper last night. Commissioner Cui went to Dingxing that night, and Mr. Mu and the reporters stayed in Gucheng. One hour after the National Army recovered Xushui City on the afternoon of the 2nd, Military Commander Mu and the reporter from this newspaper went to Xushui together, while Commissioner Cui summoned the Baojia chiefs in Gucheng to give instructions, discussing helping the National Army repair the railway and highway, and expand public security.

### Drafting International Trade Charter, Our Representative Submits Memorandum; Trade Restrictions and Other Items Must Be Revised

[French News Agency, Washington, dispatch on the 1st] The Preparatory Committee of the International Trade and Employment Conference is currently being held in London. According to the US State Department spokesman, the drafting work of the "International Trade Organization" general charter is progressing rapidly, beyond [illegible] expectations. The Preparatory Committee has now accepted the draft charter submitted by the United States as the basis for discussion and is expected to complete the drafting by the end of November, so that it can be submitted to the International Trade and Employment Conference for discussion.

[Central News Agency, London, special dispatch on the 1st] The Chinese delegation has submitted a memorandum to the Preparatory Committee of the International Trade and Employment Conference, proposing to revise several articles related to trade restrictions and tariff adjustments proposed by the US representative in the World Trade Charter. The memorandum stated that the use of inappropriate quantitative restrictions as a means of adjusting trade should be avoided. The Chinese delegation believes that it cannot accept the suggestion that adjusting tariff rates alone is sufficient to help countries with backward industry and commerce. The memorandum explained the Chinese delegation's opinion, with the reason that: "Tariff protection has been considered too high before it has fully achieved the expected results. This act not only violates the purpose of the conference, but will also increase domestic prices and damage the national economy." If tariffs are too low, foreign non-essential goods and luxury goods will flood the domestic market, making it impossible for domestic industrialization to be realized. "Tariff rates that are too high or too low will lead to adverse results in the transitional period for countries with backward industry and commerce. It is not easy to find a suitable balance. The Chinese delegation deeply feels that countries with backward industry and commerce must adopt commodity quotas or tariff quotas to adjust their national treasuries." The memorandum explained that: Countries with long-term trade deficits, such as China, must restrict the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods, and allow the import of essential goods to preserve their exchange materials. In the transitional period, restricting the import of luxury goods and non-essential goods by registration is not only necessary but also reasonable. This selective restriction only affects the types of imported goods, but does not affect the total quantity of imports. Regarding the definition of "reasonable quantitative restrictions" that countries with backward industry and commerce can adopt during the "transitional period." The memorandum stated that the period cannot be stipulated in advance, and the date is not determined by the situation of currency reserves and payments. Currency reserves and payments are the main indicators of financial stability and industrial development. Therefore, the Chinese representative proposed that the transitional period should be extended to (1) 50% of workers are employed in modern industrial enterprises, which are either producers or distributors. (2) 50% of its national income comes from modern industrial, commercial, and financial enterprises. The Chinese delegation hopes that these articles can be added to the final World Trade Charter, so that countries with backward industry and commerce can accelerate their industrialization process and finally expand world trade.

### Latest Atomic Bomb, 20 Feet Long and Weighing 4 Tons, U.S. Currently Stockpiles 100

[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd]: The "Daily Express" reports that the latest type of atomic bomb is approximately 20 feet long and weighs approximately 4 tons. The United States has a stockpile of about one hundred. The bomb is so long and large due to the complex detonation mechanism it contains. The detonation mechanism is a long cylinder, with two rods of radiant plutonium metal at each end. These strips do not react when separated, but when they suddenly come into contact, they explode violently. As for its great weight, it is because the bomb is lined with thick lead on the outside to insulate the dangerous radiation within.

### Second Public Auction of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate, Trust Bureau States: Unwilling to Handle Problems Arising, Management Bureau States: Abiding by Directives to Enrich National Treasury, Tens of Thousands of Residents Fear Loss of Homes and Disputes

Since the victory, the housing shortage in this city has been severe. The Central Trust Bureau, to assist the government in solving housing difficulties, had planned to build apartments for sale, with an estimated cost of 40 billion yuan. A consortium of national and commercial banks was established and a method for raising construction funds was proposed and submitted to the Joint Treasury for approval. This plan was just passed by the 325th meeting of the council on October 24th. Before its implementation, all the residents of enemy and puppet houses on Weihai Road, Wusong Road, Wuzhou Road, Zhaopu Road, Changzhi Road, Yuhang Road, Tanggu Road, and other places in this city became panicked by the Central Trust Bureau's public announcement of the second auction of the aforementioned enemy and puppet real estate. They were particularly concerned about the provision in item 11 of the bidding instructions, which stated that all auctioned houses must be vacated within 20 days of signing the preliminary agreement. Yesterday, all the residents jointly issued an appeal. In addition to the opinions of all tenants, which are detailed in the announcement, a responsible person from the real estate department of the Central Trust Bureau stated: "This is the second time our bureau has handled the auction of enemy and puppet real estate, purely entrusted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region. This auction totals 39 units. The purpose of handling this business is to provide service, and we really do not wish to handle the indirect problems that arise." The opinion of Shen Guanya, director of the secretariat of the Enemy Property Management Bureau, is that the auction of enemy property to enrich the national treasury is being implemented gradually according to government directives. According to the principles of handling enemy property, it has long been stipulated that all auctioned houses should first maintain the original tenants, based on the original lease contracts. It is by no means that the successful bidder can force the tenants to move out. Of course, if the original lease has already expired, that should be treated differently. Regarding issues such as the equipment and renovations in the original house, according to lease customs, when returning to the original owner, the house should be restored to its original condition. The above points, including legal and customary issues, can achieve a reasonable solution by mutual reference."

[Report from this Newspaper] According to reporters' inquiries, if the 39 units of enemy and puppet real estate auctioned by the Central Trust Bureau this time are sold and the original tenants are forced to move out, more than ten thousand people will immediately become homeless. In addition to an urgent appeal, all the residents are also appealing to the City Council and other relevant authorities.

### Visiting the Flagship Taikang, Radar Installed on the Deck, Depth Charges Carried on the Stern, Britain Donates Eight Small Boats to be Delivered to China in Batches

[Report from this Newspaper] The flagship Taikang, one of the eight warships donated to our country by the United States, recently arrived in Shanghai for repairs at the Gaochangmiao Jiangnan Shipyard. Yesterday, the Navy Fleet Command specially invited the city's press to visit. At 2:00 p.m., they gathered at the department on Huangpu Road and first held a tea party. Chief of Staff Wei Jimin, the returning naval officers who had been training in England, led by Wang Huien, Instructor Bai Shumin, who is about to go to England to receive warships, and the Taikang's captain, Gao Ju, reported on the Navy's recent situation. Then, they took a small motorboat to visit the Taikang.

The naval officers and soldiers who trained in England left Chongqing via Calcutta and Mumbai last November, totaling 28 officers and over 250 cadets. After arriving in February this year, they began studying and training for seven months. Currently, except for a portion who remain temporarily in England, 16 officers and 86 cadets have completed their studies and returned to China. Three more officers and a portion of the cadets will also be driving eight small boats donated by the British to Shanghai in the near future.

These small boats will arrive in China in three batches. The first batch of three is already en route, the second batch of three has now departed, and the third batch of two can also be expected to arrive before the end of the year. Each boat weighs 40 tons and has a speed of twelve nautical miles per hour. Their characteristic is that they have great wave resistance and can continue to sail for three or four days, making them suitable for patrolling or guarding harbors.

In addition to the eight small boats, Britain is also donating one cruiser and two submarines. The naval authorities have appointed Colonel Deng Zhaoxiang to lead 600 officers and soldiers to receive them, and they will depart within a week.

The flagship Taikang is an escort destroyer. In February of last year, our receiving personnel arrived in Miami for training, and formally took receipt on August 28th. At the beginning of January this year, it left the U.S. and went to a military port in Cuba for tactical training, and only started its journey back to China in April. The entire ship is 300 feet long and over 20 feet wide, with a displacement of 1,430 tons and 680 horsepower. There are two machine guns with a caliber of 3 inches, two with a caliber of 40 mm, and nine with a caliber of 20 mm. There is radar installed on the top of the ship, divided into air and surface types. The stern carries many depth charges, all controlled by electricity. The ship has now been repaired and will patrol the coast in the future.

Furthermore, according to Chief of Staff Wei, the Navy's Shanghai Resident Office will be closed down. In the past year, the office received over 350 warehouses, with a total value of over 80 billion yuan, mostly containing clothing, ammunition, food, vehicles, and other materials.

### New Methods for Collecting Water Deposit

The new unified collection method for water deposits in this city, proposed by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, has been amended and approved by the 51st Municipal Administration Meeting of the Municipal Government, and will be announced by the respective water companies within days and implemented from November. The methods are as follows: (A) The amount of deposit required from old users is based on twice the average monthly water bill of the user in the previous twelve months. (B) For new water users, if several houses share one public water meter, the deposit is charged based on the number of houses, with each house (based on the street number) being charged 4,000 yuan. If it is a separate meter, the amount charged is based on the size of the new water pipe's diameter. For example, for a new water pipe with a diameter of 13 mm, the minimum deposit amount is 6,000 yuan for ordinary users and 12,000 yuan for commercial users. For 20 mm, it is 9,000 yuan for ordinary users and 16,000 yuan for commercial users. For 25 mm, it is 12,000 yuan for ordinary users and 24,000 yuan for commercial users. For 40 mm, it is 15,000 yuan for ordinary users and 32,000 yuan for commercial users. For 50 mm, it is 18,000 yuan for ordinary users and 40,000 yuan for commercial users. For 75 mm, it is 60,000 yuan for ordinary users and 80,000 yuan for commercial users. For 100 mm, it is 90,000 yuan for ordinary users and 160,000 yuan for commercial users. Furthermore, if the water price changes, the amount of deposit required from new and old users can be adjusted. Old users can adjust according to the new price and the regulations in section (A), while new users must first submit a request to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval before they can adjust.

### Anti-Chinese Riots in Korea, Overseas Chinese Lives Unprotected, Appeal to Government to Send Personnel to Protect Them, A Batch of Refugees from Japan and Korea Arrive in Shanghai

One hundred and fifty-four refugees from Japan and Korea returned to China on the U.S. transport ship O-043 the day before yesterday, of which 73 were overseas Chinese from Japan and 81 were overseas Chinese from Korea. They were escorted to Shanghai by Wang Jitang, a representative from the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce. According to Wang, the total number of refugees returning to China this time is 218, and the rest are from Tianjin, Beijing, Guangdong, and Taiwan, and will be sent by the U.S. on separate ships. Currently, the situation faced by our overseas Chinese in Korea is extremely serious. Since the victory, the lives and properties of our overseas Chinese have been plundered, with more than 200 cases of brutal killings. Furthermore, Koreans repatriated from our country to Korea have spread all kinds of malicious rumors that are unfavorable to us, provoking emotions between the Chinese and Korean people. Recently, there have been riots in Nando (place name), and overseas Chinese are in a very dangerous situation. If the government does not send personnel to protect overseas Chinese or telegraph the Korean Military Government to protect them soon, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Korea will all return to China because their lives and properties cannot be guaranteed. Today, these refugees brought with them two petitions from Ding Yuangan, president of the Seoul Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Jiang Maozhen, chairman of the Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce, addressed to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They will be submitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within one or two days, they said.

### MGM Cinema No Longer to be Built, Public Works Bureau Approves Alternative Plan for Underground Parking Lot, All Vehicles Must Park at the Racecourse

[Report from this Newspaper] After the news spread that the American company MGM Film Company was preparing to build a first-class cinema in Shanghai, people here were very concerned. However, the architectural drawings of the cinema have not yet been drafted, and it is said that all the equipment will be designed by the American headquarters. After the Municipal Public Works Bureau passed the proposal, it sent a letter to the person in charge of the company, outlining the principles that must be followed in building in this city. The company can accept all the conditions, but they find it very difficult to establish a parking lot. The open space at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Meibage Road is not very large. According to the conditions of the Public Works Bureau, a certain amount of open space must be left in front of the cinema for future widening of the road. If a parking lot is also built, it is practically impossible. Therefore, it is proposed to build the parking lot underground, with entrance and exit tunnels on both sides of the cinema. However, the Public Works Bureau believes that the above facilities are extremely inconvenient, and the movement of vehicles will inevitably be slow and congested, thereby hindering traffic on the road. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the company asking them to abandon this plan. Regarding the parking lot issue, an alternative plan has been approved, namely that all vehicles entering and exiting the cinema are only allowed to park at the edge of the racecourse, and then the audience can walk to the cinema to watch the show. However, the cinema must send employees to maintain order at the parking area regularly to avoid any violations. It is heard that the authorities of MGM Film Company have expressed their willingness to comply with the proposal.

[Report from this Newspaper] At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, while Judge Shen of the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court was holding court, a middle-aged woman suddenly appeared, holding an infant and wearing a petition on her head, shouting for justice. According to her petition, her name is Xu Liangzhen, 34 years old, from Anhui, and she lives at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in Yangshupu.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I recently read a cessation notice published in the November 2nd issue of the Democratic Weekly, which stated, "In addition to the police bureau repeatedly issuing secret orders to ban this publication, it also instructed the Shanghai Newspaper Association to notify all newspaper vendors not to sell this publication." Our association is the only trade organization for newspapers in this city and was only formally established on October 17th. We have never received any instructions from the police bureau ordering our association to notify newspaper vendors not to sell the publication. The statement in the notice that "the Shanghai Newspaper Association" forbids newspaper vendors from selling the publication is something our association has never heard of, and thus "the Shanghai Newspaper Association" is unrelated to our association. Fearing that the confusion of names and inaccurate rumors may cause misunderstanding, we are writing to request that your newspaper publish this fact to show our seriousness. Sincerely, Shanghai Newspaper Commercial Association.

### The YWCA Launches Fundraising Drive - Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday - Target of 180 Million Yuan - First Prize Winner is the Mayor's Wife's Original Chinese Painting

[Our Report] The Shanghai Chinese Christian Women's Youth Association's 38th fundraising conference, led by General Captain Huang Zhuoqun, wife of Mayor Wu, will launch a fundraising campaign from the 11th to the 23rd of this month with a target of 180 million yuan. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the association held a grand opening ceremony at Mayor Wu's private residence on Anfu Road. Mayor Wu's wife, Deputy General Captains Yan Huiqing's wife and Huang Zuoting's wife, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou, and about 300 local dignitaries, both Chinese and foreign, attended. Ms. Shen Zhoucuiying served as chairwoman.

Promote and Accomplish Mission

Mayor Wu's wife delivered a speech: The YWCA is an organization that promotes light. During the enemy-puppet period, it was unable to carry out its work due to oppression by evil forces. Now that Shanghai has been recovered, it is necessary to eliminate the darkness of the enemy-puppets. The YWCA's responsibility is particularly great. I hope that all sectors of society will work together to help it accomplish its mission.

Needs Light, Increase Strength

Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, briefly stating: Today, after attending the meeting and reading your association's work report, I was struck by the words "a source of light." Shanghai does indeed need light, and only light can add strength. Women bear a large part of the responsibility in society, at least half. If the YWCA has sufficient funding, its future will be limitless. From now on, the YWCA will carry out a kind of work, and the effectiveness of the work will depend entirely on the results of everyone's participation in fundraising. Finally, I wish the fundraising success.

Women Have Great Responsibility

Mr. Kong Xiangxi stated: There are many jobs in society that men cannot do well. Women have great responsibility. For the sake of the country and society, we should support the YWCA's fundraising and not just express it verbally. Deputy Speaker Xu also believes that the work of the YWCA is indeed necessary and is confident that it will exceed expectations. Subsequently, Ms. Wang Xiuqing reported on the association's fundraising and affairs, and Ms. Gao Junzhe reported on fundraising organization matters. This fundraising is divided into 50 teams. In addition to the three general and deputy captains, there are also 12 fundraising committee members, including Mr. and Mrs. Wang Xinkang, and Mrs. Chen Xing. There are 36 advisors, including Kong Xiangxi, Pan Gongzhan, Xi Wang, Wang Renlin, Liu Hongsheng, and Xi Debing.

The number of members in each team varies, and the team leaders are all well-known ladies and women in Shanghai.

After the fundraising amount is announced, the first-place individual can receive a valuable Chinese painting personally painted by General Captain Wu, the Mayor's wife. Exquisite prizes will also be awarded to the top five individuals and groups.

### Rendell Case Concluded - Sentencing on the Morning of the 5th - Defendant Asks for Appeal to be Dismissed - Original Ruling of Non-Acceptance Upheld - Two American Military Officers Testify on the Date of the Reception - Another Battle of Wits Between Lawyers from Both Sides

[Our Report] The district court has already ruled that American United Press reporter Rendell is not guilty in the defamation case filed by Shen Ke, a suspected Nazi spy. However, Shen Ke's side is still unwilling to accept this and has appealed to the High Court, which continued the hearing yesterday morning. First, Judge Wang Jian opened the court to continue investigating the evidence for about two hours, and then adjourned the court. After ten minutes, he reopened the collegiate court for trial, with Chief Judge Zhang Qinglan of the Criminal Court serving as the presiding judge, and Judges Wang Jian and Zhang Shijie as jurors. The lawyers on both sides argued fiercely. At 1:20 PM, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 AM on November 5th.

During yesterday's investigation of evidence, most of the time was spent proving the date on which the American military reporters' reception was held. Because the Zilin West News, which used the United Press draft, was published on April 16th, and the certificate provided by the American military to Rendell proving that the content of the draft was consistent with the report of the reporters' reception, mistakenly stated that the date of the reception was also April 16th, which caused a contradiction. Because the materials from the meeting on that day could not have been seen in the newspaper that morning. However, Major O'Connor and Captain Farrell, the prosecutors from the American military court who provided the certificate yesterday, personally appeared in court to testify that the reception was actually held on April 15th, and that Rendell and Cushing et al. released the news based on the report on that day. The date mentioned in the certificate was indeed a mistake due to a lack of detailed investigation. When O'Connor et al. took the witness stand, they saluted the court, which is rarely seen in Chinese courts.

### O'Connor Expresses Apology for Mistaking Meeting Date

O'Connor said: I apologize to the court for the mistake in the meeting date due to being very busy. The reception was actually held at the American Club from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 15th. It was indeed said at the reception that Shen Ke was sent by the German government to Chongqing to investigate the activities of our secret personnel in the coastal areas and the routes of United Nations personnel sneaking into the interior. O'Connor emphasized that the points published in the Shen Ke case were indeed unknown to the outside world before the press conference, and only became clear to the world after the conference. In fact, the meeting was held after Shen Ke was arrested. At this time, lawyer Yao suddenly asked: Was Shen Ke's activity location in Shanghai or Chongqing? If Shen's activities were in Shanghai, and after China and Germany declared war, then Shanghai was already controlled by Germany at that time, and it could not constitute espionage. The court then reminded lawyer Yao: "This is within the scope of the American military court." Rendell's defense lawyer Chen Tingrui also said: "It is the responsibility of the American military court to prove Shen Ke's guilt or innocence. If lawyer Yao has any profound arguments, why not publish them in the military court?"

### Captain Farrell Provides Supplementary Evidence

Captain Farrell then provided supplementary evidence, saying: He himself also attended the reporters' reception on that day. About a week or so before this day, he had notified the German on April 15th to report to 53 Fuzhou Road. They arrived around 9:00 AM that morning and were arrested by Major O'Connor. There were many news reporters and photographers on the scene at that time. Rendell and Cushing et al. asked about the details of the matter, and we went to the nearby American Club together and published the case in one question. I myself had long been ordered to investigate the activities of the Nazi intelligence agency Ohard Bureau. When I was under General Zhang Fakui's command in my early years, I had assisted in the investigation. After coming to Shanghai last November, I continued to investigate the case. All the investigation results, in addition to being sent to the American military headquarters, have also been sent to General Zhang Fakui's headquarters for filing. I had informed Mr. Lun Jiner of the facts of the case, and Mr. Lun later published it. And what I told him that day was actually more than just the materials published in the newspaper. Fa also said: The date on the certificate was wrong because the files were not checked in a hurry. Other than that, everything is true and reliable, and there is proof. The court then asked what kind of proof? He replied that it could prove that Shen Ke was a traitor from the beginning to the end before and during the war! At this time, lawyer Chen stood up and said? The date of the reporters' reception and the content discussed at the meeting have all been proven, and Rendell's report is even more proven to be true.

### Sharp Words on Both Sides - Extremely Tense Atmosphere

When these two American military officers were testifying, the lawyers on both sides stood on both sides, and the words of interrogation were very sharp, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. However, lawyer Yao seemed not to have expected the defendant's side to say that these two people would appear in court. During the interrogation, perhaps due to insufficient preparation, he eventually retreated in dismay. The court ordered the end of the investigation. At that time, Judge Wang left the seat, and after about ten minutes, he reopened the collegiate court for trial.

When lawyer Yao described the reasons for the appeal, he said: (1) Rendell's report was inconsistent with the facts. (2) Even if Shen Ke had activities, his activities were in his own country or the occupied territory of the Allies, which could not constitute espionage. Therefore, Rendell's report was obviously a malicious insult. (3) Shen Ke did nothing wrong to China. Yao said: "Rendell can only prove the source of his news. If he said that it was told to me by others, I can be irresponsible, which is legally unfounded!"

### Lawyer Yao Makes Strange Arguments - Reporters Shocked

As soon as lawyer Yao said this, the reporters in the audience looked at each other in shock, thinking that people who interview social news in the future, if they are not also police chiefs or editors-in-chief, will be on trial every day like Lundir, and reporters who interview political or military news will be burdened at all times. And lawyer Yao then attacked the American military headquarters for not publishing the text of the case under investigation to the outside world first. Moreover, the criminal law stipulates that the text that can be reprinted includes the proceedings of the central and local meetings, the open trials of the court, and public meetings. Lawyer Rao claimed that he also knew about the importance of maintaining good relations with friendly nations, but for the sake of the law, he could not help but do what he knew was impossible. In the concluding remarks, he still requested that Rendell be punished as he deserved.

### The Responsibility of a News Reporter is to Collect Materials

The court then asked Rendell if he could prove that what he had recorded was indeed true? Rendell replied that he could prove it. In addition to the American military court Major O'Connor and Captain Farrell who have testified today, there are also Ge and Mei, who are responsible for investigating the case. In the American military court records presented at the last hearing, it can also be proved that Shen Ke is one of the highest-paid members of the O'Hart Bureau. Regarding the letters of evidence submitted by Ambassador Chen Jie and Mr. Wu Shaoshu, Rendell said: Shen Ke is indeed a "double spy." The responsibility of a news reporter is to collect new materials, weigh them, and then publish them to the world. News reporters are not people who specialize in investigating cases. I have been a reporter for more than 20 years, and I only know how to obtain materials from legitimate sources and report them faithfully. I am being tried today, which is really incomprehensible. On the point that news reporters do not have to do their own investigation work, I hope that a clear explanation will be given in the judgment. I have never known Shen Ke, but the defendant's side is certainly not unable to present evidence of Shen Ke's crimes.

Lawyer Chen believed that the letters of evidence from Chen Jie and Wu Shaoshu that were favorable to Shen Ke had no value in the evidence unless they were proved by appearing in court to testify. Rendell also said angrily: Just now, lawyer Yao said that Shen Ke's activities in his Ming Dynasty occupied territory could not constitute a crime, so wouldn't Wang Jingwei's activities in the territory occupied by Japan also not constitute a crime?

### The Spokesperson is Responsible for Whether the News is True

Lawyer Chen stood up to argue that there are obviously two facts in this case: (1) The source of Rendell's record is based on the press conference hosted by the American military. If there is no fabricated or fabricated record, the defendant is not responsible. (2) Whether the news itself is true should be the responsibility of the spokesperson of the press conference, and the defendant is not responsible. The appellant's agent talked endlessly, a great theory, but combined these two into one, and even called Shen Ke a friend of the Republic of China, which is completely irrelevant to this case. As for whether Rendell's record of the American military press conference is correct, United Press is not the only one who has this record on that day, but also the United News Agency. If it was forged afterwards, how could it be the same? The appellant's side said that this newsletter was fabricated out of thin air and deliberately insulted Shen Ke, but in fact, the soil has been turned over, and there is a basis for the April 15th reception, and there are two people who attended at the time, Major and French Captain, to explain that Lun's record is completely the same as the report of the true reception, and there is no increase or decrease. In addition to the oral report on that day, the American military intelligence office also had a written record that Shen Ke came to China under the orders of the German high military authorities, which is the same as Rendell's record. Therefore, Rendell's record has been proven to be accurate. If Shen Ke wants to express that he is not a spy, he can present it in the American military court. This case should be discussed on a case-by-case basis and on a matter-by-matter basis. Whether Shen Ke is a spy or not does not need to be mentioned again, but if the court wants to know the details of this matter, the defendant's side also has evidence and is not afraid. Shen Ke endangered the Chinese government, endangered the Chinese nation, and endangered the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now, only because others recorded this kind of activity, he filed a lawsuit in the court of the country he intended to destroy, which is extremely absurd.

### Several Points of the First Instance Judgment Reason Cannot Agree

As for the reasons for the first-instance judgment, the defender also deeply feels that there are several things that cannot be agreed with: (1) The original judgment is based on Article 211 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which states that the victim of a crime can file a lawsuit. However, there is no explicit provision that an enemy alien can file a lawsuit. No matter what country or law, no law can include everything, so Article 1 of the Civil Code still emphasizes custom, and Article 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law also has this law or other laws. For example, ambassadors from various countries have extraterritorial jurisdiction, which is not within the scope of the Criminal Procedure Law. Recently, the court did not accept the case of the United Nations staff being accused, which is also an example. (2) So, is there a basis for the fact that enemy aliens cannot file a lawsuit? In the first instance, the plaintiff submitted Article 8 of the Hague Convention, whether it is an interpretation of the chapter, it is not known, and it is an established practice, not a mandatory provision. (3) From the perspective of international law, Germany has no responsible government. In other words, there is no government to abide by international law. Since the opposing party has no government, our court must insist on abiding by international law, and the defender cannot agree with it. (4) In the first instance, the plaintiff said that if enemy aliens cannot sue, then murder and robbery, as long as the victim is an enemy alien, will not be able to become a crime because they cannot sue, and the social order will be disrupted. This is indeed the original trial's wrong view, because the country has a prosecutor who can still sue. (5) Article 296 of the Criminal Procedure Law refers to public prosecution, and Article 360 should be cited for private prosecution. If a Qiao has behaviors that are detrimental to the host country and has not been allowed to reside by the host country government, he shall not file a private prosecution in accordance with the law. Therefore, today's request is for two points: (1) Reject the appeal; (2) Still ask for a ruling of non-acceptance.

Finally, Rendell still asked the court to conclude the case as soon as possible so that his work would not be affected. In addition to the two military judges of the American military court, Ge Lei and Mei Jun also appeared as witnesses for Rendell yesterday. The court believed that the case was clear, and Zhu Yu did not summon them.

### Routh Flies to Tokyo This Morning - Returns to the US After a Brief Stay

[Our Report] Routh, the publisher of the American "Time," "Life," and "Fortune" magazines, came to Shanghai a few days ago and met with President Jiang in Nanjing. After returning to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he will fly to Tokyo this morning and return to the United States after a brief stay. Mayor Wu and his wife specially hosted a banquet at their official residence on Anfu Road yesterday to invite and bid farewell to Mr. Routh. It is reported that Mr. Routh came here purely at the invitation of President Jiang to visit China and visit friends.

### Secret Radio Stations - Investigation Results - Most Have No Special Function - Only Profit-Making Commercial Institutions

[Our Report] Recently, the public security authorities have used scientific instruments to crack down on many secretly established radio stations. After an investigation, most of them have no special function and are only private commercial radio stations for profit. Due to the congestion of telecommunications agencies in this city, it often takes a very long time for businessmen to send business telegrams, and even the goods have arrived before the telegram has arrived. Therefore, private radio stations have emerged. However, since this type of radio station has not been approved by the government, it is illegal and will still be banned.

### Reader Consultation - Legal Questions

(1) Deposit Dispute

Wang Huizhen asked: My husband deposited 500 yuan in national currency into a certain firm in the first month of the 28th year and established a passbook stating that the annual interest rate was 1%. At that time, he gave the money to me as an engagement gift. It has been nearly eight years, and he has never paid a penny. Now I want to withdraw it. (1) Can I handle it according to the supplementary regulations for civil litigation after recovery? (2) How many times will it increase? (3) If the firm refuses to increase, what should I do?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui replied] (1) If you want to increase the payment, you can use the supplementary regulations for civil litigation after recovery as the basis. (2) There is no statutory standard for increasing the number of times. (3) If the debtor is unwilling to increase, there is no other way but to sue.

(2) Inheritance Tax Rate

Miao Yulin asked: I have several questions about inheritance tax. Please answer them. (1) My father passed away last winter and left four houses. In the 34th year, he made a will specifying that his son, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter each receive one house. The tax is a progressive system. According to the regulations, the tax is calculated. I would like to ask if the total price of the four houses is calculated, or the value of each person's share is calculated according to the rate. In the above situation, is there a difference between having a will and not having a will for taxation? (2) The descendants have their own property with a household name as proof. Can the bureau forcibly treat it as inheritance? (3) In addition to the funeral expenses listed in the deduction list (please also indicate the highest amount that can be filled in), can medical expenses be listed? (4) Has this tax been implemented in Shenxi, Suzhou, and other places? Also, what are the solutions to the bureau's illegal estimation and extortion?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui replied] (1) Inheritance tax is calculated and levied according to the total amount of inheritance. Inheritance is the same, and bequest is also the same. There is no distinction between having a will and not having a will. (2) The property owned by the descendants cannot be treated as inheritance. The necessary expenses for funerals are deducted, and the maximum limit is not more than 1 million yuan. As for the medical expenses used before death, they are not paid from the inheritance, so they are not included in the deduction. (4) The Inheritance Tax Law does not have the provision for regional implementation. Even if the collection has a priority, all regions must implement it. Regarding the tax assessment by the taxation agency, if you are not satisfied, you can ask the original agency to review it. If you are not satisfied with the review decision, you can apply to the Inheritance Tax Review Committee for review, but you should pay one-third of the tax within fifteen days of receiving the review decision from the taxation agency. Otherwise, the right to apply for review will be extinguished. If you are still not satisfied with the review decision, you can file a complaint according to the law. If the tax officials have extortion, it belongs to the scope of criminal law. Complaints and reports shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Law.

Initial Hearing of Drug Trafficking Case Via Air Transport ‚Äì All Defendants Offer Excuses and Deny Guilt

[Report from this newspaper] The large-scale drug trafficking case via air transport that was cracked by the Shanghai Police Bureau in mid-September resulted in the transfer of all thirteen criminals by the Police Bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office on September 23rd. The Prosecutor initiated a public prosecution, and the District Court held its first hearing yesterday afternoon. The defendants Sun Zhicheng, Li Hongying, Zhang Gentian, Zhang Yiren, Li Dingguo, Zhang Li Bingkun (female), Zhang Mingyuan, Yan Dongfu, Ma Xiangwu, Li Xinquan, and Song Zixin were all mentioned. Only Zhu Qishan was not mentioned due to illness. Judge Shen Tianbao questioned each defendant one by one. According to Sun Zhicheng, he is from Taiwan, a businessman, and arrived in Shanghai at the end of March last year. Afterwards, he traded drugs in Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, but denied purchasing morphine at Zhu Qishan's residence at No. 4 Kunshan Garden. He also claimed that the morphine found during the search was left in his care by a friend and did not belong to him. Zhang Yiren stated that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin before his arrest and that the two suitcases containing morphine were entrusted to him by a friend surnamed Yang, and he did not know what was inside. Zhang Mingyuan stated that he arrived in Shanghai by plane on September 11th and that the drugs were entrusted to him by his father-in-law. All the defendants denied knowledge of drug trafficking. Due to the complexity of the circumstances and the cunning of the defendants' statements, the interrogation was very difficult. The three defendants, Sun Zhicheng, Zhang Yiren, and Li Dingguo, also requested a medical examination, claiming that they were injured during interrogation at the police station. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing.

### Yichang Securities Company Bankrupt ‚Äì Losses Exceed 820 Million Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] Amidst the current downturn in the stock market, Yichang Securities Company (not a broker on the stock exchange), located on the fifth floor of the Gauze Building on Middle Zhengzheng Road in this city, suddenly declared bankruptcy yesterday. It is said that the company regularly engaged in wash sales, drawing in 3 million shares of Wing On Textile Factory this time. However, it ultimately succumbed to bankruptcy due to the continuous decline in the stock market in recent days. It is reported that the total loss reached a staggering 820 million yuan. Among them, two banks from the Sichuan group were affected by as much as 600 million yuan, and customers lost 200 million yuan. Furthermore, two or three other securities companies have also been impacted, causing instability. The company's manager, Mr. Wang, has disappeared and taken away 500,000 shares of Wing On in physical form. It is said that the actual losses this time may not be as high as reported, and there may be misconduct involved. It is now reported that the creditors are actively pursuing their claims.

Wash Sales Exposed, Stock Market Morale Weak

The Huagu stock market yesterday revealed panic before the opening due to the bankruptcy of a certain wash sale company in the Gauze Building. At the opening, the "three small heats" [three hot stocks] had already shown a slight decline. Wing On Textile was initially quoted at 650 yuan, but selling was prevalent, so the opening did not materialize, and it was revised to 640 yuan as the opening price. Xinhua followed suit, also dropping to 275 yuan at the opening. After the opening, a surge of buying orders emerged at lower prices, causing a rally. However, this was very brief, and prices gradually returned to their previous levels after the initial rise. At the same time, rumors were rampant in the market, and brokers were extremely panicked, many selling to protect themselves. Supply was unusually abundant, and short sellers also took advantage to demonstrate their strength. Midway, all prices fell to new lows. After 10:30, the market turned around after the lows, but the overall trend remained panicked. Later, wash sale companies outside the market stopped making new transactions and focused on settlements, gradually covering their short positions. Numbers 198, 89, and others were covering, and the Guang group, such as number 232 and others, also entered, gradually driving prices up. Near noon, the market fluctuated wildly, with strong short covering on the trading floor. As the closing approached, all prices rebounded. Absorption was evident in the "three small heats," and there was a willingness to strive for higher prices. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the hot stock Wing On Textile fell by 4%, while Mayar and Xinhua fell by more than half a percent. Jingfu and Xinguang showed a slight decline, while Qin Hing reversed course and rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, Cement, New Asia, and Huafeng remained flat, while Liann was slightly higher. The rest showed a slight decline of up to half a percent. The off-market stocks were relatively stable.

The trading of foreign stocks was sluggish, initially flat but then weakening. Market conditions remained devoid of fresh stimuli. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Huidong, Gangye, and Asia Paper fell by more than half a percent, while the rest did not fall much.

### Gold and Currency Both Loosen

Yesterday, the buying momentum for gold bars weakened slightly, and the Central Bank added pressure, causing a slight rebound followed by a decline. The morning opening was around 2.33 million yuan. After the opening, the market was relatively stable, with the high price not exceeding 2.335 million. Later, pressure gradually increased, and scattered sellers also closed their positions, leading to a downward trend. Prices gradually retreated to around 2.31 million. After 10:00, the Central Bank distributed 120 bars at a price of 2.31 million, which further dampened the market. Prices once fell to 2.302 million before stabilizing. At noon, the market hovered around 2.32 million. In the afternoon, it was heard that off-week trading had risen again to around 2.335 million. As a result, it closed down slightly by 8,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Decorative gold was priced at 46,000 yuan, silver dollars remained flat, and silver dollars decreased slightly. The black market interest rate was around 1.5 jiao.

Foreign currencies showed a loosening trend. In the black market for U.S. dollars, rumors of a ban on circulation resurfaced, causing sellers to retreat to 4,050 yuan, a continued decline from the previous day. The sales of Hong Kong currency were even more sluggish due to the rise of the Shanghai Telegraph. Yesterday, it dropped to around 890 yuan, a decrease of 20 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate was also brought down to around 880 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was around 1,070 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 14,100 yuan. All were sellers with few buyers. The official exchange rate for U.S. dollars remained unchanged, and transactions remained quiet.

### Hong Kong Gold Prices Plummet

Hong Kong, 1st (Telegraph) - Recently, the price of gold here has fallen to 293 yuan. After inquiring with relevant parties about the reason for the decline, it was said that the banks here had previously obtained approval from the Hong Kong authorities to order the first batch of 100,000 ounces of gold from Mexico, which had arrived in Hong Kong one after another as scheduled. With supply exceeding demand, market prices have fallen. Not long ago, the banks again requested the Hong Kong authorities to purchase another 70,000 ounces of gold from Mexico, which will also arrive in Hong Kong. According to general speculation, gold prices may continue to fall.

### Government Bonds Plunge

Yesterday, due to the dismal atmosphere among securities firms, a major player in the Gauze Building engaged in selling. Tongbing opened at 710 yuan and immediately faced selling pressure. Midway, it plummeted to around 1,370 yuan. Fuyuan made purchases at lower prices. As the closing approached, it hovered around 1,550 yuan. As a result, it closed down 180 yuan compared to the previous closing. Jia and Yi fell 120 yuan, Ding fell 50 yuan, and Tongwu also fell 90 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics Remain Firm

Recently, woolen fabrics of various colors at public tea parties have been in strong demand. Because the market supply is limited and buyer appetite is not weak, supply cannot meet demand. Most sellers are holding firm on prices. All retail and wholesale transactions are in cash. Even if checks are accepted due to special circumstances, the maximum period is only ten days.

### Improvement in Yarn Allocation ‚Äì Two Pieces per Order Changed ‚Äì Fine Yarn Also Increased

[Report from this newspaper] It is learned that the Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee has recently approved the request of the Replicated Products United Allocation Association to change the allocation of cotton yarn below 20 counts to two pieces per order. In addition, the variety of allocated yarn has been increased, including 40 counts TK yarn, 60 counts double strand, and 80 counts double strand, six strand, and other types.

### Cloth Prices Fall Below Cost ‚Äì Lightweight Double Horse at 1.88 Million

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market started weak and ended strong. In the early morning, because various factories allocated a considerable amount of 20-count yarn, many people in the industry were selling their existing inventory. As a result, Extra Double Horse once fell to 2.06 million, and lightweight even quoted 1.88 million and 1.89 million. The market was filled with cries of selling. Only the Hankou group made small purchases on the dips, because the Hankou market price was slightly higher than Shanghai, leaving room for profit. In addition, the Beijing and Guangdong groups also bought on the dips, and the price rebounded. At the closing, the gains and losses of 20-count yarn were mixed, but generally remained firm. However, 42-count machine yarn fell by about 30,000 to 50,000 due to slower sales.

Yesterday, the cloth market also continued to decline, mainly due to the tightening of credit, making purchasing power even weaker. The opening price of Leading Spinning Construction was only 80,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous price. Other mid-range products such as Wufu opened at only 76,000 yuan, and the number of applicants was virtually zero, demonstrating the bleak market situation. According to the allocation price of yarn, cloth prices have fallen below cost, and a severe period for manufacturers is approaching. If the prices of production materials are not reduced, the future of the replication industry will be difficult to be optimistic about.

### Vegetable Oil Rises Again ‚Äì Mixed Strength and Weakness

Yesterday, more than 12,000 stones of goods were registered in the north and south rice markets, but digestion remained sluggish. Northern Japonica rice was scarce and relatively stable. Indica rice had high prices at the place of origin, and owners held firm, so prices were also firm. However, Baiyuan shipments were sluggish in the morning, continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yinyuan Zhongguan also fell slightly by 1,000 yuan. Southern Japonica early rice and Bo rice were abundant and sales were slow, plunging by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybeans were imported from Shantou and Quanzhou, but Shantou factories in the city had weakened appetite, rebounding by 300 to 500 yuan, unevenly up to 1,000 yuan. Wheat demand exceeded supply, and goods were scarce everywhere, showing a continued rise of 300 to 500 yuan. Wheat bran stepped up by 100 to 200 yuan. Red sorghum had lively sales to distilleries, rising by 600 to 700 yuan. Sesame was firm and stable, red beans rose by 1,000 yuan, raw peanuts were high but secondary grades were stagnant, peanuts were neither good nor bad, broad beans had few arrivals and the market rose by 1,000 yuan. The oil market fluctuated suddenly, and raw vegetable oil rose again by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, soybean vegetable oil was firm, rapeseed vegetable oil was stable, sesame oil was flat and steady, soybean cakes Shantou had a weakening but not strong appetite, weakening slightly by 100 yuan.

### Wheat Gradually Arriving ‚Äì Feng Factory Resumes Production

The problem of raw materials for flour in this city is said to be gradually improving. The date for the arrival of American wheat in Shanghai is not far off, and wheat is also being transported from neighboring counties. Fufeng Flour Factory resumed production the day before yesterday. The allocation of flour is still managed by the Flour Industry Association. Tomorrow, perhaps 12,000 bags can be allocated, with the allocation targets being the flatbread, fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles industries.

### New Translation of the Name "Rayon" ‚Äì Rong Jin

This newspaper - Tianyuan Baoye Company, the exclusive agent of American Viseose Cor P, has always managed the (Rayon). Due to the fact that the Chinese name "man-made silk" was not satisfactory, a new translation was sought in the newspaper at the beginning of September this year. More than 4,000 letters were received. After careful preliminary selection by the company, 17 names were selected, and industry giants and academic authorities such as Shu Zhang, Wu Baofeng, Li Shengbo, Cao Huiqun, Cheng Cangbo, Jing Zhong, Mai Weiyu, and Zhao Junhao were invited to discuss and decide on the 19th of October at the Hongjiao Club. It was decided to follow the principle of translating the sound of two characters. Therefore, the two characters "Â´òÁ∑ä" (l√©i j«ên) were adopted as the appropriate Chinese translation of Rayon. It is said that it is planned to provide the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for reference.

### National Banknote Industry Plans to Establish a Federation

Banks and money houses across the country have very close business dealings, but in the past there has been no vertical organization. Recently, the Hankou City Bank Industry Association suggested to the Shanghai City Bank Industry Association that a National Banknote Industry Federation be organized. The Association has expressed its agreement and has sent letters to the Bank Industry Associations of major cities to jointly initiate it. Responses have been received from the Bank Industry Associations in various places expressing approval, so they will proceed actively.

### After American Cotton Rebounds, Government Does Not Intend to Take Action ‚Äì Controls on Fabric Prices Will Be Lifted

[United Press International, New Orleans, 1st] Cotton futures closed today up eight dollars and sixty-five cents to ten dollars per bale, and spot prices rose nine dollars and seventy-five cents.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The rise in cotton prices on Thursday and today has eased the pressure on the government to take immediate action to maintain the cotton market. The Economic Equalization Bureau is now considering lifting controls on cotton fabric prices, government purchase plans, and other measures, but no decisions have been announced to date. According to people in the cotton industry, unless the cotton market experiences another price drop, they believe that government plans regarding cotton fabrics will be announced only after the November 5th election.

Export Bonuses May Be Canceled

[Reuters, Boston, 1st] The Cotton Committee of the National Association of Cotton Manufacturers of America reported last week that the U.S. raw cotton export bonus system is a temporary measure designed to help U.S. farmers maintain foreign markets and clear the current large stocks of cotton in the United States. Since its implementation, this measure appears to have achieved its purpose. In view of the fact that there is no longer an excess of cotton stocks in the United States, the Committee recommends that the U.S. Department of Agriculture consider canceling the export bonus. The report continued: "Most U.S. mills rely on Asian cotton to manufacture special products. According to recent reports, there is little hope of importing Chinese cotton for at least a year. It is doubtful whether special planting of large quantities of cotton in the Hankou and Tianjin areas will be sufficient to meet export needs. At the same time, whether it is possible to obtain a sufficient amount of cotton from India is also in question."

### Eighth and Ninth Batches of Raw Silk Paid at New Prices ‚Äì Total Receipt Exceeded 4,300

The Foreign Trade Committee decided on the prices for China Trust Bureau's purchase of raw silk based on the grades inspected by various experts and the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The highest AA grade was set at 5 million yuan per stone, and the lowest grade was 3.4 million yuan. It is learned that the China Trust Bureau paid for the eighth and ninth batches of raw silk on the 1st according to the new prices, and all manufacturers have received the full amount. The price to be supplemented for the raw silk purchased in the first to seventh batches is being counted by the Bureau, and will be supplemented in full next week. Although the silk industry has objections to the prices of various grades set this time, no formal expression has been made so far, and the China Trust Bureau has not received any documents from the Silk Industry Association. Therefore, the Bureau is still paying according to the prices set by the Foreign Trade Committee.

In addition, since the Bureau has been purchasing raw silk, it has reached nine batches. The eighth and ninth batches were handled on the 30th of last month, with 140 dan in the eighth batch and 500 dan in the ninth batch, totaling 640 dan. However, according to the Foreign Trade Committee's method, unqualified goods will not be purchased. The Bureau rejected 15 dan in the eighth batch and 30 dan in the ninth batch, rejecting a total of 45 dan, purchasing only 595 dan. Adding the previous seven batches of 3,710 dan, the total purchase reached 4,305 dan.

### Today's First Division Soccer Games - Youyou Plays Against Jewish First - Donghua Clashes with Hequn - Youyou vs. Jewish in Jin Yuan Park in the Morning - Donghua vs. Hequn at Yiyuan Stadium in the Afternoon

Today, they have also obtained the assistance of Italian generals Baojie and Xiladi, and English veteran Jackob will make a guest appearance as center forward. Their strength has become even more complete. Youyou will once again rely on veterans Zhang Rongcai and Feng Yunyou to guard the three positions. The attack of forwards Lei, Yuan, and Tian is not weak, but they must be cautious in the face of a strong enemy.

Our regiment's Zheng Lun basketball team came to Shanghai for sightseeing and was fortunate to receive your care, enabling us to learn from the Shanghai team and the Allied forces. Our regiment is insignificant, and the Zheng Lun team's basketball skills are clumsy and not worthy of high praise. However, we dare not lag behind others in promoting military sports to strengthen our military spirit. Victory or defeat is not the point. We have gained a lot this time and are grateful for the tireless guidance from all sectors. Thank you by telegram. Cao Yigeng, Commander of the 6th Transport Regiment of Luoyang"

### Jiangxi Actively Develops Coal Mines - Anyuan and Tianhe Two Major Coal Mining Areas Are Transferred to State-Owned Enterprises - New-Style Coal Mining Plants Will Be Established and a Coal Mining Bureau Will Be Established

‚Äî Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo

Jingdezhen, 7th

Coal is a necessity of life and an essential element of motive power. The prosperity or decline of the coal industry is directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Yangtze River area has relatively developed industry and commerce, with an annual demand for coking coal of more than 4 million tons. However, there are no large-scale coal mines near the Yangtze River to meet the demand. In the past, the coal used in the Yangtze River area, except for the Kailuan coal mine, which sold hundreds of thousands of tons annually, was mostly Japanese coal and Fushun coal. The Chinese coal market was almost entirely controlled by them. The daily coal consumption of the provinces along the river could not even be self-sufficient. Isn't this a strange historical fact in the world?

Provincial Coal Production

To solve and supply the above coal demand, only Jiangxi coal production is the most advantageous and convenient. The amount of coal reserves in Jiangxi Province cannot be determined because there has not been a comprehensive survey and statistics of the reserves. According to the estimates of the Central Geological Survey Institute, the coal reserves in the province are approximately 989 trillion tons, ranking seventh among the coal-producing areas in the country. Detailed examination of the basis of the estimation is limited to Leping, Pingxiang, Ji'an, Fengcheng and other counties. Other counties such as Yichun, Wanzai, Wuning, Shangrao, Yushan, Xinyu, Gao'an, and various counties in southern Jiangxi, are generally not included. If the coal-producing areas in the above-mentioned counties are added to the statistics, the coal production should be at least 3,500 trillion tons.

Mines Decline

The largest coal mine in Jiangxi is the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which is also the largest coal mine in the country. The second largest is the Pole Coal Mine in Leping, and the third largest is the Tianhe Coal Mine in Ji'an. When the Hanyang Iron Works was first established, the daily output of Pingxiang alone exceeded 3,000 tons, totaling more than 6,000 tons annually. Later, due to the influence of the situation and the closure of the Hanyang Iron Works, the output was reduced by more than half. At this time, it could still be maintained. After 1930, it became even more depressed, and the business was hit by the best-selling foreign coal in various places, making it difficult to maintain. Similarly, the Leping Pole Company was disturbed by the Red Bandits several times, and the output could not be restored. The output of other small mines was even more difficult to maintain at a certain amount. In 1929, the province's coal sales dropped sharply to 663,850 tons, in 1930 to 456,340 tons, and after 1931 to 341,000 tons.

Provincial Government Seeks Control

Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, recognizing that the coal production in the province is gradually increasing but the output is very small due to manual mining. In order to adjust the province's coal demand, a three-year mining plan has been formulated, expecting to supply it without interruption. In addition to transferring the Anyuan and Tianhe coal mines to state-owned enterprises, all private mines in Fengcheng, Yichun, Wanzai and other places will be controlled, and those who originally held mining licenses will be required to apply for registration within a time limit, otherwise their mining rights will be revoked. Regarding the Tianhe Coal Mine mining plan, a preparatory office has been jointly established by the Resources Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to handle it specifically. The Coal Mining Bureau will be established within the year to carry out mechanized mining, with an estimated output of 800,000 tons in three years. The past and present conditions of the Anyuan and Tianhe coal mines are recorded separately below, so that the general situation of the large coal mining areas in Jiangxi can be seen.

Anyuan Mine Overview

Pingxiang Coal Mine is one of the largest mines in China. The mining area is in Anyuan, Pingxiang, with a width of ten miles. It is mined as a tributary of Tianci Mountain. Anyuan Mountain is 15 miles southeast of the county. Tianci Mountain is 690 feet high and has a slope of 29 degrees. Its veins come from Majiling in Lotus County. According to the German technician who discovered the mine, if one million tons are mined annually, it will continue for 500 years, so the richness of its coal reserves can be imagined!

The origin of the mine is that Zhang Zhidong, Governor of Huguang in the 22nd year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, founded the Hanyang Iron Administration Bureau. Because fuel was supplied from Kailuan, Ma'anshan, Tangshan, the United Kingdom, and Japan, the prices were expensive and the coal quality was poor. Therefore, it returned to self-mining coal mines for application. A German mining engineer was specially sent to investigate in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui. In the 24th year, a large coal field was found in Pingxiang. The color was as black as lacquer, the luster was very strong, it was rich in cohesiveness, and the volatile matter was small, which was suitable for coke refining for ironmaking. Zhang and Sheng Xuanhuai raised one million taels of gold to start mining. In the 28th year, it was further expanded and four million marks of German gold were borrowed from the German company Lihe, and German Lailun was hired as the chief technician and Zhang Shaozhen was appointed as the general manager. In the 34th year, Sheng merged Pingxiang Coal Mine, Hanyang Iron Works, and Daye Iron Mine into one, called Hanyeping Company. At that time, the Japanese envied the success of German investment and intended to take the opportunity to compete. Sheng decided to use Japanese debt to replace German debt after the company was formed. Later, the Japanese side even encouraged expansion. By the end of the abolished Qing Dynasty, the loan had reached a huge amount of 30 million yuan. During the Republic of China era, until the European War, the mine had a vigorous atmosphere. The daily output once reached 3,000 tons. At that time, the demand for iron was very broad, only because the government did not supervise it and the organizers indiscriminately borrowed Japanese debt, thus losing the interests and opportunities, and letting go of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. At that time, someone calculated that the loss was actually more than the total property of the company. After the Communist Party hosted the Pingxiang Miners' Club in the 12th year of the Republic of China, labor unrest occurred frequently, and production declined sharply. At the same time, it was affected by military affairs and transportation inconvenience, making management more difficult. In the 14th year, the Hanman Iron Factory stopped work, and Pingmei was hit hard. From the autumn of that year, the coal produced was only for the mine's own use and sold locally. In the 15th year, the Revolutionary Army arose, and the mining was hosted by red workers. In the spring of the 17th year, local gentry and garrison commanders raised tens of thousands of funds to organize a company to purchase coal and sell it on their behalf to maintain the food supply for the mine workers. It was impossible to maintain due to limited resources and little capital. In the winter of that year, in order to take care of local security and maintain the lives of thousands of employees, the Jiangxi Provincial Government appointed He Zhaozeng as the Pingxiang Commissioner to advance funds for maintenance. After the start of work, the daily output of coal was 800 tons. In the autumn of the 18th year, the Jiangxi Provincial Government was reorganized and Xiao Jiaxin was appointed as the Pingxiang Commissioner. After serving for more than a year, he lost more than 300,000 yuan. In the spring of the 20th year, the Provincial Government was reorganized again and Dong Lun was appointed as the Pingxiang Commissioner. The local authorities also asked fellow villagers in Hunan to advance funds for repairs. In June of the 20th year, the water drainage machine at the bottom of the direct well malfunctioned. The repairs were not timely, causing the lower layer of the Eight-Fang well to be flooded. The daily output of coal was only more than 500 tons. In the 21st year, the Jiangxi Mining Affairs Special Committee drafted a plan to rescue the Pingxiang Coal Mine, and continued to appoint He Zhaozeng as the Pingxiang Commissioner and Liu Wenyi as the Deputy Commissioner to be responsible for handling it. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the mining business fell into stagnation again. Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has reorganized the control plan for the province's coal mining areas. The Anyuan mining area has a larger scope and is classified as state-owned. The revitalization of the mine is expected to be realized soon.

Tianhe Mine Overview

Tianhe is 120 miles away from Ji'an County and 600 miles away from Nanchang by water. The mining area is in Zhouyuan Village, 15 miles away from Tianhe. The coal seam there is from ten feet to eight or nine feet thick, with abundant reserves. People mined it in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. At the end of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Ye Biaoke from Xuanhua planned on a small scale and used manual excavation. After several months, he had not yet obtained the source of the mine. Although Ye suffered losses, he was not discouraged. He raised funds to continue mining. The following year, he made a huge profit. He applied for registration and requested the Ministry to issue a mining license, making considerable profits every year. However, wherever there is profit, people flock to it like ducks. Dozens of people have successively rented mountains and obtained licenses to excavate there. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, each mine produced about 300-400 dans of coal per day, and there were about 300-400 miners. The coal produced was sold to ships, railways, and Wuhu, and other ports. Because the coal quality was quite good, they were happy to buy and use it. During the Red Bandit's disturbance, the mine shafts were destroyed, almost completely bankrupt. After the peace, Zhang Jingjiang, a central supervisory committee member, stated to the central government that the original manager of the mine had stated that the Tianhe coal reserves were abundant. If funds could be raised for mining, it would not only maintain the lives of the majority of mine workers, but also continuously supply the country's production and construction. Therefore, Zhang invested 300,000 yuan to expand the original mine shafts and planned to build a light railway of 13 miles from the mine shafts to the wharf. In the 22nd year, Zhang sent Yu Zhimin to the mining area for an on-site survey. He believed that the bituminous coal was abundant and could be used to refine coking coal. After Yu reported back, he ordered Zhang to plan construction on the one hand, and continue to use the local method for mining on the other hand.

There were more than ten other coal bureaus in total. After the 15th year, only seven remained, namely Yichang, Yuanda, Fuchang, Jichang, Huikang, Changming, and Anji. The area of the mining bureau ranged from more than 500 mu for the large ones to more than 40 mu for the small ones. The seven totaled more than 1,500 mu, equivalent to more than 90 hectares. The most difficult thing in the mining area was the inconvenience of transportation. The 15 mu from the production area to Tianhe were all mountain roads, making it difficult to travel by car. All of them were carried by manpower. From the mining mountain to Tianhe, each person could only carry it twice a day. From Tianhe to Ji'an, the water journey was 180 li. During the spring and summer when the water level rose, folk boats with a load of 1,000 dan could pass unimpeded. In winter, when the water was shallow, they could only carry a load of 500 dan. The transportation workers were all local workers. It was not easy to hire, and it was even more difficult to increase or decrease the number of workers. At the busiest time, there were fewer workers, and at the most idle time, there were more workers. The coal transportation system was adopted by each mining bureau, and the number of days of rotation for each month was stipulated and could not be changed. The Provincial Government believed that the production of the mining area was abundant and that large-scale mining should be carried out. Dividing it into many small mines hindered the development of the mining industry, and construction was prone to obstacles and various disputes were prone to occur. It was once planned to merge the mines for mining, but it failed due to difficult work and huge costs.

Recently, according to the authorities' estimates, the reserves of the mine are 17 million tons. The Resources Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial Government are jointly investing in manual mining for the time being, and are planning to establish a new-style coal mining plant. It is expected to be completed in three years. In terms of business, bituminous coal will be mined, and part of it will be transported to Ji'an for use as fuel for ships and power plants in the Gan River basin, and part of it will be used for coke refining. In terms of equipment, two 750-kilowatt steam turbine generator sets will be specially installed to switch to electric mining. In the first year, the estimated coal production is 72,000 tons, 180,000 tons in the second year, and 540,000 tons in the third year. The total equipment cost is US$2 million. Once the Resources Committee's approval is obtained, the new plant can be established.

### From Shaobo to Baoying

‚Äî Hesheng

Gaoyou Dispatch, 25th

Shaobo‚Äîit is a town belonging to Jiangdu County. It looks like just a small dot on the map, with nothing special about it. However, for the refugees from northern Jiangsu who have been fleeing to Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and the areas of Nanjing and Shanghai over the past year, it is of particular concern. Especially for the people of Yangzhou and Taizhou, it can be said that they are worried day and night because they feel the threat is too great. It is only forty li away from Yangzhou city, a morning's journey, and they see with their own eyes the suffering of the fleeing refugees, and hear with their own ears the misery of the so-called "liberated areas." If Yangzhou falls, what will be their fate? So they are constantly watching it with trepidation.

At the same time, Shaobo is the throat of the Grand Canal and the gateway to Central China. Its importance is like Gibraltar in the Mediterranean and the Bosphorus in the Black Sea. "If Shaobo is held firmly, Central China will be secured," this is the slogan written and shouted by the Communist army in Shaobo. Indeed! Relying on the complexity of the terrain and the strength of the fortifications, even though Huaibei, the heart of Central China, has been recovered by the National Army, they are still determined to defend Shaobo to the death. When the National Army began its counterattack on the 5th of this month, they dispatched reinforcements from Xinghua and Gaoyou in different directions, hoping to secure this gateway to Central China. Little did they know that they would eventually be no match for the power of the National Army's artillery fire and the bravery of the officers and soldiers. In the battle on the south bank of Shajiang Dam, all nine strong fortresses were destroyed, and all but forty-eight of the more than three hundred officers and soldiers were captured, the rest all went to "E'du City" (died).

Building Pontoon Bridges Overnight, Forcing Crossings at Three Locations

After occupying the south bank of Shajiang Dam, it would have been possible to press on victoriously, but they were blocked by the Shajiang River, which was more than sixty meters wide, and could not fly across. Therefore, raft-style pontoon bridges were built overnight, and forced crossings were carried out at three locations under the cover of artillery fire. Some officers and soldiers who were good at swimming disregarded the cold and were willing to sacrifice themselves. *plunk! plunk!* They jumped into the water like a flock of ducks and quickly swam to the other shore to seize the fortifications. That night, the National Army captured the positions on the north bank of the Shajiang River and the Dongyue Temple stronghold. At the same time, our left-wing troops, after a day and a night of bloody battle, broke through eight strong enemy fortifications and reached the south street of Shaobo. The bandits reinforced and counterattacked several times, but ultimately could not reverse their tragic fate. The 10th Column, known as the "victorious army," scattered in three directions‚ÄîYangzhuang, Zhenwu Temple, Zhaoguan Dam‚Äîwith its 85th, 87th, and 89th Regiments fleeing in disarray. On the morning of the 6th, we completely occupied Shaobo and immediately gave chase in different directions. As a result, the famous Zhaoguan Dam, a natural barrier that was easy to defend but difficult to attack, was captured in just three hours of battle. There is a saying among the people of northern Jiangsu, "To capture Zhaoguan, ten thousand must die," but we only suffered a few dozen casualties and took Zhaoguan. By 6:00 p.m., our army had pursued beyond Lujin Town.

The author arrived in Shaobo at 8:30 a.m. on the 6th. Commissioner Lin from the Fifth District, County Magistrate Zhang from Jiangdu, and reporters from various newspapers stationed in Yangzhou arrived one after another. We posted notices to reassure the people, and at the same time inspected the battlefield to observe the traces of war. We walked a lot of roads, but everyone did not feel tired. At the same time, we also decided to convene a mass meeting at 2:00 p.m.

Truly, beyond our expectations, in less than an hour, the townspeople, supporting the old and leading the young, men and women, gathered at the square where they had often participated in "struggles" and "liquidations" in the past. Although only about eight hundred people attended the meeting, everyone who remained in the town, except for those watching the doors, went. The excitement expressed on each person's face was truly indescribable.

The meeting began without any ceremony. First, County Magistrate Zhang introduced me to speak first. I was not prepared to say anything. I simply explained why we still had to fight after the victory of the War of Resistance, why everyone still could not live in peace and prosperity, and the government's repeated tolerance and concession to the Communist Party. Then I asked them why everyone looked so gaunt and poorly clothed today. Hadn't the Communist Party liberated you? They exclaimed in unison with emotion: "Liberated! If you hadn't come, if we had been liberated by them for another two months, we wouldn't be alive!" Finally, I told them about a few things they should pay attention to and abide by in the future, and they expressed their sincere acceptance.

After I finished speaking, Deputy Brigade Commander Li, Commissioner Lin, County Magistrate Zhang, and others continued to speak. Although more than two hours had passed, the order remained the same. Their excitement and joy overflowed from their eyebrows, and they applauded in unison at the moving parts, applauding no less than twenty times. I have never seen such a good situation at a mass meeting. After the meeting, I said to County Magistrate Zhang: How does it compare to the mass meeting in Yangzhou? They have been trained! County Magistrate Zhang did not answer, but smiled.

On the way back, I thought to myself that people generally think that the Communist Party's propaganda and training of the people is so remarkable. Today, it seems that the effect of their propaganda and training is like this, which may be beyond their expectations! A message to the CCP! Deceptive propaganda is useless. If you want to succeed, you must change your style! Otherwise, if you continue to fight, there is still no hope!

At dawn on the 7th, the National Army continued to advance. We expected that there would be another fierce battle in Cheluduo, Wuliba, and other places. These two places are the gateway to Gaoyou, and the terrain is very complex, and the fortifications are very strong. According to intelligence, there is still a regiment of troops holding Cheluduo, and the 82nd and 84th Regiments are preparing to defend Gaoyou to the death. However, our officers and soldiers still felt that their numbers were too small and that the fighting was not enjoyable. They ran away as soon as they were hit. Wouldn't running away mean waiting for the next fight? This is really a nuisance. Not only is the political negotiation of the Communist Party repeatedly a nuisance, but the fighting is also the same. I hope for a total liquidation, a happy and thorough annihilation battle, but they fight and run, run and fight, the same tune as fighting and talking. From this, it can be seen that their party, government, and military personnel are all birds of a feather.

National Army Enters Gaoyou, Pursuing Victoriously in Different Directions

Sure enough, the vanguard advanced to Cheluduo. Although they resisted stubbornly with their fortifications, the enemy's courage had been chilled and they could not hold on. In less than two hours of battle, we occupied it, capturing dozens of people and seizing dozens of guns, as well as three brand new and complete mortars. In addition, many were killed by us. That night, we advanced to Wuliba, and Gaoyou city was in sight. The officers and soldiers were all brave, and they planned to stay in the city tonight, but the Communist army set fire to the bridges in Wuliba. After extinguishing the fire and repairing the bridges, it was already 8:00 a.m. on the 8th. The National Army entered Gaoyou city at this time and pursued in different directions to the east and north.

When I entered Gaoyou city, the first thing that surprised me was that the people of Gaoyou city were setting up incense tables along the road to welcome the National Army. Many old women were chanting "Amitabha, the Old Central Government has really returned," and the sound of firecrackers was deafening. Some children followed theÈòü‰ºçrunning and asked our soldiers, "Why didn't you come sooner!" The Communist Party's control of Gaoyou for nearly a year has resulted in the loss of popular support. I hope that all parties, factions, and social leaders will come to Gaoyou to see the real public opinion of the so-called "liberated areas."

I toured the city for a week. The scene in Gaoyou city was much better than in Shaobo because Shaobo had experienced a fierce battle and suffered more damage. Gaoyou had little damage. Except for a portion of the strong men who were coerced and taken away, the rest of the people were still at home. Wherever we went, the people gathered around us, talking to us with great excitement, joy, and warmth. They told us many things that we could not have imagined. They hated the Communist Party to the extreme. An old woman in her seventies said to me: My son had a bicycle. One day, "Fourth Master" came to my house and insisted on taking it away. I refused to let go. I said: Don't you talk about democracy? Why don't you reason? My son was taken away by you to sacrifice, and he left this bicycle, which I want to keep as a souvenir. You can't bear to take it away. Before I could finish speaking, they threatened me with guns. I didn't care about anything and stood up and said: Okay! Shoot me! I can't live anyway. As a result, they shot a shot in the sky and didn't take it away. This happened several times. Sir! Do you think they are good? If you don't come, the lives of our people will be over. The old woman said this while acting, like performing a play. Although we expressed our sympathy, we could only comfort her with empty words. In short, every person truly hated the Communist Party to the extreme, wishing they could eat their flesh and sleep on their skin.

Afterwards, it was said that after the fall of Shaobo, the Communist army still wanted to hold Gaoyou and had gathered more than two thousand laborers overnight to strengthen the fortifications inside and outside the city. On the evening of the 7th, Su Yu's First Division, with more than ten thousand people, had already passed through Xinghua to reinforce Gaoyou, but before they reached Ergou, Gaoyou was recovered by us and it was too late to rescue it. Gaoyou city was spared the calamity of artillery fire. At the same time, it was said that there were more than a thousand people on the red list who were planned to be slaughtered, but thanks to our rapid advance, they were spared from disaster. This was truly fortunate.

After the recovery of Gaoyou, the National Army's pursuit troops headed towards Xinghua in one direction and advanced along the Grand Canal towards Baoying in the other, like sweeping away dead leaves with an autumn wind, and reached Baoying on the 11th. The entire Grand Canal line was completely cleared.

At 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, we still took a gunboat to Sishui, and then returned to Gaoyou by car. After returning, I saw the newspaper of the 19th, which published the CCP's statement on the current situation issued in Yan'an on the 17th, which did everything possible to slander and vilify, full of lies, which is not worth criticizing. However, what we have seen with our own eyes in the recovered areas, and the CCP's statement, is really ridiculous, pitiful, and hateful! They usually rely on their so-called million regular troops and more than two million militiamen to rebel and carry out internal strife, seizing cities and land, and attacking the National Army everywhere. When the National Army counterattacks slightly, they are defeated miserably and realize that their belief in force is not enough, so they shout for a ceasefire! Ceasefire! Unconditional ceasefire! The government is generous and allows a ceasefire, but they put forward unreasonable demands, making peace impossible. Today, they claim to have made so-called eight concessions and propose to restore credibility and integrity. I really don't know how they can be so shameless. Especially shameless is that they talk about the interests of the people and the demands of the people, as if the people are their patent. Drowning tens of thousands, massacring tens of thousands, and enslaving tens of thousands, is this also in the interests of the people? Is this also the demand of the people? That's right! The demand of the people is that the government quickly eliminates you, a bunch of traitors who harm the country and the people!

Finally, they shamelessly said: "We have no other demands, we only ask to restore the military positions of the KMT and the Communist Party on January 13." That's right! We can do it, we are willing to do it, because we are the country's army, and we can be transferred to any place at will. However, we really have to ask the people, ask the people in the so-called "liberated areas," and it is best to invite Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to northern Jiangsu to ask, especially Mr. Zhou Enlai, who is from northern Jiangsu, and the transportation is very convenient now. He can take the opportunity to see his own hometown. As long as one person in northern Jiangsu says they are good, welcomes them, and wants us to leave, we will definitely ask the government to transfer us away and let them restore the positions of January 13. CCP people! Wake up! Stop dreaming, lay down your butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot, this is your real way out!

### We Need A Municipal Drama School

‚Äî Tao Xiong

We need a municipal drama school, a municipal drama school must exist, because it is an educational institution that cultivates social education talents! It is also a training ground that will train countless teachers for society! So we need it!

People from the municipal drama school will be the movers who promote the giant wheel of the times! They are the driving force for promoting social progress; they are the leaders who guide countless compatriots who have not received school education into the realm of "propriety, justice, integrity, and shame"; they are the soul of the nation, the teachers of the people; they are the ones who correct social customs; they are also the ones who lead people into a normal life. The municipal drama school trains them, educates them, its significance and function exceeds any other school!

The municipal drama school is about to be cut, the reason being to save the monthly expenses of three hundred thousand and some thousand to start a national school. This can be said: not to be a reason! Could it be that Shanghai's only municipal drama school can be cut to rob Peter to pay Paul?

We need a municipal drama school! A municipal drama school must exist! Especially standing from our own standpoint in film and drama, so we need it even more! We hope that the municipal drama school can be retained!

### New Movie Miscellaneous Reviews

‚Äî Ma Boliang

1.  Lost Horizon

Among American directors, Lubitsch and Cukor are really not worth mentioning. Hitchcock of "Rebecca", Julian Duvivier of "The Great Waltz" and "Tales of Manhattan", Renoir Clair of "It Happened Tomorrow" and Capra of this film have our favorite characteristics. We once thought that American films should return from splendor to plainness. This kind of style can be seen in "The Human Comedy", "Lady Hamilton", and "The Story of G.I. Joe" during the war, which was due to the lessons of the disasters of war. Hitchcock and the other two had an even deeper trend, but Capra was the first to start with a plain life. The title "Lost Horizon" is far better than "Lost Horizon". Here, there are clear floating clouds in the blue sky, but there is no dusty dream of life. It is such a clich√© story. The same themes are "Lady for a Day" and "Springtime in the Rockies". The difference is that Capra's play has a full human touch, and it criticizes the capitalist class with a bravery that is unprecedented in Hollywood. He pursues a kind of self-sufficient and happy physical and mental state. I really like the commoner families depicted by Capra, the people who are content with their lot, and the embarrassment revealed when the hypocritical bourgeoisie suddenly arrives. How much exaggeration is contained in the director's technique, but in the scene where the young couple makes a big scene in the hotel, the nature of the exaggeration is also a kind of cheerful joy. The old cripple raising the sign to throw something is a delicate and touching proof. The only flaw is that we dare not agree with the arms dealer's awakening. He should have more anger at the old cripple's instruction, and then more reflection. All the actors' skills are perfect. Jean Arthur's beauty is clear and beautiful. Perhaps the bad thing is that her voice is slightly hoarse. Perhaps it saves the sentimentality of the characters in the play too much, but we just like this confusion and sincerity of the world.

2.  I'll Be Seeing You

I have always regarded love as thin as autumn clouds, but this play tells me the truth and beauty of love, contacting life with each other under understanding. I believe that this is the only way to happiness. Botel has a kind of sadness, the quiet of the lakeside walk and the revelry of the New Year's ball, all faintly have the bleakness of the silent winter dusk. Although it is a legendary story like "Intermezzo", the difference is that there is a lot of human touch. The warmth of the American small town family shown by the Babela family of three, there are many beautiful pictures, the innkeeper leading Zack into the bedroom, Zack's neurotic attack, the small talk by the lake, the prison meeting, all have poetic and picturesque charm. It is lovely to play. Qin Qiu Luoji Si Jiao Wan is better than before, with a delicate style. Joseph Cotton is steady, and Shirley Temple plays a half-understood little girl, sincere and moving, better when she is mischievous than when she cries. Going home after the play, I still remember the crisp knocks of the rain on the streetlights, so harmonious, it is the flavor of this play.

3.  The Princess and the Pirate

A comedy is an extreme dream of a wandering story. This time, it takes pirates and princesses as the object of finding happiness. Although comedian Bob Hope is nothing more than those old routines, after all, it is not hard comedy of fist and foot. "The Princess and the Pirate" probably has five times more humor than "The Ghost Breakers". Seeking a relaxed feeling, I got a happy laugh. But when I came out, I even forgot Ginny Simms' smile. The prominent ending can prove the screenwriter's efforts. Goldwyn and his director are at least a little serious.

### About "Passionnellement"

‚Äî Lin

This is another masterpiece by James Hilton that MGM turned into a film. His "Lost Horizon" and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" have been praised unanimously after being put on the silver screen. Recently, "Random Harvest" has also been shown and has been well received. In "Passionnellement", Hilton writes about a mental patient who commits murder based on his abnormal psychology. This person who escaped from the madhouse has a very beautiful wife. But he suspects that his friend is having an affair with his wife, and finally designs a meticulously planned suicide, falsely blaming his friend. The intricate plot unfolds in this way.

The heroine of "Passionnellement", Ingrid Bergman, is a popular star known as the modern Garbo. Like Garbo, she is Swedish, gentle and beautiful. The two male protagonists are Robert Montgomery and George Sanders, who is good at playing detective films.

### Ouyang Fei Ying will go to North America

‚Äî Jiang Niao

Ouyang Fei Ying, the heroine in "Ying Fei Ren Jian", is a singer who has just appeared on the screen. She has a charming voice and a healthy body, which makes her have a loud and pleasant singing voice. She is very kind to people and very generous in handling things. She often says to people: She didn't even think about appearing on the screen this time. Before the audition, she didn't even know how to make a movie, and she hadn't even seen it. Therefore, she dared not predict the success or failure of this time. She only hopes that after the screening, she will get more instructions from the outside world and senior gentlemen!

Her words are so modest and kind. In fact, it is impossible for her to fail in "Ying Fei Ren Jian", because of her own efforts and humble learning. However, because she has no experience in acting, she still has a little fault in dialogue, that is, she does not pay attention to the pause and interval when speaking!

She is a new talent in the film industry, and she has all the technical conditions required for film: she can ride a horse, swim, and shoot a gun; she can also do other things that people can play well, such as riding a bicycle, dancing, playing ball, Peking opera, and driving a car. Recently, she has received her passport and will leave for the United States in mid-December to study her own music in more depth. I hope that she will really learn something back from abroad, so that these friends who love music and film and drama will have more strength!

### Truth and Justice

‚Äî Yu Fu

Watching "The Life of Emile Zola"

Zola's life can be clearly divided into two periods: the former period he lived in poverty, and the latter period he lived in affluence. In the former, he saved Nana. In the latter, he saved Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Both of these were expressions of his sense of justice, but the way they were expressed was different from his feelings at the time: when he was poor, he automatically saved Nana without hesitation. When he was living in affluence, he no longer had that impulsive energy. When Mrs. Dreyfus came to him, he only refused at first, and then doubted, because it was out of doubt that he discovered that Dreyfus had really been wronged, and then he wrote the famous article "J'Accuse!".

Under the contrast of these two senses of justice, it makes me think that people living in poverty and hardship are more rich in noble sympathy, and people living in comfortable and affluent environments only know selfishness, only know hypocrisy, have no pity, have no sympathy; they are afraid that misfortune will be transmitted to them, will break their happy lives, so they would rather live an ordinary life day by day until their hair turns white, until they walk into the grave, and are unwilling to extend great sympathy to save others' misfortune! Therefore, when you are unfortunate and want to ask for help, you must first see clearly the other party's environment and his personality, and don't act rashly. Otherwise, you will fail!

Zola finally discovered the truth of an innocent unfortunate person, because he was once a poor man, so he still has a sense of justice. Therefore, he stood on his position without hesitation to expose the darkness of the powerful, to tell the misfortune and pain of the humiliated, and to challenge the evil forces!

The slaves of the powerful judged that he had lost the case, and the blind masses attacked him. This cannot indicate that he does not conform to the trend, nor can it indicate that he has lost the hearts of the people, nor can it indicate his mistake! It only shows his strong will and great personality! It also shows that he is always standing on the side of truth!

When the savior Jesus was alive, he suffered all kinds of hardships, and his fate could not escape being nailed to the cross, let alone Zola! But truth is always truth, and it finally follows justice!

### Blue Skies

‚Äî Xin Ming

This is a message that makes people excited. Paramount has invested three million dollars to produce this colorful musical blockbuster "Blue Skies". Because the film is a collaboration between Bing Crosby, the king of song, and Fred Astaire, the king of dance, for the second time (the city has already shown "Holiday Inn"), and Astaire announced during the filming that he would bid farewell to the film industry after the completion of this film. Therefore, he used all his skills in this film; he also introduced four new dance styles to his fans.

As for the king of song's plays, they still cannot escape the original style. As many as twenty-one intoxicating bass songs. The composer is Irving Berlin, a famous figure, and the peony green leaves complement each other.

### The two protagonists in MGM's new film "Undercurrent": Katharine Hepburn and George Sanders.

### The First Domestically Produced Song and Dance Film: "Orioles Fly in the World"

‚Äî Hu Tian

Since its restoration after the war, China Electric Studio Two has already presented its first domestically produced film, "A Family of Loyalty and Righteousness." Now, they are about to show us the first domestically produced song and dance film, "Orioles Fly in the World." This film has a very good theme: art belongs to the people and should not be the exclusive privilege of a few leisure-class individuals.

The story is about an artist in an ivory tower who trains a talented female singer. She relies on her beautiful voice and public performances in theaters, where ticket prices are quite expensive. Many people who cannot afford tickets can only look at advertisements outside the theater. By chance, she meets a poor male musician who hopes she can sing unconditionally to the poor in impoverished neighborhoods in front of a large audience. She happily agrees and invests in organizing a singing group for them. She also changes her name and goes out to sing beautiful songs for the people, so that her music can be heard by anyone and is no longer the exclusive privilege of gentlemen in theaters. However, her teacher discovers this and tries to stop her charitable singing. His female disciple resists, causing him to become angry and commit suicide. This, in turn, makes her even more determined and strengthens her resolve to sing for the poor!

Although the story is very simple, the director is able to use many

song and dance scenes to make the plot very lively. I met the director, Fang Peilin, a few days ago, and learned that the entire film has twelve insert songs and eight song and dance scenes, and that Li Ailei was invited to participate in the dance performances. I myself went to visit the filming of several ballet scenes and found the sets to be truly magnificent, especially the scenes that use reflections. In one scene, a row of more than a dozen female dancers, all dressed in white costumes, are singing and dancing on the stage. Below the stage is a pool of water, and when the lights shine brightly, the reflections of the dancers on the stage are clearly visible in the water. It's truly beautiful!

I have seen several American Hollywood Technicolor song and dance films and feel that their work is really good because their machinery and technology can help them succeed. After seeing the production process of a Chinese song and dance film this time, I feel that our work has a different kind of charm: although some parts cannot keep up with foreign works, the director's ingenuity, his ability to use clever shots and angles, and to make the most of the current sets and simple machinery are commendable!

Fortunately, this film will be shown to us within this week, and its success or failure is up to us to decide.

Spring and Autumn

### A Record of Two Literary and Art Tea Parties

‚Äî Jin Shan

Some friends gave me this topic after I attended the literary and art tea party at the Five-Story Restaurant last Sunday. Over the years, whether teaching or editing publications, I only knew how to give topics for others to write about, and I didn't know the pain of writing about a given topic. Well, now I've encountered it. Fortunately, it's not an exam where I have to hand in a paper immediately, otherwise, I'd definitely get a zero. But it doesn't matter if I get a zero; who relies on grades to eat these days? But this is a friend's commission, a request of friendship, and a piece of ardent expectation, so this is difficult.

I am someone who hasn't learned anything well and doesn't understand anything. IÂãâÂº∫can say that the only thing I know a little about is emotions, and the reason I am so frustrated and have accomplished nothing is also because of these emotions. Taking friendship as an example, I wouldn't be like some people, going through the motions and being perfunctory. So my heart is often locked up by loneliness. However, I believe that "birds sing for companions" is a true exchange of emotions, and I felt and confirmed this again at these recent two literary and art tea parties.

One is the "Saturday Literary Tea Gathering." The origins of this gathering can be traced back to Mr. Zhong Ming's "Friendship Between Intellectuals and Political Relations" published in the Spring and Autumn in September. That article prompted responses from Mr. Hua Lin and Mr. Hong Wei, and Mr. Hua's concrete suggestions turned into active practice.

One day, Mr. Hua ran over excitedly and said, "I've got it! I've found a place: Xiangxue Garden!" Of course, I understand Mr. Hua's enthusiasm and experience. Before the war, he ran the "Literary Club" in Nanjing, and during the war, he ran the "Saturday Evening Tea" in Chongqing. So we discussed inviting friends and publicizing the news.

A few days later, Mr. Xu Zhongnian came to talk about restoring the "Literary Tea Party." I told him about Mr. Hua's plan, and he understood. He said, "It just so happens that the times and locations of the two tea parties are different, so they can coexist without conflict." I thought, that's right, isn't everyone in Shanghai worried about the inconvenience of meeting friends? Wouldn't it be better to have more opportunities to meet? So we discussed inviting friends and issuing invitations for this tea party.

A few days later, Mr. Hua sent the invitation card for the first tea gathering, and I published it in the Spring and Autumn as well.

I went to participate on the afternoon of October 19th. Xiangxue Garden turned out to be a bamboo fence and thatched hut-style building, located in a corner of a sanatorium's garden. In the center of the hall was Mr. Wu Zhihui's calligraphy, "Literary Tea Gathering," and at the entrance was Ms. Zhou Lianxia's couplet, "As long as two hearts understand each other, what does it matter if there is no lamp or moon?" Classical gauze lanterns hung high on the roof, and canna lilies outside the window, with a hint of melancholy, were scattered in the western breeze and slanting sun. Participants each had a cup of tea, sipping slowly, appreciating the taste of finding tranquility in the midst of noise. Perhaps because of the architecture and facilities, which all have an Eastern rural flavor, it reminded people of Daoxiang Village in "Dream of the Red Chamber" or the Green Willow Village on the Slender West Lake. The only pity was the lack of a stream and the sound of oars.

I left early that day. I saw Mr. Liu Haisu, Mei Qi, Zhu Ying, Guan Liang, Zhong Xianmin, and the host, Mr. Hua Lin, etc. Everyone gathered freely, without any formality. They talked about literature, painting, people, and ghosts‚Ä¶

The second time was on October 26th. This time, the participants included Shi Zhecun, Dai Wangshu, Xu Shiqi, Huang Huanwu, Mr. Liu Shi, Mr. Sun Fuxi, and Mr. Hua Lin. It was rare that Mr. Zhang Chuandao, one of the founders of "Yu Si," happened to be in Shanghai, and he came with Mr. Li Xiaofeng.

Of course, there was another exchange of friendship, humorous wit, and enthusiastic greetings. Everyone talked and laughed until the sun set and dusk gradually covered the window screen. Everyone seemed to feel that they hadn't talked enough. But we can meet again at the literary tea party tomorrow. Everyone thought this in their hearts and slowly dispersed.

### Goddess of the Luo River

‚Äî Ming Qiu Shizhou

The restoration of the "Literary Tea Party" can be considered Mr. Zhongnian's personal preparation, just as the literary tea gathering is Mr. Hua's sole operation. As far as I know, he ran around for more than three weeks, and even the invitation card published in the Spring and Autumn was written by Mr. Zhongnian himself. Although he specially introduced Mr. Chen Chengyin of the Changnian Qiansao Society at the meeting for his contribution in liaising, he also traced back to Mr. Sun Fuxi's initiation fourteen years ago, saying that it was Mr. Chuntai who caused the trouble, and also thanked Spring and Autumn for publishing the invitation card this time.

The Five-Story Restaurant is fully equipped with modern facilities, with high steel windows draped with beige silk curtains, dark green velvet soft chairs, and a smooth floor. However, the enthusiasm and leisurely mood of the participants were no different from those in Xiangxue Garden. That day, it was so crowded that it seemed there was no room for latecomers to stand.

At the gathering, Mr. Sun Fuxi, in his capacity as the original troublemaker, reported several witty and humorous stories about his ten years of separation and exile in the Great Rear Area. Mr. Hua Lin spoke about the three stages of life: loving parents in childhood, loving lovers in adulthood, and loving friends in middle and old age, explaining that the most precious thing for human beings is friendship, and that politics is only a kind of responsibility that citizens have towards the country. Therefore, he hoped that everyone would participate often and become good friends together. His words happened to echo Mr. Zhong Ming's article. Indeed, look at this gathering, whether new friends or old, everyone shakes hands and smiles, and who doesn't feel deeply connected?

Mr. and Mrs. Wang Yaliao, as well as Mr. Xu Weinan, had left beforehand, and Mr. Yan Duhe was always smiling. Mr. Ma Gongyu talked while stroking his beard.

That day, Mr. Liu Shi also reported with sorrow about the desolate situation after Mr. Chen Bao's death. Mr. Xu Xiaotian immediately expressed his deep concern, and for a moment, everyone felt infinite sympathy and prepared to find ways to provide relief to the family in distress.

Among those present were elders with gray hair and unkempt celebrities; there were elegant and refined painters, as well as writers in neat suits; there were graceful and luxurious women, as well as charming young girls; there were famous literary seniors, as well as young people who love literature and art: different identities, different clothing, were naturally harmonized in the common literary atmosphere. I believe that when everyone left the meeting, their hearts were filled with freedom, harmony, and joy.

‚ÄîWriting to here and reading it again from the beginning, I realize that I have only written some superficial impressions. I think that if Mr. Zhao Jingshen were at the meeting, his vivid writing would be much better than this rough record. What to do? I still can't turn in the paper. But it's a small matter if I can't turn in the paper; it would be terrible to fail the trust and expectations of my friends.‚ÄîWell, let it be published, so that friends from other places who care about us can know a general idea first.

### Street Scene

‚Äî Ye Hong

Around eight o'clock in the morning, there are already twenty people standing at the tram stop.

Everyone is anxiously waiting for the tram, almost all stretching their necks and casting their gaze into the distance. However, after a long time, they still can't see the shadow of the tram.

The sky is gloomy, and it looks like it's going to rain.

A small jeep carrying several gaudily dressed women speeds past, leaving behind a gust of "fragrant wind." The small jeep speeds away.

Finally, a trolleybus slowly crawls over like a beetle. From ten feet away, you can already see that the car is packed with people.

As soon as the tram arrives at the station, the ticket seller at the door, who is not wearing a hat, is about to blow the whistle when several soldier elders inside shout loudly

"Open the door, open the door now!"

The ticket seller can't help it and has to open the door. After the soldier elders rush down, the people at the station rush up like a swarm, as if they are grabbing gold...

The ticket seller immediately uses all his skills, using his hands, feet, and mouth, desperately pushing the door while shouting at the top of his lungs:

"Don't be so fierce, okay? See for yourselves if you can fit in!"

The people rushing up seem not to hear and continue to rush up with their heads down...

Suddenly, someone in the car cries out:

"My money is gone! My money is gone!"

A bald young man squeezes out, holding an "empty" canvas bag, crying and shouting:

"Catch the thief!"

An old man at the station hurriedly walks over, concerned:

"How much money is gone?"

"Eight hundred thousand, eight hundred thousand, wa‚Äî‚Äî" The young man bursts into tears.

The old man strokes his beard: "Sigh! What kind of world is this!"

The ticket seller sneers:

"Crying, what's the use of crying, is the thief waiting for you? Hurry back and tell your boss!" Saying that, he clenches his fist and hits the door twice with force, shouting:

"Open it!"

The tram is about to start, and there are still two people clinging to the door.

"How about waiting for the next one?" The ticket seller pushes the door tightly.

The two people ignore him and continue to cling.

This time, it makes the ticket seller furious. He uses all his strength to push the door: "Clatter!"

After a long, long time, another one comes. Before reaching the station, the ticket seller in the car blows the whistle deafeningly, and the tram speeds past.

More and more people are at the station, and the sky is getting darker and darker. It's about to rain.

### Balzac Eats Painted Cakes

Honor√© de Balzac (1799‚Äì1850), the founder of French realism, was also a famous visionary. It is said that when he was young, he only ate some water-soaked bread every day, but he didn't think it was bitter. He often drew pictures of pastries and food on the table with chalk. When the urge came, he would chew voraciously, and he would feel as if he was eating delicacies.

### An Inch of Rivers and Mountains, an Inch of Blood 81

‚Äî Ye Jingfeng

I looked at my watch and it was already past six o'clock. I then tidied myself up a bit and woke up Tiger, telling him about the situation here and asking him if he wanted to eat anything else. He was drowsy for a while before shaking his head. His nostrils were stinging. I knew it was the effect of the fumes. I called him to get ready quickly and leave this place. Coincidentally, that old bumpkin's wife walked in at this time, clapping her hands and laughing, saying, "You two brothers, what did you do yesterday?" She said she had come in two or three times, but seeing us sleeping so soundly, she didn't dare to disturb us. She also asked us if we wanted to eat in the main hall or if we wanted her to make something for us. We told her that we wanted to go for a walk and that if there was official business, we would have to hurry back to the city.

We passed through the kitchen and walked into the aisle behind the "Hall of Seeking Talent." I felt a chill on my body and my nostrils were clear. I felt much more comfortable. There were two paper-covered window grilles in the aisle that led to the main hall of the Hall of Seeking Talent. The paper on the window grilles had many small holes. The buzzing of voices, loud shouts, and small cries all came from here. We walked to the window and peeked inside. Just as we put our eyes close, a stench wafted out‚Äîopium, cigarettes, sweat, people, all mixed with an indescribable strange smell!

From this window hole, only a corner of the hall can be seen. The various details of this corner, I think, even if a painter tries to describe it vividly, can't capture the mood of the people. Men: Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, each and every one either looked like fierce gods or were exuding the decadent aura of someone who was poisoned. Women, if the Rakshasa Kingdom really exists, I think they were all transplanted from the Rakshasa Kingdom. As for their vulgar and outrageous behavior, it's impossible to describe clearly. This is probably a living hell, and it's also probably a kind of paradise that the Japanese invaders created for traitors and lackeys!

We wanted to analyze the people in the hall and make a statistical comparison, but Tiger suddenly gave me a signal. It turned out that someone from the kitchen was carrying a large tray of soup and dishes and passing through here. I quickly pretended to be nonchalant and left the aisle.

To get from the old house to the headquarters in the street district, you have to take the main road and go back to the arched gate, then enter the locked entrance. Thinking that there would be strict guards inside the entrance, we prepared to walk through the backyard of the old village and find a way to get past. We determined the direction and walked along the back of the flat houses along the edge of the old village. At this time, the sky was already dark, but we were carefully avoiding obstacles and exploring the way forward. There were various obstacles separating the old village from the headquarters. Some were ten feet high, some were layers of barbed wire, interspersed with thorns. Some were seven or eight feet high, and the thorns were arranged densely, making it impossible to see what was on the other side. This area had only a small path, and the tiles and stones along the street looked as if no one had ever stepped on them.

When we reached the back of the old village, it was a chaotic forest, desolate and unbearable, like a messy tomb, uneven, and the ground was covered with thorns, wild vines, and weeds, making it impossible to set foot. Tiger suggested that he pick a tree and climb to the top to get a general view and then make a plan. But at this time, I was thinking that it was better to try the main road, because I predicted that it would be impossible to pass through this area at all. Even if we get past these obstacles, we don't know what the situation is on the other side. But there's no harm in looking from the tree.

Tiger tidied himself up a bit and picked a taller tree to climb up. After a while, he came down and told me that he was afraid we couldn't cross over on this side. If we crossed over the obstacles, there would only be a ten-foot-wide ditch on the other side, with a stone wall on the opposite bank, only one person high, and it would be easy to cross over. He said he saw that the main road at the entrance had to cross a bridge, and he was afraid that the guards there would be strict, making it difficult to approach.

I hesitated for a while and discussed it with Tiger again. We decided to try to cross over the obstacles. Because, according to the defensive arrangement, the more dangerous the obstacles, the less strict the defense must be. As long as we overcome this obstacle, it is the main road. I also tidied myself up a bit, took out the small sword I was carrying, and handed it to Tiger, letting him lead the way, because his eyes were sharp and he had some martial arts skills. Although we were careful, we still had our clothes torn and several small cuts on the back of our hands. It took us half an hour to break through this obstacle. Tiger handed the sword back to me, saying that this small sword was much sharper than the small knife he got from the Japanese invaders.

Probably because I often quote sentences from the Bible, many readers have written to ask if I am a Christian. Here, I can answer these enthusiastic friends: I am a Christian, but after leaving school, I have never been to church once and have no contact with the church. I am a worshiper of education and can also say that I am quite interested in the study of the Bible. My interest lies in philosophy and literature. Because this book is philosophical and literary (especially the Psalms).

At the same time, some readers have written to say that this publication "praises Christian works and often criticizes Buddhism," etc. This is definitely not true. If it is said that I rarely quote or introduce Buddhist classics, then that is because of my lack of understanding. I dare not make amateur comments to make a fool of myself. As for "criticizing," I not only guarantee that there has been none in the past, but I can also guarantee that there will never be any in the future.

Religious freedom is a given today, and no one should have narrow prejudices and force others to believe the same thing. Moreover, the basic belief of any religion‚Äîto do good‚Äîis the same. Therefore, if one opposes Buddhism because of belief in Christianity, or opposes Christianity because of belief in Buddhism, that is not the most wise and magnanimous attitude.

In the summer of the thirty-third year (1944), in Chongqing, I went to Beibei Jinyun Mountain to visit Master Tailu. His calm and tranquil demeanor, even though I am not a Buddhist disciple, still lingers in my mind today. I know that it is due to profound religious education. This impression has constantly stimulated me and led me to study the classics.

I have answered truthfully as above. I wonder if these enthusiastic friends can understand?

Fairy Tales for Adults

### The Original Form Appears

‚Äî Wen Hua

It is said that the following joke is currently circulating in Europe:

Once, an airliner carrying many passengers of different nationalities was flying over the Atlantic Ocean. During the voyage, a part of the aircraft's machinery suddenly broke down and could not be repaired. So the pilot immediately announced that the weight on the plane had to be reduced, otherwise it would not be able to reach a safe place. So the passengers had no choice but to sacrifice all their luggage and mailbags and throw them into the sea one by one. However, the load was still too heavy and the plane was sinking. At this point, a Frenchman immediately stood up and delivered a beautiful and passionate speech, the gist of which was that for the safety and happiness of all passengers, as well as the brotherhood of mankind, someone should sacrifice themselves and jump off the plane to save others. However, in the spirit of freedom and equality, these heroes should not be forced, but should voluntarily come out to complete this great undertaking. At this time, a Japanese passenger, hearing about suicide, was greatly moved and immediately walked forward without hesitation, opened the door, shouted "Long live the Emperor!" and jumped down.

The second was a German, who also shouted "Heil Hitler!" and jumped down, but then opened a parachute.

Then an Italian passenger shouted "Long live Mussolini!" walked to the door but hesitated again and again and didn't jump. A British gentleman walked up to him, recited "God save the King!" and pushed the Italian down.

After that, no one volunteered anymore, but the plane was still sinking and had to reduce weight. So everyone gathered in a pile and started a meeting. After repeated discussions, it was decided that whoever was the heaviest should go down. At this time, a large Russian man immediately backed out and shouted "Veto!" (Vets!) refusing to agree.

While everyone was looking at each other blankly and helpless, an American suddenly stood up very generously and said, "Whoever is willing to jump down, I am willing to pay $1,000!" At this time, the Jew, hearing this, immediately stood up and said, "If you can pay me $2,000, and in cash (in cash), I will voluntarily go down." The American was overjoyed and hurriedly took out his wallet to pay when a Chinese businessman, who had been silent until now in the corner, quietly reached out to the Jew and said, "Since you are about to jump down, you should leave the money in my care!"

Weekly Miscellany: Calendar Revolution

### ‚ÄîOverthrow the Current Calendar

‚Äî De Cai

The latest calendar: The current Gregorian calendar is extremely irregular, seems to have no discipline, and lacks the meaning of the word "calendar." Now I propose a new calendar:

The year is still divided into four seasons;

Each season has three months, totaling twelve months in a year;

Among the twelve months: six odd months: January, March, May, July, September, November, etc.; six even months: February, April, June, August, October, December, etc.;

Odd months have 31 days each (odd month, odd number), large months;

Even months have 30 days each (even month, even number), small months.

The whole year has 366 days (standard year, which is actually the current leap year).

Ordinary years reduce one day in January.

The first day of the standard year is called the Standard Day;

July 1st of each year falls exactly in the center of the first and second halves of the year and can be called the "Day of Central Justice." The names of the four seasons of the year are spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

In the current Gregorian calendar, spring is in December, January, and February; summer is in March, April, and May; autumn is in June, July, and August; winter is in September, October, and November. This violates the discipline, spirit, and meaning of the seasons. We can move all the current months forward by one month. February is changed to January, and so on. In this way, spring is January, February, and March; summer is April, May, and June; autumn is July, August, and September; winter is October, November, and December. Or we can change the definition of the English month names: December is January, and so on, and November year thirty day has become New Year's Eve.

The standard day of the standard year happens to fall on a Monday. It occurs four times every twenty-eight years, but there is only one year that can be coordinated with the weekly rotation table. This year is obviously the leader of the four standard years and can be called the "Unified Year."

Modifying the current calendar in this way both accommodates reality and is extremely scientific in calculation, and easier to remember. I tentatively name it: "Disciplined New Gregorian Calendar." I also hope that it will become the "New World Calendar" in the future. If there are any English experts, I hope they can translate it and send it to foreign magazines and newspapers to provide it for everyone to discuss.

### Eternally the Same

‚Äî Wu You

I remember when I was in middle school, I discussed the reform of the calendar with my classmates at an evening party. At that time, I whimsically proposed a novel "new calendar." In short, this "new calendar" is like this:

A year is divided into four seasons; each season has three months; each month has three "weeks"; each "week" has ten days. (The system of "weekdays" is abolished, and the term "weekday" is, in fact, naturally no longer applicable. Even the term "week" is not appropriate, and a proper name is yet to be determined.) A year is originally three hundred and sixty-five days, plus a few hours and some minutes. The above twelve months only account for three hundred and sixty days, leaving five days plus a fraction. These days do not belong to any month, so they are arranged as follows: four days are respectively placed at the beginning of each of the four seasons, named "Spring Day," "Summer Day," "Autumn Day," and "Winter Day." The remaining day plus a fraction is placed at the end of the year, named "Year-End Day."

I can barely come up with many reasons and advantages for this "new calendar." Here is a brief description of the more important ones:

First, it is fixed, without exceptions, eternally the same, simple and clear, and easy to calculate. Second, it is suitable for general habits and needs in personnel matters. Each season and the end of each year have a blank day, which is independent and very effective. (In principle, "X Season Day" and "Year-End Day" are all rest days, which can be used to review and settle the past stage and plan and budget for the next stage, without interfering with ordinary days.) Third, the weekly day off, which occurs every seven days, is changed to a "Weekend Day" off every ten days. Because the New Year has a "Weekend Day," a "Year-End Day," and a "Spring Day" - three consecutive holidays - there is no need for a separate New Year's holiday. There are many other similar situations. This is very beneficial to "efficiency." For example, the time from elementary school to university graduation can be shortened from sixteen years (referring to my country's current school system) to fifteen years. Similarly, administrative efficiency and industrial productivity can be deduced.

This so-called "new calendar" is indeed new, but unfortunately, it lacks academic basis. I wonder if it is correct?

### I Want to Get Married!

‚Äî Ren

Youth Problems

I am not trying to place a marriage advertisement here to find a marriage partner. However, I believe that there must be many women currently encountering the same difficulties as me, definitely not just me alone. Therefore, I want to bring up this problem that has been accumulating in my mind for a long time and cannot be solved, for discussion.

I am a twenty-five-year-old unmarried woman. According to the ancient saying "a woman should marry when she is of age," it is time for me to get married. But what is unusual is that I do not embrace spinsterhood. I desperately want to get married, but I have never had a marriage opportunity to consider in my life. I read the newspaper in the morning and see engagement and marriage announcements every day. Only I am among the crowd but abandoned outside the crowd, and I can never find a possible opportunity. In terms of education, I am a high school graduate, which is considered an intellectual. In terms of physique, I am strong. In terms of appearance, I am not necessarily inferior to people who are fortunate enough to get married. I really don't understand why no one wants to marry me.

The current marriage style has improved with the times and is in a period of "parents do not command, matchmakers are silent." The old style has been abolished, but obviously, there is no universal new style to replace it. China has not yet reached the civilized stage where "daughters are first introduced into society at sixteen" and must work hard on their own. Parents do not arrange marriages for their daughters when they are adults. How can they say to friends everywhere, "Please introduce me to some boyfriends so that I can have a chance to get married?" There are many people in the same predicament as me, around the same age, and with similar circumstances, waiting to get married. However, everyone keeps silent in words, but their spirits are unspokenly understood.

I am definitely not one of those women who think that marriage is the only way for women, nor do I regard marriage as an "escape route." But I myself (and I think many women like me) absolutely do not want to be old maids. The only way not to be an old maid is to get married. To get married, there must be a partner. Where should I find a partner?

Some people may say, "Go out and do things, and you will naturally meet more people, and then you will have opportunities?" But how many institutions in Shanghai can a high school graduate strive for, besides elementary school teachers and female typists? And in these institutions, if there are not more women than men, then most of the male employees are already married. I once read an article in the September issue of Coronet titled "How to Find a Husband," but the article is not applicable to China. I want to get married, but I am being forced by the environment to walk down the terrible path of "old maid." What should I do?

Shanghai Insider

### Dancers and Dance Halls 4

‚Äî Jia Mo

The income of ordinary dancers is naturally not comparable to that of red stars. The difference between them is so large that it is enough to make outsiders gasp. Ordinary dancers (referring to those in second- and third-class dance halls who have seats and are doing well) have an average monthly income of about one million to one and a half million. Black stars who are in decline only have three or four hundred thousand per month. And the most miserable Gu√¨huƒÅ dancers have less than one hundred thousand per month. They have no monthly salary or base salary. There is no cost of living index to rely on. Their income is the converted amount of dance tickets and cash given by guests. The following table is based on inquiries to clarify this:

(Level) (Seat Type) (Dance Hall Type) (Average Monthly Income)

First-Class Red Star Non-Seated First-Class Dance Hall Over 8 million

Second-Class Red Star Non-Seated First-Class Dance Hall Over 5 million

Second-Class Red Star Non-Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 6 million

Third-Class Red Star Non-Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 1 million

Third-Class Red Star Non-Seated Third-Class Dance Hall Over 2 million

First-Class Dancer Seated First-Class Dance Hall Around 1 million

First-Class Dancer Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 2 million

Second-Class Dancer Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Over 1 million

Third-Class Dancer Seated Second-Class Dance Hall Under 800,000

Fourth-Class Dancer Seated Third-Class Dance Hall Under 400,000

Black Star Seated Third-Class Dance Hall Under 150,000

According to the above table, we found a very peculiar example, that is, the income of a third-class (at least) red star who is "non-seated" is often not as good as that of a seated dancer. Moreover, the average income of a first-class dancer in a second-class dance hall with a seat is actually higher than that of her sisters in a first-class dance hall. This is because most of the dancers who frequent first-class dance halls bring their own dance partners, or they call the red stars to sit with them, which makes it difficult for seated dancers to make a living. On the other hand, the seated dancers in second-class dance halls are more resourceful, and the dancers are all enthusiastic single men.

Those dancers who are frustrated in second- and third-class dance halls often run to other cities as a way to survive. However, since Nanjing and Hangzhou banned dancing, they have returned in a panic. Currently, the only other city is Hong Kong. Moreover, there must be sufficient preparation for travel and living expenses (about one million national currency). Therefore, there are not many who go to other cities.

Those dancers who are qualified as red stars live in an environment of temptation. Therefore, love affairs are endless, and marriages or cohabitations can be found at any time. They often suddenly declare their disappearance, because they have retreated to the golden house of a rich man. At the same time, rising stars continue to climb up from small dance halls. "The waves of the Yangtze River push the waves ahead." New dancers are constantly growing. Old dancers are constantly climbing up and constantly changing. This has created a deformed new profession for women in Shanghai. This has created the prosperity of the dance industry in Shanghai, a hedonistic and sensual distribution center. (The End)
