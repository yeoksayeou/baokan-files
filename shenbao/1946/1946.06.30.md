### Ceasefire Deadline Expires Today at Noon; Chairman to Issue Important Proclamation; Tripartite Committee to Meet This Morning for Final Decision; Ma, Hsu, and Chou May Fly to Northeast Together

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th Morning, 3 AM] It is heard that Chairman Chiang will issue an important proclamation tomorrow morning regarding the outcome of the peace talks. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang convened a dinner gathering at the military academy residence around 7 PM this evening, inviting key government officials such as Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Hsu Yung-chang, Yu Ta-wei, Wang Shih-chieh, Shao Lizi, and Chang Li-sheng. It is said that after listening to reports from various parties, the Chairman discussed the current situation with the committee members. Latest news tonight indicates that the Military Tripartite Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning to make final decisions on the Northeast ceasefire, resumption of transportation, reorganization and integration of troops, and Ambassador Ma's arbitration authority. If a full agreement cannot be signed, the already decided portions will be signed, and a joint announcement will be issued by both sides. The situation is improving due to Chairman Chiang's forbearance for the sake of the nation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The Central Propaganda Department is preparing to issue an important announcement within the last hour of the ceasefire deadline tomorrow, or within two hours after the deadline. The content of this announcement may be a prelude to comprehensive peace, a reservation for comprehensive peace, or an agreement for partial peace, depending on the attitude of the CCP within ten hours after midnight tonight. According to Deputy Minister Xu of the Central Propaganda Department, who jokingly told our reporter this evening: "Please rest assured and sleep well tonight, reporters. Please come tomorrow to hear good news. Although tomorrow is a weekly holiday, the Central Propaganda Department will still be open as usual."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The third ceasefire deadline expires at noon tomorrow, marking another expiration. However, as of 11 PM tonight, partial issues within the troop reorganization plan have yet to be agreed upon. It is heard that this morning at 10 AM, Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei met with Ambassador Marshall, but only spoke for about twenty minutes before departing. Ambassador Marshall then, at 11 AM, brought his revised and supplemented troop reorganization plan from last night, along with the CCP's supplementary opinions on the plan, to pay respects to the Chairman. They held earnest talks for two hours, and he only returned to his residence at 1 PM. Colonel Cooke also visited Zhou Enlai at 11 AM this morning, discussing for one hour. After the meeting with Cooke, Zhou hurriedly went to Marshall's residence at 2 PM to hear the results of Marshall's morning meeting with the Chairman. He considered accepting Marshall's advice and sincerely consulting with the government on the troop reorganization issue to resume the Military Tripartite Committee meetings. It is heard that the discussions continued until 6:30 PM, but no concrete results were obtained.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] It is learned that if the compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Marshall is agreed upon and signed by both parties, Ma, Hsu, and Chou of the Military Tripartite Committee may fly to the Northeast together to facilitate a comprehensive ceasefire within the Northeast border to facilitate negotiation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] According to the CCP side, the CCP has made the following concessions in the troop reorganization: (1) The CCP has given up its demands regarding the proportion of troops. (2) The current situation in Harbin can grant the government a significant "advantage." (3) The CCP garrison in the Rehe, Chahar, and Northern Jiangsu regions can make concessions as much as possible in terms of locations. The above opinions are the content of the four-hour discussion between Zhou Enlai and Marshall this afternoon. Marshal Marshall originally planned to visit the Chairman tonight, but it was canceled because the records had not yet been fully translated. They should be able to meet and talk tomorrow morning.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] It is heard that the government's counter-proposal to the troop reorganization plan, regarding Northern Jiangsu (including Northern Anhui), Rehe, Northeast, and parts of Shandong, hopes that the CCP can withdraw completely. This plan is the defense zone system that the government has consistently insisted on based on the demands of the people in various regions. According to Shao Lizi, who returned from Chairman Chiang's residence, most of the issues have been agreed upon, and only the parts within the Guannei region remain to be discussed.

Compromise Plan Contents

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Today, the government and the CCP spent the entire day discussing the transitional measures in the troop reorganization compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Marshall yesterday. It is heard that this method has adopted some of the CCP's opinions. If this plan can be agreed upon before 12 AM tonight, it is hoped that the tripartite meeting can be reopened within the last six hours of the ceasefire period, and the two sides will sign at the end of the meeting and issue a public announcement immediately. However, the government has many difficulties in accepting this method and is currently making final considerations. The following are the main points of the content of the compromise plan proposed by Ambassador Marshall:

(1) Regarding the issue of stationing locations, both sides' troops should return to the state before the Northeast ceasefire order was issued on June 7th. (2) The government peacefully receives the three major cities of Harbin, Qiqihar (one says the CCP will not withdraw from Qiqihar for the time being), and Andong, limited to administration. When administrative personnel go to receive them, the CCP troops should withdraw to areas thirty or fifty miles outside the city. (3) All troops stationed on major railway lines should withdraw to designated areas to avoid conflict and restore transportation. (4) Both sides' troops should quickly reorganize and integrate to save expenses and must not arbitrarily conscript or expand their forces. (5) The reorganized troops will all be national troops of the Republic of China and enjoy all the treatment of national troops. (6) All parties and groups should withdraw from the military. After an agreement is reached, the KMT and CCP will formally sign an order for a nationwide ceasefire and quickly restore national transportation. (7) Once the military issues have concrete results, the reorganization of the National Government and the convening of the National Assembly will be implemented, a constitution will be formulated, constitutional government will be implemented, and "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" will be achieved. However, the three parties involved have not confirmed this plan. It was unilaterally spread by people close to a certain party, and it is heard that the CCP has expressed agreement with this transition method because the above method is extremely beneficial to the CCP.

[United Press, Nanjing, 29th] Dagong Bao reported today that the CCP has expressed approval of all the suggestions in Marshall's troop reorganization compromise plan. The government still insists that the Communist army should withdraw from all ports in Shandong, major cities and railways in Rehe and Chahar, as well as northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu. According to the CCP, the Communist army wants to withdraw from a portion of the above-mentioned areas, but the government must not abolish the political systems, economic plans, and other policies established by the CCP in those areas.

### Various Circles in the Capital Had Frequent Contacts Yesterday; Shao Lizi and Wang Shih-chieh Visited the Chairman; and Held Discussions with Mo Dehui and Others

Representatives from all parties believed that the ceasefire deadline was approaching, and within this short period, they all hoped that various issues could be agreed upon, and looked forward to making the greatest efforts to achieve true peace. During the tea party, Shao Lizi first reported on the recent negotiation situation. Liang Shuming, Zhang Junmai, and Luo Longji then reported on their conversations with Zhou Enlai and their visits to Marshal Marshall.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Shao Lizi and Wang Shih-chieh visited the Chairman at 8 PM tonight, and then went to Mo Dehui's residence at 11 PM for a meeting. According to Shao, regarding the issue of war and peace that the people of the whole country are concerned about, he can inform reporters: "There will definitely be no fighting tomorrow." As for the unresolved issues, only the inland portion of the troop stationing issue has not been agreed upon, but most issues have been resolved, and the government continues to make the last and greatest concessions.

### The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Officially Begins Operations

### National Assembly Representatives in the Capital Issue Declaration on the Situation; Advocate for the Government to Sanction the Civil War

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] [Changli News Agency] reports: Due to the CCP's repeated delays and lack of sincere remorse, as well as inciting ignorant masses and advocating anti-Americanism, today is the deadline of the ceasefire, and the negotiations still have no concrete results. Recently, representatives of the National Assembly in the capital held a meeting and issued a solemn declaration on the situation, titled "Our Opinions on the Current Situation," jointly issued by Qi Qi of Suiyuan and Shen Lingxiu, representatives of overseas Chinese in Honolulu, and signed by more than sixty people. They advocated for the government to sanction the civil war and protest to the Soviet Union for its actions in fueling the civil war. Furthermore, National Assembly representatives Deng Gongxuan and Zheng Xiangchou told reporters that they believed that the opinions expressed in this signed statement were what the people wanted to say, and there were no partisan biases.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 29th] More than ten cultural groups in Hangzhou jointly issued a declaration on the situation on the 29th, which included "The CCP does not want the Republic of China, only its socialist 'motherland.' The CCP has been revolutionizing for more than twenty years and has discovered that this path is impassable, so it has taken a roundabout turn, saying that communist revolution is the highest goal and democratic revolution is the lowest goal. The CCP's killing, arson, besieging cities, seizing land, and even betraying the country and acting as a traitor, all have a set of theories. One day, if the country is destroyed and the race is extinct, the CCP will still say 'For the world revolution, this sacrifice is worthwhile!' The Kuomintang is not without its shortcomings, but the obstacle to peaceful unification and democracy lies in the CCP, etc." Furthermore, the editorial of the local newspaper today, titled "The Remaining Thirty-Six Hours," accused the CCP's counter-proposal for troop reorganization as an empty and impractical counter-proposal, and called on compatriots and third-party figures across the country to make fair and reasonable judgments and make strict demands.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] The Sichuan Provincial Assembly recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the main points of which are as follows: The CCP violates discipline, betrays trust, rebels with weapons, demolishes transportation to obstruct rehabilitation, and conspires to secede and undermine unification. This time, your graciousness has issued a clear order to extend the ceasefire, showing your eagerness to seek peace. However, the CCP is still capricious and has no remorse. The flames of war are spreading, causing turmoil throughout the country and worrying friendly nations. This assembly witnesses the overall situation and is deeply concerned. It deeply knows that after eight years of bloody war, the fruits of victory have just been reaped. If we continue to be tolerant and retreat, it will inevitably lead to destruction. Therefore, after a general meeting, it was decided that after the expiration of this extension of the ceasefire, if the CCP still acts against orders and disregards the nation's destiny, we earnestly request that you make a decisive decision, quell the internal chaos, relieve the people's suffering, permanently establish peace, and maintain the fundamental interests of the country. The assembly hereby represents 70 million people as the government's staunch support.

### With Unsettled Hearts Inside and Outside the Guannei, Three Groups Depart for Mediation; Yesterday Departed for Qingdao, Shuangcheng, and Tao'an

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 29th] The weather in the north today is gloomy and sultry. The ceasefire deadline is approaching, but reports indicate that the negotiations in Nanjing are still far apart, affecting people's hearts and causing unrest. However, there are three groups inside and outside the Guannei that set out for their respective posts this morning. One is the Qingwu Group newly dispatched from Peiping to mediate conflicts near Qingdao. The other two groups, 35 and 36, departed from Changchun, one to Shuangcheng County south of Harbin, and the other to Tao'an (Baichengzi) in Nenjiang Province. Originally, the Government side of the Northeast Forward Command Post of the Military Mediation Department requested that two groups be sent to Harbin and Qiqihar. The Communist side disagreed.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The 35th Group of the Military Mediation Department, consisting of government representative Colonel Zhang Peizhen and four others, and American representative Colonel Kelly and five others, flew to Harbin at 7:30 AM on the 29th, and then traveled to Shuangcheng by car. The Communist Party representatives will be sent from Harbin. The 36th Group may also begin work in Baichengzi or Kaitong within days, but if the airport in Baichengzi is damaged and cannot land, they may land in Qiqihar and then transfer to Baichengzi.

[Our Zhiyang Dispatch, 29th] With only one day remaining until the ceasefire order expires, reporters visited the military authorities here, but they all remained silent and did not express their opinions. Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, only said that stopping military conflicts, restoring transportation, reorganizing the army, and the issue of troop stationing have been discussed for a long time and are very easy to resolve. The only thing is to implement them in Beili and us. According to military sources, the Communist army has increased its troops in Harbin and Andong, and the national army is also preparing accordingly. There are also many rumors among the people, and the general situation is very tense and on the verge of breaking out. In addition to looking forward to good news, the people of the Northeast hope that the sun will no longer turn on this precious day.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] Lieutenant Colonel Glenn, the new American head of the 15th Ceasefire Group of the Military Mediation Office, and his team of six translators arrived in Qingdao by plane from Dexian on the 20th.

### Acheson Issues Statement Explaining U.S. Aid Policy to China, Aims to Achieve China's Unification

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated the following at a press conference today, regarding the issue of U.S. aid to China: Recent news reports from China indicate that some Chinese individuals have misunderstandings or distortions regarding the goals and policies of our aid to China. The various actions taken by the U.S. government to assist smaller countries are merely steps to complete the aid program to China. This program was agreed upon long ago, and its purpose is to help the entire China eliminate the various effects caused by the long-term war against Japan. These steps should not be interpreted as supporting any military factions of any party within China. Our actions cannot be fully realized in the short term. Their goal is to create, not destroy, the unification of China, and to encourage Chinese people to resolve their domestic problems through peaceful agreements and democratic means, rather than resorting to force. In this regard, we may as well cite the President's public statement on China policy on December 15, 1945, in which the President stated: "As China moves towards peace and unity, the United States will be prepared to assist the National Government in rebuilding China, improving the economy of agriculture and industry, and establishing a strong military organization within all reasonable limits, so that China can fulfill its responsibility for maintaining peace and order at home and abroad."

Assisting China in Training a Modern Army

There is currently a bill in Congress to assist the Chinese government in forming a moderately sized modern army. One of the main objectives of this legislation is to provide China with practical assistance in fulfilling the agreement reached in Chongqing on February 25 of this year regarding the reorganization and unification of China's armed forces. This agreement stipulates that a non-political national army be formed by drawing from the existing Communist and Central armies. Many measures to assist China will require a considerable amount of time for negotiation, agreement, legislative action, and finally, a decision by the President based on the circumstances at the time.

Resolving China's Economic Crisis

The above steps will inevitably take a long time. For example, the military aid to China bill currently being debated in Congress will take more than a year, and if any obstacles are encountered at any particular stage, there may be significant difficulties in continuing. The recent oil pipeline loan agreement with China has attracted much attention. This agreement totals approximately US$58 million. This agreement is, in fact, a formal procedure for the understanding reached between our country and China shortly after Japan's surrender, at which time it was agreed that China could purchase leased materials already in production or en route to China. Various measures to provide economic assistance to China in the form of materials and loans are impartial efforts by the United States to resolve China's severe economic crisis and prevent financial and economic collapse. The U.S. government hopes that the economic assistance we provide will be administered by a government that fully and fairly represents all major political parties in China (including the Communist Party). The U.S. government feels that it should postpone implementing economic aid until all political parties in China work together under a unified government. If we are stingy and do not provide even this minimum level of economic assistance, the result may be a crisis of economic collapse, plunging the general population of China into eternal suffering.

### Shen Honglie Reports on Administrative Situation: Zhejiang's Security is Assured; Seawall Project to be Completed in Mid-July

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th dispatch] Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie, on the afternoon of the 29th, hosted newspaper reporters and reported on the recent administrative situation: (1) Chun'an, Sui'an, Zhuji, Pujiang, Xiaoshan and other counties have all reported floods. Personnel have now been dispatched to conduct investigations in conjunction with the staff of the Executive Yuan, to provide clothing and food relief, and to complete repairs as soon as possible. According to reports, the current floods are due to years of deforestation, so future afforestation work is of utmost importance. (2) On the issue of security, an agreement has been reached with the Pacification Headquarters. National troops will be responsible for the main roads and waterways, while the special commissioners and county magistrates of each district will be responsible for the designated areas. Provincial security forces will eliminate bandits in bandit-controlled areas. In areas where two provinces intersect, the two provinces will dispatch teams to jointly suppress bandits, under the command of personnel dispatched by the Pacification Headquarters. Ammunition has been requested from the Ministry of National Defense, and the province will allocate 30 million yuan to each county for financial support. Chairman Shen also analyzed that banditry is due to a mixture of demobilized officers and soldiers, guerrillas, and puppet troops. A separate law has now been formulated for each county to accept disbanded soldiers and vagrants. Those from other provinces will be sent by the Pacification Headquarters to Teng County, and then repatriated to their original provinces by neighboring provinces. Those from this province will be stationed to reclaim wasteland along the coast.

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th dispatch] The Shanghai-Hangzhou highway leading to the seawall has not yet been repaired.

However, according to Sun Choupei, Director of the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Bureau: According to the Longhua Observatory, typhoons will strike in July, August, and September.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The High Court today sentenced He Wenjie, Wang Jingwei's son-in-law, to two years and six months in prison and deprived him of public rights for five years.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The Capital High Court is currently investigating Zhou Xuechang, the puppet mayor of Nanjing. Citizens have filed hundreds of complaints with the High Court accusing Zhou of crimes, some of which were forwarded from the Chairman's complaint box. As of noon today, the following four crimes of Zhou have been found: (1) In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), he colluded with Tian Jingbo, the chairman of the puppet sugar industry association, to secretly deduct dozens of packages of rationed sugar. After being exposed by newspapers, he was forced to distribute the sugar, but there were still instances of bribery such as selling and swapping the packages. (2) He privately used public funds from the puppet municipal bank for speculation in gold and stocks, and for high-interest lending. (3) He used the power of the price evaluation council to collude with the president of the puppet chamber of commerce, bribing reporters before being allowed to raise prices. (4) He hoarded more than 36,000 bundles of salt, speculating and driving up prices, causing a salt shortage in Nanjing.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Jiang Zhengxiang, who was previously reported by the Nanjing City Council to have committed treasonous acts and automatically relinquished his position as a representative of the National Assembly, was recently found by the City Chamber of Commerce to have borrowed 300 million yuan in puppet currency from the Clearing Office of Puppet Financial Institutions last year under the pretext of being a preparatory member of the City Chamber of Commerce, which has not yet been repaid.

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 29th dispatch] Zhang Beisheng, the puppet Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director and Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu Clearance, was re-tried and concluded by the Jiangsu High Court. The judgment was announced in the first court at 3:00 PM on the 29th. The main text: Zhang Beisheng repeatedly conspired with the enemy to plot against the country, sentenced to death; deprived of public rights for life, all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members. Upon hearing the verdict, Zhang's face turned white and his hands trembled slightly. He wanted to argue, but the court stated that if he did not agree with the verdict, he could submit reasons within ten days to request a retrial.

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 29th dispatch] Tao Shousun, a well-known gangster in Suzhou, had close relationships with enemy intelligence agents and puppet army commander Ni Pucheng during the enemy and puppet period. He used his power to arbitrarily dominate the countryside and harm the local people, and his traitorous actions were obvious. After the victory, he fled to Shanghai. Recently, Guo Dazhang, a soldier of the 202nd Division of the Youth Expeditionary Force's Sixth Army, accused Tao of relying on his power to forcibly buy his ancestral house and requested a thorough investigation to protect property rights. The original accusation also implicated Liu Genghua, a member of the Wu County Provisional Council, for colluding with him. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has now secretly ordered the Wu County Government to handle the matter and report back, and to not be lenient.

### Sun Yat-sen's Internal Organs Were Burned Long Ago; Zou Lu Denounces Chu's Absurd Claims; Ministry of Health Has Telegraphed Beiping for Investigation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Regarding the reasons cited by the traitor Chu Minyi for requesting a retrial, such as the claim that the puppet government sent him to Beiping in the 31st year of the Republic (1942) to negotiate with the Japanese army to retrieve Sun Yat-sen's internal organs and enshrine them in the mausoleum, Committee Member Zou Lu told reporters that this matter was bizarre. Recalling that after Sun Yat-sen passed away on March 12, 1925, when an anti-corrosion operation was performed on the body at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beiping, Sun Yat-sen's family members, including Madam Soong Ching-ling and Mr. Sun Fo, were all inside the operating room. I and the comrades who accompanied Sun Yat-sen to Beiping were all waiting outside the operating room door. When the operation was completed, the doctor announced that the internal organs had been cremated by electric fire, stored in a bottle, and then placed in the coffin. At a central government meeting the other day, Mr. Sun Fo explained what happened that day. Mr. Zhan Jitao also said that this matter was rather strange, and it was decided to have the Ministry of Health investigate the doctor who performed the operation that day and confirm it further in order to dispel the absurd claim. Minister Jin Shunshan also said that he had telegraphed personnel from the Ministry of Health stationed in Beiping to be responsible for investigating with Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

The team has six soup kitchens in Fushun, which can accommodate 6,000 disaster victims for meals every day. Investigations have been conducted in the restored rural areas of the county, and relief efforts have begun. The Fushun municipal administration has gradually gotten on track, but public utilities such as electricity, telephone, water supply, and sewage systems have been destroyed, and the repair work is extremely large. The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also planning to rectify the situation.

[Central News Agency, Chaoyang, 29th dispatch] 105 refugees from Rehe transferred by the Executive Yuan Northeast Branch have arrived in Chaoyang. The Fifth Working Team of the Hebei-Rehe-Beiping Branch sent them back to their hometowns. However, due to the widespread destruction by the Communist army, they can only be sent to Lingyuan, and then given travel expenses to walk back to their hometowns. These refugees were all immigrants forced by the Japanese army and laborers who were captured. Refugees from Western Rehe who were stranded in Chaoyang are also planned to be repatriated.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Planning Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss Five Important Issues; Subcommittees to be Established for Regular Economic Research

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The first meeting of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been scheduled to begin on the afternoon of July 1st and end on the afternoon of July 5th. There will be two sessions each day, morning and afternoon, for a total of nine sessions. The agenda is arranged as follows: the first and second sessions will discuss the policy outline of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the 36th year of the Republic (1947); the third session will discuss ways to rescue the industrial crisis; the fourth and fifth sessions will discuss the review of economic regulations and economic administration; the sixth and seventh sessions will discuss the issue of prices; the eighth session will discuss the coordinated development of state-owned and private enterprises; and the ninth session will discuss improving international trade facilities. At that time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will personally attend and give instructions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The first meeting of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is about to open. Reporters interviewed Deputy Minister Xiao Zheng of the ministry to inquire about the significance and content of the meeting. Deputy Minister Xiao stated: The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously considered holding a national economic conference, but in view of the current inconvenience of transportation and the busy work of the heads of various regions, it was decided to establish this Planning Committee to hire economic experts and senior ministry officials to engage in regular research on current economic issues, as an important reference for the ministry's policies. In addition to holding plenary sessions whenever necessary, the committee will also establish subcommittees to regularly study temporary and special issues. As for the main topics of discussion at the first meeting, it can be reported that there are approximately five items: (1) The policy direction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the 36th year of the Republic; (2) The improvement of economic laws and regulations and administration; (3) How to coordinate state-owned and private enterprises; (4) The encouragement and protection of industry; and (5) The issue of stabilizing prices. Many of the above major issues involve matters beyond the authority of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so the meeting plans to invite personnel from relevant ministries and commissions to participate and discuss them together. It is hoped that this meeting can formulate a relatively complete plan for the current economic situation, and use this economic policy as a pivot to contribute to the government for adoption and implementation. In addition, the reporter asked: There are rumors that Premier Song and Deputy Premier Weng had a certain economic plan that was submitted to the committee for discussion. Is this true? Xiao denied it, saying only that the Central Design Bureau had drafted a plan for opening up the state-owned enterprise system in January of this year, but this is not the main topic of discussion for this Planning Committee.

### Editorial: The Importance of the Trieste Port Issue

Since the reopening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, more than ten days have passed in the blink of an eye, but the conference still has not made any progress. Although several agreements have been reached in the meantime, such as the return of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, the convocation of the European Peace Conference still seems increasingly bleak due to the failure to reach agreements on several key points of the peace treaty. Among these key points of the peace treaty, the redistribution or transfer of land is naturally a crucial key. The two sessions of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and the two sessions of the Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference convened for the sake of the Foreign Ministers Conference, still have a great distance to overcome in resolving these territorial issues. Without reaching an agreement on these territorial issues, it would be almost impossible to conclude a peace treaty and convene the European Peace Conference. Among the issues concerning the redistribution of these territories, one of the most important is the Trieste port issue. Not only has no agreement been reached on this issue to date, but judging from current indications, the opinions among the four powers are growing further and further apart, appearing to be the main dispute of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, demonstrating its importance.

Trieste is a port on the northern shore of the Adriatic Sea. Before World War I, it belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was an important base for the Austro-Hungarian navy. Its residents were originally mostly Italians. Because it was an important sea outlet for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, when the Savoy dynasty of northern Italy rose after 1850 and sought unification, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while retreating in northern Italy, did not advocate returning this important sea outlet to Italy. Italian nationalists had long expressed dissatisfaction with this. It was not until the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I that Trieste and the surrounding lands were recovered, fulfilling the long-cherished wish of the Italian national movement. Unexpectedly, less than thirty years after Trieste was returned to Italy, Italy suffered a disastrous defeat in World War II due to Mussolini's mismanagement of the country. At the same time, Yugoslavia, Italy's neighbor, under Marshal Tito, embraced the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia then used the pretext of a small number of Yugoslavs residing in and around Trieste to demand that Trieste be assigned to Yugoslavia. This demand immediately received the support of the Soviet Union. In Britain and the United States, in order to safeguard the national aspirations of the Italians, there was a natural and firm opposition to the assignment of Trieste to Yugoslavia. In order to show mutual concessions, one side put forward a new proposal, advocating the internationalization of Trieste, to be managed by the United Nations for ten years, and then to be decided by a vote of local residents, which has been opposed by the Soviet Union. The new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union advocated that Italy and Yugoslavia jointly own Trieste, each appointing a governor to implement joint management, and that the Allied powers should recognize the new Italian-Yugoslav border west of Trieste. According to Molotov, this was a "tremendous concession" from the Soviet Union, but this new proposal was clearly opposed by U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has convened twice, and an agreement cannot even be reached on this minor dispute over the Trieste port issue. It can be seen that the future of the Foreign Ministers Conference is fraught with hidden reefs, and the prospects for the European Peace Conference and world peace are disturbing and uneasy.

Although the land area disputed in the Trieste port issue is not large, it is an important key to European peace; it can even be said to be a crucial link in world peace. If an agreement can be reached on this issue, other issues will not be difficult to resolve. The core of this issue is: if Britain and the United States are determined to prevent the further expansion of Soviet power, then they naturally do not want to accept the Soviet proposal to assign Trieste and the surrounding lands to Yugoslavia or to be jointly owned by Italy and Yugoslavia; if Britain and the United States want to adopt a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union, then the Trieste port issue will not be difficult to resolve. Trieste is the gateway to Western Europe. If Trieste is assigned to Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia is a vassal of the Soviet Union, then Soviet power can extend all the way into the gates of Western Europe. Due to the results of the general elections in France and Italy, the British and American authorities currently seem to feel even more obligated to prevent the further expansion of Soviet power. But at the same time, on the other hand, the Soviet Union, in view of the trend of public opinion in France and Italy, has also strengthened its trust in military force, making its attitude more resolute, and allowing its occupation forces in Europe to continue to occupy for a long time before a peace treaty is concluded. Trieste, at least for the time being, is almost a must-win issue. At the last Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, under the insistence of Byrnes, the U.S. delegation already had the cry that Paris was no different from "Munich II," and U.S. Republican stalwart Vandenberg clearly stated that everyone was unwilling to be Chamberlain in the Munich era again. From this, it can be seen how heated the dispute between the two sides has become.

Trieste is a small problem, but the implications behind it are of great significance. This is a problem of power politics versus democratic politics. After two world wars, should humanity still be slaves or free people? But to put it more practically, from a closer perspective, this is the focus of the struggle between the Anglo-American world and the anti-Anglo-American world. We belong neither to the anti-Anglo-American world nor to the Anglo-American world. In this struggle, we seem to be outsiders. However, the world is indivisible, and peace is also indivisible. Our allies always advise that there should be peace within China, and we deeply agree; but we also hope that for the benefit of mankind and world peace, our allies can be tolerant and make the greatest concessions to each other to seek international coordination and maintain world peace. In saying this, we deeply feel that it is necessary for the political leaders of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, like the three giants of the Rochesters Conference in the past, to speak frankly and sincerely during wartime. If we only allow a few foreign ministers to haggle over every detail at the conference table, and devote all their energy to preparing for the strategic strongholds of the Third World War, then world peace is a big problem. Although the Trieste issue is a small problem, the fall of a single leaf heralds the coming of autumn. The inability to resolve the Trieste issue is precisely a sign of the resurgence of the atmosphere of global tension!

### Local Dispatches: Rampant Epidemic in Suzhou, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factories Refuse to Purchase Vaccines, Suzhou Newspaper Criticizes Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for Control

[Our Suzhou Correspondent] Recently, due to the rampant epidemic in this county, although the county health authorities have tried their best to prevent it, they are ultimately constrained by funds, making it difficult to develop. Even isolation hospitals are not equipped. Therefore, patients have nowhere to seek medical treatment and can only sit and wait for death. In addition to being mentally and physically exhausted, the authorities are striving for universal vaccination, but the vaccine supply has been interrupted. After ordering personnel to go to Shanghai for purchase, the various pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai all stated that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has implemented control, prohibiting sales to other areas, and refusing to purchase. When the news came, all sectors of the county were extremely indignant. In addition to the county government being responsible for negotiations, public opinion unanimously criticized the situation. The Suzhou Mingbao newspaper published an article titled "Protest to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau," criticizing it as an illegal measure and demanding the abolition of control.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Plans to Establish a Smoking Cessation Demonstration Center

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] In order to strictly enforce the prohibition of smoking and drugs, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in addition to strictly ordering all counties and cities to strictly investigate and ban them, is also planning to establish a smoking cessation demonstration center in the provincial capital. In order to establish a model to eliminate the bad practices and shortcomings of ordinary smoking cessation hospitals in the past, and to concentrate efforts to jointly plan, on the 26th, the Civil Affairs Department convened relevant units in the provincial capital to discuss issues such as housing facilities and funding sources. It was decided that: 1. The provincial smoking cessation demonstration center will be affiliated with the provincial hospital; 2. Funding and plans will be drafted by the Health Department in conjunction with the Accounting Department, and the number of beds will be limited to one hundred for the time being. The number of medical personnel and staff will be tentatively set at 20, and the number of laborers will be tentatively set at 15. The establishment date of the hospital is expected to be in mid-July.

Songjiang

The Cholera Epidemic Spreads More Widely

Since the cholera epidemic spread to the urban area of this county, the number of deaths has increased day by day. On the 27th, due to the extreme heat, Lao Guan Yang Amao of Xinxin Tea Garden, Malu Bridge, contracted cholera and died despite medical treatment. Tao Ruilin, an apprentice at a woodenware store at Xiangjianongkou, Bailongtan, also suffered from true cholera and died within ten hours.

Bengbu

The Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits Military Vehicles from Engaging in Commerce

The Anhui Provincial Government has reported that on the province's highways, military vehicles are still carrying passengers and goods, refusing to be inspected by various stations, soliciting business at will, and driving at any time. In particular, the vehicles are carrying more than 5,000 to 6,000 catties of passengers and goods, exceeding the prescribed load. When passing over bridges, they also do not unload, speeding and encountering accidents. Such violations of laws and regulations, destruction of traffic rules, and impact on traffic management are detrimental to the future of road administration. The provincial government has recently issued a strict ban to emphasize military discipline and benefit traffic. The Provincial Highway Bureau has ordered its affiliated offices and stations to strictly investigate and prohibit violations, and those who violate will be detained and severely punished.

### Byrnes Firmly Demands Quick Setting of Date for Peace Conference, Expresses Deep Dissatisfaction with Soviet Representative's Delaying Tactics, Fierce Verbal Battle Unfolds at Paris Conference

[Our Dispatch] London, 29th Broadcast: Today's Four Foreign Ministers Conference will have the most important decision, that is, whether the Peace Conference will be convened this summer. The British and French Foreign Ministers and Byrnes have unanimously demanded that the Peace Conference be held this summer, but Molotov has expressed opposition.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes today engaged in a fierce verbal battle with Molotov during the three-hour plenary session of the Four Foreign Ministers regarding the convocation of the Twenty-One Nations Peace Conference, accusing each other of failing to keep their promises. This matter occurred just as the meeting was about to adjourn. Byrnes immediately announced that he would demand that the Foreign Ministers Conference decide on the date of the Peace Conference tomorrow. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately replied that all issues must be discussed before the date of the Peace Conference can be agreed upon. Thereupon Byrnes said that Molotov had raised many issues that must be discussed before the Peace Conference can be convened, which is surprising, as otherwise there will never be a date to convene the Peace Conference. Molotov then proposed to discuss it the day after tomorrow.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th Dispatch] What the Four Foreign Ministers discussed this afternoon were all unresolved issues regarding the five treaties, including the Italian-Yugoslav border, Italian colonies, and other minor economic issues. Major issues were shelved because no agreement was reached, while many minor issues were resolved.

### Moscow Radio Calls for Opposition to U.S. Signing Separate Treaty

[Reuters, London, 28th Dispatch] As the Foreign Ministers Conference is about to end, the fate of the peace treaty is still uncertain, and Moscow Radio has issued a call to oppose the United States or the Anglo-American group signing separate peace treaties with other countries. Radio commentator Nengshi broadcast in English, saying that there have been voices in the United States calling for a separate peace treaty. It should be known that after the First World War, the United States also negotiated peace separately with Germany, which ultimately made a big mistake. How can this error be repeated? According to reports from Washington in early June, there were reports of a separate peace negotiation, but Moscow's propaganda did not respond at the time. Recently, Byrnes and Bevin reiterated warnings that if the four powers cannot agree, the world cannot be left in a state of war forever, so the rumors of a separate peace treaty have arisen again. Nengshi reiterated the results of the separate peace negotiations between the United States and Germany after the First World War, such as the support of American capital for the Mussolini regime and the restoration of the economic and military power of the Weimar Republic, which ultimately led to the rise of Hitler and the outbreak of the Second World War. In other words, after the First World War, the United States not only lost its own peace, but also lost international peace. Regardless of the debate between American political parties regarding their foreign policy, it is felt that the United States currently has a trend of rejecting the group of powers to ensure lasting world peace.

### Italian Colonial Issues

Special Committee Has No Results, Handed Back to Four Foreign Ministers for Handling

[Reuters, Paris, 28th Dispatch] The special committee composed of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers discussed this morning a proposal to postpone the Italian colonial issue for one year. They failed to reach an agreement on the administrative issues of the colonies during this transitional period and handed it back to the Four Foreign Ministers for handling. It is believed that the committee broke down because it did not approve of the Soviet proposal to establish a Four-Power Colonial Administrative Committee. The British representative supported continuing to maintain the current military rule, while the American and French representatives advocated finding a compromise between these two proposals. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky insisted that if this proposal was not accepted, the committee could only declare failure. The British representative opposed this step and stated that he was unwilling to recognize the collective trusteeship of the four powers, creating this precedent, as it would only give the four powers nominal sovereignty, which is the same as approving the French representative's compromise proposal of "symbolic" control by the four powers yesterday.

### Italian Patriotic Musician Refuses to Perform in Paris

[Reuters, Paris, 28th Dispatch] The 79-year-old Italian famous musician Toscanini, in order to protest against the Four Foreign Ministers' decision to assign the Brigar and Tanda regions of northern Italy to France, has stated that he will never come here to conduct the performance of the Milan Orchestra.

### Control of Austria, Allied Countries Sign New Agreement

[Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch] The four-nation representatives of the Allied Council in Vienna have signed a new control agreement that greatly limits the Allied countries' supervisory powers over the Austrian government. It is understood that the implementation of this agreement was initiated by the British side. The laws passed by the Austrian government originally needed to be reviewed by the Allied Council and could be vetoed by one country. The new agreement now stipulates that the laws passed by the Austrian parliament can only be vetoed if Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union unanimously express opposition within three weeks. However, the issues of refugees, German property within Austria, and the constitution are exceptions. The old regulations still apply, and one country can still veto them separately.

### Veteran Politician Nicola Elected Provisional President of Italy, Gasperi Cabinet Resigns as Usual

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 28th Dispatch] The Italian Constituent Assembly elected a provisional president, with Nicola elected with 504 votes against 396 votes. Nicola was born in 1878 and served as President of the Senate in 1923. He resigned because he was unwilling to swear allegiance to the Fascist Party and soon withdrew from politics. He was later appointed as a senator by King Emmanuel II in 1929, until after the liberation of the port of Naples by the Allied forces in 1944, when he resumed his political activities.

[Reuters, Rome, 29th Dispatch] Nicola has been elected as the first president of the new Republic of Italy. It is expected that the next step in the development from a monarchy to a republic will be that Prime Minister Gasperi will submit his resignation. The new cabinet will be composed of the Communist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Socialist Party. Then the Constitutional Assembly will begin its work of drafting a new constitution.

### World Federation of Trade Unions Advocates Cutting Ties with Franco

[Associated Press, Moscow, 29th Dispatch] The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions today called for cutting ties with the Franco regime and requested that the United Nations declare Franco an illegal regime, while recognizing the Giral government in exile as the legitimate government of Spain.

### Warships Congregate in Trieste Port

[Associated Press, Trieste, 28th Dispatch] In addition to the two British cruisers and several small warships originally in the port of Trieste, the U.S. ten-thousand-ton cruiser Fargo arrived here tonight.

### Brazil Resumes Relations with the Soviet Union, List of Foreign Envoys Announced

[Agence France-Presse, Brazilian Capital, 28th Dispatch] Brazil and the Soviet Union have been severed for 28 years. The list of foreign envoys announced by the Brazilian government has not included Soviet diplomats until now. Now that the two sides have resumed diplomatic relations, the list of foreign envoys announced today only includes six Soviet personnel, including two ambassadors and counselors, and two secretaries and attendants each.

### Aspects of American Foreign Policy

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

Let us turn back to the story of "Dollar Diplomacy." I cannot estimate how much profound power dollar diplomacy can generate, but on the surface, dollar diplomacy does have its considerable scale. When the 500 million British loan was being debated in Congress, British diplomats, dignitaries, and bankers were making various arrangements and activities in the United States. After the House of Commons passed it, just as it was about to be presented to the House of Lords, suddenly Professor Laski, a British authority and senior advisor to the Labour Cabinet, gave a speech, the gist of which was: Britain cannot rely solely on friendship with the United States and needlessly offend the Soviet Union. Laski warned the British people to recognize the decline of American capitalism and to look forward to the emerging power of the Soviet Union. He said that Britain should stand between the United States and the Soviet Union, leaning slightly to the side of the Soviet Union. When this speech reached the United States, many newspapers began to criticize it. The New York Daily News, which was slightly sensational and very right-wing in its attitude, wrote a very vivid editorial, publishing a photo of Laski with the caption: "Recognize the True Face of the British." The editorial said: Just as the United States was passing the loan to Britain, Labour Party General Laski gave such a "biting the hand that feeds you" speech. Let them go and get close to the Soviet Union! Anyway, the United States cannot give the thread to others and then have others slap themselves in the face. The New York Daily News called on the House of Lords to reject the loan to Britain, saying: "Now workers are on strike, and prices are so high, why not use this money to save our own people?"

Britain and America are After All One Family

Of course, the New York Daily News's criticism will not be effective, and Laski's artillery-like speech is just talk. Britain and America are, after all, one family. The Americans knew that Britain would become a strong competitor in international trade with this money, but they still lent it. I have listened to several Congressional meetings discussing loan issues. The white-haired senators spoke very childishly and like they were "joking." They put forward loan conditions, some saying, "The loan can be granted, but the British must not look down on the United States again"; others said, "The money can be lent to them, but also tell those British not to be arrogant!" Some stood up and said thirty or forty conditions one by one, but apart from the lease of military bases being something to be valued, almost all of them were childish words. But it is not easy to understand the foreign policy decisions of a childish country. As I said earlier, the Paris Conference was a turning point in American foreign policy, then after the Paris Conference, the deployment of American diplomacy should have been very active everywhere. But there is still a problem here, because the essence of diplomacy is not preparation for war, and preparation for war cannot be considered diplomacy, let alone that the American people do not want to go to war with the Soviet Union? Based on this point of view, many, many people have voiced dissatisfaction with Byrnes. This dissatisfaction is not divided into Democrats and Republicans, nor is it divided into those in power and those in opposition. If we must use party lines to distinguish them, then those who criticize Byrnes' foreign policy the most are not the Republicans, but the Democrats themselves. I cannot fail to point out Mr. Wallace as the leader of this force. Perhaps my view is a bit arbitrary, or premature, but judging from the facts pieced together, the Democratic Party is indeed splitting, and the leaders of the left wing are slowly gathering around Wallace. I have not studied the history of the development of the Democratic Party, but the Democratic Party's work in the United States and even in the world is indeed a remarkable political group, with keen vision and a large number of talents, far superior to the Republican Party. At least this is the case today. This does not mean that the Republican Party has no people. The Republican Party also has outstanding talents who have always been admired by the American people. But the Republican Party's talents are mostly pragmatic entrepreneurs who can do one thing well, but they cannot have unique vision and walk ahead of the times. For example:

American Bao Gong, Dewey

Republican General Dewey was formerly the prosecutor of New York City, prosecuting tens of thousands of cases of murder for money and harming society every year, being upright, selfless, iron-faced, and ruthless. During his tenure as prosecutor, the lives and property of the people of New York were indeed guaranteed. When the people of New York talk about Dewey, they think of Bao Gong from the Chinese "Seven Heroes and Five Righteous Ones." Now this American Bao Gong is the Governor of New York, and the security of the entire state is well-organized. Another example is former President Hoover, a Republican general. Before he became president, he handled world disaster relief, being fair, impartial, prompt, and reliable. Therefore, the Americans elected him as president. But once he became president, he was flustered in dealing with the economic downturn. After four years, he immediately stepped down. Now Hoover is doing relief work again, and the Americans are convinced that he can still do well, because he can concentrate and be responsible for doing one thing well. I don't know if this is the style of the Republican Party? This style is completely different from the characters of the Democratic Party. If we say that the Republican Party's pragmatic approach is the right way, then, according to the Chinese saying, the talents of the Democratic Party are mostly "unorthodox" and "prodigies." They have vision, have the courage, and don't necessarily have to do everything themselves. Perhaps this style was influenced and cultivated by Roosevelt in the past. Taking foreign policy as an example, when Roosevelt was alive, the Democratic Party had a heavy stone to hold it down, and because the opinions and steps within the Democratic Party during the war were consistent, not only was the internal consistency, but also the Republicans could be used by Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's death, the heavy stone was gone, and the war was over. Thus, within the Democratic Party, there were significant differences in foreign policy and foreign opinions. Mr. Wallace's main base of operations is the Molomo Hotel on 42nd Street in New York. I have listened to Mr. Wallace's speeches at evening parties several times. His basic diplomatic attitude is that the United States should not hate the Soviet Union or isolate itself from the Soviet Union. He sharply states: "If we walk hand in hand with Britain, we will definitely be dragged down by Britain." The current diplomatic responsibility of the United States is to grasp the key to world peace. The only way for the United States to seek world peace is to stand in the middle of Britain and the Soviet Union, impartially. Wallace rarely directly criticizes the current government in his speeches, but in every word, he is addressing the measures of the current government. He likes to bring out the "legacy" of the late President Roosevelt. I don't know if this is the "orthodox struggle" of the Democratic Party? In theory, Western society does not pay much attention to "orthodox" and "illegitimate." Mrs. Roosevelt often likes to listen to Mr. Wallace's speeches. Former Secretary of State Stettinius, Mrs. Roosevelt, Mr. Wallace, and Secretary of Labor Schlenber are a group of people in the Democratic Party who are more compatible with each other. Let me arbitrarily give them a name: "The Left Wing of the Democratic Party." (To be continued)

### Relief of China's Famine is Only Partially Effective

Hoover's Broadcast Speech Claims

[United Press, Ottawa, 28th] Former US President Hoover, at the request of the Canadian government, delivered a broadcast speech here tonight, stating that the gap between the world's food supply and the minimum needs of the people has been filled. If the grain-producing countries can continue to cooperate, there will be no collective starvation. However, China is an exception. Due to the inconvenience of inland transportation and the lack of organization, relief has only achieved partial effectiveness. Hoover, who represented President Truman in investigating the disaster situation in 38 countries, claimed that this speech was his "final report." It is said that the current critical period has not yet passed, and the International Emergency Food Committee should find ways to provide special assistance to 200-300 million children in Europe and tens of millions of people in Asia.

### Tomorrow's Atomic Bomb Test, the Huge Explosion Sound on Bikini Island Can be Received by Radio, the Speed of Radio Waves is 186,000 Miles Per Second

[United Press, New York, 28th] According to scientists, when the atomic bomb is tested on Bikini Atoll on July 1, the speed of the sound wave when the atomic bomb explodes above the reef is 1,100 feet per second, while the speed of the radio wave is 186,000 miles per second. Therefore, it is possible that radio receivers can hear the sound of the atomic bomb exploding before the participants in the test. Commander Blandy of the atomic bomb test has announced the plan to listen to the atomic bomb explosion by radio. However, the New York National Broadcasting Company announced that the plan to listen to the atomic bomb explosion has not been fully developed, but it is expected to use short waves in the future. Blandy's plan is to place the microphones on the target ships, which is similar to the test news broadcast. One of them will be placed on the target ship "Pennsylvania," which is located in the center of the test ships. The other ships are moored hundreds of yards away. When broadcasting the news, the electrical rhythm controller on the "Pennsylvania" will start to emit "tick-tock" sounds. When the radio listener does not hear this "tick-tock" sound, it indicates that the atomic bomb has exploded, because the electrical rhythm controller on the "Pennsylvania" may have been blown to smithereens at this time. Many naval personnel believe that the amplifiers on other target ships that are farther away may not be destroyed at the same time, so radio listeners can hear the sound of the atomic bomb exploding. Blandy's flagship "McKinley" also has an amplifier, moored ten miles away, and listeners can hear the sound broadcast 40 seconds after the atomic bomb explodes. The reporter ship "Appalachian," fifteen miles away from the target ship, is also equipped with an amplifier to broadcast the sound of the atomic bomb explosion.

Vermilion Boats Test Radiation Energy

[United Press, Flagship "McKinley," 28th] There are six vermilion boats in the test fleet, which are modified from 86-foot landing craft. They will be controlled by radio by thunderbolt aircraft to test the radiation energy in the lagoon after the motorized forces dare to return to the target area. The ship is equipped with a Geiger counter, which can record the amount of radiation energy in the lagoon. There is also a wireless capsule counter attached to the wireless telephone to report the radiation energy situation to the ships. When radiation energy is found, the Geiger counter will emit a "tick-tock" sound. The more radiation energy there is, the faster the sound will be. If approaching a dangerous area, the "tick-tock" version will speed up and become a "buzz" sound. The small boats that detect radiation energy are also equipped with special equipment to extract seawater from the lagoon and bring it back to the test ships for analysis. The small boats that detect radiation energy are not driven by people. The lagoon and fixed locations are equipped with counters with rangefinders to measure the radiation energy in the water flow and air system. At the same time, aircraft are used to measure the flow of the clouds that had radiation energy in the sky after the atomic bomb exploded. It is impossible to speculate how long radiation energy can remain in the water, because there is no precedent to follow. The amount of toxic substances scattered in the air when the atomic bomb explodes in the airspace is the largest.

Fragments After the Explosion Fly into the Stratosphere

It may even cause the exploded fragments to fly into the stratosphere. According to some scientists, the residual radiation on the ground can be equal to several tons of radium ingots. A large amount of radiation energy may be concentrated in the water during underwater explosions, but whether the minerals in the seawater will increase or prolong the original danger of nuclear fission will be known after the experiment. However, at high tide, seawater containing tin will flow into the lagoon from the east, rapidly changing the water quality in the lagoon. In that case, the radiation energy of the lake water may be cleared earlier.

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 28th] After the bomb test, four radio-controlled flying fortresses and many naval aircraft will immediately fly to investigate and report the explosion scene with radio image transmission machines for scientists to conduct accurate research.

Members of the Observation Group May Visit China

[United Press, Washington, 28th] President Truman specially appointed a survey group to participate in the original bomb test. The group includes scientists and ten members of Congress. The group leader is Dr. Compton. They will return home after the second atomic bomb test. During the first and second tests, the group may go to Guam and other US military bases in the Pacific, as well as China, Japan, and other places. However, according to the representative of the group, they will probably not go to the Philippines.

Atomic Bomb B29 Aircraft Took Off from Kwajalein

[Central News Agency Reporter Song Dehe, Kwajalein Atoll, 28th] All reporters and visitors arrived at Kwajalein Island today. More than 60 Army and Navy aircraft, including B29 aircraft, will take off from here during the test, carrying atomic bombs to Bikini. American reporters or reporters and visitors from other countries are prohibited from visiting a part of the island. When the (B29) aircraft carrying the atomic bomb takes off, various preventive measures will be taken to ensure the safety of the personnel on the island. All non-essential personnel will be evacuated from the island for fear of accidents involving the aircraft.

If the Weather is Bad, Postponement is Possible

[United Press, Guajalin Island, South Pacific, 28th] The atomic bomb test commander predicted today: If the weather is bad next Monday, the first atomic bomb will be dropped in the first half of July. If there is no sunny day in half a month, the bomb will be dropped regardless of the weather.

[United Press, Bikini Flagship "McKinley," 29th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal declared to new reporters on the flagship today that this original bomb test is not invaluable and can produce pre-calculated results. The ships selected for bombing are extremely interesting. The result of the Japanese battleship Nagato after being bombed is particularly noteworthy.

### Atomic Bomb Test Day, Special Commemorative Postmark

[US Information Service, Honolulu, 28th] The US Navy has approved a postmark engraved with the date of the atomic bomb test and the words "Atomic Bomb Test Bikini Island" to be stamped on 200,000 letters.

### Inspection of the Bombing of Hiroshima, the Report of American Experts is Released, Proving that the Power of the Atomic Bomb is Indeed Terrible, a Far-Reaching Plan Should be Prepared to Prevent Attacks

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Experts sent by President Truman to Japan to inspect the atomic bombing situation have submitted a report today, drafted by Averell of New Jersey Insurance Company, which advocates that the United States should formulate a far-reaching plan to prevent atomic bomb attacks. It is said that the bombing situation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki proves that the danger of the atomic bomb is not fictional. The United States should "now" prepare how to deal with the atomic bomb, and should not slacken in the slightest. All American troops should be dispersed, hidden, and protected. In addition, they should be careful at all times so as not to lose the ability to counterattack after being bombed by one or several atomic bombs. In order to protect the people, fortifications that can resist atomic bomb explosions, flashes, burns, and radiation should be built. Other necessary plans include building stronger houses, organizing a national reserve defense force equipped with grain seeds, emergency supplies, and equipment, dispersing various industrial and medical equipment, and evacuating cities. At the same time, the Army Department's Manhattan Atomic Bomb Manufacturing Engineering Office also submitted a similar report. Both reports do not believe that some people died from the radiation energy left in the bombed area during the atomic bomb explosion. However, according to experts who went to Japan for inspection, if the atomic bomb exploded not hundreds of feet above the ground, but on the ground plane, the scene would be even more tragic. The Army Department declared that the initial report that the first atomic bomb contained approximately 20,000 tons of TNT explosives was believed to be reliable. However, presidential inspection experts estimated that 2,100 tons of high explosives, incendiary bombs, and fragmentation bombs could have the same effect if dropped on Hiroshima. Both reports gave vivid descriptions of the atomic bomb's destructive and terrifying bombing and burning, and described the principle of the explosion and its destructive nature, but did not reveal any atomic secrets. According to the Army Department, the explosion of the first atomic bomb was determined around the fall of 1942. At that time, the selection of targets was based on the following conditions: the distance of aircraft navigation, whether the environment was easy to identify the bombing target, and the weather conditions. The distance of the second bombing target (Nagasaki was the second target), what impact it would have on the Japanese people and shortening the war, and what impact it would have on the enemy's morale. The expert inspection report warned the American people based on the destruction of the atomic bomb that the danger of the atomic bomb is indeed real, and they became more convinced after going to Japan for inspection.

### Nanjing Massacre Case, Eight Chinese and American Witnesses are Ready to be Summoned to Court at Any Time

Okawa was Injected with 606 Doses

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 29th] MacArthur Headquarters International Prosecutor's Office announced that eight Chinese and American people who had suffered Japanese atrocities and witnessed the killing behavior in China were prepared to appear in court to testify at any time when the International Military Tribunal opened.

### Laborers in Japan Strike for the First Time; Government Employees Stage Large-Scale Demonstration

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th Dispatch] This afternoon, Japanese laborers staged their first strike to protest against the occupation forces. 1,800 Japanese workers at a U.S. Army arsenal went on strike, bringing weekend ship unloading to a standstill. The workers are demanding an end to the distribution of paltry rice rations, a 50% increase in monthly wages, and a one-thousand-yuan anti-hunger allowance for each person. This first strike against the occupation forces is appealing to 300,000 fellow workers under the occupation for support and solidarity in their action. When the strikers marched to the MacArthur headquarters, they stopped in front of the Central Liaison Bureau, which employs workers for the occupation forces. During the march, workers loudly sang songs printed by the Japanese Communist Party. Two worker representatives held closed-door talks with officials from the Central Liaison Bureau for several minutes. All reporters were kept outside.

### Rare Books: Jiajing and Wanli Editions of the Shanghai County Gazetteer Deposited in the Municipal Gazetteer Office; Discovery of the Hongzhi County Gazetteer Ten Years Ago; A Unique and Unprecedented Event

The rare Jiajing and Wanli editions of the Shanghai County Gazetteer from the Ming Dynasty have now been deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office. This event, combined with the office's discovery of the Hongzhi Shanghai County Gazetteer ten years ago, constitutes a unique and unprecedented event in the history of Shanghai gazetteers. According to the person in charge of the office, the Shanghai County Gazetteer was revised three times in the Ming Dynasty, and only the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office has collected and deposited all three editions over the past 300 years. The Hongzhi Gazetteer had not been seen since the Ming Dynasty, and the only copy was hidden in the Tianyige Library, obscure and unknown. It was not until 1936 that the office learned of its existence and negotiated for a photographic copy. The Jiajing Gazetteer could not be found even when the Shanghai Gazetteer was revised during the Kangxi period, and the only copy belonged to the Jigu Ge Library. The woodblocks of the Wanli Gazetteer were damaged during the Kangxi period, and the only copies in the world are those at the Xujiahui Catholic Church, Wu Xing Jiang Mengping, and half a copy at the Beijing Library. Since its re-establishment, the Municipal Gazetteer Office has diligently sought documents, widely inquired, and collected information, continuing its pre-war work, and finally acquired the Jiajing and Wanli Gazetters, completing the collection of all three Ming Dynasty Shanghai gazetteers, including the Hongzhi edition. Its historical significance is real. "The Shanghai Yearbook, 5th Edition, North", and the Shanghai Directory have either already been edited, or are in printing. In terms of archival materials, it has recovered and reorganized tens of thousands of volumes of books and records secretly stored after August 13th, and continues to visit and purchase classical books related to Shanghai literature. The office is the most academically research-oriented institution among the administrative agencies, and its passion for work can be seen from its remarkable achievements. Furthermore, it is understood that a photographic reprint of the Hongzhi Gazetteer has already been made by the office, and it plans to follow suit with the Jiajing and Wanli Gazetters. It is estimated that the cost for each edition will be around 40,000 yuan, and a subscription has been launched. If 100 copies are subscribed, work will begin.

### Shanghai Industry and Mining Construction Association Discusses Current Economic Problems on the Eve of the Economic Conference

[Report from this newspaper] As the central government is about to convene a national economic planning conference, the Shanghai Industry and Mining Construction Association held a tea party yesterday on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel to discuss various current economic problems. More than 20 people from industry and commerce, as well as experts such as Cai Shuhou, Yang Kaidao, Chen Baoyi, Shui Xiangyun, and Wu Juenong, attended. The discussion was lively, and the causes of the current economic crisis in our country were discussed in detail. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM. The general opinions can be summarized into the following points: (1) The current exchange rate should not be changed for the time being, but differential exchange rates or separate subsidies should be adopted for import and export industries based on their nature. (2) Regarding the issue of state-owned and private enterprises, in principle, state capital should be developed, but in reality, state-owned enterprises are currently controlled by bureaucratic comprador capital. Therefore, a democratic approach should be adopted, so as not to harm private enterprises. (3) Regarding the issue of prices, the fundamental solution is to balance government revenue and expenditure. If a balance cannot be achieved, the extent of the imbalance should be disclosed. Secondly, transportation must be smooth and materials must be controlled. Japan must be required to compensate in kind, such as machinery and equipment. (4) The main reason for the bankruptcy of national industries is not high wages. Under the current circumstances, labor and capital should cooperate. Since the exchange rate is inconvenient to change, at least customs autonomy must be sought. In addition, the loan interest rate of the Central Bank seems too high. (5) The fundamental solution to all economic crises lies in political domestic peace and international stability.

### U.S. Troops Prone to Venereal Diseases; Police Busy Inspecting Prostitutes

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Government recently received a message from the U.S. military authorities stating that some U.S. troops in Shanghai have contracted venereal diseases due to frequenting prostitutes, and have brought them back to the United States, causing a significant impact. They specifically requested close cooperation from the city authorities to reduce this problem. The Municipal Government immediately instructed the Municipal Police Bureau to strengthen enforcement. Although the Police Bureau has already been actively handling this matter, some private prostitutes are operating secretly. A method is now being devised to severely crack down on them, and all brothels have been ordered to register and prohibit the operation of prostitutes with diseases. It is reported that in addition to setting up clinics for prostitutes to be examined and treated, the Health Bureau will also set up mobile medical teams to visit and treat prostitutes in various brothels.

### Preparing Three Months of Food to Overcome the Lean Season; City Government Allocated 8,000 Dan Yesterday to Supply the Market; Minister Xu Arrived in Shanghai Upon Summons to Discuss Sources of Rice

[Report from this newspaper] In order to report on the methods of handling recent rice price fluctuations and the news that rice prices will stabilize within one or two days, Mayor Wu specifically convened a meeting with reporters in the City Government conference room at 4:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Wu first reported that the City Government is planning to prepare three months of food for July, August and September to overcome the lean season. Yesterday, the City Government has allocated 8,000 dan of stored rice to supply the market, and warned rice merchants not to arbitrarily raise rice prices in the future. He stated that there is no shortage of rice, as the average daily transaction of rice shops in the city is only five thousand several hundred dan, which is sufficient to stabilize the market. Now, the City Government has decided to use a sufficient amount of stored rice to meet the emergency, so there is no reason for rice prices to rise. The method of selling this rice will follow the original regulations, that is, the selling price will be 46,000 yuan per stone, plus 6% profit and transportation costs, so the selling price should be 51,000 or 52,000 yuan.

Regarding the invitation of President Song to invite Minister Xu Kan to Shanghai, the mayor specifically stated that it was solely to discuss the source of rice, and had nothing to do with the handling of the grain loan case. The grain loan case has now been handed over to the Shanghai-Wusong Preparatory Command for handling.

Mayor Wu expressed his pain regarding some rice merchants who disregard the country and the people, only seeking personal gain, and decided to adopt appropriate methods to actively respond to the schemes of unscrupulous merchants, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods.

### The American Military Shows Indifference to Communist Anti-American Propaganda

Implementing Established Policies to Assist the National Government; No Changes Due to Any Obstacles

The American military here is very indifferent to the Chinese Communist Party's request for the U.S. military to withdraw from China and Mao Zedong's accusation that the U.S. military is fueling the Chinese civil war, and believes that this kind of propaganda has no effect on U.S. policy in China. They said that the Kuomintang represents the Chinese government today, and if we want to assist the development of all parties in China, we should target its government. The American military is not paying much attention to the CCP's malicious propaganda, but they claim that the United States' policy toward China and its assistance to its recovery plan have long been decided, and that all policies will not change due to any obstacles.

### Laborers' and Employees' Cost of Living Index Slightly Fluctuates This Month

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Government Research Office has completed the compilation of this month's cost of living index for the city, which was officially announced yesterday.

The general cost of living index for employees is 319.51766, which is 4.88% higher than last month.

According to the food index of last month, it was 452.31366, and the food index for this month is 438.45419, a decrease of approximately 3.06%. Other items such as housing, clothing, and sundries have all slightly increased.

### Wen Zongyao's Unauthorized Sale of Public Property Continues to be Heard by the Local Court Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The Guangzhao Association of this city filed a lawsuit requesting confirmation that the land sale was invalid, accusing Wen Zongyao, who unauthorizedly sold public property, and the Qian Tai Commercial Bank, etc., who purchased the property. The local court continued the hearing yesterday. The defendants argued that the board of directors had made several resolutions at the time, and Wen Zongyao acted in the capacity of a legal representative, which was unrelated to his political behavior as the acting president of the Pseudo-Judicial Yuan. Therefore, they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff intends to submit additional evidence at the next hearing. The court allowed the submission and adjourned the hearing. Although the litigation fee in this case has reached 1.3 million yuan, it is not yet considered the largest amount among the cases accepted by the local court, because the property lawsuit of the New Asia Hotel has a litigation fee of more than 20 million yuan, which is even more than this case.

### The Prophecy of "No Summer This Year" is Broken

The Atomic Bomb's Impact on Climate Theory Also Does Not Hold

[Our Dispatch] Astronomers once made the prophecy of "no summer this year." However, the recent unusually hot weather proves the inaccuracy of this prophecy. In order to find out how hot the summer will be this year, the reporter visited Zheng Zizheng, director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory on the Bund, yesterday. According to Zheng, the summer temperature in 1934 was the highest in the past 69 years, with 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit in June, 104.3 degrees in July, and 104 degrees in August. In these 69 years, the average highest temperature in summer was 95 degrees, and the highest temperature this year was 99 degrees on June 27. Zheng believes that this temperature is generally normal. There may still be hot days in July and August this year, but the changes will not be significant, and it will definitely not be as unusually hot as in 1934. Zheng also said that the previous report that this year's climate is abnormal due to the impact of the atomic bomb is not tenable from a scientific point of view.

We encountered many dangers, but we overcame all difficulties with a patriotic and loyal spirit, achieved the final victory, and completed my mission during my term of office. This is something I will never forget. However, although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, economic construction is just beginning. The work of the Chamber of Commerce will be even more important than before. I hope that all colleagues will uphold the spirit of service of the past and take 'hard work' as their motto. Since the May Fourth Movement, I have represented the Chamber of Commerce and served the business community, from the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce to the General Chamber of Commerce to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, for nearly 30 years. I have not shied away from difficulties, nor have I accepted bribes. I can ask myself without shame. In the future, Xiaolai will serve the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and also serve as a supervisor of this association. I hope that my colleagues will assist from the sidelines." Afterwards, Secretary-General Yan Zhi delivered a reply, briefly stating: "Colleagues have followed Chairman Wang for more than ten years, just in time for the two Anti-Japanese Wars of January 28th and August 13th.

In addition, the central government's collection of in-kind tax is only set for one year, and the equipment expenses such as warehouses and collection agencies in this city are huge.

### Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hankou Shipping Lines Shorten Travel Time

[Our Dispatch] The Business Office of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been restored for more than a year.

### The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Organizes Special Buses for Passengers at the North Station; Three Lines Will Run from Tomorrow

The number of passengers arriving at the Shanghai North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is very large every day. The original transportation in the city is not enough to carry them, causing passengers to fail to be evacuated immediately upon arrival.

### The Work of Building the Police is Urgent; Mr. Li Shizhen Expresses His Views

[Our Dispatch] Mr. Li Shizhen, President of the Central Police School, recently expressed his views on some important issues related to the police at present. The main points are summarized as follows: Li first revealed Chairman Jiang's instruction: "The foundation of nation-building lies in the police," so he believes that the work of building the police is indeed urgent. However, the development of police work must be based on the foundation of caring for the people and serving the society, and it is necessary to grasp the historical center of gravity, implement benevolent governance, adapt to the trends of the times, and implement the rule of law. Li believes that there are three reasons for the poor handling of police in our country: (1) insufficient quality, (2) too low salaries, and (3) simple equipment. Therefore, if we want to improve the police in our country, we must strive to improve these three aspects in order to talk about establishing the police of a modern country. Since the enemy surrendered, social order has not yet been restored. Li believes that the key to this problem is the poor police duty methods. There is no fixed scope of service, and responsibility cannot be confirmed. The police jurisdiction system recently implemented in Beijing and Shanghai is designed to address this deficiency. However, the outside world believes that the system is strengthening the management of the people, which is a misunderstanding. Li then analyzed the issue of democracy and the police in detail. He believes that talking about democracy is inseparable from the law, and the enforcer of the law is the police. Therefore, the police are the tool for implementing democracy. Li finally hopes that the police themselves can cultivate morality and change past concepts. At the same time, he also deeply hopes that the public's perception of the police should also change, and that they should value and trust the police. He deeply hopes that all relevant parties should assist the work of building the police from various aspects in order to catch up and keep pace with the police of the world's powers.

### Tsinghua Holds a Meeting, Rice Prices Stabilize Once

Mayor Wu's Speech at the Tsinghua Alumni Association Yesterday

[This Newspaper News] The Shanghai Tsinghua Alumni Association held an opening ceremony yesterday because the new clubhouse of the China Flower Bank was ready. Mayor Wu and his wife, Zhou Yizhuan, Gu Yuxiu, Li Zufan, and Wang Huacheng, who recently came to Shanghai and are about to travel to the Philippines to participate in the Independence Day celebrations, were among the more than 200 people present. After Mayor Wu's wife performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating briefly: The last time a meeting was held, it coincided with his arrival in Shanghai to take office, and the most important issue at that time was food. Fortunately, it was soon calmed down. This time, the meeting is again at a time when the food problem is serious, which can be called a coincidence. Before the new grain enters the market, the rice market often undergoes many changes, like a malaria phenomenon. This is because unscrupulous merchants always seek to take advantage of any loopholes in the authorities' actions. However, a large amount of rice will arrive in Shanghai within a day or two, so it is believed that after this meeting, the current difficulties will definitely have a solution. Therefore, every time the association holds a meeting, it seems that the rice price can be stabilized once. It is hoped that the Tsinghua Alumni Association will hold more meetings in the future so that he can always lower the rice price. He can also often shed some "worries" (Mayor's original word was English Worry) in the alumni association. The mayor praised Tsinghua alumni for strictly adhering to their positions and working diligently, which is in line with the school motto of "self-improvement without ceasing." He also said that the main reason why China cannot be as good as people want and the intellectual community has failed to lead well is that they often become corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry as soon as they leave school, which affects the country. He deeply hopes that the alumni of the alma mater can carry forward the Tsinghua spirit and work hard for the country. Then, the chairman of the association, Li Zufan, introduced the newly appointed secretary-general of the association, Zhou Yongde, to the audience. At about six o'clock, everyone dispersed happily.

### A Glimpse of the Improvement of Municipal Middle Schools: Restoration and Addition Total 15 Schools; Shanghai West Plans to Establish a Municipal Art Normal School

[Our Newspaper News] Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were six municipal middle schools in this city: Jingye, Shibei, Wusong, Yangjing, Xinlu Normal School, and Wuben Girls' School. After the Anti-Japanese War, the above six schools were fully restored, and five schools formerly established by the Public Works Department were taken over: Yucai, Gezhi, Jiqi, Jinyuan (formerly Huatong Public School), and First Girls' School. Four schools were added: Gaoqiao, Luxing, Fuxing, and Kindergarten Normal School, for a total of fifteen schools. In addition, three schools were established: Remi Road West Overseas School, Dihua Road West Overseas Boys' School, and Yuyuan Road West Overseas Girls' School, specializing in enrolling American, British, French, Russian, and other foreign students. After the Japanese surrendered last autumn, foreign students who had been living in concentration camps in Shanghai for a long time had no books to read, so these special schools were established. Since July and August, the number of foreign students has gradually decreased, and most of the nationals of various countries have established their own schools. Therefore, the West Overseas Schools are no longer needed, so the education authorities have decided to close the three schools starting from the next semester. The Remi Road West Overseas School site will be moved into by the Municipal Wuben Girls' School. Moreover, because there are still few municipal middle schools in Shanghai West, a municipal Shixi Middle School will be added, and it is also planned to establish a municipal art normal school. The school buildings will use the original sites of the Yuyuan Road West Overseas Girls' School and the Dihua Road West Overseas Boys' School. This is a glimpse of the recent improvements in municipal middle schools in this city. (Tian)

### 160,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Arriving, No Problem with Shanghai Residents' Food Supply Before New Rice Enters the Market

[This Newspaper Report] It is learned that since President Song decided to find a way to supply 8,000 dan of rice to the city every day, the future of the city's food supply has become clearer. A rice industry insider told reporters yesterday that 20,000 dan of rice have already arrived in the city. Before the new rice enters the market, there is absolutely no problem with the continuous supply of rice to Shanghai. Moreover, on July 15th, the first batch of 160,000 tons of Brazilian foreign rice will be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the current grain price in the Shanghai rice market is expected to remain unchanged. In addition, since the authorities unsealed the rice stored in the San Tai and Yangtze rice stores, it has been distributed to various rice shops in the market for sale yesterday. The stored rice is all high-quality thick japonica rice. Therefore, it is expected that from the next day or two, rice will be widely available for sale in various rice shops in the city.

North and South Rice Markets Scheduled to Open on the 3rd

After the North and South Rice Markets in Shanghai were ordered to actively prepare, it has now been decided to start business on July 3rd. It is reported that more than one hundred businesses are participating in trading in each market. It is learned that before the war, rice trading in Shanghai was conducted individually by rice shops. After the victory, trading was concentrated in the Qingli market. However, after centralized trading, it was very easy to have speculation, manipulation, and price increases. This time, the authorities are determined to disintegrate the centralized market. During the transitional period, the old North and South Rice Markets will be restored first, in order to gradually restore the pre-war system of individual transactions by each firm. This measure can break up the atmosphere of speculative trading and prevent normal trading from being hindered. Yesterday was the last day of business for the Qinglian Pavilion temporary rice market. Market transactions were sluggish and have already changed from a buying and selling market to a distribution market.

Decrease in Passenger and Cargo Registration, Increase in Self-Transportation by Rice Shops

The registration of passengers and goods in the rice market decreased again yesterday. The total was only 959 shi, including 795 shi of white japonica rice, 10 shi of Yangxian rice, 2 shi of white yuan rice, and 152 shi of milled xian rice. However, self-transportation and self-sales by rice shops increased sharply, totaling 1,464 shi and 54 packages. Transactions between traders in the market remained the same as before, with few changes. The goods in each stall remained unchanged.

Flour continued to show strength. Raw oil was scarce and quick-selling, with an increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There were still shipments of soybean oil, with an increase of around 1,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was stable. Yellow soybeans were selling well but were somewhat sluggish. Raw peanuts were average, and so was mung bean, with high prices rising and low prices falling. Cowpeas were in demand and sold quickly, remaining in the station. Broad beans were stable at high prices, with the middle and lower grades sluggish and inactive. Soybean cakes from Shantou were still acceptable and rose by 300 to 400 yuan. Wheat from other ports was selectively purchased by those who were clever at digestion and disposal, and the market was firm. The factory continued to digest it, and the prices were neither good nor bad. The Miscellaneous Grain Association will be closed for three days starting tomorrow.

### Relief Rice, Siamese Overseas Chinese Donate 200,000 Bags, The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Arriving in Four Batches

Ma Canrong, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Food in Vietnam, recently returned to China from Haiphong. According to Ma, Vietnam and Siam both reported bumper harvests this year, and local grain prices are low. Siamese overseas Chinese organized the Siamese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for the Motherland's Famine to raise donations to purchase rice to relieve the food shortage in the motherland. A total of 200,000 large bags of rice were purchased. 70,000 bags have already been shipped to China, and the remaining 130,000 bags will be shipped in a short period of time. Ma will also report the situation of various works to Minister Xu of the Ministry of Food within the coming days.

The relief supplies allocated to us by the UNRRA are far from the quantity we requested, especially in the case of rice. Since China began receiving relief supplies in December of last year, as of now, a total of three batches of rice have been shipped. The first batch arrived on March 25th, with a total of 12,445 bags. The second batch arrived on May 25th, with a total of 32,000 bags. The above two batches totaled 3,000 tons. The third batch arrived in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, with a total of 1,600 bags, only over 100 tons. It is reported that the fourth batch has already departed from Hong Kong and will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month. It is also reported that the quantity is only several thousand bags.

### American Agricultural Experts Arrive in Shanghai, Export Industry Hopes for Immediate Relief

The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, a group of eight American members, led by the head of the group, Mr. Hachison, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Chinese delegation members Shen Zonghan, Lin **, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jingzhong, and others have prepared various materials and will immediately begin joint research and investigation. The American delegation's visit to China will pay special attention to improving the four major agricultural products of our export trade, such as tung oil, tea, silk, and wool, and increasing exports to enrich our foreign exchange resources. Chinese officials and people are very excited. According to export industry magnates Qiu Liangrong, Zhang Yujiu, and others, the investigation by the group will take about two months. Then, a plan will be drawn up for the government's reference to provide a fundamental solution. This cannot be achieved in one or two years, and it is difficult to immediately solve the current difficulties in the export industry. Mr. Qiu Liangrong also stated that the current emergency measures for the export trade are: (1) Exemption from export tax. (2) Establishing a subsidy system, with the government bearing the cost of foreign shipping and insurance for all export goods. (3) Reducing transportation costs, which should follow the methods of foreign shipping companies, with equal reductions for both water and land transportation. (4) Low-interest loans, which the Central Bank has already implemented, are only for packing loans. It is hoped that the time limit will be changed to start from the time of transportation. (5) Exemption from business tax. The above five items are not trade policies, but only emergency measures for the present. It is hoped that the government will adopt them. As for a thorough solution in the future, the only hope is that there will be no war, transportation will be restored, prices will be lowered, and wages will be reduced, so that the cost of export goods can be reduced accordingly. Only then can a balance in international trade be sought.

### Reviewing the Long-Term Talk on Foreign Exchange, May Have a Stimulating Effect in the Short Term, Authorities Warn Against Falling into the Trap of Speculators

[This Newspaper Report] Because the half-year settlement period for the silver and money industry is approaching, the new trends in the financial market after the settlement period have become the focus of speculation in all circles. Among them, the talk of long-term foreign exchange is particularly rampant. The reporter once consulted several financial authorities on this issue. Their opinions were that raising the exchange rate might be able to slightly stimulate the export industry for a while. However, the gain will soon be completely wiped out by the soaring prices that follow the long-term appreciation of the exchange rate. The impact will make the current stage of prices and exchange rates more confusing. Therefore, raising the exchange rate is by no means a good policy at present. The reporter then inquired about this matter from the relevant authorities of the Central Bank. They stated that rumors about raising the exchange rate have been repeatedly heard. The market is easily affected by rumors and does not know that it is falling into the trap of speculators. Only after suffering losses will they recognize the truth of the rumors. Therefore, from the perspective of the authorities, they have no need to repeatedly defend these rumors. They only know to use facts to show everything based on the established policies.

### American Dollar Users Shift Positions, British Pound and Hong Kong Notes Become Active One After Another, Gold Prices Fall Slightly, American Dollars Remain Silent

Shanghai yesterday saw a slight fluctuation. However, because of the holiday, some people tried to balance their positions. Although there were some who were killed off, those with capital considered that the environment was not optimistic and bought gold to protect themselves. The overall situation was extremely stable. The morning opened at the same level. On the way, it once fell back from the 2 million mark to 1.97 million. The central bank distributed 325 bars, and the price was also reduced to 1.975 million. However, it was still slightly boosted to above 1.99 million near noon. In the early afternoon, it was still flat. Later, because the transaction was even rarer, those who were pressed for funds were eager to settle, and it fell below 1.97 million. Then it was slightly flattened. As a result, it fell slightly by 3,000 compared with the previous day. The unofficial discount closed at six points. The cash market was tight, and the interest rate ranged from one and a half to two cents.

Because those who needed American dollars moved to the British pound group, and at the same time, the exchange industry people tended to arbitrage between British and American exchange rates, they became even more deserted. The British pound added to the beauty and rose to 9,400 yesterday. The Indian exchange rate was even higher to 720 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was sold at 590 yuan. Transactions were difficult to announce because of the limited supply. Based on the current price of the British pound and the American dollar, the exchange rate between the British and American exchange rates is only over 3.4 yuan, which is still a distance from the official price of 4 yuan. The trend will definitely rise again. The American dollar is still deserted. Yesterday, it rose and fell slightly with the price of gold. The highest price in the middle was 2,670 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,620 yuan. At noon, it was around 2,660 yuan. It fell slightly in the afternoon. As a result, compared with the previous closing, there was no change. The Hong Kong notes had limited chips, and the supply could not meet the demand. As a result, it rose by another 15 yuan.

### Bulls Compete to Sell, Black Market for Government Bonds Falls

Yesterday, the bulls made the final killings on government bonds. The Ministry of Finance will implement the return of principal next month, which is inevitable panic. The selling wind was raging. The hot Grade C transactions were slightly active due to the urgent sale by the holders. The price fell from above 700 yuan to below 450 yuan, and then flattened slightly. As a result, it fell sharply by 40% compared with the previous closing. Miscellaneous brands also fell slightly by 35%. The price difference narrowed again, with the difference between hot and cold being only 100 yuan. Foreign stocks were all suspended. Over-the-counter transactions were slightly quoted for Yongsha Mayer, and the quoted price was slightly lower. The rest were all no market.

### Daya Bank Closed Down, Using Deposits for Speculation

Dazheng Bank, located at No. 19 Tianjin Yi, because senior soldiers failed in operating weaving, lost 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, another six ** of the period were urged, but unable to ** , declared bankruptcy and stopped business. The Shanghai Data Exchange issued a notice yesterday afternoon on the handling method for the bank's bills of exchange. The original text said: "After investigating the Daya Bank, the exchange bank acting on behalf of our office No. 50.38, after the exchange on the 28th, the amount remaining in our office was not enough to pay the difference. Although it was delayed until midnight, the bank still failed to provide the difference to the office. Then, with the approval of the Exchange Committee of our office, (1) each bank and bank in exchange relationship with the Daya Bank on the 28th should return to each other the back exchange **. Those who have already paid the seal should cancel the payment seal. (2) From the 29th, our office will stop acting on behalf of all receipts and payment bills of the Daya Bank."

### China Purchases 50,000 Tons of Wheat from Argentina

[Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 29th]

China has been negotiating the purchase of wheat from Argentina since the beginning of last month, and it has now been decided to purchase 50,000 tons, at a price of 30 pesos (Argentine currency) per 100 kilograms.

### Customs Duties on Imported Goods Based on Market Wholesale Prices

If There is No Wholesale Market Price, the Customs Will Determine the Price

Since the victory, the import of goods into Shanghai has become more and more frequent. As for the payment of import duties, the market wholesale price is used as the basis for calculation. The customs duty wholesale price clause is as follows: (1) All goods will be deemed to be the average market price at which the goods are freely sold or can be sold in the open market at the port of import at the time of import in ordinary wholesale quantities under ordinary trade conditions as the wholesale market price. (2) If there is no wholesale market price for goods at the port of import, the wholesale market price in other major domestic markets may be used as the basis for calculating the dutiable value. (3) If there is no wholesale market price for goods in the domestic market, the bona fide price ex-ship plus 5% should be used as the dutiable value under normal circumstances. (4) If the goods do not have a wholesale market price or a bona fide price ex-ship to be based on due to the following circumstances, the dutiable value may be determined by the customs at its discretion. (A) The ownership of the goods is of a leasing nature and still belongs to others. (B) The goods are subject to royalties and the royalties are not certain or are insufficient for other reasons to estimate the value of the goods. (C) The goods are sold to agents or branches. (D) The goods are transported to China under other special circumstances.

### Silver Dollars Imported From Tianjin

[This Newspaper Report] A large batch of silver dollars was imported yesterday. The China Merchants Bureau's Huangyu ship returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, transporting 8,554 boxes of silver dollars, which were declared by the Central Bank. The ship is currently berthed at floating pontoon No. 10 and 11 for unloading.

### Uranium Standard Said, American Doctor's Suggestion

(Chicago, 28th) Dr. Daniels of the University of Chicago recently wrote an article in a magazine, advocating the use of uranium instead of gold as the basis of the American currency system. Dr. Daniels pointed out that because uranium contains a certain amount of energy, it can be free from the impact of price fluctuations.

### Coarse Yarn Sales Remain Strong, Spot Cotton Market Remains Firm

Yesterday, the yarn market was unusually firm. 20s spot goods were still unsalable. Dasheng Yarn Factory opened over one hundred pieces of Nianzhi Cai Kuixing, and small-scale goods and road yarn were also transacted in not a few cases, all of which were absorbed by the Jingwu gangs. Fine yarn was still not improving, and both supply and demand were silent. At the close of the 20s Shuangma, someone who was tired of Luoke said that it was reduced to seek cash urgently.

Yesterday's New York American Cotton Telegraph, the market fluctuated, up and down three or five pounds. The near-term was US$31.19, and the long-term was US$31.24. The spot price of Metering was US$31.65. The spot cotton trading in the local market was still good. Lixin Factory imported Metering, and Xiamen Factory imported Pengjia Pi. In addition, the trade of flower numbers was not deserted, and the market was still in a firm situation.

Both the cloth street and the customers have a male star need. Because the supply of serge is short and the Imitation Construction Company has not supplied it for several periods, the market price is uniquely high. The customers on the Shilin cloth distant road have already begun to distinguish, and the market price is as stable as usual. However, bleached cloth and fancy cloth have entered the season when the orders fall, and the momentum is weaker.

### New Fried Green Tea Prices Drop

Taiwan Bud Tea Increases Again, British Government Tenders for Tea

In recent days, a lot of new fried green tea from Yushan, Jiangxi and Wenzhou, Zhejiang has been transported to Shanghai, but the shops on this street, in view of the fact that during the excessive period at the end of June, the stomach for food was very weak, and the supply exceeded the demand. The prices turned sharply downward. Other colors, both selling and buying, the market was firm. However, black tea and bud tea in Taiwan, Yixing and Wuxi continued to be bought, and the handlers raised the price again. As a result, the market price rose by another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per dan compared with the previous day. As for the foreign tea market, Wan Yutai, Hua Tea, Wuchang, Xinhua and other firms in Shanghai shipped red and green tea for export the other day, the number of which was about several thousand boxes. According to the tea merchants, the foreign prices are extremely tight, but in order to expand sales, there is really no profit to be made.

Also, it is reported that the British government recently tendered to purchase a large amount of tea from China and India. It is reported that Chinese import and export firms and tea merchants are enthusiastically mailing tea samples and prices for bidding.

### Export Price of Fur Falls, The Reason Why Bristles Do Not Meet Standards

[This Newspaper Report] After the victory of this war, sea transportation was initially opened, and Chinese exporters did their best to load and transport the export goods that had been accumulated for many years to foreign countries. European and American countries also needed the goods that had not been seen from China for many years, so they absorbed them in groups. The price of the goods was quite high, and exporters made a lot of profits. Later, because similar goods arrived one after another, it was suddenly felt that the supply exceeded the demand, and the price of the goods fell sharply. For example, the price of fur in the American market has fallen by six-tenths, while in mainland China, the price of goods has continued to rise due to the purchase by exporters and the devaluation of the currency, which has formed a strange phenomenon that the price of export goods in the place of origin is higher than the overseas market price. In addition, such as the pig bristles, during the war, the enemy and puppet used them as military supplies, regardless of standards, and purchased them all. This time, they were transported to the United States and were mostly returned because the size did not meet the standards. The loss of exporters is not in the middle. At the same time, because the initial export goods were mostly hoarded by people outside the industry, the quality was uneven, and foreign merchants were greatly disappointed. The export volume plummeted. Recently, Mr. Zhang Guowei, a tycoon in the Shanghai fur industry, decided to go to the United States in person to exchange opinions with manufacturers there on improving fur exports, and to seek the development of export goods. He made the above remarks at a farewell banquet for his colleagues.

### Anglo-American Competition in the Fur Market

[United Press, Sydney, 28th] Mr. Bellina, a representative of London's fur exporters, recently assured Australia here that Britain would purchase all the sheepskin, rabbit skin, and gray squirrel skin that Australia can supply. Mr. Bellina further stated that Britain hopes to obtain Australia's assistance in restoring London as the world's fur center, replacing New York. Currently, the best furs are all shipped to New York because "only Americans have the money to buy them."

### More American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Report] The "H.H. Raymond," managed by Fuli Foreign Firm, arrived from the United States carrying over 8,000 tons of relief wheat. It entered the port the day before yesterday evening and is now docked at the Qichang line in Pudong for unloading.

### Sugar Prices See Both Ups and Downs

[Our Report] Hezhong Sugar Company's fifth batch of sugar for sale plans to deliver one-quarter as spot goods and three-quarters as futures. Under the futures item, three ships will arrive in early July. It is understood that the ships could have arrived in Shanghai earlier, but due to typhoon conditions, the time was delayed. It is now expected that the Hai Zhen and Taipei vessels will arrive first tomorrow (the 1st) and the day after (the 2nd), followed by the Maler vessel somewhat later.

Yesterday, the sugar market trended firm with little fluctuation. The guild's closing price for spot goods was 118,500 yuan for medium-grade white sugar in double bags and 119,500 to 120,000 yuan for single bags. Fifth-batch warehouse receipts were 117,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. Road goods for immediate delivery were silver 100,800 yuan, and customs-paid silver was 110,000 to 112,000 yuan, later 100,900 yuan. Numbered goods opened at 100,400 yuan for fresh extraction, Huanggang green at 100,200 yuan, down 500 yuan, Shantou red cotton at 123,400 yuan, and secondary at 120,000 yuan, with 200 bales transacted. Xinghua white several pieces, 128,000 yuan.

### New Orchid Bamboo Twig Market Opens

The first batch of new orchid bamboo twigs, arriving in limited quantities this time, opened yesterday with several dozen boxes. The higher prices were 352,000 yuan to 315,000 yuan, and the secondary prices were 277,000 yuan. Early red twigs and dark leaf twigs were about 30% less, varying accordingly.

### Shanghai's Patients! Where Do People Go?

...Collective writing by this newspaper's interview room...

Patients Waver on the Crossroads: Take off-the-shelf medicine? Or seek medical treatment?

When you are sick, you need to take medicine, which is undeniable. But what medicine can actually cure the disease, what medicine is the same as taking nothing, and what medicine will not only have no effect but also harm people? There is a need for a great deal of research in this area. For the first type, if the patient takes the right medicine, and indeed the body recovers health, then there is simply nothing to say. But the latter two situations are the most common and the most dangerous. Here are a few common examples for everyone's reference.

(1) We all know that tuberculosis is the most prevalent and most frightening disease in China, but there is still no specific medicine invented. Unfortunately, if you have this disease, you have to pay extra attention to daily life, nutrition, air, sunlight, and rest more. In addition, please ask a doctor to diagnose and treat. Medication and surgery go hand in hand, so that the tuberculosis bacteria in the patient's body are calcified and automatically stop spreading. It takes a long time to treat this rich man's disease, but the so-called special medicine for lung disease sold on the market is actually only a common medicine for treating respiratory diseases. At best, it contains two kinds of antibacterial medicines, Creosol and Guaiacol (commonly known as Guaiacol). But according to the conclusions of modern biological bacteriologists, tuberculosis is wrapped in a waxy shell, and so far no medicine has been invented that can penetrate this shell, so it can be seen that the effect of antibacterial medicines is very limited.

(2) Mentioning the two words "stomach disease" is another headache. It is both painful and stubborn, and there are particularly many patients. Patients should pay attention to the weather, be moderate in diet, do not eat things that are difficult to digest and irritating, eat more fruits and vegetables, and eat less raw fat and carbonated foods. Most of the stomach medicines currently sold on the market are alkaline, containing baking soda and Atropa preparations to neutralize stomach acid with alkalinity. Atropa itself contains a small amount of atropine, so it has the effect of calming malaria and relieving pain. This method of drinking poison to quench thirst can only be effective for a while and has no hope of curing the disease at all. The result of taking it often is that the stomach becomes numb and unable to secrete gastric acid mucus, leading to ulcers. If the patient's stomach secretion is too weak and stomach acid is too little, then the harm of taking it can be imagined.

(3) Under the strict ban on smoking, drugs to quit smoking arise in response to the times, but no one has ever completely quit because of buying and taking this kind of drug. This type of drug mostly contains sleeping pills and narcotics. Taking it can only be used as a substitute, and taking it often can also become an addiction. Therefore, to quit drugs, you must consult a doctor and inject drugs according to the law and reduce the medicine step by step, otherwise the body will become weaker day by day, and old diseases and new diseases will break out together, and it will be impossible to clean them up.

(4) Sand eye disease is also a disease that Chinese people suffer from a lot, and most of them are caused by lack of attention to hygiene and infection. To treat it, you have to have surgery to remove it. The ingredients of the eye medicines sold on the market are nothing more than boric acid and other medicines. The effect can only treat common eye diseases, but it has no effect on sand eye at all. This point should be paid special attention to.

(5) On the advertising billboards, you can often see medicines that specialize in treating children's diseases. In fact, anyone with a little medical knowledge knows that there has never been a medicine that can cure all diseases. This kind of medicine mainly contains podophyllin and calomel, which can only treat constipation and kill roundworms. Both of these are powerful medicines, and taking too much will inevitably cause poisoning. Pharmaceutical merchants don't understand this point, so "only seek no harm, and don't seek merit." The amount of medicine in the medicine is extremely small, but this also loses its effectiveness.

(6) Everyone knows that syphilis and venereal diseases require injections of old-fashioned needle medicines such as "606" and "914". General slippery doctors vigorously publicize that the roots can be eradicated in a few days or weeks. It is really playing tricks on them. Sometimes, those who suffer from this disease are given a few injections by the doctors, and the sores on the skin slowly metabolize, and the doctors say: "Your disease has been eradicated, and you don't have to see it again in the future." You know, the "outside is strong and the inside is empty", and the blood inside is still poisonous. Therefore, sick people must ask legitimate doctors to diagnose and treat them and check the blood at any time until there is no toxin in the blood at all.

(7) Speaking of tonics, they are really too numerous to mention. What pills, essences, pastes, juices, elements, preparations, and life-saving tonics are all decorations for the rich and have more harm than good, but real ones of value are not easy to find. The so-called general medicinal liquid contains vitamins A, B, C, D, etc., but it is a lie. You must know that the nature of vitamins is that A and D are soluble in oil, and B and C are soluble in water. Then it can be seen that those that contain A and D are all oil-based, and those that contain B and C are all water-based. To mix the four types, except for solids, it must be emulsified, and liquids cannot be done.

(8) There are also many medicines, although they are genuine and live up to their reputation, there are often things that "impersonate" and "change their appearance" to confuse the public. Moreover, if there is any change in the quantity, usage, and nature when applied, all the work will be abandoned. For example, take the famous medicine penicillin. This medicine must be kept at a temperature of ten degrees below zero, otherwise it will easily lose its effectiveness. Even if it is a solvent, if it exceeds seven days after production, it will no longer be effective. Some people often want to buy cheap goods and buy them in large quantities, but the result is an empty joy. In addition, like injecting glucose needles, you must inject 40 cc of 50% each time to be effective, and the amount less than 40 cc is of little use. Serum and antitoxin should also be stored between 5 degrees and 15 degrees. Also, the way of cutting corners and reducing materials in DDT is already an open secret. It is better not to use it than to be fooled.

Finally, we do not want people who are sick to not take medicine because they are afraid that the medicine will be ineffective, but it is always better to be cautious. Some people want to save some money and buy some off-the-shelf medicine to eat, but the result is "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice." You must know that "money is a small matter, but life is a big matter." If you are sick, ask a legitimate doctor to treat it, and taking medicine for the disease will not necessarily be more expensive than off-the-shelf medicine, and it will be effective soon.

### Weekly Forum: On the Demarcation of Shanghai from the Perspective of Urban Planning

— Zhao Zukang

Since the Executive Yuan approved the boundary of Shanghai's urban area in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the municipal government only received 17 rural districts in the 17th year. The remaining 13 rural districts were not handed over by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and they were designated as areas where the municipal government would temporarily delay reception. To this day, the case remains unresolved, covering more than ten years. The development of the city and countryside has been greatly affected by this. The villagers in the non-received township hope that the municipal government will take over and build them immediately. Now, at the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the province and the city continue to discuss the demarcation. I would like to take the starting point of urban planning, objectively analyze and compare, and discuss the principles and practical problems of this appropriate and reasonable solution.

The establishment of modern cities can be regarded as the focus of national or political, cultural, economic, and transportation. The prosperity of the city can be reasonably developed, and the country or the world will benefit from it. This is a very clear principle and does not need to be elaborated in detail. Therefore, in the post-war construction of European and American countries, although great importance is attached to the universal construction of rural areas, special attention is paid to the revival and expansion of cities. The United Kingdom has established a Department of Urban and Rural Construction Planning for urban and rural construction; the United States has provided administrative and financial assistance to urban housing, urban streets, etc. from the federal government during and after the war. As for urban planning, whether in the UK or the US, small cities and villages are often combined and planned together in order to obtain a more perfect design object.

Therefore, the principle of provincial and municipal demarcation should first be based on the consideration of the interests of the entire national politics, economy, culture, and transportation as a prerequisite, secondly, the city should be the center, and the adjacent counties and townships should be its assistance, with the goal of co-gang development, and finally, attention should be paid to not harming the future status of the province's politics, economy, culture, and transportation. These three principles are actually the basis that both parties discussing the provincial and municipal demarcation should adopt in common.

The initial work of Shanghai's urban planning is now being actively carried out by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. Urban planning refers to "the entire, long-term, and natural physical development plan of a city." The natural construction of a city is more fixed than social construction, so it must have a long-term and complete plan as its goal, so as to avoid the trouble of cutting the feet to fit the shoes and being too late for regrets. The formulation of Shanghai's urban plan is now aiming at a 50-year plan, and then taking a five-year plan and a ten-year plan as the steps to advance. Therefore, when discussing the current area of Shanghai, it is most reasonable to take a 50-year plan as the object. Now, let's discuss the needs of the four points of "population density," "waterline length," "traffic equipment," and "green area and industrial area":

Shanghai's population was 3.8 million in the 25th year of the Republic of China, and according to the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau's survey in April this year, it is currently 3.39 million, excluding the two districts of Tangwan and Zhoupu. (Among them, affected by the war, there is a clear interruption on the population curve.) According to the statistical records of the past 60 years, the future development is estimated, and referring to the Malthusian population theory, the growth of Shanghai's population doubles every 25 years, and quadruples after 50 years, that is, 12 million people. Even if strictly estimated, it cannot be said to be an exaggeration if Shanghai's plan aims at a population of 10 million in the future. As for the population density, there are now more than 200,000 people per square kilometer (Zhejiang Road area in Huangpu Police District and Ximen area in Taishan Police District). According to the urban plan we have drafted, it will be divided into three levels in the future, calculated as (1) 5,000 people, (2) 7,500 people, and (3) 10,000 people per square kilometer. Excessive population density not only hinders hygiene and helps traffic congestion, but also lowers living conditions and increases the causes of crime. Modern urban construction is trending towards the dispersion of population, and it has to be. According to the above three-level distribution, if the area of Shanghai approved in the 16th year of the Republic of China is more than 890 square kilometers, it can only accommodate 7 million people after 50 years. Calculated with a total of 10 million people, there are still 3 million people who must live outside the urban area, some of whom are Shanghai citizens who come to the city in the morning and scatter to the four villages in the evening, and some of whom are people from satellite cities and towns around Shanghai. From the perspective of population density, if the urban area of Shanghai cannot expand its scope, it should at least be in accordance with the regulations of the 16th year of the Republic of China to meet the actual needs, first.

The prosperity of Shanghai is very dependent on the development of the Yangtze River and Huangpu River water lines. The throughput of Shanghai Port reached the highest record in the 19th year of the Republic of China, with a total tonnage of 38 million tons of imported and exported ships, ranking approximately seventh or eighth among the world's ports, and being the largest port in our country. If we compare Wusong Baoshan to Shanghai's throat, then the Huangpu River is no less than Shanghai's esophagus and stomach. Now, Baoshan City could not be rationally divided and assigned to Shanghai due to the relationship between the county seat in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The upstream of the Huangpu River, such as Caohang, Tangwan, Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Maqiao, Xinzhuang, Qibao, and Minhang, are also among those temporarily delayed. The existing pier waterline in Shanghai is about 12,000 meters. According to the 50-year development plan, the throughput of Shanghai Port can reach approximately 100 million tons per year, and its pier waterline should be about 30,000 meters, which must make full use of both sides of the Huangpu River. From the perspective of waterline length, the area of Shanghai should include Baoshan County into the urban area, and the two banks of the Huangpu River should at least still be in accordance with the settlement of the 16th year of the Republic of China, second.

The rise and fall of a city is greatly related to water, land, and air transportation. The coordination of railway lines and stations in Shanghai's urban area has failed to meet the ideal and hinders the development of various industrial and commercial transportation industries in the city. The urban plan proposed by the former Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works also included suggestions for changing the money and location of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines and stations, which was requested by the former Shanghai Municipal Government to the former Ministry of Railways for consideration. However, due to the limitation of funds and the restriction of the environment, the central and local governments failed to cooperate effectively, and the plan could not be realized, which is a pity. Now that the concessions have been recovered and various transportation technologies have made significant progress, the plan may need to be revised, but it seems that the railway freight terminal should be moved from Maigen Road to West Shanghai, and the railway passenger terminal should be rebuilt or slightly moved outward, all of which are necessary for the gang, which is closely related to the urban area. If Yanghang, Dachang, and Zhenru must still belong to the urban area, it is easier to configure. Other places such as Longhua and Minhang in South Shanghai, Hongqiao, Qibao, and Xinzhuang in West Shanghai, and Zhoupu in Pudong, or where the airport is located, or where the railway passes, or where the highway leads, are all important transportation areas, and should still belong to the Shanghai urban area. From the perspective of traffic equipment, the Shanghai urban area should be in accordance with the original regulations of the 16th year of the Republic of China, third.

In the built-up areas of Shanghai, such as the former Public Concession, the former French Concession, and Hongkou, there are many shops, houses are lined up, and the population density is very high, and parks and open spaces are insufficient. According to our survey and statistics, the existing public area is about 1,000 acres, equivalent to more than 60 hectares. In terms of the built-up area, it is about 6.7/1000 of the area. If the whole city is taken as the unit, it is only 8/10,000 of the area. In the future, the layout of the garden should be in accordance with modern urban design, with more "green belts" and park open spaces, etc., and the rural areas that have not yet been built are most suitable for the use of this ideal layout, that is, the more rural areas join the urban area, the more fully the garden layout can be, and the more it conforms to the ideal of beauty and hygiene. According to the ideal of London's post-war plan, only the park area is calculated to be 4 acres per 1,000 people. If Shanghai's population is 10 million in the next 50 years, the park area should be 40,000 acres, equivalent to 16,000 hectares, which is more than two or three hundred times more than the current situation?

As for the location of Shanghai factories, since being occupied by the enemy and puppet management, there has been a trend of gradually encroaching on residential areas, even in West Shanghai. This poses a great threat to the health of residents. Many of these factories are dyeing and weaving factories or leather factories, and the sewage discharged is particularly harmful to hygiene. It is urgent to determine the zoning method, order them to improve, or even move them back. As for the future of Shanghai's industry, once the port and railway are improved and expanded, it will be booming. The land required for the factory base is also unlimited. The planning of the industrial area is already urgent. From the perspective of "green area" and industrial area, the area of Shanghai should also maintain the regulations stipulated in the old case of the 16th year of the Republic of China, fourth.

In short, if the area of Shanghai is received in accordance with the case of the 16th year of the Republic of China, it will be equivalent to the area of Beijing, which is far less than the major cities in Europe and the United States, such as New York, London, and Chicago. If it is too small, the city will be stretched and unable to expand, and the neighboring counties will also suffer from it. It is necessary to give it a reasonable and appropriate area, at least as the original case of the 16th year of the Republic of China, so that not only can the city have a place to develop, but also the neighboring satellite counties and villages will benefit from it. At present, the advanced countries in Europe and the United States have progressed from urban planning to regional planning and national planning. Their political regions are gradually trying to cooperate with economic regions. Then, the demarcation of Shanghai's area should start from the perspective of the revival and construction of the entire country and nation, and strive to promote the prosperity and development of our country's first port, first city, and its surrounding counties and villages. It is clear. (35.6.28)

### Private Hospitals: A Disguised Form of Hotel

Opening up the telephone book, you will definitely be surprised by the number of hospitals in Shanghai. Large and small, from the quite complete Hongqiao Sanatorium, which covers all departments, to hospitals specializing in the treatment of body odor, there are more than 200 private hospitals alone.

Among these more than 200 hospitals, less than one-third have beds. There is a "hospital" on Tibet Road with only one room. A board wall is sandwiched on the front part along the road, leaving a space of more than a foot wide. A small window is opened on the left, which is the number queuing place, and the door to enter the "hospital" is on the right. The person in charge of registration is the only nurse in this hospital, and the person in charge of this hospital is also the only doctor in this hospital. The doctor's business does not seem to be thriving, but it is still maintained on Tibet Road, where land is as valuable as gold. Most of these "smallest" private hospitals are concentrated on Tibet Road, and some are also on Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road, mainly specializing in the treatment of venereal diseases.

A little larger than these hospitals are hospitals that have equipment and sometimes more than one doctor, but no wards. This kind of "hospital" is actually equivalent to the "clinic" of several doctors. Many dental hospitals seem to be able to be classified into this category.

Opening a Private Hospital Is the Same as Opening a Hotel

However, when people mention private hospitals in Shanghai, they always refer to those luxurious sanatoriums with elegantly decorated gardens as soon as you enter, and two or three patients sitting in rattan chairs on the lawn to recuperate. In terms of the high level of doctors and the relatively thoughtful nursing, these private hospitals are mostly better than general public hospitals. The wards in these hospitals are also more comfortable, so they are more popular with those dignitaries and big-name celebrities. And what those private hospitals welcome are this group of generous patrons. A doctor who has worked in a very famous private sanatorium for four or five years said: "Objectively speaking, hospitals don't make a lot of money in medicine. In other words, opening a private hospital is similar to opening a hotel.

This is an Enterprise, Not "Rescuing People"

He said: Sometimes, these hospitals will also "go bankrupt." When patients come in, they pay a little money, but later, they can't afford it, and the hospital has to recognize the bad luck.

"Then, people who can't pay a sum of money when they enter the hospital have no hope of seeing a doctor at all?" the reporter asked.

He shrugged and said, "Why don't public hospitals have better equipment? Can't they have the help of the Federation?"

He repeated that running a private hospital is an enterprise, at least the "hospital owner" believes so.

Words such as "saving all sentient beings" and "rescuing people" shrank back from my mouth.

The Hospital Is Much Quieter, So It Doesn't Rent Hotel Rooms

He also told me that in the enemy-occupied era, one day a relative of a pseudo-official suddenly came to the hospital and insisted on booking all the wards for the servants of this rich patient to live in. As a result, the hospital cobbled together and gave him ten rooms, and the patients naturally had to move to other hospitals.

Perhaps because he saw that I was a little surprised, he said, "There are a lot of empty rooms in other hospitals! Some people will book long rooms in the hospital. When there are really patients, these rooms can still be vacated - as long as you have enough friendship with the people in the hospital."

The reporter took the opportunity to ask him why those guests who booked long rooms didn't book hotel rooms since they didn't have any illnesses? The doctor smiled mysteriously and said, "Isn't the hospital a little quieter?"

### Concerning Public Hospitals

In today's world where rice is like pearls and firewood like cassia, if you are unfortunately visited by the demon of illness, you will undoubtedly worry about which hospital is best to go to, both to quickly alleviate the pain and to minimize financial losses. From any perspective, public hospitals with a long history and large scale would be more to your liking. However, Shanghai has several public hospitals, so what are the circumstances?

From the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road in the western district to the China Hospital in Tilanqiao in the eastern district, there are the Sino-American Hospital on Baker Road, the Hongren Hospital on Beijing Road, the Renji Hospital on Shandong Road, the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road, as well as the Municipal First, Second, Third, and Fourth Hospitals, and the Gongji Hospital, from whose five-story balcony you can look out over the scenery of the Suzhou Creek... All these hospitals can be divided into three categories according to their nature: those run by charitable organizations, those run by churches, and those run by government agencies. They all bear important social healthcare responsibilities to varying degrees. I truly cannot imagine what fate the citizens of Shanghai would encounter if these hospitals did not exist in Shanghai.

Now, let us make a rough comparison of these hospitals: they all have magnificent buildings, complete equipment, and white-clad nurses shuttling back and forth endlessly. If one must mention some distinctive features, then the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road has the most tranquil environment, the Sino-American Hospital has the most complete equipment, the lawn in front of the Gongji Hospital is the most pleasing, but its prices are considered the most aristocratic.

Currently, the outpatient fees of various hospitals range from around four hundred yuan to one thousand yuan. The Gongji Hospital has a so-called "specialist outpatient clinic" that costs five thousand yuan per visit. The inpatient prices also vary greatly. For example, a special ward at Renji Hospital costs 16,000 yuan per day, and a first-class ward costs 14,000 yuan. A first-class ward at Hongren Hospital costs 24,000 yuan, while Gongji Hospital charges as much as 35,000 yuan. However, most hospitals offer preferential treatment to ordinary people, so the prices of third-class wards are very different from those of first and second-class wards, usually around 2,000 yuan. Even the most aristocratic Gongji Hospital has "beds for the common people," although the daily room rate is still as high as 5,000 yuan.

Almost all public hospitals have many common shortcomings, the most prominent of which are: first, when patients enter the hospital, they must prepay a huge "deposit." The first-class wards require approximately 300,000 to 400,000, while the third-class wards require about 100,000 yuan. Due to the strict enforcement of this regulation, many tragedies have occurred in the past. Often, some poor and critically ill patients are unable to pay this huge fee, and the hospital refuses to admit them, even to the point of watching them die without offering assistance.

Second, the doctors in charge of general outpatient clinics are mostly less experienced, or interns from medical schools just starting out. Their abilities are poor, and because there are so many people seeking treatment, diagnoses are inevitably hasty and careless. If you have a fever, they give you some baking soda; if you have a cough, they give you some quinine pills; if you have a skin disease, they give you some sulfur ointment. Patients come with great hope, wait in crowded waiting rooms for a long time, but in the end only receive prescriptions that they themselves understand, inevitably leading to complaints.

Third, what hospitalized patients need most is the care and comfort of nurses, but many "misses" do not seem to understand the meaning of service and treat patients as bothersome things. Especially in third-class wards, it is common for patients to be left to groan unattended or to be unable to get a cup of plain water.

What has been said above may inevitably be criticized for being overly demanding. In fact, we sincerely hope that all public hospitals in Shanghai can constantly find ways to improve, strive for progress, and extend benefits to the general public, in order to achieve their great goal of benefiting mankind.

### Factions, Factions, Factions! British, American, German, Japanese, and French Medical Circles

On the surface, doctors appear to be a type of freelance professional. But the inside story is that there are many factions, each distinct. The factionalism among the factions is quite profound. According to people in the medical community, the most obvious divisions can be divided into three factions:

British and American Faction

One is the British and American faction: This faction accounts for more than half of the number of doctors in the country. It is said that there are many tributaries under this large artery. In terms of foreign countries, the most prominent are the Harvard and Hopkins factions. Domestically, it is also divided into Xiangya, Shanghai, Qilu, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) factions. This major artery can be said to occupy a leading position in the domestic medical community.

German and Japanese Faction is a Large Vein

Second is the German and Japanese vein: If the British and American faction is currently the main artery of the domestic medical community, then the German and Japanese faction is precisely a major vein. The number of doctors belonging to this large system is also sufficient to compete with the British and American faction. Among the German and Japanese factions, graduates from Hamburg and Tokyo Imperial University are the most famous abroad. Domestically, there are also Tongji, Tongde, and Southeast universities. The factionalism among the schools under this large system is not as profound as that of the British and American faction.

French Faction Weak

Third is the French faction: This faction is weaker. This is largely because the number of doctors from France is not as large as the previous two factions. Aurora University in this city is the representative college of this faction in China.

An example of this might be helpful. Suppose a doctor from the Harvard system of the British and American faction becomes the president of a hospital, he would always find a way to replace all the department directors with Harvard people. To put it more clearly, if a patient consults a doctor from the Harvard system for his initial surgery, it is absolutely impossible to switch to a doctor from the Hopkins system for follow-up care if the illness is not cured. Because the doctor from the Hopkins system, after finding out about your consultation history, will definitely shake his head at you without hesitation and leave with his medical bag. This may seem unbelievable, but similar events are constantly playing out in the medical community today!

Even within the British and American faction, the various small tributaries are clearly distinguished. The gulf between the British and American, German and Japanese, and French factions is so deep that readers can easily imagine it.

### Factionalism Becomes Argumentativeness

In addition to these three major factions, there are also many who practice medicine after apprenticing as pharmacists and nurses. These individuals, after practicing with a doctor for more than three years, can obtain a "Tong" character medical license from the Ministry of Health, or pass a qualification examination.

Some say that the formation of these factions is due to different research systems. The diagnosis and prescription for the same symptoms have certain steps and methods, which cannot be disturbed in the slightest. Others say that factionalism is too deep, inevitably leading to argumentativeness. For the sake of the patients' welfare, we hope that the former is in line with social reality.

### The Anguish of Mothers

Unable to Bear the Huge Delivery Costs, What Decisions Can Be Made Regarding Abandoning Infants?

Walking on the streets of Shanghai, one often sees various hospital signs, especially those of "obstetric hospitals." The Health Bureau is trying to compile statistics, but only a few hospitals have registered. Information about the facilities and fees inside the hospitals is naturally even more difficult to obtain.

A Wide Variety – Sixty or Seventy

According to the reporter's rough estimate: there are no less than sixty or seventy obstetric hospitals of all kinds, large and small, in Shanghai. In addition, most hospitals have an obstetrics department. Each of these many hospitals is different. After the reporter's interviews, all parties feel that Shanghai's obstetric hospitals can be roughly divided into the following four levels:

The So-called Super-Level – Twenty Gold Bars – Named "Super-Level" by the Reporter
Naturally, the environment is extraordinary, the equipment is extraordinary, the doctors are extraordinary, the surgery is extraordinary, and the fees are also extraordinary – twenty large gold bars! You may not believe it, but the reporter can remind you: this is Shanghai after all! Nightclubs that sell a Western meal for 200,000 yuan are still "fully booked" every day, let alone obstetric hospitals? That being said, those who can experience this extraordinary surgery are, after all, a minority of the minority. At the same time, these "super-level" hospitals and "super-level" doctors can live a leisurely and luxurious life by performing extraordinary surgery once or twice a year.

Special-Level Hospitals Charge Exorbitantly

Hospitals belonging to this level are not uncommon in Shanghai, and they already give the general public a rather "aristocratic" impression! Their average delivery fee is 300,000 yuan, and hospitalization fees, medical expenses, etc. are all paid separately. Difficult births are doubled, and of course, registration fees must be prepaid. The hospital is responsible for nursing before and after childbirth to ensure the safety of the mother and child. Most of the doctors inside are more reliable in terms of academic theory and experience, but how can ordinary people afford such huge costs?

Mid-Level Hospitals – Novices Delivering Babies

Speaking of mid-level, these are the most common type of hospitals, with the largest number of people hospitalized for childbirth. The delivery fee is directly proportional to the room level, with first-class wards charging about 20,000 yuan per day and delivery fees at 50,000 yuan. In addition, there are also separate charges for labor room rental, surgery fees, material fees, childcare fees, etc. The total amount will not be a small number. However, it should be noted that most of the deliveries are performed by midwives in the hospital, because according to the regulations of obstetrics schools, they must have at least twenty internship experiences before the summer vacation. The objects of these many student internships are the mothers in the hospital, and at the beginning of the internship, the doctors only provide instructions and supervision from the side. However, there are inevitably some shortcomings in deliveries performed by novices. At this time, you can designate a doctor, as long as you are willing to spend more money (usually double the fee). Therefore, the mothers in the third-class wards who cannot afford to pay become the objects of their internships.

Cheap Solicitation Leads to Skillful Extortion

The "inferior level" that the reporter refers to does not refer to the hospital's equipment. There are many obstetric hospitals in Shanghai that have very impressive facades and many branches, but their content is despicable. They use the lowest delivery fees as a selling point, and use labor-inducing injections, pain-relieving injections, and blood-boosting injections as extortion tactics. This is already an open secret. The most terrible thing is that those so-called obstetricians are there every day as butchers of countless pure little lives! According to a famous obstetrician in Shanghai, performing an abortion for an unmarried woman is a very dangerous thing, but these inferior doctors only recognize money, and they do not care about life at all. They are guilty, but this evil society tolerates them committing crimes, allowing them to continue killing people every day!

Serving the People and Benefiting Mothers

Finally, the reporter wants to introduce an obstetrics hospital that truly serves the common people – Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at 995 Kang Nao Road. The hospital was founded in the 28th year of the Republic of China and is now largely financially responsible by Dr. Wang Yi Jun. The hospital is located in a commoners and factory district, and the diagnosis and treatment is especially eager. Most of the doctors in the hospital are devout Christians. They serve the people in the spirit of Jesus' sacrifice. Those who are truly poor can request a full waiver of fees. Recently, many mothers introduced by the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA)" have come to the hospital. In addition to waiving all fees, they also provide meals. Each mother eats eight ounces of noodles per meal, and the flour is allocated by the CRRRA. In addition, there are also milk powder and medicines. When poor and sick mothers are discharged from the hospital, the hospital also provides some milk powder.

The Problem of Abandoned Babies is the Most Troublesome

What they currently feel most powerless to do is to accommodate infants, because there are many impoverished mothers who cannot afford to raise their children. They often heartlessly abandon their own flesh and blood. At this time, the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital has no choice but to take them in for delivery and nursing, but because childcare facilities are still lacking, they can only give them futile sympathy. Dr. Wu Rongying, who has served in the hospital for more than five years, told the reporter: "I really don't understand, since God loves everyone, why does he allow such a disparity between the rich and the poor? Wealthy people love to be comfortable and can leave their children to nannies, but poor women, who are also mothers, have to grit their teeth and heartlessly abandon their own sons!"

### Social Services – Answering Readers' Questions

Legal Questions

(1) Zhao Lanfen asks: Editor, I am a 24-year-old woman who has not received education since childhood. At the age of 18, I married a man surnamed Yan from the same village, who is a chauffeur, on the orders of my parents. He became unemployed just two months after the marriage. Because of the pressure of life, I had to work as a maid. My husband is a vagrant by nature, gluttonous, and lazy. Sometimes when he has some money, he always squanders it outside, and sometimes he doesn't come home for several months. He doesn't want to pay for his parents and all the expenses at home. When I argue with him, he swears and beats me. I have no choice but to endure and go home, hoping that he will realize his mistakes. Now I have several doubts, please help me find a solution: 1. Is the husband's failure to provide for his wife a reason for divorce? 2. The husband is now cohabiting with a prostitute, who is willing to use the money she earns from prostitution to support him and live together as a couple. Can I catch them in the act of adultery? 3. Does a divorce require the consent of both parties, or can a divorce be filed unilaterally?

[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuangling] (1) If it is malicious abandonment that is still ongoing, it can be a reason for requesting a divorce; (2) Yes; (3) If one of the spouses has any of the circumstances listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code, the other party may request a divorce from the court.

(2) Lu Zhongli asks: (A) A man and (B) A woman have been married for seven years and have no children. (B) The woman also has mental illness and cannot manage the household. Now (C) A woman is introduced by relatives to marry (A). (B) Also agrees, and the parents of (A), (B), and (C) all agree. If (A) marries (C), (B) may appeal to (A) for bigamy. I don't know if it will be legally effective. If (A) sues (B) for divorce because she has a neurological problem and cannot have children, I don't know if it will be legally effective?

[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuangling] Man A may not marry woman C until after divorcing woman B. As for the inability to have children, it is not sufficient to constitute a reason for divorce. However, if woman B has a serious and incurable mental illness, man A may request the court to divorce her.

(3) Liu Junmin asks: There is someone named A, who was introduced by a friend a few years ago to meet a woman named B. However, they did not go through the marriage procedures. Only one day they invited relatives and friends to a banquet and announced that they were married to woman B. Now, due to disagreements, they intend to break off the relationship. Please ask (1) Is this kind of marriage legal? (2) If you want to divorce, do you need to hire a lawyer to go through legal procedures?

[Answer from lawyer Fu Kuangling] (1) If there was a public ceremony at the time and two or more witnesses, it can be considered a legal marriage. (2) If the divorce is by mutual consent, it should be done in writing and should have the signatures of two or more witnesses. These witnesses are not limited to lawyers.

### Lies

— Shao Fu

There was such a news item in the evening paper:

A certain day, a certain meeting. In addition to reporters from various newspapers, the guests included... and many foreign guests. Elegant and luxurious, some wore silk stockings. The meeting was chaired by Ms. ×××, Ms. ××× gave a speech, and then Ms. ××× gave a speech, saying that in the face of high cost of living and widespread disasters, our women should take the lead in advocating frugality...

"Elegant and luxurious, some wore silk stockings," "in the face of high cost of living and widespread disasters, our women should take the lead in advocating frugality"... It feels rather incongruous to read.

Looking at the following text, I thought there would definitely be "those wearing silk stockings took them off," or "those who were elegant and luxurious looked ashamed," but I don't know if the reporter was being euphemistic, there was no description of this.

I once heard a story: A labor activist was sitting on a rickshaw, stomping his feet and scolding the rickshaw puller, saying: You are pulling so slowly, delaying my business. Do you know that I am going to attend a workers' congress?

Unity of knowledge and action, practicing what you preach, otherwise, it's all lies.

### Summer on the Banks of the Jialing River

— Shi Bei

The sound of cicadas is like the flowing water in a stream, small and slender, penetrating into the heart through the eardrum, unintentionally with a sliver of coolness flowing through the whole body.

Seeing the French parasol trees on the streets of Shanghai, green and crystalline, tender and dripping, I want to linger for a moment; but the lightning-like cars and the crowd of pedestrians make it impossible for me to stop. At such times, I think of last year's summer on the banks of the Jialing River.

There are no typhoons blown in from overseas on the banks of the Jialing River, making it almost impossible for people to open their eyes. The wind in summer there is like flying catkins scattered from the sky in the basin, turning over the mountain gorges, skimming across the river surface, and then leisurely coming to you, with the rich aroma of soil, beckoning you to return to the embrace of nature. At this time, you are truly open-minded—without a trace of worries, without a trace of the troubles of urban materialism, carefree to receive the coolness of the wind and the clarity of summer.

Right there on the long embankment lined with French parasol trees, you lie on a Sichuan-style bamboo chair, sitting alone, and no one else comes to disturb you. From the gaps between some low river trees, you watch the boats in the river. They, like you, only let the forces of nature govern them, slowly letting the wind send them away; some large black civilian boats, with dozens of naked-shouldered trackers, crawling down, pulling long cables. In this way, you can appreciate Du Fu's famous line "Late sun, slowly watching the brocade cables pulled," and you will also admire their perseverance in making a living.

There are no ice pops that chill the tongue, but there is Tuo tea in the teahouse, or sweet tea from North Hot Spring. You can ask the "little total" to bring you a cup; the clear fragrance mixed with a faint sweetness, this is the famous product of Sichuan. Sipping slowly, you feel that it is much more wonderful than the stimulating taste of ice cream. You can never find an ideal coffee shop in the city, but when you see this simple teahouse on the riverbank, with two or three "Sichuan kids" busy with hospitality, even if you sit far away from the teahouse, you don't need to call out, they will naturally come diligently to fill your cup from time to time; you enjoy the blessing of tasting tea, but you don't feel the air of sitting in a teahouse. Such a mood and place, I always think, is the most ideal coffee shop.

The Jialing River never has the surging waves of the Huangpu River, nor is it filled with warships and foreign ships. The river transport that the people of Sichuan call "foreign boats" in the river are just small-sized passenger ships on the inner waterways of the Minsheng Company. They fly small flags, coming from downstream and falling to upstream, like a comb, freely coming and going in the heart of the river.

The long sound of cicadas can float from across the river. You chant a tune and can harmonize with this cicada song. How can you hear the sound of cicadas in the city? The sound of cicadas is like the flowing water in a stream, small and woven long, penetrating into the heart through the eardrum, unintentionally with a sliver of coolness flowing through the whole body.

After half a day, when you see the shadow of the parasol trees stretching out slender, and two or three returning crows have also flashed in the river, you can slowly return to the small house by the river.

In summer, the climate in Sichuan often rains at night. Pushing open the small window, listening to the sound of rain rustling in front of the window, embracing the thin quilt, you seem to hear someone whispering Li Shangyin's famous lines:

"You ask when I will return, there is no date set,"

"Bashan night rain swells the autumn pond;

When will we trim the western window candle together,

And talk again of the Bashan night rain."

Good, now I am living in Shanghai and reminiscing about "Bashan." I think those who sigh in Chongqing about the "difficulty of traveling" can also linger for a while longer.

### A Record of Chiang Ching-kuo

— Han Tianrong

The scorching sun hangs high in the sky, sweat pouring like a waterfall. Looking toward the Northeast, turning back to Gan Nan, the same oppressive heat pervades. Lowering my head in contemplation, the image of the young statesman Chiang Ching-kuo appears before my eyes.

During the war, New Gan Nan was a paradise in the Southeast rear, and many wandering youths had thrown themselves into its embrace; many foreign friends were also willing to spend their foreign lives there. Three years ago, I first came to Gan Nan, and by chance, spent more than two months of summer life with Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, learning a lot of rich knowledge.

I don't emphasize or exaggerate. As he himself said, Chiang Ching-kuo is an ordinary person. A sturdy body, neither tall nor short, often wearing a black leather hat of a New Gan Nan public servant, dressed in a uniform of safe and stable blue, a smile on his face, either riding a bicycle or slowly wandering the streets of Ganzhou.

He has no bureaucratic airs, let alone the temper of a young master. He loves Ganzhou and likes to be close to the common people. At the entrance of the New Gan Nan Road Commissioner's Office, there are no stern, armed soldiers like in ordinary government offices, but instead two young unarmed Boy Scouts? The bulletin of the Commissioner's Office does not contain the phrases "etc. by order..." in official documents, but instead popular and sincere public language. This approach is intended to make the general public thoroughly understand government orders and get close to the government, which will certainly have a great effect. At the same time, in order to avoid being deceived, it is stipulated that the public will be received at the Commissioner's Office every Wednesday. At that time, on the roads of New Gan Nan, an endless stream of people, supporting the old and carrying the young, were marching toward the entrance of the Commissioner's Office. They were full of hope that the wise officials would be able to solve their difficulties and redress their grievances. According to several examples I have asked about in the past, Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo has indeed never given them empty promises.

Ganzhou is a gathering place for young people, and you can see countless students rushing to various schools. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo loves young people, so Ganzhou has become the base camp for wandering young people. There, not only can they solve their daily lives, but also get great help in terms of schooling and employment. The hearts of wanderers are soothed with kindness, and they will not feel much desolation in a foreign land. Life School, Hugang, and the Jiangxi Branch of the Youth Corps are all residences for wandering young people. I also once lived in the university dormitory established by Mr. Chiang, and personally enjoyed the preferential treatment he gave to wanderers, "Chiang Ching-kuo is my brother, and therefore your brother." Young people who have been to Ganzhou all have the same feelings as Mr. Chiang Wei-kuo.

The historical facts of past hardships and struggles have forged Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo into a resolute, pragmatic, unafraid of violence, and persevering person. When he was in Russia, because he had no support and no place to live, he lived by sleeping in the trash. This difficult situation did not weaken him, on the contrary, it made him realize the bitterness of the world and laid the foundation for his future basic political concepts. He worked while studying, and in addition to his normal official duties, he also read books for two or three hours every day. According to the person closest to him, he told me: "His work has never been interrupted for a day." From this, we can see Mr. Chiang's perseverance.

News Snippets

### Famous Courtesan Dies; Pimps Send Her Off

Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has fluctuated again, and the black market is rampant. Rice shops claim that there is no rice supply, but if you ask someone you know well, you can buy it for 66,000 yuan per dan. Our view on this matter: it can be said that "wildfires cannot burn them out; the spring breeze blows and they are born again."

A famous courtesan in Zhangshu Back Street, Jiangxi, died of illness. On the day of her funeral, the funeral procession passed through the streets, and thirty or forty people attended the funeral, most of whom were pimps. A few words can give a glimpse of the prosperous scene of the famous courtesan's life, with a constant stream of people and carriages at her door.

In front of the Chenghuang Temple in Suixi County, Guangdong, there is a couplet written by the former Qing scholar Chen Qiaosen:

"The yamen runners there are not ghosts,
The yamen here does not want money."

Today, when we read it, it seems necessary to add a "?" to each line, saying "The yamen runners there are not ghosts? The yamen here does not want money?" It is easy to see the King of Hell, but difficult to deal with the little devils.

On the streets of Guiyang, rickshaw pullers and horse-drawn carriages are racing side by side. We express our twelve-point sympathy for the ancient and simple mountain people, but when we think about how far apart the distance between "man and beast" is, we can't help but feel inexplicably sad!

"Thousands of rickshaw pullers in Changsha City, because of sluggish business, mobilized to destroy all the buses running on the streets. The military police opened fire to suppress them, killing and wounding more than a dozen people." This is another tragedy related to rickshaw pullers, and it is also a contradictory phenomenon in the current society. Ancient China needs mechanical industry to revive and build, but the ancient people need to maintain the continuation of life under high living pressure with cheap labor. Therefore, we only consider this unfortunate event to be the sorrow of the laggards!

The puppet mayor of Tianjin, Wen Shizhen, was sentenced to death by the Hebei High Court on the 24th. Judge Sun's accent was too heavy, and Wen mistakenly heard it as four or ten years in court. When he walked out of the courtroom, his face was ruddy and his attitude was calm. He asked the bailiff, "Is it four years? Is it ten years?" He was quite proud at the time. The bailiff told him that it was a death sentence, and he bowed his head in silence. Wen can be said to have been smart all his life, but confused for a moment. How could he not know that he who commits many evil deeds will bring about his own destruction?

### Reminiscences of Jiulongpo

— Chen Xunjie

The Site of Jiaotong University in Chongqing

As a person like me who likes tranquility, returning to this noisy and bustling big city cannot help but make me often recall the tranquility, beauty, and loveliness of Jiulongpo!

Jiulongpo is more than ten kilometers away from Chongqing, on the west side of the city, and can be reached directly by the Liangjiu Highway. If you start from Lianglukou, and if the car does not break down halfway, in about an hour, you will pass through the winding mountain roads, through several twists and turns, uphill and downhill, and slowly see the clear white water of the Yangtze River. When the car reaches the last stop, this is Jiulongpo. Jiulongpo is on the riverside. Here, you can stay on the beach and watch the rolling eastward flow of the river, the various ships coming and going, look at the factory in Lijiatuo across the river, and look far at the birds circling in the sky...

This is the only way from Chongqing City to Haitangxi and Guiyang. Jiulongpo Riverside is a ferry crossing. From early morning to night, there are dozens of jeeps, cars, and heavy trucks crossing the river every day.

In fact, the name Jiulongpo is probably due to a nearby small town called Jiulongpu. Near this ferry crossing, there is a mountain slope with a large upward and downward slope, and this small station on the slope is named Jiulongpo. Speaking of Jiulongpu, there are twenty or thirty shops, restaurants, noodle shops, tea houses, and other grocery stores, dirty streets, and dilapidated low houses. In the morning, this is a small open space, and after the rain, the mud pit is even more filthy!

After passing Yangjiaping on the highway bus, you can soon slowly see a small town from the car window. In a turn, the entire face of the small town is in front of you. There are only a few shops on the roadside, but the air here is more lively than Yangjiaping. This town is called Huangtongping. One stop past here is Jiulongpo. In other words, this is the last two stops of the Liangjiu Highway. Across the road from the town, is the school building of the National Jiaotong University during the Anti-Japanese War!

(If you already know very well, then you know that if you get off at Huangjueping, you can walk to the school in a few steps. Otherwise, you will definitely take it all the way to Jiulongpo, and then walk back a section of the road to get to the school. Correctly speaking, Jiaotong University is in Huangjueping, but perhaps because the reputation of Jiulongpo is greater than that of Huangjueping, as long as you talk about Jiulongpo, you also know that it is the location of Jiaotong University.)

Originally, this was a desolate place, but since Jiaotong University moved here, this small town has also risen with it. There are restaurants, noodle shops, tea rooms, candy stores, and cigarette shops. They are all doing business for the students. Here, almost all of them are Jiaotong University students. This is Jiaotong University's small world.

The whole of Jiulongpo does not have as many people as the Shapingba school district, so it is not as lively. This place is shrouded in the atmosphere of the countryside. Tranquility, elegance, beauty, and leisure are good places to study with peace of mind, and good places to concentrate on research.

The highway passes in front of the school gate. After crossing a small mountain depression, passers-by can see the neat houses. The first thing that catches the eye is probably Huangjueping, the factory building across the street; a few steps further, is Jiaotong University, probably also the most beautiful auditorium in the entire Jiulongpo. It stands tall on the roadside, showing the heroic posture of Jiaotong University standing still during the Anti-Japanese War. It shows the entire spirit of Jiaotong University. Inside is the Wenzhi Hall, which commemorates Mr. Tang Wenzhi and can accommodate nearly a thousand people. Commemorative weeks, celebrity lectures, plays, and movies are all held here. At the same time, this is also the heart of Jiaotong University, the location of all administrative offices.

Next to the auditorium, rows of bungalows are the classrooms for the students. Behind the auditorium, rows and rows are the dormitories for the students. Further back, on the small earthen mountain, are the residences of the professors and the dormitories for the female students. Overall, the houses are very simple, but they are neatly arranged in rows and columns, and in the morning light and sunset, they especially show the beauty of the bungalows. This place once hid a part of the essence of China, and this place was once where more than 1,500 young students studied.

The jagged mountain peaks are layered one after another from far to near. On clear days, you can see the rolling eastward flow of the river, contrasting with the earthy color of the uneven foothills. Water, mountains, flowers, trees, birds, the azure sky, and floating dark clouds. A gentle breeze blows from the fields, and you will doubt that you are no longer in the world.

By evening, this place becomes even more lovely. Dotted lights, in this long dark night, extend its infinite light, representing the light near Jiulongpo!

In the sunset, students gather in groups of three or five, chatting and laughing, strolling on the road. Walking out of the school gate to the right, you can go to Jiulongpo, and to the left, you can go to Yangjiaping. The breeze blowing from the valley brings the free and comfortable atmosphere of the fields, and also sends away the students' exhaustion all day long!

On a moonlit night, after finishing homework, you walk out of the dormitory with two or three close friends, wandering under the moonlight. Remembering the mountains and rivers of the motherland and the long-separated homeland, a piece of moonlight mountain scenery, a gentle sigh, will vibrate the entire space. If you are interested, drink together under the moon, talk to each other, and lie on the grass until late at night.

Jiulongpo must not be as lively as it used to be, but the mountain scenery under the moon must still be the same. In this noisy city, I often recall Jiulongpo, recall the life during the years of the Anti-Japanese War, and think of the beautiful Jiulongpo, and at the same time, I also think of the entire beautiful China. Quiet Jiulongpo, although I have left in a big city thousands of miles away, I recall it, I love its tranquility, a tranquility that is not easily obtained in the world!

### The Abandoned Colonel

— Chuan Qiu

Before the United Nations launched the invasion of Europe, the US military was constantly pouring into the British Isles, setting up camps everywhere. An American colonel was ordered to inspect the barracks that were under construction in various places. His driver was a member of the beautiful British Women's Auxiliary Corps Motor Transport Corps. Wherever they went, the houses were under construction, and none were completed. Every time this driver arrived, she carefully looked for women's toilets, but she was always disappointed. As she drove along, her unpleasant mood gradually increased. Finally, she could not bear it any longer. When they were returning to headquarters, she stopped the car on the side of the road, stammered "I'm sorry," got out of the car, walked hundreds of steps quickly, and hid in the woods. A few minutes later, she reappeared, looking straight at the ground, lowered her head shyly, got into the car, started the engine, and drove straight away without saying a word. When she drove fifty miles to the headquarters parking lot, she turned her head and found that the army colonel was not in the car. Three words and two sentences collection

### The Sound of Gongs and Drums Next Door Prevents Sleep All Night

— Wuling Ren

Mr. Zhu, the sales director of the Yue Dong Cigarette Factory, was threatened this month on the 17th by someone who claimed to be "reporting a traitor" and extorted twenty gold bars. He negotiated in various places such as the Royal Cafe, Da Sanyuan Tea Room, and Meihua Restaurant. Finally, it was reduced to eight. Zhu secretly reported it to the police. On the 24th, he pretended to make a payment at the Fuchunlou Restaurant and seized the four criminals. I admire Mr. Zhu's patience and perseverance. He put it off for a week before reporting it to the police station, and the case was solved immediately, reducing a lot of investigation procedures for the police.

More than ninety theaters requested a reduction in donations, but did not achieve their goal, and prepared to collectively suspend operations automatically from July 1st. I am quite worried about the employees of the theaters in the city. If they stop operating, will there be problems with their lives? But when I think of the sound of gongs and drums next door at night, which often prevents me from falling asleep, I feel that it is good to have a few quiet nights.

It is said that white japonica rice is becoming scarce in the market, and rice merchants mostly use brown rice to supply the market. This is to promote eating brown rice. It not only meets the purpose of thrift, but also improves health, and should be commended.

The health authorities are working hard without slacking off, but the epidemic is rampant and getting worse every day. The number of cold food stalls on the street has not decreased, and DDT seems to be not very "popular" anymore.

Xu Weizhen, the president of the puppet High Court, was very unhappy with the sentence of ten years in prison, and repeatedly said that he did not accept it. Xu was quite famous in the judicial circles in the past, and he was also well versed in the law. If he were a judge today, how should he judge a criminal like him who colludes with enemy countries? I am afraid that only he himself knows the answer!

In view of the serious housing shortage, a certain company specially commissioned a bank to design and build real three-story city houses and fake three-story garden houses for sale in Pudong. Is this really reducing the serious housing shortage? There are plenty of houses in Shanghai, but I only regret that I don't have the connections, so it is better to say that there is a "lack of alchemy" than to say that there is a serious housing shortage.

### Shanghai Gestures

— Chuan Hong

Miss Mei Ou recently returned to China from the Far East, and told the following story, and swore not to lie. When he arrived in Shanghai one night, it was late, and he stayed in a hotel. The Chinese servant knocked on the door and came in, speaking his most wonderful Pidgin English, and asked, "Want a dog?" Mei Ou asked back, "What?" The servant replied, "Dog." At the same time, he made many gestures to explain what a "dog" was. Because this pantomime was so perfect, Mei Ou finally understood. But what he urgently needed was only a bathroom and a bed, so he pointed to his gray hair and old glasses, indicating that the old man did not have such interest. But his pantomime was not as good as the servant's. Half an hour later, the servant returned to the room, followed by an old woman with chicken skin and crane hair, wearing glasses on her nose.

### The Wealthy and Noble of the Qianlong and Jiaqing Eras

— Cao Zuohan

In the recent domestic news in the newspapers, in addition to the issue of the war between the Kuomintang and the Communists, the issue of the treatment of public education personnel also seems to be raging. The proposal of the Legislative Yuan, based on the price index, which is only one-tenth of the pre-war ratio, has not yet been passed. The number of adjustments now decided is that the monthly salary income is still enough to buy half a dan of rice. In the past, Tao Yuanming was unwilling to bend his waist for five dou of rice, then today's officials seem to be better than in the past.

In fact, the poor treatment of officials has not started today. In the Outer Chronicle of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, there are a few sentences that say:

"Today's Chinese government is accustomed to demanding and extorting. The small salary of officials makes people gasp in surprise... Then how do officials live? They only extort bribes for a living."

Just how small was the salary at that time that it could make people gasp in surprise? Its smallness can be known. But there are still people running around to seek it, because being an official is another way to make money. I remember that before the Anti-Japanese War, a certain Mr. Wang from Tianjin came to govern my county. From the moment he got off the car, all his subordinates, from the secretary section chief to the doorman and tea servant, were replaced. The people of the county who were good at visiting privately nicknamed him "Wang Yituan," because the number of people he brought was enough to form a regiment. Why did he do this? It is said that those who came here were all "carrying strong men," and their nature was the same as running a business in partnership. Since they received a good deal, all the shareholders, big and small, had to share a cup of it. In the 1861 article "The Corruption of the Chinese Government" in "China's Friend," it is stated:

"The government says: Come! Zhang San Li Si, pass the imperial examination, offer your money, and I will give you an official title. The scholars and imperial scholars, once they become officials, will exploit and accumulate wealth; when they have a lot of money, they will seek promotion; when they are promoted, they will exploit again. Officials, regardless of their size, all use this as a way to live. Below the governor-general is the governor, whose salary is about fifty pounds, and whose annual income is about four thousand three hundred and thirty-two pounds. The governors and governors all have the power of life and death..."

This is really a good deal, but unfortunately, how much of the people's hard-earned money was wasted and squandered because of this! No wonder there is a folk song of "three years of Qingzhi Prefecture, one hundred thousand taels of silver"; as a result, what is manifested in the private lives of corrupt officials is obscenity and shamelessness, and extravagant and excessive enjoyment. There is a passage in the General History of the Qing Dynasty that writes truthfully:

"At that time, food, clothing, vehicles, and playthings were all competing for novelty and ingenuity, and their extravagance was beyond what emperors could achieve... When a certain river governor entertained guests, a basket of pork had to kill more than fifty pigs, taking only a piece of the back meat, and the rest was discarded. To eat camel hump, three or four camels were needed for one table, and goose paws and monkey brains were also taken from the essence. Even a plate of tofu had dozens of ways to make it... Because the food was so complicated, a banquet often lasted for three days and nights."

If the governance of officials is not clarified, the country will be poor and the people weak, the national treasury will be empty, and the people will be unable to live. Only corrupt officials and treacherous merchants are the winners who get what they want. When Heshen's crimes were revealed and his property was confiscated, his own property exceeded the total income of the national treasury for ten years. How much did the country and the people have to be exploited and squeezed by him?

The above situation is from the time of Qianlong and Jiaqing. The reason for the Hong Yang Rebellion has ethnic and other factors, but the issue of people's livelihood caused by corruption is also a major cause.

Of course, this time is different from Qianlong and Jiaqing, but the number of bandits is still greater than at the end of the Ming Dynasty. It is hoped that we will not be driven into the jungle to be beaten, or driven into the deep to be fished. Clarifying the governance of officials and improving treatment are both urgent and cannot be delayed.

Movies and Drama

### The Experiential School of Acting

— Ye Zi

We can see the acting methods of this school in the style of Stanislavski's "Moscow Art Theatre." This theater centers on performance, viewing actors as the fundamental and primary medium of theatrical art. The theater is owned, enjoyed, and governed by actors, but its main belief is not focused on individual creative expression, but rather on collective expression as a prerequisite.

Stanislavski founded this theater with the aim of using "truth" to transcend the artificial "external" performances that were gradually growing in the theater at the time. He said that exaggerated styles and artificially designed expressions of emotion were gorgeous and pretentious. In his theater, each actor must put themselves in the position of the protagonist, empathically imitate the character, and experience inner emotions individually. The director merely helps them to inspire. Therefore, they call their theater a "theater of inner emotional drama." The foundation of this theater's style is to achieve beauty through simplicity and refinement, placing realistic scenery around the actors, and imitating the character's emotions truthfully and accurately. His ideal, he said, was to "drive fake theater out of the theater."

For this reason, the performances at the Moscow Art Theatre are more diligent than those at other theaters. They prefer to be serious and do not like to spend effort on bright decorations and pleasing costumes. They established an inner theory of performance, in which actors experience the character when performing, abandon their own will, and live the life of the character they play. Everything is done naturally, not only expressing the external appearance of the character's life, but more importantly, creating the inner life of the character being performed on stage, what Stanislavski called "emotional intuition," to contain an inner, extremely profound meaning in the external form. The inner life of this character is created through the actor's inner experience process, living the individual's feelings into the character's life, injecting the soul into the characteristic parts of the character, becoming a symbol of personal life, and selecting naturalistic details that can emphasize and digest various psychological opportunities, giving psychological elements to everything. For this reason, actors need more acute senses and more experience than in real life. And every time an actor performs, they must experience it once.

When an actor is completely gripped by the script they are acting in, most of the work is subconscious, relying on the natural power of the human organism. If the organism is stupid, a method must be used to stimulate it and drive it. This is the method of technical psychology, which enables actors to awaken creative awareness within themselves. For the entire psychological preparation for creation, actors must develop stage control and creative concentration within themselves, a solitary mental state completely isolated from ordinary interests, and any mental preparation is indispensable before starting creation. This is produced by the actor's long-term cultivation and enthusiastic psychological training. The task of this method is to use consciousness to indirectly awaken the subconscious to create, that is, to reveal the realism of the actor's inner life along all the natural rules of the human organism to stimulate the subconscious, so as to burst forth inspiration. Therefore, conscious and correct creation is the best foundation for the subconscious and inspiration to create. Stanislavski said in "My Art Life": "This does not mean that I want to create inspiration by artificial methods, which is impossible. What I require is: how to create a good quality that can express inspiration through will. If that quality exists, inspiration will easily pass through the actor's soul."

"Conscious technical psychology" is to develop this ability of creative awareness and to explain the inner essence of creation. Correct creative awareness results from a correct stage belief in the created material that has a sense of reality. Just like the purity of a child, Stanislavski said that "correct artistic truth" can eliminate artificiality in performance and produce the miracle of image life." Creation is guided from the actor's imagination and fantasy. When this assumed imagination appears, the actor can produce a greater fascination than real life and believe in it from the bottom of their heart. This will produce real stage actions. If the "consistent direction" and "core of the character" of the script are discovered, then the stage image will emerge accordingly. What should be noted here is that they are all proceeding towards a fundamental and supreme goal, and the character is a decomposition of this topic. The actor must connect the actions and converge towards this supreme goal, expressing the author's latent meaning and thoughts. They are like this, focusing on studying people's inner experiences and emotions.

Only this kind of performing art can completely grip the audience, so that the audience not only understands but also experiences everything that happens on the stage, enriching the audience's inner experience and leaving a trace that cannot be erased by time.

### Fourth General Review of Shanghai Drama

— Guan Yu

Ten. "Teacher for All Generations"

"Teacher for All Generations" was the first performance of the China Electric Troupe after arriving in Shanghai. They truly introduced the level of drama in the Great Rear Area to the audience in Shanghai. Before this performance, many troop troupes used the banner of inland drama actors to give multiple public performances in Shanghai, which caused the audience to doubt the acting level of inland drama actors and made them even more disappointed with inland directors. Only after the performance of "Teacher for All Generations" by the China Electric Troupe did they truly recognize the highest level of inland drama actors. In particular, they were very satisfied with the director's handling.

Although the playwright and director of "Teacher for All Generations" have two different names, we know that they were originally one and two, two and one, a playwright. When he directed the play, his attitude was very serious, and he also had the power to control the acting line and level of the actors. Therefore, the plays he directed were quite complete and tidy. This has been generally recognized by all sectors during the performance.

"Teacher for All Generations" describes how a university professor arduously holds on to his post, teaches a group of young refugee students, and leads this group of students to walk to Yunnan to relocate the school. For a full twenty-five years, he never left his post. When he was so poor that he could no longer live, someone advised him to first lay a little economic foundation, but he did not do so. He just held on to his post diligently. He dedicated his life to this great cause, not caring about the rewards of the present and the future, but only feeling that "it is a pleasure to share one's knowledge with others" was enough.

In this performance, we cannot find a trace of the star system, nor any performance of a genius actor making personal development! In this play, we truly saw the collective creation of the actors. Therefore, we were able to appreciate a serious and complete work of art.

In another play he wrote and directed, "Mountain City Story," we cannot see such a complete collective creation. We know that the pioneers of drama have told us to put every actor on the stage in the position of the protagonist to imitate real people, and to use the success of the entire performance to replace the star system of one or two genius actors.

Therefore, the success of a play's performance is not the success of a certain actor, but the success of every actor, that is, the success of the whole.

The success of "Teacher for All Generations" is not the success of a certain actor, but the success of all the workers.

Eleven. "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours"

This is also a play performed by the China Electric Troupe. In this play, we cannot find any of the excellent traces in the performance of "Teacher for All Generations." All that is the same is the name of the performing troupe. Other than that, there is no more breath of China Electric's performance.

The phenomenon shown in this play is exactly the star system we want to overthrow. It is undeniable that here we can fully see the deformed development of genius actors. They can disregard the character's personality and real life and use formal techniques to perform their roles. At the same time, their attitude towards art does not seem serious, because some things cause them to laugh in memory, so the stage and the audience are integrated, and everyone laughs. This, at least in this kind of performance, is problematic. However, it cannot be completely denied that they are more serious in other performances, but they have not faithfully implemented the observation and imitation of the character's personality.

The playwright added a lot of interesting gimmicks in "Chongqing Twenty-Four Hours," which are only familiar to the people of Chongqing; for example, the electric lights dimming until they go out, and then slowly turning red and white and lighting up. There is no one in Chongqing who has not personally experienced these things. It is just as common as the people of Shanghai queuing up early to wait for the National Rolling Household Rice and being starved by the enemy's blockade. Because the playwright wrote it this way, it has a bit of local color, and with local color, it is also limited by locality.

However, this play is written very compactly. The playwright unified the time, place, and action, so that the things to be done are completed in the same place within twenty-four hours. This is what we call the "three unities."

I have seen the performance of this play in different places five or six times, but their business performance always does not exceed the height of Chongqing.

### A scene from "Xuan Palace Beautiful Dream"

### Mr. Chen Guofu, a member of the Central Committee, is enthusiastic about the film industry. He recently came to Shanghai and went to the Second Factory of the Central Film Studio to take a photo in a scene of the new film "Distant Love," which is being filmed at the factory.

### Stage Technology Talk

(6) Color Harmony

Color harmony is entirely a matter of feeling caused by color contrast. Some colors feel harmonious to the human eye, while some combinations feel dazzling and uncomfortable. Common harmonious colors include: yellow and blue, red and blue, red and gray, blue and orange, blue and black, black and white, orange and green, black and yellow, white and purple, cyan and red, yellow and red, purple and orange, orange and brown, white and blue, red and white, brown and white, etc. In the combination, it is also necessary to pay attention to adding white or diluting with water to make bright tones (Tint), adding black to make dark tones (Shade), and adding both white and black to make broken tones (Broken Tone). This can make the scope of color harmony wider and obtain the pleasant beauty of life under various qualities, education, customs, and human relationships.

Xiang Fulu Ershang divides color harmony into two major categories. The first category is similar harmony (Harmonies of analogy), which is further divided into three types: the harmony of color steps, which is the matching of various luminances arranged in the order of equal difference of the color value (Value) of the same color step (that is, a color of the same color); the harmony of mixed colors, which is the matching of the same or similar luminances on the color steps of adjacent colors (such as yellow and orange, cyan and green); and the harmony of dominant color light, which is the matching of various different colors in which one color is uniquely visible and noticeably subordinates the remaining colors. (This kind of harmony is the same as observing objects with dichroic glass, and all object colors change color and have a common tendency.) The second category is contrast harmony (Harmonies of constract), which is also divided into three types: the harmony of color step contrast, which is the matching of suspended luminances in the same color step; the harmony of mixed color contrast, which is the matching of suspended luminances in the color steps of adjacent colors; and the harmony of different color contrast, which is the matching of very different color steps. It is generally the same as the summary of each family of Lousijing Feilai (Baily). It is nothing more than seeking unity from change.

The most important thing to pay attention to in the first type of harmony method is "color phase transition" (Gredation of Colour). The colors in nature, such as grass, trees, insects, and even the colors of the sky, are the most common phenomena; that is, the lightness and depth of the same color or similar colors are gradually or intermittently changed, and the contrast is clear (more distant luminances or small blanks can be used to separate the transitions of various luminances). The taste of harmony is the most elegant and peaceful. In other words, different lightness and darkness and saturation of the same color phase can achieve harmony under any proportion.

The second type of harmony method is mainly to unify the whole with the dominant color light, and its dominant color occupies the dominant position in terms of area or intensity. The colors dominated by it are suitable for those with a distance of 90 degrees to 220 degrees in the color wheel, because they implicitly contain the same pigment. The points to pay attention to when applying it are further listed as follows:

(1) The color area and lightness should be inversely proportional, and pay attention to the overall breadth to determine the color area, so as to achieve its balance.

(2) The combination of two colors is beautiful with approximate complementary colors, but the lightness should be different, that is, add gray to each or darken their tones to form an unsaturated state. If the combination of the other two colors is not suitable, it can also be harmonized if unsaturated colors are used instead.

(3) When matching three colors, it is advisable to use two warm colors and one cold color. Decorations and paintings in ancient times all had warm color tones.

(4) The area of cold colors should not be too wide. If it is necessary to use a large amount of it, the color should be light, but green should still be used sparingly. (There is no pure green in ancient Greek wall decorations).

(5) When using black and white and other colors, pay attention to the change in contrast on the lightness.

(6) Gold and silver colors can only be used as connecting lines, and their lightness and darkness should be opposite to the background color.

(7) For complex color schemes, you can follow the proportions of beautiful natural colors such as butterflies, flowers, and gemstones. It is also advisable to use more broken color silk. It is best to have one or five colors that are prominent, so that the whole has a tendency to the same mixed color. (Sometimes adding small dots or thin lines of one color to the whole has the same effect.)

(8) Use less bright and simple colors to make people obtain a wider position. (The most bright colors in nature are flowers, but their area is particularly small, and the surrounding colors are mostly dark; there are also bright and fixed comparisons, so that their colors are not too dazzling, so they do not harm the sense of beauty.)

(9) The number of colors used should not be too many (regardless of the lightness of each color).

In addition to the harmony of volume and area mentioned above, there are also differences in the length and order of time of perception and physical phenomena. We all know that all dark colors are heavier than light colors. For example, the black pants and white shirts of Chinese women and the black pants and white clothes of Western European choirs can make people feel comfortable in terms of feeling. This is because the heavy color is below and the light color is above. If this physics is reversed, it will definitely give people a feeling of disharmony. The length and order of time of perception are related to the residual sense phenomenon. Special attention should be paid to this in color films.

### Two Comedies

— Tao Xiong

Although "A Chart of Official Promotions" and "A New Official Takes Office" are different in performance, their themes are the same. The former describes how a group of corrupt officials use power to exploit the common people, how to flatter their superiors, and even sacrifice their sisters and wives, in exchange for the only goal - to be promoted and make a fortune; among colleagues, they establish a wide network, exclude and squeeze each other! These are just the present forms of bureaucrats on the political stage! The latter describes a group of traitors, but aren't they also exploiting the common people, flattering their superiors, and excluding each other? However, in the environment and status of this group of people, they are not as noble and legitimate as in "A Chart of Official Promotions." Although the county magistrate and secretary in "A Chart of Official Promotions" are two habitual thieves, aren't all the others imposing officials? And in "A New Official Takes Office," it is a group of ignorant hooligans. Although this group of hooligans is pretending to be like real officials, they are ultimately pitiful! Because they don't know how to be officials, their "ancestors" have never been officials, so even on a notice, they have to write the names, ages, hometowns, and where they live of these officials. When they have a little something to do, they can hold meetings at will, "standing at attention" looking very much like it. Once the chicken comes, they can disperse in a rush for a braised or stewed chicken! They don't care what the results of the meeting are. Their stupid behavior makes people feel pitiful and laughable, and they are much more innocent than the officials in "A Chart of Official Promotions."

The method of corruption of the officials in "A New Official Takes Office" is to sell white powder and opium, and this one asks that one for monthly rule money; that one tells this one that he has no money, you have money, everyone should enjoy the blessing! And the method of corruption of the officials in "A Chart of Official Promotions" is to levy donations from the common people; to ask subordinates for gold bars to cure headaches, and to ask subordinates to sell a five-carat diamond ring for a few dollars. From these perspectives, stupid hooligans are much more straightforward than shameless bureaucrats.

These two plays were written by Chen Baichen. Their themes are all about the various forms in the officialdom, and they are all comedies. Because the times and social environments in which the playwright wrote were different, these two different works were written under the same theme. From this point, we can know that an author cannot be separated from the times and society!

### Luo Zhenzhi Advocates Kun Opera

— Luo Zhenzhi

Shanghai is an area where humanities gather. Most kinds of local operas are available, but only the Kun Opera of our Suzhou territory is entrusted to Min Ru. Why? For twenty years, wars have filled our eyes, and people's hearts are strong. What we have seen and heard has all tended to be violent. Therefore, the style of opera has gradually become stimulating, and the sounds of music, poetry, and odes are not valued by the world. In addition, culture has declined, etiquette and righteousness are almost lost, the market is noisy, and the autumn is mourned by insects, causing the southern immortals to become scattered; in the north, only Han Bai remains, and Han Shichang does not want to come out to perform, but specializes in teaching music for a living. Kun performers have also sighed that they were born at the wrong time! If Mei Lanfang successfully takes the stage, he will use Kun Opera as the vanguard, with the intention of reviving the decline. The highbrow art is half to promote national studies and half to cultivate people's hearts; the words of the songs are beautiful and deeply moving, so they should be a noble form of entertainment, how can we let them be buried and unknown!

The legendary scripts were all written by well-known people in the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and often take several studies to be published. Their meaning does not escape loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness, containing the essence of education. If Dou E contains grievances, flying snow in June, reading at night with straw sandals, and being granted a double crown, although they are deliberately depicted, we must know that they are eager to persuade people to do good, and they have many good influences, which are helpful to the world. Today, science is prosperous, and people can definitely overcome nature, but there are many social events, and frauds, deceptions, and thefts emerge one after another. If we can use the style of opera to correct people's hearts, it may not be a good proverb for preaching! However, at the beginning of its creation and performance, it relies on the theater owner to mediate well and guide enthusiastically!

The great corners of Beijing Opera, Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, all have a foundation in Kun Opera. From this, we can know that Beijing Opera and Kun Opera cannot be regarded as two different paths, causing the separation of Qin and Yue. I wish that Beijing Opera and Kun Opera would be integrated, or in the performance of Beijing Opera, interspersed with Kun Opera programs, so that Kun Opera would not disappear from people's ears and eyes, and be forgotten. I hope that those who love Kun Opera will work hard to promote it, and I am willing to wait and see the revival of Kun Opera!

### The Plot Playwright Scribe

— Da Chun

Before the 19th century, European plays were mostly poetic dramas. In the early 19th century, although Victor Hugo raised the banner of literary revolution in France, advocating Romanticism, his work "Hernani," which served as the prelude to Romantic literature, was also a poetic drama. It was not until Augustin Eugene Scribe arose that he began to promote vernacular drama, which was extremely popular in society at the time, and no one dared to challenge him. Another reason was that Scribe's comedies of manners, with their intricate structures and abundant interest, perfectly met the demands of the middle class at the time. His improved vernacular dramas were eagerly sought after by theaters such as the Theatre de S. A. R. Madame, the Theatre de la Comedie Francaise, and the Opera-Comique, and even influenced the rest of Europe. The theaters of various countries were almost dominated by Scribe's works.

Scribe was the son of a merchant, born in Paris on December 24, 1791, and died on February 20, 1861. During his lifetime, he wrote more than four hundred plays, either alone or in collaboration with others, at least three hundred and fifty of which were published separately or included in various collections. Scribe was a talented writer. In 1815, his popular comedy "Une nuit de la garde nationale" and several lively short plays, such as "Ie sollicitur" and "L'ours et Pacha," were published and immediately welcomed by the literary world, making him a famous writer. From 1811 to 1862, his plays were performed in various theaters for more than fifty years, and no French playwright was as highly regarded for so long. In terms of style, he applied comedy, vaudeville, popular vaudeville, melodrama, opera, and opera-comique styles. Scribe's earliest works were one-act popular comedies, and he later wrote five-act comedies. Scribe was an astute and meticulous observer, capturing the customs and habits of society at the time. His plays focus on construction, taking plot (Device) as a premise, rather than emphasizing wording and interest as problem plays do. Scribe had a magical and unpredictable technique, and the structure of his plays was original, very clever, and intricate. The beginning is often unremarkable, but the ending can be amazing. Every prop and book in his plays is a clue to the whole play, which can arouse the audience's interest. The plot is captivating everywhere, like a detective novel, and the ups and downs are also heart-stopping. Moreover, he can cater to the psychology of the masses, and the plays have a common character, with simple and readable words, just like Bai Juyi's poems, which even old women can understand. Therefore, the critics of the time called his plays "Pieces bien faits" (well-made plays). Later Eugène Labiche and Henri Bernstein (1876–1953) were his disciples.

From the opening of the Gymnase Theatre in Paris in 1820 to 1830, Scribe wrote many popular comedies for the theater, expressing them with very appropriate themes and rich content. The best works of this period are "Le plus beau jour de la vie," "La Demoisrllea marier," and "Le charlatanisme." The main themes of Scribe's plays are not hidden: they provide exactly the happiness and ideals that the middle class needs.

Scribe adapted several themes from popular comedies into comedies and achieved considerable success. His "Valerie" was performed at the Comedie Francaise in 1822, and in 1827 the theater staged his "Le camaraderie." From 1833 to 1850, his works often won the audience's praise at the theater. During this period, the theater successively performed his "Bertrand et Raton" (1833), "Le camaraderie," "La calomnie" (1840), "Le verre dieau" (1840), and "Une chaine" (1841).

From 1815 to 1848, comedies accounted for the largest proportion of French plays, and plays about money issues occupied a very large position in theaters: almost all erotic comedies were infected with this issue. In addition to Scribe's "Le camaraderie" and "Le Puff" (1848), more famous ones include "L'argent" (1825) by C. Binjour (1795-1856), and "L'agiotage" (1826) co-authored by L.B. Picard (1769-1828) and A.S. Empis (1795-1868). After 1848, F. Pinsaraent (1853) and "La Boursr" (1856) appeared.

From 1823, Scribe also wrote many operas and opera-comiques: "La Dame blanche", "La Muette de Portici" (1828), officers, baronesses, innocent girls, national guards, veterans of the Empire era, clever officials, fake news reporters, explosive merchants, notaries, small clerks, etc., are all model images, he simply exhibited an accurate and moving large picture album in front of people. The clothes, actions, anecdotes, and conversations of these characters revolved around. Looking at the characters in those comedies of manners, people are reminded of the works of Moliere, J.-F. Regard (1655-1709), F. Dancourt (1661-1725) and Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée, and others. And sometimes Scribe performed even better than them.

Scribe had many collaborating friends who only helped him find some materials and provide some opinions. One collaborator named Carmouche once said, "I have collaborated with Scribe on twelve or fifteen popular comedies, but I always tell you that not a single word in these works is mine." Scribe often selected a few scenes from the collaborators' works, changed the theme, compacted the various parts, and rewrote them from beginning to end. The collaborators also got less than half of the benefits.

The best plays written by Scribe in his lifetime are "Bertrand et Raton," "Le verre d'eau," "Bataille de dames" (1851), "Le camaraderie," and "Le camaraderie". "Bertrand et Raton" and "Le verre d'eau" are model works in historical comedies, and the strokes are light and refined, pure. Alexandre Dumas also often praised him. "Bertrand et Raton" writes about the struggle between the Count of Lanjos and Stroganov. "Le verre d'eau" writes about the struggle between the Duchess of Marlborough and Bolingbroke. Scribe often chose adventurous or dangerous themes. "Bataille de dames" depicts the competition between two women to rescue a conspiratorial teenager whom they love. Will he be caught? There is endless interest in this hidden event, in this search, and in this strict language. The protagonist in "Le camaraderie" is a typical figure of the new moral nouveau riche. A young man is in love with a widow's money and marries her without love. The characters in "Le camaraderie" are similar to the typical characters in "Cabotins" by B. Pailleron (1834-1899), but Scribe's lines are clearer.

In addition to dramas, Scribe also wrote many short stories and published them in various newspapers and periodicals. His complete works were not published until 1859.

Scribe only cared about writing in his life and had no other extravagant expectations. His collaborator J.-F. Bayard once said, "He is a truly outstanding writer, just like a few writers, he is content with such a title, and does not want to use the writer's guise to seek other things. His name is not in any faction, he does not want to engage in any revolution, he does not summon any powerful people, although there are people among them whom he admires. He does not bow down to honor, status, or subsidies. He only asks for himself, only exhausts his talent and work, he has his happiness and independence..."

On January 28, 1836, Scribe entered the Académie Française.

O, Feillet (1821-1890) once said: "In the field of literary creation, the most difficult technique is to induce imagination without abandoning imagination, to touch the heart without disturbing the heart, to comfort people rather than bribing people; this supreme technique is what Scribe has."

On March 26, 1863, at the meeting place of the Académie Française, Vitet (1802-1873) also said: "Scribe has a strong and excellent talent, which guarantees his deserved position. In this era, he holds the reins of the drama world. He has an inventive talent for plays, which can be said to be unprecedented... His imagination is not thrown into an ordinary mill, he has his secrets, he has his methods, and he never expresses himself in the same way..."

Since writing plays, the most difficult thing to deal with is the structure, and Scribe's plays have overcome this difficulty. Today, although Scribe's works are no longer popular, his ingenious structure still has lasting value. This is what playwrights should learn from him. The purpose of my writing this article is only this point.

### Mold (Novel) (Part 2)

— Zhong Yuan

Of course, he never received money from his wife. He understood that it was a kind of shame, and he felt angry. But the result of his anger was just letting out a long breath and that was it.

It's embarrassing to say, but sometimes he actually felt a little regret. For example: when he attended meetings and saw the youngsters like Yang Ke-ren and Zhou Da-xiong, all wearing smart suits, offering cigarettes and chatting up the pot-bellied school board members, he secretly regretted not accepting his wife's money. Otherwise, those pot-bellied guys would at least look at him differently, or ask his name, instead of letting those youngsters monopolize the spotlight.

That kind of regret was naturally hidden deep in his heart. He never dared to reveal it to anyone, not even to himself. However, he certainly knew it existed, except when some naughty students chased after him shouting "cuckold."

Now, in the dim light of the rapeseed oil lamp, looking at his wife, he thought of all these things, past and present. But tonight, everything seemed a little different. There was only one thing in his heart - rage! There was only one thing in front of his eyes - Yang Ke-ren's smug face filled with coldness.

"How hateful, woman! Tonight, you even pretend to offer me some comfort with your fake kindness. Who wants your comfort? Because of your shamelessness, my rice bowl is shaky, do you know that?"

He shouted angrily in his heart. His fist almost slammed into his wife's tender face. He felt that he was too easy on her when she came back just now by only giving her a sneer and ignoring her. He really should do as Yang Ke-ren said: "That kind of woman, give her a good beating!"

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, the more anxious he felt. Finally, he lost control and croaked out from his throat: "Give her a beating!"

He didn't shout loudly. But in the silent night, it was startling enough. His wife suddenly opened her eyes, looked at him, and asked in surprise: "What's wrong?"

He glared at his wife. Awakened from her sleep, her cheeks were flushed, making her look particularly beautiful. This charm pricked his eyes, pricked his heart. He hated her. At this moment, he clearly felt that he hated her. He slowly raised his clenched fist.

However, before his fist landed, his wife had already jumped out of bed.

"Don't hit me, let's talk it over properly…" She grabbed his hand, her flushed face pressed against his shoulder, and she stammered in fright: "When I came back just now, I could tell that you weren't very happy tonight, so I didn't dare tell you something very happy...". She cried, and tears dripped onto his clothes. She was a woman of rich experience, understanding that tears could melt a man's heart, especially a man like Feng Zeng-shou.

Sure enough, his fist loosened. Like a child wronged, complaining to his mother, he told his wife about the anger in his heart.

"So that's it! You've been tricked, let me tell you!..." After listening to his story, his wife smiled slightly and told him succinctly: "Recently, a girlfriend introduced me to a rich old man, a big shot, and also the most powerful director in your school. A few days ago, I asked him to promote you. He agreed immediately. Yesterday he told me that he had talked to your principal and that the position of Dean of Studies for next semester will definitely be offered to you. Yang Ke-ren probably found out about this news, so he came up with a plan today to scare you, instigate you, and make sure you don't succeed..."

"Understand?"

She didn't say much more, just gently asked: "Understand?" He nodded. She leaned close to his ear and whispered: "I did it all for you!" He nodded again. And so, the storm passed.

It passed. As the night deepened, in the dim light, he saw two old men with smirking faces, hugging his wife's petite body, turning, jumping, and laughing in front of him. Gradually, many familiar faces appeared in front of him, Yang Ke-ren, Zhou Da-xiong, Zhang Kang-yuan, Wang Fa-kui... Ah! Those hateful youngsters were all spitting on him and shouting at him: "Turtle! Turtle!"

As if in a fit of rage, his body moved slightly. But in an instant, the old man and his wife disappeared, and he was standing proudly in front of those youngsters. No! He seemed to be sitting leisurely in the Dean's office, wearing a snow-white silk shirt and light gray suit, talking secretly with Principal Li, the big boss, about joining forces to go to Nanjing and Shanghai to make money. A thin teacher knocked on the door and came in, wearing a torn blue cloth gown, with his head bowed. He looked and saw, oh, it was Yang Ke-ren, "Humph!"…

Humph…

He laughed! Opening his eyes, the rapeseed oil lamp was flickering, and his heart was also flickering.

It was still a moldy day, and the hot wind from the supermarket was blowing everywhere. The Dean of Studies for next semester would be changed.

Feng Zeng-shou had a talk with Principal Li, and dozens of strange eyes were looking at his face at the same time. He strode through these strange eyes, proudly carrying his books towards the teachers' room.

He walked very fast, his thin body floating, almost able to fly into the sky. But suddenly, he stopped, and his "proudly" disappeared. He heard a group of students laughing in the sixth-grade classroom, and in the middle was a very clear voice:

"Ha... Mr. Feng's wife sleeps with my dad, five thousand yuan a night... Ha..."

He could tell that it was Zhang Kang-yuan's voice. He gritted his teeth and clenched his fists, wanting to rush into the classroom. But suddenly, his fist touched a thick wad of something in his pocket, and his hand loosened. He remembered what his wife said when she stuffed this wad of things into his pocket in the morning: "Old Man Zhang said that when your school directors hold a meeting next week, he will introduce you to a few bigwigs, but how can you meet people looking like that? Hurry up and order a suit today first!" Thinking of this, he suddenly felt a burning sensation on his face; in an instant, his whole body began to burn.

Finally, he wiped away the sweat and carefully pressed down on the thick wad of things in his pocket, and stepped past the sixth-grade classroom, burning all over.

Muggy, humid, hot... A dim sun hung in the sky… (The End)

### Flying Together (6)(9)

— Zhao Qingge

The situation on the second and third days was similar. Li-hua's performance continued to be praised, while Li-yun's was mediocre, not good, but not a complete failure. Therefore, after three days, the two sisters officially went to sea (started performing). They signed a half-year contract with the troupe manager. Their names were temporarily ranked second or third, and then considered for promotion. Li-yun's salary was 20 yuan per month, and Li-hua's salary was 40 yuan per month. Although Li-hua's income was not much, it could be considered that Mrs. Mo's purpose had been achieved. They were finally earning money while living at home. However, 12 yuan out of the 60 yuan had to be given to Zhang Xian (this was a condition that Zhang Xian had set in advance. After the apprentice started earning, the master had to extract 20% of the apprentice's salary). Moreover, Mrs. Mo still asked them to continue learning opera, because she hoped that they would have greater success. Mrs. Mo had promised Zhang Xian before the new year to increase the tuition fee to 40 yuan per month this year. In this way, the money they earned was all spent on Zhang Xian. Fortunately, Zhang Xian waived the fee for pulling the huqin (Chinese violin) for them to show his generosity. But he stated that this was only a temporary help during the transitional period. When they became more familiar with the stage and had a little more experience, others could also pull the huqin for them. Then he would no longer help them. If they had to have him pull the huqin, they would have to pay him separately. After Mrs. Mo calculated this in her heart, she was still very optimistic. For her daughter's art, she would not hesitate to spend another sum of money to hire Zhang Xian as Li-hua's fixed huqin player. Because she always felt that to make a lot of money, you had to be willing to pay. She was optimistic about Li-hua's unlimited future, and the money she spent would definitely not be in vain. As for Li-yun, it was a favor she did along the way, and cultivating Li-yun for Second Mrs. Weng would still be beneficial to her in the future. Mrs. Mo was indeed a smart person. She saw everything far ahead, had vision and a broad mind, and dared to act, dared to be ruthless, and dared to be vicious!

Mrs. Mo's prediction was indeed correct! Li-hua's artistic reputation grew bigger and bigger every day. The audience liked her because she was young and talented, and gradually some audience members even began to give her gifts. Some people went to the backstage specifically to see her, and many ladies and young ladies took her to their mansions to play because they loved her. All of this made Mrs. Mo ecstatic, and made Zhang Xian and Second Mrs. Weng, Shi Yu-lou, and others jealous.

Yet only Li-hua didn't care! She numbly accepted everything, and she indifferently regarded everything as fleeting clouds. Her repertoire has also changed recently. In addition to the few operas that she starred in independently, the operas starring Shi Yu-lou were often added, and they seemed even more exciting, and would win more applause. As a result, this situation caused Shi Yu-lou to feel uneasy, but Shi Yu-lou did not resent Li-hua, and only mourned his own golden age!

Time does not forgive anyone, and Shi Yu-lou was gradually abandoned in the flight of this merciless time! His body and mind were gradually abandoned with his life, and he became gray, depressed, and even died!

At the same time, Li-hua grew and progressed in the flying years!

Second Mrs. Weng was sad because of Shi Yu-lou, and Mrs. Mo was happy because of Li-hua!
