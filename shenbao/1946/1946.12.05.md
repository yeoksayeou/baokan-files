[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The People's Congress held its eighth meeting on the 4th. The meeting was called to order at 9:35 AM with the ringing of a bell. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Hechang reported that 1,103 representatives were present. Chairman Hu Shuhua led the assembly in performing the customary salutations and announced that female representative Liu Chunyi had passed away in the morning at the Central Hospital due to cerebral hemorrhage. The entire assembly stood up to pay their respects. Then, they began to broadly exchange opinions on the draft constitution. Xinjiang representative Zhang Fengji first stated that another representative from Xinjiang, Abulahat Mahsut, had not had the opportunity to speak the previous day and requested that he be given priority. This was unanimously agreed upon by the assembly. Mr. Abulahat then delivered his speech in Uyghur, which was translated by representative Mai Huanxin. Xikang representative Qumu Changmin then spoke, which received much applause.

### Youth Party Speaks for the First Time, Supporting National Supremacy and Endorsing a Strong and Powerful Government

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] During the morning session of the eighth National Assembly, the representatives expressed their opinions as follows:

Abulahat Mahsut, representative of the Xinjiang region: Every revolution in the world has a primary goal and slogan. Mr. Sun Yat-sen proposed the lofty principle of equality among all ethnic groups in the country. However, 35 years since the establishment of the Republic of China, this has not been realized in practice. Border regions, with Xinjiang being the bridge between Europe and Asia, are particularly important. All ethnic groups in Xinjiang are members of the Chinese nation. Why is there such inequality? It is hoped that the National Assembly and the government will jointly take responsibility for this issue and seek a thorough solution in the constitution.

Qumu Changmin, representative of the Xikang region: Most of the indigenous ethnic compatriots in various provinces and regions have been sinicized. However, their lives are controlled by the local gentry and officials, and they have no political status. It is requested that the assembly pay attention to this and incorporate provisions into the constitution to raise the status of ethnic minorities and increase their welfare.

Shi Shangkuan, elected representative: (1) The characteristic of the Five-Power Constitution is to extract the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of the parliamentary system and the presidential system. The National Assembly, representing the people, exercises strong political power, while the five Yuans exercise governing power in conjunction with the government, enabling it to amend the governing power institutions for the strongest political power, which should be rectified. (2) The word "responsible" in Article 58, which states that the Executive Yuan is "responsible" to the Legislative Yuan, is incorrect. The relationship between the Yuans should be one of equal partnership. Disputes between the Executive and Legislative Yuans should be judged by the National Assembly.

He Luzhi, elected representative (Youth Party): The majority opinion in the assembly is that mutual checks and balances among governing power institutions will offset administrative power, which is quite reasonable. Although we participated in the revision of the draft constitution, its content does not fully reflect the proposals of the Youth Party. We have always believed that national interests are above all else. For the sake of the future of the nation and the country, we will never be rigid and insist on our own opinions. We also agree with the establishment of a strong and powerful government to cope with the current situation. It is hoped that the assembly and the various review committees will conduct thorough discussions and formulate a constitution that is most perfect, most reasonable, and most suitable for the national conditions. We will also follow in the footsteps of all the representatives and work hard for the future nation-building cause.

Yu Jiaju, elected representative: We (Youth Party) are a minority party, and our role is to provide both positive and negative opinions. Now, we only express the following opinions: (1) The public opinion organs should be permanent, hold meetings regularly, and the number of people should not be too large. It should be parallel with the administrative organs. The functions of the Legislative Yuan in the amendment meet these conditions. It only rejects laws and policies of the Executive Yuan, but does not vote on a vote of no confidence, which also meets the national conditions. (2) The rights of the president should not be too large or too small, so that he can be capable but not have exclusive power. (3) The autonomous system should be used in an appropriate way to maintain unity. "Autonomy" cannot be used to implement "division," nor can "unity" be used to implement "oppression." (4) Professional and women's groups should have spokespersons in the public opinion organs.

Wang Shizeng, elected representative: The people control the government with political power in three ways: personnel control, political control, and legislative control. The amendment and the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft have the same starting point on this, but the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft gives them all to the National Assembly, while the amendment divides them between the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. We admit that Sun Yat-sen's political ideals are the most outstanding in common usage, but the conditions for their realization must wait until all parts of the country have reached the constitutional period. The current situation has not yet reached that time. It is advocated that the power of the National Assembly maintain the provisions of Chapter 3, Article 27. Hu Dingan, a representative of the liberal professions: (1) If you want a strong country, you must first strengthen the race. The physical fitness level of the people must be improved. It is advocated that the people's rights to health care, rest, and hygiene be included in the constitution. (2) The number of liberal professions in the professional group representatives should be taken into consideration.

Zhan Xuehai, representative of the Hubei region: (1) Division of power and ability; (2) Political power should be separated from governing power and be independent; (3) The National Assembly can set up a smaller permanent organization during the adjournment period to administer power to avoid the Legislative Yuan's excessive power, where the governing power plunders the political power.

Tang Guozhen, an elected female representative: (1) The location of the capital is not clearly stated in the constitution; (2) The election of ethnic minorities in the border areas and professional and women's groups should be listed after Article 129 to eliminate de facto inequality.

Kong Geng, representative of the Hubei region: The representatives of the Youth Party have already expressed their opinions. Please invite Mr. Yao Dongyou from the Democratic Socialist Party to speak.

Zhou Zhongyue, representative of the Yunnan region: (1) The amendment collects the various opinions since the Fifth-Fifth Draft, which is generally good; (2) The Legislative Yuan's excessive power should be amended.

Wang Huaiming, representative of the Shanxi region: Article 90 should not be limited to civil servants for the examination, but should include candidates for public office. The term "regional quota" is not clearly defined, and the method is not thorough. It should be changed to "regional examination, provincial quota."

Li Hongwen, representative of the Shanxi region: (1) Changes to the territory in Article 4 must be approved by the National Assembly; (2) Chapter 4 on the powers of the National Assembly should be revised and added; (3) The establishment of the capital should be considered from the perspective of national security and ethnic interests, and there should be no regional self-interest. It is advocated to establish the capital in Beiping, because: (1) Geographically and historically, Beiping has been a famous capital since ancient times. Those who have established their capital in Beiping can continue to rule; (2) In terms of national defense, it can control the Northeast and Northwest; (3) Economically, heavy industrial raw materials are all in the North. To build the country, we must make every effort to develop it. It is easy to do it near Beiping; (4) In terms of transportation, land and water are very convenient; (5) In terms of climate, Beiping summers do not delay work.

Yuan Baohuang, Tianjin professional representative: The number of workers' representatives in the country should be stipulated in the professional group elections.

Wu Yanhuan, representative of the Hebei region: (1) "Mr. Sun Yat-sen" in the preface to the draft constitution should be respectfully referred to as the "Father of the Nation"; (2) The proposition to establish the capital in Beiping is based on the perspective of national defense security, and it is by no means selfish. It is hoped that all parties will not lightly make idle remarks.

Li Wanjuz, representative of the Taiwan region: (1) Article 14 should be changed to "The people have the freedom of belief in doctrines and religions to avoid confusion; (2) The power of the National Assembly is too small; (3) Local rights should be more clearly stipulated; (4) More than 95% of the people in Taiwan have received education and are highly educated. Can autonomy be granted during the implementation of the constitution?

### Zhang Lan to Arrive in Shanghai Within a Week

The Democratic League is About to Convene a Central Standing Committee Meeting

[Central News Agency, this city] Shen Junru, a member of the Standing Committee of the Democratic League, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 3rd. He said that Zhang Lan is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Chongqing ten days ago. When asked by reporters, he said: The relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League, the successor of the Secretary-General of the Democratic League, and other internal issues of the Democratic League will all be discussed at the Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League. He also stated that the Secretary-General of the League is currently being represented by Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Xinmin. Of the 17 members of the Standing Committee of the Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Jian Bozan, Zhang Shenfu, and Li Jun are all in Shanghai, except for Liang Shuming, who has sent a representative and will not be able to come to Shanghai to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting.

### Zhang Dongsun to Come to Shanghai, Meeting with Zhang Junmai

Discussing the Unity of the Democratic Socialist Party

[Our Beijing Correspondent, 4th] Zhang Dongsun, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, who opposed the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly, recently received a telegram from Zhang Junmai urging them to fly to Shanghai to discuss the issue of party unity. It is reported that the three are preparing to go.

### National Defense Council Routine Meeting Changed to Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The routine meeting of the Supreme National Defense Committee, which was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th, was not convened. It is reported that it has been rescheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 6th.

### National Assembly Representatives Save Refreshment Fees, Donate Funds to Aid Nanjing Refugees, Presidium Decides to Give Each Representative a Special Allowance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Some representatives of the National Assembly, concerned about the refugees in Nanjing, have repeatedly proposed to save the refreshment fees of the Assembly and use them for aid, and to ask the representatives to donate funds for aid. It is now learned that this case has been resolved by the Presidium meeting. According to the wishes of the representatives, the Assembly will stop providing refreshments from the 4th, and the fees will be used for aid. The government will also be requested to order the competent authorities to promptly distribute relief to the refugees. As for donating funds for aid, each representative will voluntarily donate, and the representatives will transfer the donations to the post office bureau in the assembly hall. It is reported that the bureau received 1 million yuan in donations in one day on the 4th. The donors included Wang Tongye, Li Yingsheng, Huyan Liren, Chen Xingsun, Hu Yiming, Xue Dubi, Xue Shixuan, Zhu Shuchi, Liao Gongpu, Chen Jingchuan, Liu Houwu, Ding Zhongying, Wan Zhucun, Zhou Zhaolin, Wang Mingxuan, etc. There were also two representatives who donated 310,000 yuan anonymously. In addition, Tao Wan, a staff member of the bureau, also voluntarily donated 10,000 yuan.

[Another dispatch] The Presidium of the National Assembly believes that the prices in Nanjing are high, and the food and accommodation expenses received by the representatives are not enough to cover their expenses. It was specially proposed for discussion at the tenth meeting of the Presidium, and it was decided that each representative would be given a special allowance of 500,000 yuan by the Assembly, and the government would be requested to order the Ministry of Finance to urgently pay the money, which can be distributed to the representatives within a few days.

### Democratic Socialist Party Representatives Speak Successively, Explaining the Spirit of the Political Consultative Conference Draft Constitution, Hoping to Formulate a National Centennial Law

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The main points of the speeches of the representatives at the eighth National Assembly in the afternoon are as follows:

Xu Chuanlin: The draft constitution is generally very good, but we should now formulate a centennial plan that is needed by the people of the whole country, and everyone should discuss it calmly. I also hope that this draft constitution can be passed at the meeting, but Article 7 "Establish the capital in Nanjing" should be deleted, because no country has put the establishment of the capital in the constitution. At the same time, if the country encounters an accident, the capital must be moved, and the parliament will not be able to convene, so the location cannot be determined. Regarding the location of the capital, I think it should be in Beiping now, but Beiping will not be a good place in the future. My country's exchanges with foreign countries are not in the southeast but in the northwest, so the capital should be built in Lanzhou, for the following reasons: (1) It may consolidate the national defense in the northwest; (2) The northwest is sparsely populated, and the southeast is densely populated. If the capital is built in the northwest, the people in the southeast can immigrate to the northwest to achieve the purpose of development; (3) The culture of the northwest is backward. If the capital is built in the northwest, the phenomenon of abnormal development of culture in the southeast can be eliminated, and the national culture can be developed universally and evenly. This point will be discussed again at the next meeting.

Finally, I would like to propose that in Article 137 of Chapter 13, "The foreign policy of the Republic of China shall be based on the spirit of independence and autonomy, so as to promote good neighborliness, fulfill treaty obligations, abide by the Charter of the United Nations, promote international cooperation, and ensure world peace as the basic policy." The seven words "abide by the Charter of the United Nations" should be deleted, because the Charter of the United Nations is temporary, and my country's charter is permanent.

### Reduce Party Color, Take into Account Environmental Needs

Jiang Yuntian: The draft constitution submitted by Chairman Chiang to the Assembly this time is mostly the result of consultations among representatives of various parties and social elites across the country. Our party has participated in the consultation and cannot but respect the opinions of the consultation in terms of morality, but this draft constitution is a collection of opinions from all parties. From a theoretical point of view, some articles have a considerable distance from the ideals of our party.

Our Democratic Socialist Party believes that since we are formulating a centennial law for the country and establishing common rules for the people of the whole country, the first is to reduce the color of the party, and the second is to take into account the current actual environmental needs. Reducing the color of the party can permeate opinions from all parties. The more opinions it permeates, the more it will be supported by the majority. Being able to take into account the needs of the actual environment, the use can be flexible, and many difficulties can be reduced when implementing it. This draft constitution was written under these two major premises.

In terms of reducing party color: Article 1 is an example, which has permeated the opinions of all parties and included all the people of the country. In terms of taking into account the needs of the environment, Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 together show its characteristics. For example, the National Assembly can elect a wise and outstanding president. The provisions in the draft constitution allow him to exert his outstanding talents to lead the nation-building cause without forcing him to have behaviors that exceed the constitution. If the National Assembly cannot elect a first-class president, and the Legislative Yuan can agree to an intelligent and capable president of the Executive Yuan, then the president of the Executive Yuan can also exert his talents in this draft constitution and replace most of the president to lead the nation-building cause. Hearing the opinions of the representatives in recent days, I think that the powers of the National Assembly are too small. From the perspective of quantity, there are only elections or recall of the president and amendment of the constitution, which seems too little. However, from the importance of exercising power, its powers are great and sacred. If every representative of the National Assembly can elect a president for the country, then his contribution to the country will be very great. As for amending the constitution, it is the most basic and important power. Therefore, we believe that the power of the National Assembly is not less than that of the Legislative Yuan. In the past few days, I have heard the opinions of the professional representatives, women's representatives, and especially the border representatives, and our party has shown sympathetic consideration to them.

### The Legislative Yuan Has Greater Power, Showing the Spirit of Democracy

Wu Zaochi: This draft constitution can fully express the spirit of democratic politics, and can also be in line with the ideological trend of modern constitutions. Since the 19th century, the constitutions of various countries in Europe and the United States, whether internal or external, have been colored by individualism and social ideology. What individualism is fighting for is political equality, and the main purpose of socialism is economic equality. This constitution incorporates these two ideas. Chapter 12 is a concrete manifestation of political equality, and Articles 138 to 142 of Chapter 13 express the spirit of socialism. These two spirits can also be seen everywhere in the entire draft constitution. The legislative branch is particularly clear, and the Legislative Yuan has greater power. Only in this way can the spirit of democratic politics be more enriched. However, we say this not because we think that a constitution is perfect, because we know that this constitution is the result of responding to objective environmental requirements, and it is necessary to add all the basic principles of the Three Principles of the People to write it. If it needs to be modified, it will be more perfect, that is, it must be studied in detail.

Sun Yaofu: This draft does not violate the teachings of the Prime Minister, and it is a combination of the opinions of the Communist Party, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party. It was formulated by various parties sacrificing their prejudices. Some people think that the powers of the National Assembly are too small. Political power is the power of the people, and the power of the people is exercised by representatives, which is indirect democracy. The National Assembly has the power to elect and recall the president and vice president, and to pass amendments to the constitution, as well as the indirect democratic rights to elect legislators and supervisors. As for the Legislative Yuan's excessive power, direct democracy can be exercised by referendum to reduce it.

Zhang Fengji: Our compatriots in the border areas can all believe in the Three Principles of the People and support the National Government. I hope that we can get equal rights and add a chapter on national autonomy.

Liu Dongyan: I think there are three characteristics in this constitution: (1) It can prevent the emergence of centralized politics. Although the government is not an omnipotent government, it is still a capable government that is compatible with the trend; (2) It can improve civil rights and realize democratic politics; (3) It can reconcile opinions from all parties and achieve the goal of peaceful unification.

Xia Taosheng: The constitution is good as long as it can be compromised. This draft constitution is a comprehensive opinion from all parties, and it is naturally a good constitution if it can be implemented.

Xia Erkang: The chapter on the National Assembly should adopt a proportional representation system to produce representatives, and the number of female representatives should be increased in a considerable proportion.

Li Peitian: The Supreme Economic Commission under the Executive Yuan should be abolished, because it is a structure that competes with the people for profit. Two departments, Overseas Chinese Affairs and Border Administration, should be established separately.

### Women and Professional Representatives Should Participate in the Constitution-Making

Gu Yuxiu: Article 151 states that if it is necessary to separately determine the implementation procedures for the implementation and amendment of the constitution, it shall be determined by law. Article 146 states that if there is a conflict between the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the President, we accept the President's will to implement constitutional government as soon as possible, not to implement the constitution, but to ask the government to implement constitutional government as soon as possible. According to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference to establish the National Government Committee, representatives of the National Assembly, legislators, and supervisors should be increased to expand the base, and women and professions should also participate in the constitution-making organization. The Constitutional Government Promotion Association asks President Chiang to promote the early implementation of constitutional government.

Wei Tingsheng: The teachings of the Father of the Nation are to implement local autonomy first and then implement constitutional government. Now that the constitution has been made, how to realize direct and indirect elections in the future. Also, the power of the Legislative Yuan is not too great, and the power of the Executive Yuan is not too small.

Fan Tengxiao: The reason for establishing the capital in Beiping is that it is better than Nanjing in terms of national defense, economy, and education.

Qin Liankui: The people's lives and property should be protected. This is stipulated in Articles 91 and 16, but personal freedom still needs to be improved, and freedom of residence should retain the guarantees given to the people in the Fifth-Fifth Constitution Draft.

Chen Yiyun: (1) It should be based on the spirit of the Five-Power Constitution of the Prime Minister's teachings; (2) In the chapter on basic national policy, it is recommended to add an express provision for the protection of female and child workers; (3) Political, economic, educational, and professional should stipulate equal opportunities for women.

Lhadnabadar: It is not necessary to amend the regional quota for the examination system for the border areas. The draft constitution belongs to the people of the whole country, not to one party or one faction. I hope that all parties and factions can sacrifice their prejudices.

### The Executive Yuan's Bureau of Supply Denies U.S. Business Community's Criticism

[Central News Agency, this city] According to a recent report by the Associated Press from Washington, the U.S. business community has been very critical of my country's purchase of surplus U.S. goods, saying that the government and officials use it for profit, causing confusion in the domestic economy. The Bureau of Supply of the Executive Yuan yesterday issued a statement to correct this, believing that the U.S. business community's criticism of the Sino-U.S. surplus goods trade event is inconsistent with the facts.

### Female Representative of National Assembly, Social Elite, Liu Chunyi Died in Nanjing, Suffering from Cerebral Hemorrhage, Funeral Held Today

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] Liu Chunyi (see picture), a female representative of the National Assembly and social elite, was from Sanyuan, Shaanxi. She was 53 years old and had a plump physique. After the meeting on the afternoon of the 3rd, she returned to the Fourth Guest House. She was fine before KFC that night, but at about 12:00 midnight, a female representative who was close to Liu suddenly noticed that Liu's breathing was abnormal, so she got up to visit her and found that Liu was in a coma. She immediately called the first guest house of the General Secretary's Office of the Dihua and the Central Hospital, etc. Then, many National Assembly staff and doctors rushed to the scene and sent Liu to the Central Hospital for emergency treatment. She was examined by the on-duty teacher, who believed that Liu's illness was acute cerebral hemorrhage, which was caused by high blood pressure. It was found that her blood pressure had reached 180 or more, and blood had entered the bone marrow. Liu was in a coma at the time, with a red face and rapid breathing. After the doctor gave her a strong heart injection and other emergency medications, it was still ineffective. At this time, Hong Lanyou, the Secretary-General of the Assembly, rushed to the Fourth Guest House after hearing the news, but did not see her, and then rushed to the scene with Wang Zuxiang, the Director of the Municipal Health Bureau. The doctor had already told him that there was no hope of recovery. Hong immediately ordered many staff members to do things separately and notified his family to come. Liu passed away at 2:30 AM on the 4th. Hong left the hospital at 5:30 AM and sent the staff of the Secretariat with Liu's second son, Peng Qiya, and many friends at 6:00 AM to escort the body to the funeral home to arrange the funeral. On the morning of the 4th, those who came to mourn were endless, including Yu Youren, staff of the Chinese Women's Movement Committee, the General Secretary's Office of the Assembly, and National Assembly representatives. When the reporters went at 11:30 AM, it happened that more than ten National Assembly female representatives, including Tang Guozhen, Chen Yiyun, Zhang Mojun, and Zhang Xiulan, walked out of Liu's body room. All the representatives had tears on their faces. Representative Zhang Xiulan cried even more loudly, leaning on another representative, walking and crying: "The women's movement has not succeeded and you died again." Her voice was very tragic. Liu's body will be placed in a coffin at 2:00 PM on the 5th. Her second son, Peng Qiya, has gone to the Supervisory Yuan to cry and ask President Yu to commend his mother's deeds.

### Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Office of the President, Resigns

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 4th] A report from Beijing said that Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Office of the President, has submitted his resignation due to poor health. Li plans to go to the United States for half a year to recuperate.

### The Capital Establishment Movement is as Fierce as a Blaze

— Our reporters, Pu Dejie and Zhang Ming

— A Quick Sketch of the Eighth National Assembly

Hu Shuhua, dragging a black beard, presided over the morning meeting. His Hunan-accented Mandarin was extremely difficult to understand. He announced that the respected female representative from the social sector, Liu Chunyi, had passed away at the Central Hospital on the morning of the 4th due to cerebral hemorrhage. Everyone couldn't hear clearly and asked each other. It wasn't until the moment of standing in mourning that some representatives still thought they were mourning for Representative Zhang Yanmao, who was assassinated in Kaifeng some time ago.

The Xinjiang representative with the longest name, Abulahat Mahsut, spoke generously and passionately. As soon as he took the podium, he was well-received. However, no one understood what he said. After he finished speaking, the representatives from Xinjiang took the lead in applauding, and everyone followed suit. Then, Mai Huanxin, the second son of Masiwd, translated for him. The entire venue greatly sympathized with the content of his speech.

Three members of the Youth Party spoke in the morning. The first, He Luzhi, humbly spoke in principle, saying that national interests are above all else, and that he would follow everyone's lead, etc. The assembly applauded warmly. The second, Yu Jiaju, was slightly more specific, saying that this might not be appropriate and that should be done this way, etc. The applause was sparse. The third, Wang Shihui, specifically argued that the powers of the National Assembly should maintain the provisions of Article 27 of Chapter 3. There was no reaction in the venue. Before the break, Kong Geng said, "Please invite a representative from the Democratic Socialist Party to give some opinions as well!"

Hu Ding'an requested that the people's rights to health and rest be included in the constitution, following the example of the Soviet Constitution. When he mentioned that the Soviet Constitution also stipulates maternity leave for pregnant working women before and after childbirth, the female representatives greatly applauded Lu Dongbin [a Taoist immortal], and the female reporters quickly took notes.

The movement to establish the capital in Beiping is unfolding enthusiastically in the assembly, and it has become as fierce as a blaze. Li Hongwen, a representative from the Shanxi region, and Wu Yanhuan, a representative from the Hebei region, both gave brilliant speeches on the morning of the 4th. When Li spoke of preventing unfavorable factors in steel production, he said: "If the government had been in Beiping during the 'September 18th' Incident, the Northeast Army would never have retreated into the pass without authorization, and the Japanese would not have dared to go deep so easily. Perhaps the incident would not have even happened." Wu then issued a statement regarding some rumors made by certain people about the representatives who advocate establishing the capital in Beiping: "The first rumor is that Northerners advocate establishing the capital in Beiping out of narrow localism. I am from Lugouqiao. Why don't I advocate establishing the capital in Lugouqiao, and call it 'promoting the holy land of war,' etc.? We are Chinese citizens and make this suggestion for national defense. The second rumor is that we Northerners are selfish and self-interested. May I ask: if no one dares to say that the world has achieved lasting peace, who would be willing to have an atomic bomb dropped on their doorstep? The third rumor is that a small newspaper in Nanjing said that our Northern representatives received millions of dollars in bribes, so they advocate establishing the capital in Beiping. This is even more laughable. In short, our suggestion is entirely for the safety of the country and the interests of the nation, and we can swear to Heaven."

Zhou Xing, a representative from Beiping, said to the group of reporters next to him: "In foreign countries, there has never been a problem of the national capital. Now we have one, and two factions have formed. If this problem is not resolved, there will inevitably be conflicts and estrangement in the minds and emotions of our Southern and Northern compatriots, which will be of no benefit to the future of the country. I come from Beiping, and the population of Beiping is really too large. If the government moves there, prices will inevitably rise sharply, and the livelihood of the citizens will be even more difficult. I also believe that if Beiping continues to develop culturally and is not tainted by political struggles, it will definitely have an unparalleled and glorious future. But now is not the time to be selfish. Everyone must prioritize the safety of the country, or else I fear there will be a day of 'partial peace.'"

Statements advocating establishing the capital in Beiping have appeared one after another in the assembly, but the faction advocating establishing the capital in Nanjing has remained silent. This is just like the phenomenon that few people who participated in the constitutional draft review committee spoke. Some say that they may be observing the opinion of the highest authority. But our helmsman, Chairman Chiang of the National Government, Representative Chiang Kai-shek of the assembly, has not attended the assembly for four or five days. The issue of establishing the capital is still a mystery. Many people speculate that the result will be to abolish Article 7, and the status of the national capital will not be rigidly stipulated in the constitution. But what about the situation in the North?

Ruan Yicheng, a representative from Zhejiang, requested leave to return to Hangzhou to handle the county magistrate examination held in Zhejiang Province. He has now completed his official duties and returned to the capital to continue attending the assembly. According to his conversation with our reporter: "The constitutional amendment is indeed better than the May 5th Constitution, especially regarding the powers of the central and local governments, and the provincial and county system, which are not as good in the May 5th Constitution. The May 5th Constitution and the Five-Power Constitution are two different things. Disagreeing with the May 5th Constitution cannot be said to be a violation of the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. However, the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly in the constitutional amendment still needs to be considered. The presidential system has its shortcomings, but the speakers of the Legislative Yuan can threaten the president with the National Assembly at any time, which is not a way to seek long-term stability and peace. Perhaps the members of the Legislative Yuan should be elected by the National Assembly, or the members of the Legislative Yuan and the representatives of the National Assembly should be elected by universal suffrage, but they should not hold both positions, which would be more appropriate. As for the issue of the national capital, it is best not to stipulate it in the constitution. If it is clearly designated as Nanjing, it means that there will be no more consideration of any other location, which will disappoint the people of the North; if it is clearly designated as Beiping, then the capital must be moved as soon as the constitution is promulgated, otherwise it will be a violation of the constitution, which is also not allowed by human and financial resources in a short period of time."

Chen Lifu is always a news figure. He did not attend on the afternoon of the 3rd, which was noticed. He attended on the morning of the 4th, and was surrounded by news reporters again. After the meeting adjourned at twelve o'clock, he was crowded from the venue to the gate, and it was difficult to get away.

Wang Yunwu used scientific management methods to control the venue and handled it properly. The atmosphere of the meeting was always calm.

The Ministry of National Defense distributed exquisitely made huge books, "The Great Chairman Chiang," to the representatives at the assembly. During the break, because refreshments had been cancelled, nine out of ten people spent their time on "The Great Chairman Chiang."

It is said that the price of each exquisitely printed copy of [The Great Chairman Chiang] is 66,000 yuan. A representative lost it as soon as he walked out the door.

Xu Chuanlin, an elder of the Democratic Socialist Party, spoke in a Cantonese accent. Few people could understand him. The news reporters all stretched their ears, but still gained little. Yesterday, there was a item in our newspaper's anecdotes about Wu Jingxiong submitting written opinions, which was actually a mistake for Wu 初. This Wu is not that Wu, and is hereby corrected.

### British Hong Kong Troops Kill Compatriots Across the Border: We Lodged a Strong Protest; Britain Expressed Apologies and Took Full Responsibility

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] Guo Qihua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, lodged a strong oral protest to the Hong Kong authorities on the night of the 3rd regarding the case of British troops killing our farmers on the border. Commander Festing of the Hong Kong Garrison has made an oral apology to Guo, saying: The soldier has been detained and will be severely punished. At the same time, he said: The British side is preparing to compensate the families of the deceased. Guo dispatched personnel to Shenzhen on the 4th to conduct an on-site investigation of the truth of the case for further negotiations. A spokesman for the Hong Kong Garrison Command said tonight: The department will not issue any statement. Although the incident had long been confirmed by the border police, the spokesman did not confirm or deny the incident at this moment.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] The Hong Kong British Army Headquarters announced on the 4th that on the 3rd, a soldier of the British border guards in the New Territories of Kowloon fired a "303" bullet, and the investigation confirmed that it was a misfire. According to a report from the Chinese authorities, the bullet killed a Chinese civilian standing on the Chinese side of the border. The incident is currently under investigation by the military authorities. At the same time, the British military authorities take full responsibility for the death of the deceased and express their deep apologies.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 4th] The British soldier who shot and wounded a Chinese national within the Chinese border yesterday on the Hong Kong-China border has been arrested by the British Command. The British side has set up a court of inquiry to investigate the case. After the incident, the British side wanted to treat the wounded Chinese, but was rejected by Chinese onlookers. The wounded person died soon after.

[Our reporter, Guangzhou, 4th] Regarding the case of British troops killing our residents near Shenzhen on the border between Guangdong and Hong Kong, our reporter took a car to the local area for investigation and learned the following details:

At 2 p.m. on the 3rd, two Chinese children over ten years old were walking along the highway on the Sino-British border and entered Shenzhen on the Chinese side of the Sino-British border crossing at the Man Kam To wooden bridge. They happened to be seen by British troops patrolling the British bridgehead, who crossed the bridge into the Chinese territory and beat the two children. Fortunately, Lu, a police officer of the local Bao'an County Police, witnessed it and stopped them. This caused a dispute. At that time, more and more villagers gathered, and the public was outraged. The British troops were even more furious and said, "One hundred yards of the British border is British territory!" They then entered the bridgehead fortress, set up machine guns, and fired at the Chinese territory. The people fled in all directions. One person was too slow to escape and was shot dead on the spot. The bullet entered from the corner of the forehead and exited from the back of the head. The death was extremely tragic. The deceased was named Zhang Tianxiang, 29 years old, a resident of the 9th Bao of Shenzhen, who made a living as a peddler. He had an elderly mother, younger brother, and younger sister. After the incident, Lu Shen, the company commander of the local Garrison Regiment, immediately dispatched a team to set up哨 posts along the river for alert after hearing the news, and met with Lin Wannian, the chief of the Shenzhen Police Station, and the British military captain. However, the captain actually said that the deceased was shot with a .45 caliber bullet, while the British troops used a .33 caliber bullet, so the bullet was not fired by the British troops. Commander Lu immediately refuted this, and the customs officer of the Shenzhen Kowloon Branch also testified to the British troops' murder across the border. The captain was speechless. Afterwards, the people from all walks of life in Shenzhen held a joint meeting and sent representatives Zheng Qichang (section chief of the county government) and Wen Xuhua (secretary of the county council) to Hong Kong to visit Guo Dehua, our Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, and reported to the Governor's Office in Guangdong. Furthermore, Guo Dehua visited the Governor of Hong Kong and Garrison Commander General Festing late that night. According to the reply, the soldier did not receive an order to fire at that time, and it was only a misfire. Also, the Hong Kong border is now under curfew at night, traffic is cut off, and the Kowloon-Canton Railway has also suspended operations.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hopes the British Side Will Seek a Fair Resolution to the Case of Beating a Hawker to Death

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The case of the British Indian police officer beating hawker Wang Shuixiang to death in Hong Kong has not yet been resolved, and the people of Guangdong Province are outraged. It is recently learned that Vice Minister Gan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently told the British side that our government attaches great importance to this case and hopes it will be resolved quickly and fairly to appease the public. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent several telegrams to the Office of the Special Commissioner for Guangdong and Guangxi in Hong Kong, instructing it to make serious representations to the Governor of Hong Kong on the spot, so as to ensure that the murderer does not escape the law and that the deceased receives compensation. At the same time, the ministry is consulting with the local officials of Guangdong Province to persuade the people to avoid excessive actions.

### Religious "Liquidation"—Congratulations to the 12th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China

The 12th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China opened in Shanghai yesterday. Our Chairman, despite being preoccupied with numerous affairs, specially issued a congratulatory telegram, in which he said:

"Our country has suffered greatly from this war, and social morality has been severely damaged. Spiritual construction is particularly important. It is hoped that you will embody the spirit of Christ to save the world and save people, promote the truth, awaken society, revitalize the hearts of the decadent and apathetic, and establish a spirit of progress and positivity. The establishment of a new China relies on this." It can be seen that our Chairman has high expectations for the council. It is reported that the 12th Annual Meeting of the Christian Council of China is a grand gathering that has not been held for nine years since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Now that the mountains and rivers have been restored and order has not yet been restored, representatives from all over have gathered together. In addition to promoting the development of church affairs, it is deeply believed that at this time, there will be many emotions. Our Chairman said in his telegram: "Promote the truth, awaken society, counter the hearts of the decadent and apathetic, and establish a spirit of progress and positivity." It is deeply believed that the representatives participating in this Christian Council will repeatedly contemplate these words and gain something from them. Therefore, the convening of this annual meeting of the National Christian Council is not only conducive to the development of Christian affairs, but also conducive to national construction. We hereby express our congratulations on the convening of this conference.

Just as the National Christian Council of China is convening, we have also read in the newspapers about the so-called religious "liquidation" and the so-called "emancipation" movement. According to a dispatch from New York on the 3rd by the Central News Agency, New York Times reporter Li Bowen sent a message from Xuzhou, reporting on the Chinese Communist Party's abuse of Bishop Cai Fasi of the Catholic Church in Daming. It is said that the 53-year-old bishop was expelled from Daming and came to Xuzhou after the CCP occupied Daming. Cai Fasi was subjected to liquidation and interrogation. After being severely beaten during the interrogation by the CCP, he was convicted and fined 30 tons of grain and 47 million yuan in anti-Japanese currency. When Bishop Cai stated that he was unable to pay the fine, the Communist Party confiscated the church and all the furniture and livestock, and confiscated 33 acres of land. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Xi'an on the 3rd by the Central News Agency, the Communist Party recently carried out a vigorous "emancipation" movement in the Sanbian area of northern Shaanxi, forcing the Catholic churches in Wei Zi, Shanqiaopan, Baini井, Heilangwan and other places to hand over church property, and pursuing the annual rent grain and Chinese priests from the church since 1935. Because they could not bear the pressure, they fled one after another. Some were detained by the Communist Party in Sanbian and were subjected to abuse. The transmission of these reports, just as the National Christian Council of China is convening, cannot help but make us feel a lot.

First, the birth of Christ brought new life to mankind. What he left to mankind was the establishment of the Holy Church and the Holy Sacrifice; because of the establishment of the Holy Sacrifice, mankind can approach and integrate with Jesus every day. He only founded one church, but today we see more than a hundred kinds of churches. There is the so-called "Protestant Church" and the so-called "Catholic Church". We know that when Jesus was alive, he did not establish a religion, but only founded a church; the so-called "Catholic Church" should refer to the ancient Jewish religion worshiped by the Jews. All these divergent phenomena make outsiders feel confused. Now that the Christian Council of China is convening in Shanghai, although it can only represent the various denominations of the so-called "Protestant Church", in view of the current situation, it seems unreasonable that those who believe in Christ have dispersed their strength. Therefore, we hope that they can cooperate with each other. This issue of cooperation does not involve faith. Faith is originally free and does not have to be the same; but strength cannot be dispersed. This is a time to focus on construction from the ruins of war, and it is especially important to unite. During the war, the United Kingdom had a so-called "Sword of the Spirit" movement, uniting all the old and new factions under the same banner. The United Christian Relief Fund in America also does not have sectarian differences. Because of the convening of this annual meeting of the National Christian Council of China, we hope that they can have further unity to concentrate their strength on the construction of the new China.

Second, the news transmitted by the Central News Agency is likely to be accurate. The CCP calls for democracy and freedom, but there is absolutely no religious freedom in the CCP's areas. The transmission of this news should strengthen some of our beliefs: First, that communism and religion are two opposing forces, and we must not mislead ourselves and swallow the poison coated with sugar. Second, in order to ensure their religious freedom, those who believe in religion must place their hope on the full realization of the Three Principles of the People. Only under the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People for national construction can they ensure their religious freedom. Now our Chairman and the late Premier were devout Christian believers, not to mention that the Three Principles of the People itself contains a strong Christian spirit. For the benefit of the church itself, the Christian Church should be integrated with the Three Principles of the People. The full realization of the Three Principles of the People is the full realization of the Christian spirit. Therefore, in the religious field, Christian believers should of course embody the teachings created by Christ and strive to practice them. In the political field, Christian believers should study the Three Principles of the People, which are the foundation of the country, and become comrades of the Three Principles of the People.

Third, in the cultural field, up to now, the influence of Christianity on our country's ideology and culture is not very significant, and all the influences may not be entirely hygienic for our country's ideology and culture. Superficial Westernization is harmful to the healthy development of our country's ideology and culture. What we want to absorb is the essence of Western civilization centered on Christianity, not its dross. The eastward spread of Buddhism has had a great impact on our ideology and culture, and its influence has not diminished to this day. However, Christianity has not been integrated with the Chinese people to this day. How to make Christianity deeply rooted in the soil of China should be the work that Christianity in China urgently needs to promote in the future. The National Christian Council of China is now convening in Shanghai, and it is deeply believed that there will be careful consideration of this aspect. In the future, if our country's national culture can generate a new force and new brilliance due to the role of Christianity, it is hoped that this will be the case with the convening of the current National Christian Council of China. The so-called "revitalizing the hearts of the decadent and apathetic, and establishing a spirit of progress and positivity," is it here?

According to reports, in the summer of 1944, our army held the city against the enemy for 47 days, and more than 300,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, making it one of the most glorious and tragic pages of the War of Resistance. Commentators have called it the "Stalingrad" of China.

### Eastern Hebei Awaits Pacification

Communist Army Occupies Xinglong Mountains

[Our Newspaper Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Although the county towns and transportation lines in eastern Hebei have been recovered, the people are still suffering, and most areas have not yet escaped the communist army's harassment and await pacification. Some strongholds still see repeated seesaw battles.

Shangguan Yunxiang, the commander of the 11th War Zone, recently went to the Xinglong Mountains to preside over the pacification work.

### Communist Army Establishes Banks Everywhere in the Northeast, Indiscriminately Issues Banknotes

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 4th] Reporters have confirmed from various sources in the past month that since the communist army infiltrated the Northeast, it has established Northeast, Jijiang, Jihei, and Jilin banks everywhere, illegally printing banknotes, forcibly stipulating that the ratio with the puppet Manchu currency is one to one, and making every effort to exchange puppet Manchu currency for Northeast Bank notes. After the communist army absorbed a large amount of puppet Manchu currency, it secretly carried it to the National Army's recovered areas, or exchanged it for Northeast Nine Provinces circulating notes, or extracted the most materials. This kind of conspiracy is the same as the vile trick used by the Japanese invaders to exchange legal tender for foreign exchange stabilization funds with puppet Central Reserve Bank notes in the early days of the War of Resistance.

### Verdict in the Chongqing Labor Association Case

### Urgent Relief Provided in Northeastern Anhui, A Batch of Disaster Victims to Be Resettled, Popularly Elected Township Chiefs in the Province Must Be Completed by the Deadline

[Our Newspaper Hefei Dispatch, 4th] This reporter recently interviewed Su Xinmin, Secretary-General of the Anhui Provincial Government, who told me about the relief and food administration situation in northeastern Anhui. This year, 24 counties in northeastern Anhui have suffered from floods and banditry, and the situation is very serious. The provincial government has provided relief in many ways. Recently, the central government allocated 500 million yuan as urgent relief. The provincial government allocated 400 million yuan according to the severity of the disaster in each county. Because the floods were the most severe, the allocation principle was 65% for floods, 25% for banditry, and 10% for famine. The relief funds were allocated to the disaster-stricken counties, and the county governments distributed them to the elderly, weak, women, children, and the extremely poor who had no food and clothing. In addition, the central government has allocated 250 million yuan to provide relief to five counties (all belonging to the pacification zone): Tianchang, Xuyi, Wuhe, Sixian, and Lingbi. Currently, Fan Ren, Director of the Social Affairs Department, is participating in the handling in Bengbu. Therefore, in the 400 million yuan of relief funds, the flood allocation for the above five counties will be waived in order to seek fairness. The remaining 100 million yuan is because some disaster victims in northeastern Anhui have gone to the capital to petition for relief. It is now planned to move this batch of disaster victims to Chengyao Lake in Tongcheng County for reclamation, for the purpose of building houses and settling down. The Anhui Relief Sub-Office will provide transportation and distribute flour, which has the meaning of providing relief through work and is also a long-term living plan for the disaster victims. Otherwise, even if a shocking amount of money is given at once, it will eventually be eaten and used up. As for food administration, Anhui Province borrowed a total of 4.4 million shi this year, and 2.09 million shi should be handed over to the central government. The central government repeatedly telegraphed that it must be paid in full by the end of the year. Director Yang of the Food Department of the central government also came to the province to urge payment. However, the southwest and southern parts of the province are mostly mountainous areas with little grain production, while northeastern Anhui has been exempted from borrowing due to floods and banditry by order of the central government. The central Anhui area has a higher output but has been occupied by the enemy for the longest time. Although more than a year has passed since the victory, the trauma of the people is still deep, and the work of collecting in kind is very difficult. In order to fulfill the mission entrusted by the central government, and at the same time to consider the people's difficulties, the provincial government has ordered the counties to use a portion of the 50% of the grain that the county should get to pay the central government first to meet urgent needs. However, the central government must collect the full amount as scheduled, and in fact, due to disasters in various places, it is difficult to collect this amount in full, which is still a difficult problem.

[Our Newspaper Hefei News] The provincial government issued a notice to all counties in the province some time ago, implementing popular elections for township chiefs and deputy chiefs, and designated Fuyang, Liu'an, and Tongcheng counties as demonstration areas for popular elections. Currently, the popular elections for township chiefs and deputies in Fuyang and Liu'an counties have been reported to the province for completion. Other counties are mostly in progress. The provincial government has recently issued another notice to all counties in the province, stipulating that popular elections must be completed by the end of the year. However, the newly recovered counties in northeastern Anhui will postpone the elections until next year.

### Suppression and Elimination of Bandits in the Yangcheng Area Approaching Completion, Self-Defense Capabilities of Each County Enhanced, More Than 3,000 Bandits Captured Alive Since February

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Colonel Liu Nongjun, Chief of Staff of the Paratrooper Headquarters and Commander of the Yangcheng Area Suppression and Elimination, received this reporter on the 4th and issued the following conclusion on the suppression and elimination situation in the past two months: The Yangcheng Area began suppression and elimination in mid-September and has lasted for more than two months. The area east of the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway and the Suzhou-Jiading Highway in the jurisdiction, as well as the entire territory of the three counties of Kunshan, Taicang, and Yushan, can be said to have completely eliminated the atmosphere of banditry. Therefore, it is preparing to gradually end the suppression and elimination mission, because the strengthening of the self-defense military force in each county in the second phase of the plan, this headquarters believes, has been effectively achieved. The trained self-defense team members include 283 in Suzhou, 195 in Kunshan, 165 in Taicang, 692 in Jiading, 700 in Baoshan, 985 in Changshu, and 459 in the Suzhou-Wuxi border area, totaling 3,499 people, which is sufficient to take responsibility for defending the local area and preventing bandits. The household registration and water conservancy of each county have also been completely reorganized. As for road transportation, much has been repaired, including the section of the Jinghu Highway from Taicang to Wuxi, the middle section of the Kun-Tai County Road, the various sections of the Liuzhou-Baiyuan-Kou-Zhitang Triangle Area, and the entire line from Changshu to Jiangyin. It can now pass smoothly, which is very beneficial to military transportation. Statistics show that about 3,000 bandits have been captured alive in the past two months, and more than 100 various types of firearms, including machine guns, rifles, and pistols, have been seized. Therefore, there should be no problem with public security in the Yangcheng Area in the future.

### Wujin Distributes 10,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth

Two Zhang Per Government Employee, One Bolt Per Bao for All County Residents

[Our Newspaper Wujin News] The former China Japan Trade Federation stored 10,500 bolts of cotton cloth in the Minfeng and Dacheng factories in this county. The 8th Valuation Committee meeting of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau Changzhou Office decided to allocate 7,000 bolts fairly to the county residents and 3,000 bolts to the county's government employees and teachers. Each person is limited to purchasing two zhang, with a price of 300 yuan per foot. The County Party Department, the County Government, the Youth Army Corps, the Provisional Council, and the County Chamber of Commerce were designated to jointly discuss the distribution methods: (1) 3,000 bolts of cloth should be distributed to government employees and teachers and sold through the Urban Consumers' Cooperative. Each agency, school, and team should prepare a roster in advance and purchase the goods in bulk from the cooperative with funds prepared by the supervisor. (2) In addition to the original price, an additional 100 yuan will be added for transportation and handling fees for each two zhang of cloth purchased. (3) The 7,000 bolts purchased by the public will be based on the principle of one bolt per bao, and poor households will have priority to purchase. (4) Township offices and self-defense teams will be allocated from the surplus of public sales. Each township office will purchase one bolt, each district self-defense team will purchase six bolts, and each township self-defense team will purchase three bolts in principle.

### Former Tiantai County Magistrate Indicted for Corruption and Dereliction of Duty

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] Ding Guoming, the former magistrate of Tiantai County, was indicted for corruption and dereliction of duty during his tenure. At the end of last month, the Shaoxing District Court found the facts to be true after investigation and filed a public prosecution. In addition to Ding himself, those listed as defendants include Ding Jinhuai, the secretary who was Ding's corrupt claw during his tenure, and Ren Zihua, the chief of the county tax office. In addition, Ding Guoming instigated Dai Liansheng, the head of the investigation section of the county intelligence team, to assassinate Yu Naiheng, the chief prosecutor of the Tiantai District Court, because he repeatedly arrested his claws and brought them to justice, firing two shots and narrowly escaping the attack. This spring, when the Zhejiang Higher Court sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, Ding Guoming was worried and abandoned his post and fled in the dead of night. Chen Peidong and Dai Liansheng, who were related to the assassination case, were eventually arrested and sentenced to death by the Tiantai Court.

### Repairing the Wolf Mountain Temple

[Our Nantong Dispatch] The five Purple Wolf Mountains stand tall along the riverbank, shielding Tong City. Across the river, they face Yu County's Fortune Mountain, forming a natural barrier for river defense. The Wolf Mountain Temple is a scenic wonder, with the sounds of bells and drums echoing, making it a well-known scenic area in Northern Jiangsu. The White Robe Nunnery on the mountainside, built during the Tang Dynasty, is one of the famous ancient temples. Located on the southern slope of the mountain, it boasts the Tower of Sea View, particularly magnificent. The structure is exquisite, offering a panoramic view of the river and sky. Tourists from both sides of the Yangtze River flocked to visit, their carriages and hats intermingling, undeterred by the heat. Since the Anti-Japanese War, it had suffered from enemy and puppet forces' trampling, falling into disrepair. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), a fire broke out unexpectedly, destroying over ten rooms. Towers, pavilions, and refined chambers were reduced to ashes. As this temple is crucial to the scenic spots of the mountains, how could its decline be tolerated? Therefore, the Nantong branch of the Buddhist Association had long considered renovating it. However, due to years of dwindling incense offerings, they lacked the means to finance the construction. Recently, the Nantong Reconstruction Committee resolved to reorganize the temples and the Wolf Mountain scenic area. Thus, the temple's renovation became an urgent matter. Zhi Liang, the chairman of the Buddhist Association, sold ancestral farmlands to fund the repairs, hoping to restore the local landmark.

### Special District Office Established for Chongming and Shengsi Islands, Under Direct Command and Jurisdiction of the Provincial Government

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Provincial Government passed the following resolutions at its 72nd regular meeting on the 3rd: (1) If Ru Gao County Magistrate Xie Wencen is transferred to the province, Jian Dichu will serve as acting magistrate. (2) Sun Yunda is appointed as acting district chief of the Shengsi Direct-Controlled District.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] According to Provincial Government Secretary-General Chen, the significance of establishing the Shengsi Special District Office is as follows: Recently, the Provincial Government established a Special District Office for the Shengsi Islands, which belong to the 5th District of Chongming County, under the direct command and jurisdiction of the Provincial Government, which is of great significance. The island is over 200 li away from Chongming, making it difficult to administer by the county due to environmental conditions. Therefore, the Provincial Government has established the Shengsi Special District Office, following the example of provinces like Fujian and Jiangxi, to meet practical needs. The abundant fish production there makes it the premier fishing market in Southeast China. During the fishing season, the number of fishing boats and the population often increase dramatically to over 300,000, leading to a prosperous economy. However, if the political administration there is poor, it can easily be controlled by local bullies and landlords, greatly affecting public security. Given the current situation, the area has strong economic conditions. If managed properly, its future development is limitless.

[Our Nantong Dispatch] Ru Gao County Magistrate Xie Wencen was ordered by the province to take on another position. Jian Dichu has been appointed to replace him. Mr. Jian is currently the director of the Confidential Office of the First Pacification Headquarters. It is said that he will assume his post in Ru Gao as soon as he completes the handover within the headquarters.

### Jiangsu High Court Will Not Move to Zhenjiang; Four Measures for the Aftermath of the Suzhou Jailbreak

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 4th] Sun Honglin, the president of the Jiangsu High Court, recently returned to Suzhou after inspecting the judiciary in Northern Jiangsu. Hearing this news, our reporter paid him a special visit to inquire about the potential relocation of the High Court to Zhenjiang and his impressions from the inspection. Although Mr. Sun was covered in dust from his week-long journey, he was in high spirits. In a clear and cheerful tone, he exchanged greetings with the reporter and solemnly denied any plans to relocate the High Court to Zhenjiang, stating: The buildings currently under construction in Zhenjiang are for the use of a branch of the High Court. If the main court were to move, it would be necessary to build a large number of additional structures, which the court simply does not have the financial resources for. Reports in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai stating otherwise are unlikely to be confirmed within the next two or three years. As for his impressions from the inspection, he only visited Jiangdu and Taixian in Northern Jiangsu due to pressing matters at the court. In terms of the judiciary, the local areas are becoming increasingly prosperous, leading to a growing number of lawsuits. The staff members are also working diligently. However, the number of inmates is increasing daily, and the detention centers are inadequate and in need of repair. Plans are currently underway to add some new facilities. Generally speaking, Taixian is better than Jiangdu. The city is clean and tidy, the roads in the suburbs are smooth, and the communication network is sound. All aspects are well-coordinated with the judiciary, which is particularly gratifying. Chief Judge Han is currently still in Taixian, preparing to inspect Nantong next week, at which time I also plan to visit and then return to Suzhou together. When asked about the handling of the aftermath of the jailbreak at the Wudi District Detention Center, he replied: The court has decided on four points: (1) Continue to pursue the escaped prisoners, (2) Strengthen security at the detention center to prevent future incidents, (3) Build new prisons, (4) Transfer administrative responsibility to the Ministry of Justice for review.

County Magistrate Ding Jishi of the Provincial Government stated that after eight years of war, the province's construction was completely destroyed, the rural economy was bankrupt, and the people's livelihoods were in decline.

### Hai Area's Great Plains Suitable for Agricultural Machinery

Wu Peijun Requests the Ministry of Agriculture to Establish a Factory Locally

[Our City Dispatch] Wu Peijun, a native of the Hai area in Jiangsu, believes that the Hai area's great plains are suitable for the application of agricultural machinery. He recently submitted a request to Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, asking for permission to establish a manufacturing plant in a convenient location in Lianyungang City to innovate both the salt and agricultural industries. The original text of Wu's request to Minister Zhou is as follows:

"I have investigated that the Hai area, encompassing the four counties of Guanyun, Donghai, Muyang, and Ganyu, is the largest plain in Northern Jiangsu. With no lakes or marshes and few hills, the terrain is vast and boundless. In ancient times, the Hai area was known as a major agricultural region and a granary for wheat and beans, which is no exaggeration. At a time when the development of Northern Jiangsu is being highly touted, if new types of machinery can be used for farming, not only will the existing cultivated land in the Hai area increase production several times, but also the thousands of acres of salt flats along the coast can be deeply ploughed and drained of brine. Within three years, they will surely be transformed into fertile land, and there is even the possibility of creating a cotton production center. Therefore, I believe that the Hai area's great plains are the most suitable experimental area for agricultural machinery in Northern Jiangsu. I recently heard that your ministry, entrusted by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), is establishing a general agricultural machinery manufacturing plant in Shanghai and fourteen branch plants in other important regions. This is the beginning of agricultural innovation and development, breaking the thousands-year-old agricultural tradition of China, and I am delighted and celebrating this grand plan. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, farmers in the Hai area fled their homes, and most of their farming tools were destroyed. Unfortunately, this year they also suffered from the breach of the Mu River, which caused further destruction. Therefore, I earnestly request that your ministry establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing branch plant in Lianyungang City in the coastal area. In addition to the various reasons mentioned above, the objective conditions are also very favorable: (1) The city is the center of the border area between the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan. Using it as the starting point for transporting manufactured agricultural tools is a shortcut. (2) It is not far from Shanghai, and it is easy to import the raw materials needed for manufacturing agricultural tools by boat. (3) The four salt farms of Taiping, Zhongzheng, Linxing, and Jinan under the jurisdiction of Huaibei are connected to the city, and their pool water pumping machines need to be replenished. Considering both aspects, simultaneous manufacturing would be a win-win solution, and it would also be a surefire way to reduce costs, balance salt prices, and align them with the salt prices of Changlu."

Letter to the World Education and Culture Conference

Subject: Proposal that the World Charter should explicitly stipulate: "The state bears full responsibility for the care, education, and elderly care of its citizens; and its purpose should be purely out of universal love, equality, mutual assistance, peace, and the ideal of a world for all, promoting the advancement of humanity."

Throughout history, the educational opportunities of citizens of all countries have been subject to complex and divergent differences based on their family circumstances, their parents' abilities, and their personal experiences. This has made it impossible to achieve universal equality and to provide education to all. As a result, countless talents have been buried, the rate of progress has been hampered, and human happiness has been diminished, to an extent that cannot be quantified. This unavoidable reality is a matter of deep concern for all enlightened individuals around the world and is considered the most painful and pitiful.

I believe that as long as there are still national organizations in the world, it is pointless to discuss "education, culture, and science issues." If we are to discuss this issue, then "the state is the parent of all men and women in the country, and all men and women in the country are the children of the state." The important conditions for caring for infants and educating young people worldwide to achieve the ideal of a world for all are "providing for the young" and "employing the strong"... These noblest, greatest, and most reasonable ideals of human society should be the full responsibility of each country. They should not be entrusted to families with complex circumstances, parents with limited abilities, or unpredictable experiences. This leads to countless excellent and healthy infants and young people being deprived of "care" and "education," being frustrated, broken, becoming unproductive, injured, or dying young, causing immeasurable losses to human society worldwide. This situation has existed since ancient times, but it has become particularly evident in the 20th century, with the convenience of transportation, the development of commerce and industry, and people's drunken obsession with capitalism and the "powerful delusion" of aggression. This has led to two world wars in thirty years and several small-scale wars between nations and ethnic groups in fifty years, causing excessive destruction and an extreme polarization of wealth. Just look at the powerless families and parents around the world. They are already struggling to save lives, let alone being able to use reasonable and healthy methods to "care for and educate" their children! They can only resign themselves to fate, letting them live and die on their own, with no recourse! What a pity?! What a pity?! Enough! This stark reality is a matter of deep concern for all enlightened individuals around the world and is considered the most painful and pitiful.

Indeed, modern nations around the world all regard "caring for citizens" and "educating citizens" as important national policies. Various institutions such as infant care centers and nurseries have sprung up in response. However, the majority are still localized and have failed to achieve universal coverage. Even for early childhood education and compulsory education, while free provisions are often in place, secondary education, vocational education, and university education, while also having provisions for some or all public funding, are all fragmented and incomplete. Furthermore, in the current stage where the private property system has not been eradicated, the principle of people's livelihood has not been realized, and the social economy is still developing abnormally, without methods to ensure that male and female infants and young people can enjoy "equal care" and "equal education," these fragmented and incomplete measures will have no real and thorough benefits. Moreover, the motivations of various countries in vigorously "caring for" and "educating" their citizens have not yet reached the "Great Harmony ideal" of purely stemming from universal love, equality, mutual assistance, peace, and a world for all, promoting the advancement of humanity. They still inevitably have many ethnic groups and nations that, in order to fulfill their "powerful delusions," use young people as strong tools for "aggression" and "self-defense," exhibiting the selfish and narrow-minded "small prosperity thinking" that hinders human progress.

I believe that in a reasonable human society, human nation, human world, male and female infants should be "cared for by society," "cared for by the nation," and "cared for by the world" from birth. From the ages of four to twenty-four, this period should be covered by "education by society," "education by the nation," and "education by the world."

I believe that infants receiving care from reasonable and healthy health institutions is a "right that they should enjoy" in a reasonable human society, human nation, and human world. It should not be entrusted to parents without health knowledge or sufficient abilities, leading to malnutrition or improper hygiene, resulting in them being unhealthy or dying young. Similarly, young men and women receiving education from reasonable educational institutions is also a "right that they should enjoy," rather than what is commonly referred to today as "compulsory education."

The duration of my proposed "right to care" and "right to education" should be at least twenty-four years. During these twenty-four years, the great tasks of "managing," "educating," "nurturing," and "protecting health" should be fully the responsibility of the state, "caring for" and "educating" them into healthy and useful talents. After the age of twenty-five, until the age of sixty, these thirty-five years should be dedicated to serving the advancement of humanity. Our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen said, "Life is for service." This refers to these thirty-five years of strong knowledge, ability, and physique. After the age of sixty, as mental and physical strength gradually declines, one should enjoy the "right to elderly care." At this time, "the elderly are the parents, and the world, society, and nation are the children."

I believe that only with "rights and obligations that are equally balanced" can we achieve the Great Harmony society, the Great Harmony nation, and the Great Harmony world. Only a reasonable and healthy society, nation, and world can endure and remain eternally new.

Originally, humans are born with the "rights to care, education, and elderly care." However, in the past, these obligations were borne by uneven and unhealthy families and parents and children. Now, my proposal is that these obligations should be borne by a uniform and healthy state. Although, the state directly bears these obligations, indirectly they are borne by society and the world. Therefore, I believe that this proposal should be directly suggested to the nation and indirectly suggested to society and the world.

Finally, I believe that: "A reasonable human society, human nation, and human world can only realize truly equal "rights and obligations" in this way. Only a truly reasonable "human society, human nation, and human world" can achieve lasting peace and reasonable progress. (Wu Yourong, Taiwan)

### US Policy Towards Spain Adheres to Non-Intervention Principle; Opposes Coercive Actions, Conflicts with French and Soviet Views

[Reuters, New York, 2nd] US Representative Connally declared in the UN Political Committee today that the US resolution on Spain proposed yesterday aims to restore a democratic government in that country and does not suggest intervention. Connally pointed out: (1) The US opposes Franco and welcomes democratic reforms in that country that protect human rights and freedoms. (2) If the Franco regime threatens international peace and security, the US is willing to participate in any necessary sanctions actions in accordance with the Charter. (3) Before the occurrence of the aforementioned state, the US opposes coercive actions by the United Nations such as severing diplomatic relations, as these actions could promote Franco's unity of the domestic people against the outside world or promote the outbreak of a civil war in Spain, plunging its people into suffering. (4) The US will continue to oppose the participation of the Franco regime in the United Nations agencies and the international organizations initiated by these agencies. (5) Finally, the United States believes that the Spanish people should determine their fate. Connally stressed that the United States fully adheres to the principle of non-intervention, which is the basic point of American foreign policy, and said that the resolution he proposed yesterday does not conflict with this principle.

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] The UN Political Committee discussed the Spanish issue today for more than six hours and then adjourned until the 4th to continue. Britain and the United States did not approve of the United Nations taking direct coercive action against Franco's Spain, thus creating a sharp split with France and the Soviet bloc. France, the Soviet Union, etc. wanted all member states of the United Nations to immediately cut off relations with Franco. The United States believes that such severe action could lead to another war. British Representative Shawcross agreed with the US proposal, which demanded that Franco step down, support a provisional government, and then replace it with a freely elected government. It is said that Britain will not take any action to cause bloodshed over the issue of the Spanish government, whether it is the blood of British soldiers or the blood of Spanish people.

### Connally's Proposal Displeases Both Sides; Franco Government Protests

[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 4th] Spanish Foreign Minister Otayyer today handed a note to the US representative in Spain, protesting against the US representative Connally's proposal to prohibit Spain from participating in UN organizations, saying that this proposal offends the Spanish people. The current government of Spain was established in July 1936, in the battle to resist communist tyranny, and was bought at the cost of blood. The people of the whole country can testify to this. The current Spanish regime never participated in the Axis powers during the war. The Spanish volunteers who participated in the German army only accounted for 2% of the total number of Spanish troops. There was also an "International Division" in the Soviet army. Spain only followed its example and allowed volunteers to enlist.

[Our News] San Francisco, 4th broadcast: The exiled Prime Minister of the Spanish Republic, Gilral, and the Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, Zore, both issued warnings today, stating that if the United Nations General Assembly cannot reach a positive solution to the Spanish issue, then "direct action" should be taken to overthrow Franco.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 3rd] The President of the Provisional Government of the Spanish Republic, Li Beier, told this agency today that the US Representative Connally's proposal on Franco's Spain in the UN Political Committee appears to be very weak at first glance and does not propose any concrete plan to end the Franco regime. The Spanish Republicans cannot help but express disappointment with this attitude of the United States. As for Connally's remarks after the proposal was made, they are even more unfounded.

### Economic Unification Plan for Germany: Britain and the US to Invite France and the Soviet Union to Participate; Four Foreign Ministers to Discuss German Peace Treaty Within the Week

[Reuters, New York, 2nd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin told reporters today that the agreement between Britain and the United States to unify the economies of their respective zones in Germany could begin to alleviate the economic difficulties Britain is experiencing due to its burden in Germany. Bevin emphasized that the agreement was not aimed at any other government and was purely based on necessity. US Secretary of State Byrnes also told reporters at another location that the US is willing to enter into similar agreements with the Soviet Union or France, or to participate in a plan for economic unification. He believes that the agreement will reduce unemployment, increase food supply, and further stabilize order. Byrnes further explained that the agreement classifies German imports into two categories: (1) imports necessary to prevent disease and unrest, and (2) imports necessary to maintain a self-sufficient economic system. Foreign exchange earned from exports from the two zones will be managed by a joint agency and used primarily to pay for the second category of imports. The agreement is effective from January 1, 1947, and is limited to the economic aspects, so the political independence of the two zones will continue to be maintained. [Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] Semi-official French sources commenting on the British-American agreement to unify their occupation zones in Germany said that the agreement will not change France's position and that France has not yet agreed to include the French occupation zone in the unification. France's position on this issue remains the same as previously stated: France will defend its position during the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the future of the Ruhr area.

[United Press, New York, 4th] Diplomatic sources stated today that the Council of Foreign Ministers is currently working to finalize the peace treaties with five Axis satellite states. However, the signing of the treaties will likely be delayed until early next year due to mechanical problems in printing the final official text of the treaties. The four major powers hope to conclude the work on these five treaties within the week and then begin a preliminary study of the initial issues of the German peace treaty before the end of the week. The four foreign ministers have scheduled a meeting in Europe early next year to discuss the German issue. The signing of the five satellite states' treaties may be postponed until then. The agreement between Britain and the US on the economic unification of their occupation zones in Germany appears to have strengthened their position in negotiating with the Soviet Union and France.

### UN General Assembly to Re-discuss General Disarmament Proposal

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Both the US and Britain today advocated that the UN immediately take action to implement a global disarmament system, without the use of veto power. The British side implicitly indicated that this issue was being "obstructed" by the Soviet side. The disarmament issue was postponed for 24 hours at the request of the Soviet Union to express "very important" remarks related to disarmament.

### British and Indian Leaders Hold Individual Talks; Jinnah Still Insists on Original Position; Indian Home Minister Condemns Indian Communist Party in Speech

[Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, London, 4th] British Prime Minister Attlee met with Jinnah, leader of the Indian Muslim League, today in an attempt to break the current deadlock in India, but the outcome was not encouraging. According to well-informed sources, Jinnah clearly told Attlee that the Muslim League would never unconditionally abandon its political and religious demands. The Muslim side believes that Britain's plan for Indian independence does require the party to abandon its political and religious demands.

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: The Governor-General of India, Wavell, has made some progress in his efforts to make Nehru understand the danger of internal strife. He is trying to get Nehru to allow a provincial system, which is what the Muslim League insists on. In addition, Wavell is also putting strong pressure on the Muslim League to cooperate loyally with the Congress Party.

[Reuters, London, 4th] Today is the tenth day of the Muslim Moharram festival, a day of mourning and remembrance. Therefore, the King's banquet for Indian leaders at Buckingham Palace has been postponed to tomorrow. The Secretary of State for India, Lawrence, held private talks with Nehru and Jinnah yesterday. Nehru also had a two-hour meeting with Attlee. The Sikh representative, Singh, also went to 10 Downing Street yesterday afternoon for a preliminary broad discussion with the British Prime Minister. Nehru then went to the House of Commons, where he met Kurt Schumacher, the leader of the German Social Democratic Party who came to London at the invitation of the Labour Party, after being introduced by Labour MP Sorensen. Informal talks will continue today. It is expected that the British-Indian roundtable conference will be officially held tomorrow. [Reuters, Bombay, 4th] The Indian Interim Government's Home Minister, Patel, a member of the Congress Party, addressed a large group of workers here today, accusing Indian communists of attempting to achieve their goals through riots, strikes, and industrial sabotage. He urged workers to emulate the British Labour Party, enter the stage of workers' rule, and not be misled by the communists to engage in strikes and other behaviors, which would only harm themselves and the country.

[United Press, London, 3rd] The issue of India, independence or civil war, hangs by a thread. British Prime Minister Attlee, Secretary of State for India Lawrence, Minister of Commerce Cripps, and Minister of Defense Alexander began emergency consultations here today with Indian leaders separately. The British representatives also warned that India's large population and vast territory are essential to world peace. According to a Washington dispatch, US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson declared at a press conference that if the leaders of various factions in India can seize the opportunity to build a stable and peaceful India, it will not only benefit India but also the world.

### French National Assembly Elects Speaker Auriol; Election of Prime Minister Awaits Final Announcement

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The French National Assembly elected veteran Socialist member Auriol as Speaker with 284 votes, maintaining his record of serving three terms as Speaker. Communist candidate Cachin received 170 votes, and Radical Party candidate Van Lanonne (former Governor-General of Vietnam) received 98 votes, all losing the election. The People's Republican Movement's support for Auriol is widely regarded as an indication that the Socialists are willing to support the People's Republican Movement to assume the position of Prime Minister. This election of Speaker can also be regarded as a test of strength for the Communist Party in its competition for the leadership of the government. Auriol is a former leader of French Socialism, a student of Jaurès, and a close friend of the current Socialist Party leader Blum. He is also a member of the Socialist Party's Executive Committee.

[French Press Agency, Paris, 4th] The Socialist Party National Committee held a meeting all night last night, passing a motion supporting a Communist government led by Thorez with 3,121 votes against 845.

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 4th Broadcast: The French Communist Party hopes to lead the interim government, but is opposed by the People's Republican Movement and the right-wing Radical Socialist Party. The above two parties stated that they are unwilling to vote for Thorez as Prime Minister. When the new parliament meets this afternoon, Thorez must obtain an absolute majority of 310 votes to win the position of Prime Minister, but this seems impossible.

Also, according to a Paris broadcast on the 4th: The preliminary results of the election of Thorez as Prime Minister have been announced. He only received 259 votes out of 579, and has not yet gained the support of an absolute majority. The voting will continue tomorrow morning. Field Marshal Montgomery Leaves Athens for Rome

### Britain Requests the US to Send Troops to Greece; Field Marshal Montgomery Leaves Athens for Rome

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: Well-informed sources claim that the British side is negotiating with the US side, requesting the US to send troops to Greece, which is said to reduce Britain's burden in that area.

[French Press Agency, Athens, 4th] The British Chief of Staff, Gammell, flew to Rome this morning at 9:00 AM.

### Control of Japanese Narcotics and Corrosive Addictive Substances; We Offer Seven Recommendations

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] At today's meeting of the United Nations Narcotics Committee, the Chinese representative, Shi Siming, made seven recommendations on the control of Japanese narcotics: (1) Prohibit the manufacture or modification of narcotic raw materials. (2) Establish a narcotics warehouse in the proposed Far East Branch, or designate a location for the storage of drugs as recommended by the Committee and specified by the Economic and Social Council. (3) The UN narcotics warehouse may export drugs for medical and scientific purposes, but the quantity must not exceed the amount estimated by the supervisory authority. (4) The Japanese government should strictly control the distribution of narcotics within Japan and submit monthly reports to the UN. (5) The drug warehouse should be strictly guarded. (6) Prohibit the export of narcotics. (7) All control measures for narcotics should be subject to UN supervision. In addition, Shi recommended the establishment of a seven-member committee to study the control of narcotics in Japan and Korea.

### Rumors of Stalin's Critical Illness; Speculation Arises Again About Successor; Soviet Newspapers Heavily Promote Molotov

[United Press, Istanbul, 3rd] Local newspapers today again published news of Marshal Stalin's serious illness. According to a political visitor from Zaining who learned from reliable sources, Stalin's condition is critical, and all important Soviet figures and Stalin's closest friends are by his side. Stalin has not recovered since falling ill this spring, and his condition is now worsening. The Taisivai newspaper also reported that according to political sources in the Bulgarian capital, Stalin's condition is deteriorating, and medicine is ineffective; however, neither newspaper specified the nature of his illness. According to a prominent figure who recently returned from Moscow, Stalin's health is a taboo subject, and the newspapers are publishing photos of Foreign Minister Molotov with increasing frequency, which is quite noteworthy. A dispatch from Moscow on the 7th of last month stated that Stalin's health was good and that he was taking a vacation. This telegram was delayed for 12 days due to censorship.

Soviet newspapers are trying to select Stalin's successor, and have been heavily promoting Molotov's recent election as an honorary member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Many diplomats and others previously speculated that Molotov would not succeed Stalin as the leader of the Soviet Union, but in light of the Soviet newspapers' promotion of him as Stalin's right-hand man, their views have changed again. Stalin did not attend the October Revolution anniversary celebrations. Foreign observers believe that Stalin may retire, and are speculating about his successor. The following six people are considered the most likely: (1) Malenkov, currently 45 years old, formerly a member of the Communist Party Politburo, recently transferred from party work to administrative work in October, serving as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and is known as the "master of the art of power." His position is similar to that of Stalin when Lenin died in 1924. (2) Zhdanov, a purely party worker, formerly Stalin's representative in Leningrad, and credited with defending the city during the Battle of Leningrad. He also delivered a speech on behalf of Stalin at this year's Revolution anniversary. (3) Beria, a native of Georgia and Stalin's fellow countryman, in charge of the confidential work of developing Soviet atomic energy. (4) Andreyev, a leader of collective farms. (5) Mikoyan, Minister of Foreign Trade. (6) Kaganovich, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, a Jew. If Molotov is to be Stalin's successor, it would be unexpected.

### Lewis Appears in Court for Sentencing; Found Guilty of Contempt of Court; Lewis Defends Himself in Court; Coal Strike Unabated; Freight Transport Prohibited; Mail Also Restricted

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Lewis, with a strong attitude, is scheduled to appear in court today to hear Judge Goldsborough's sentencing for his contempt of court injunction. The severity of the punishment is at the court's discretion, and there are no legal restrictions on the imposition of any imprisonment or fines. Lewis's Mine Workers Union has also been accused of contempt of court for the strike injunction, and may face enormous financial penalties. Lewis is scheduled to reappear in court at 3:00 PM (11:00 PM Shanghai time) for sentencing. According to officials familiar with the situation, Assistant Attorney General Sonnerd's staff all support the continuation of the strike for one day, which would mean a fine of $2 million per day for the Mine Workers Union, and severe fines or imprisonment for Lewis. However, the judge is still seeking the government's opinion and asking Lewis's lawyers to make suggestions, which is not common in American courts, but not unprecedented. Before the court has ruled, Lewis's lawyers have prepared a plan to quickly appeal against the federal court's decision. Labor unions are currently supporting Lewis.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The chairman of the Mine Workers Union, Lewis, was found guilty of contempt of court today, while the coal miners' strike continued. After hearing the verdict, Lewis gave a defiant speech in court, accusing the judge of depriving coal miners of their constitutional rights, and declaring that he would maintain this position. After this dramatic scene, Judge Goldsborough pondered in the silent courtroom for about four minutes before announcing adjournment. The sentence will be announced tomorrow. According to legal regulations, a fine or imprisonment may be imposed. The government is working hard to deal with the coal miners' strike, prohibiting all freight transport except for necessities, and further reducing the mileage of railway coal-fired locomotives carrying passenger cars by 25%. The post office is also implementing strict new rules for parcels, restricting the size of parcels and prohibiting the mailing of overseas parcels from this Friday, except for those sent to US military personnel.

[French Press Agency, Washington, 3rd] Democratic Senator Johnston visited President Truman today, requesting the President to deliver a broadcast speech calling on coal miners to return to work. Democratic Senator Fuller said that the federal court's verdict on Lewis's contempt of court is not legal under American law, and may be overturned.

### General Strike Occurs in Oakland City Area

[United Press, Oakland, California, 3rd] A general strike has occurred in the Oakland city area, with a population of no less than one million. Public transportation has completely stopped, four daily newspapers have failed to publish, most stores are closed, and all factories have shut down. The strikers number 130,000. This action is a protest against the police escorting twelve trucks of goods from two major department stores through their picket line on Sunday, hence the general strike.

### Britain and France Sign Financial Agreement

[French Press Agency, London, 3rd] Britain and France signed a financial agreement today at the British Foreign Office. The French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, signed on behalf of the French government, while Sir Wilfrid Eady signed on behalf of the British side. According to the agreement, France's debt to Britain will be cleared to facilitate future trade between the two countries. The terms of the agreement were drafted by the British-French Economic Committee at a meeting held in Paris in September, and the final details were finalized by the committee in London ten days ago.

### US Under Secretary of the Treasury, Clayton, Transferred to Become Ambassador to Britain

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] President Truman announced today that he is appointing Treasury Under Secretary Clayton as the US Ambassador to Britain. Clayton, 64 years old, was born in Shelby, North Carolina, in 1882. He was elected Governor of the state in 1928, served as a member of the Anglo-American Palestine Committee in 1945, and became Under Secretary of the Treasury in February of this year. The position of US Ambassador to Britain has been vacant since the former ambassador, Harriman, was transferred to become Secretary of Commerce.

### Bretton Woods Agreement; Australian Labor Party Does Not Approve; Prime Minister Suffers First Defeat

[Reuters, Canberra, 4th] The Australian Labor Party Executive Committee decided today to submit the ratification of the Bretton Woods Agreement by Australia to the next Federal Labor Party Conference for discussion, contradicting Prime Minister Chifley's statement last month that the agreement would be ratified soon. This is Chifley's first defeat in the Labor Party Executive Committee. The next Federal Conference will not be held until the New Year at the earliest.

### White House Holds Second Banquet to Host Foreign Diplomats

[Central News Agency, Washington, 3rd] President Truman hosted a second banquet at the White House tonight to host around 30 foreign ambassadors, ministers, and chargés d'affaires. The Soviet and Indian envoys were present. Among the more than one hundred guests was a representative from Latvia, which the United States has recognized but the Soviet Union has not.

### To Cope With World Competition; Lancashire Cotton Industry to Undergo Complete Reform; Government Provides Loans to Replace Old Machinery

[French Press Agency, Manchester, 3rd] British Secretary of Commerce Cripps announced a five-year plan today to modernize and develop the cotton industry in Lancashire. According to the plan, for cotton manufacturers who want to eliminate old machinery and replace it with new machinery, the government will provide a loan of one-quarter of the cost, interest-free. This measure only applies to factories with more than 500,000 spindles. The main objective of the government's plan is to merge smaller factories to increase their efficiency. Cripps pointed out that the British cotton industry is old and cannot stand the strain. If it is not reformed, it will gradually be eliminated. In the 19th century, the cotton industry was the second largest industry in Britain, second only to the coal mining industry. At that time, the Lancashire cotton mills employed 350,000 workers, but today only 200,000 remain, and production has declined. There are many reasons for the decline in production, the main reason being outdated machinery. Most of the machinery in British textile mills is more than 50 years old, and workers find it extremely difficult to use this type of machinery. Whenever they have the opportunity, they switch to other modern industries. At the same time, since the 20th century, the development of the textile industries in other countries, especially Japan, India, and Brazil, has become a strong competitor to Britain, further highlighting Britain's backwardness. The British government's current problem is to increase production to cope with world competition. There are only two ways to increase production: to increase the number of workers or to replace machinery.

### Bank of China Plans to Build 14-Story Building in Singapore

### UNRRA to End; Meeting to Be Held Next Tuesday; Seeking to Resolve Two Most Pressing Issues; Goods Shipped to China Will Not Arrive Until Next Summer

[United Press, Washington, 4th] UNRRA will hold a meeting here next Tuesday, which will be the formal start of the end of the largest relief organization in the world. When UNRRA settles its accounts, it will try to resolve the two most pressing issues: (1) How to provide assistance to the more than ten countries facing malnutrition this winter; (2) How to provide relief to the millions of displaced people in Europe. UNRRA has played a major role. When the last shipment of goods is cleared next summer, the relief goods shipped by UNRRA will reach 22 million gross tons, worth $3,680,913,840. Of this amount, the United States donated 73%, and the rest was provided by other countries that did not directly experience aggression. On March 31, 1947, UNRRA will stop shipping supplies to Asia, but it will generally take the entire summer for the shipments to reach their destinations. The supplies shipped to China account for the largest amount, worth approximately $750 million. The transportation work has been hampered by the US seamen's strike and the congestion of Shanghai port. As of October 30, 1946, UNRRA had shipped 1,400,106 tons of supplies to China.

### Japanese People Should Give Up All Foreign Currency and Foreign Exchange

MacArthur Headquarters Issues Order

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] MacArthur Headquarters issued an order today stating that all Japanese people within Japan must give up all their foreign currency and foreign exchange, but non-Japanese nationals are not subject to this order. Before MacArthur Headquarters can handle the matter properly, it has instructed the Japanese government to dispose of all foreign currency assets in the Bank of Japan. After December 31, 1946, it will be illegal for Japanese people to possess currency or foreign exchange. The order is said to also apply to Koreans and Taiwanese.

### How Much Compensation Will Each Country Receive? It Will Depend on the Far Eastern Commission. The Japanese Are Concerned About the Fate of Their Merchant Fleet.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th Dispatch] The Central News Agency exclusively learned today: the industrial machinery that Japan will be allowed to retain may be 25% more than what Pauley suggested to President Truman in his compensation plan; the larger merchant ships allowed to be retained may be 33% more than the Pauley plan. How much compensation the Allied nations will ultimately receive from Japan depends on the decision of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington. Since February, the Commission has been constantly receiving opinions from MacArthur. Based on longer research and constantly revised statistics, MacArthur's suggestions seem more likely to become the reference for the Far Eastern Commission and its affiliated organizations when making final decisions, compared to the Pauley plan, which was based on the overall command of the Allied headquarters in the early days of the occupation. Regarding the total amount of industrial machinery and equipment Japan needs to maintain a minimum peacetime economy, MacArthur's suggested figures are higher than Pauley's; although the former's estimates for various Japanese industries differ from the latter's, on average, they are 25% higher. As for the issue of how many merchant ships will be allowed to be retained, which the Japanese government is very concerned about, MacArthur suggests allowing them to retain 2 million tons, without expressing any opinion on the navigation range of 500,000 tons of them; while the figures in the Pauley plan are similar to MacArthur's, it stipulates that all Japanese merchant ships must navigate within the Far East waters, which is the most worrying point for Japan in the Pauley plan. Although the U.S. Navy authorities, the British Empire, and the Netherlands have requested that the Allied nations seriously consider restricting Japan's navigation range for several years to come, it is understood that the United States, in principle, does not want to deprive Japan of its freedom of navigation. It is expected that this major issue will not be decided before the Japanese peace conference is held, as it is more closely related to the long-term control of the Japanese economy by the Allied nations than the current compensation plan. The tonnage of Japanese merchant ships that has been granted so far is about 1 million tons; before the war, Japan had a total of 2,730 merchant ships, or 6.3 million tons. According to MacArthur's suggestion to allow them to retain 2 million tons, Japan can establish a merchant fleet equivalent to one-third of its pre-war tonnage. Currently, among the merchant ships available to Japan, 216 are undergoing major repairs or are berthed in foreign ports, and 390 are actually in operation, of which 45 are being used to repatriate Japanese residents and prisoners of war from the Asian continent and the South Sea Islands. The three major shipbuilding companies, known as the backbone of the Japanese shipbuilding industry: Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Yamashita Kisen Kaisha, are currently still subject to the restrictions of the Allied headquarters' directive of June 6 this year. The Japanese are mostly studying the question of what kind of result the Allied nations' compensation actions will have on the future of Japanese merchant ships. It is generally believed that unless Japan is allowed to retain a reasonable number of merchant fleets and can freely navigate the world's seas, it cannot survive as a modern country.

### Tense Situation in Iran: Civil War Could Break Out at Any Moment. Prime Minister Sultan Naser Announces Postponement of General Election

[Reuters, London, 4th] British radio stations claim that a mass meeting of 50,000 people here has passed a resolution demanding that the authorities of Azerbaijan Province immediately issue a mobilization order. The radio station further stated that government troops in the city of Jinjin, near the border of Azerbaijan Province, used machine guns to strafe civilians. According to a dispatch from our Tehran office, the Azerbaijan Provincial Government has distributed weapons to workers, civil defense groups, and youth groups to defend themselves against the entry of central government troops.

[Reuters, Tehran, 4th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultannah announced tonight that the parliamentary elections scheduled for next Friday will be postponed for one day, but the elections in Azerbaijan Province will be held only after the central government troops enter. Sultannah further stated: "The Soviet newspapers and radio stations, based on false reports from Tehran's left-wing newspapers, have launched attacks on the Iranian government, which is extremely shocking. I have always aimed to seek the friendship of the Soviet Union, knowing that good relations with the Soviets are necessary for Iran."

### New Anti-Malarial Drug Is Far More Effective Than Quinine

[United Press, New York, 4th] According to news received today: a new drug used by the U.S. military during the war to prevent and treat malaria is now available for general household use. The drug was originally named "76181," and later became known as "Chloroquine." Its effectiveness is about sixteen times that of quinine, and its toxicity is lower. The drug is also better than "Atabrine," which was widely used during the war. "Chloroquine" is a synthetic compound made from coal tar, and its chemical formula is very similar to that of quinine and Atabrine. Clinical trials are currently underway to explore whether the effectiveness of this drug can be further increased.

### The Mayor Convened a Press Conference to Review the Street Vendor Incident. Attending Responsible Persons Expressed Their Opinions, Eagerly Hoping the Government Will Handle the Matter Carefully.

[Our Newspaper Report] To review the disturbances caused by the street vendor issue the other day, Mayor Wu specially convened a press conference in the city hall conference room at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, reporting the details of the incident to the responsible persons of the city's newspapers and expressing his apologies to the press. He said that because the situation at the time was too chaotic, even news reporters were innocently injured, which he deeply regretted. The improper attitude of the police at this time must be thoroughly improved. He hoped that all sectors of society could provide as much material as possible, and the municipal government would definitely do its best.

As for the uproar caused by the crackdown on street vendors, all newspapers have had detailed records. In short, this incident is not simple. Because the street vendors detained by the Huangpu Police Station were all released before 12:00 noon on November 30, and there were no cases of starvation or freezing to death. However, the violent rioters took this opportunity to spread rumors and wantonly destroy property, which is extremely infuriating. I am very grateful to the military and police at the time for obeying orders and not firing live ammunition, thus avoiding a catastrophic disaster. As for the violent use of force by a few police officers at the time, it was due to the excitement of the on-site emotions, which is also human nature.

Mayor Wu continued, hoping that the press would pay attention to two points when reporting the truth: (1) Did it really happen? - Such as freezing to death, starving to death, police officers firing guns, etc. (2) Were the innocent citizens injured by stray bullets actually shot by police officers? Because rioters did fire guns. If any citizen can provide concrete evidence to prove that they were injured by police officers firing guns, I will definitely deal with it severely.

### Street Vendors Are Forced by Livelihood Needs, and They Should Be Shown Sympathy

Wang Yunsheng of the Ta Kung Pao then spoke, saying: At the beginning of his term, Mayor Wu once stated in the first press conference that he had solutions for everything in the city, but he felt quite difficult about the street vendor issue. Because most of the street vendors are refugees from northern Jiangsu, and they are all forced by livelihood needs, they should be shown sympathy. However, the result of Mayor Wu's resolute crackdown at this time will inevitably cause a major disaster. On the day the disturbance occurred, our newspaper's reporter was insulted by police officers, which made him feel extremely angry when reporting the facts. However, I strongly urged him to exercise restraint in order to take the overall situation into consideration and to avoid stimulating the situation, so that the article avoided stimulation as much as possible. This is a misfortune for the country and a misfortune for the people. Therefore, the Ta Kung Pao's records of this incident are extremely mild, but my colleagues in this newspaper have a great deal of complaints about me because of this, and even believe that I am distorting the facts.

### Wang Yunsheng Talked About Three Points of View

Afterwards, after careful review, it was believed that the attitude of the police was indeed unreasonable, and the government's

General style needs to be improved.

(1) The traditional Chinese political view is wrong. The government believes that the people must be controlled and that no one is allowed to disobey. This concept is most undesirable and may become the fuse for major turmoil. The government's attitude towards the people should not be "management" or "interference," but "help" and "service."

(2) The attitude of the police towards the citizens should be thoroughly improved. In this street vendor incident, the measures taken by the police against the street vendors were: "control," "scold," "arrest," and "beat"! This is the style of the patrol room in the past concession era, which is the tool used by imperialism to oppress the people of the colonies. Today, the mayor's orders or the commander's instructions cannot be regarded as laws! The police have a responsibility to protect citizens. This is true for the wealthy people in high-rise buildings, and it should also be true for the poor people sleeping on the streets, because they are all citizens!

After the meeting, Wang Yunsheng also hoped that the municipal government would not completely shirk the responsibility for this unfortunate incident on the rioters, and believed that the citizens arrested in the turmoil should be dealt with calmly, and hoped that Mayor Wu would leniently deal with the case.

### The Government Has Not Fulfilled Its Responsibility to Protect

Zhan Wenhu of the Xinwen Bao said: This turmoil originated from the crackdown on street vendors, so if we want to review it, we must clarify the purpose of the crackdown on street vendors. Mayor's crackdown on street vendors in the central district is aimed at improving traffic, which is related to the welfare of the public, so I agree with it. I am extremely angry about the riots that were caused as a result, and the fact that companies and shops such as Gaosheng Department Store were destroyed in the chaos. In any case, the government's failure to fulfill its responsibility to protect should be considered a regrettable thing. I hope that the police can do more to fulfill their responsibility to protect in the future.

Liu Zirun of the Southeast Daily then reported his experience of being besieged and beaten by the crowd on Zhongzheng Road last Saturday. He said that although he was unconscious at the time, after he regained consciousness, he tried to avoid verbal stimulation. Regarding the issue of street vendors, he believed that it was an economic problem, and hoped that the municipal government could take a stand on the economy to find a solution. If there is no way out, it is inevitable that they will take risks. Liu finally stated that because of the disturbance that occurred this time, the municipal government should thoroughly crack down on street vendors in order to maintain the government's prestige.

### The Mayor Said That Although the Riot Has Subsided, the Conspirators Still Exist

Finally, Mayor Wu expressed his gratitude for the opinions of the above speakers, and stated that the municipal government's crackdown on street vendors in the central district was aimed at improving traffic, and definitely not at tidying up the city's appearance. In the future, street stalls will still be prohibited along the roads in the two central districts of Huangpu and Laozha, but they will be allowed to continue operating on public and private open spaces that do not obstruct traffic. He also said that although the riot has subsided, the conspirators still exist, and he will definitely step up prevention in the future, and also hope that citizens will not be incited.

### Director Xuan Held a Reception for Reporters to Report on the Street Vendor Case

[Our Newspaper Report] Police Director Xuan Tiewu held a reception for reporters from various newspapers at the bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, reporting on the disturbances caused by the crackdown on street vendors and the handling process. He said that in recent days, the general public and public opinion have misunderstood the police bureau's measures and blamed the Huangpu Branch, but in fact, the crackdown on street vendors had already been announced by the municipal government and was implemented by the police bureau from November 1, so the cause was not complicated and the scope was not large. If there were no saboteurs infiltrating, it could have been resolved quickly. In total, the number of shops destroyed in the past three days was 14 in Huangpu District, 38 in Laozha District, 21 in Xincheng District, 28 in Yimiao District, 1 in Yujiawan District, 2 in Hongkou District, and 6 in Beizhan District. Seven police officers and thirty-three police officers were injured. In addition to those who were released, the remaining suspects with lighter circumstances will be sent to the district prosecutor's office, and another ten will be sent to the garrison headquarters for military law. In order to take care of the livelihood of the street vendors, the police bureau had also submitted a request to the municipal government to allow them to operate in public and private open spaces where traffic order is not obstructed. At the same time, it was agreed with the Health Bureau to allow them to set up stalls in various vegetable markets after the market closes. In addition, stalls selling fried dough sticks and rice can also be set up along the Huangpu River and in some areas before 8:00 a.m. every day.

### Director Fang Raised Funds for Relief, President Bei and Others Expressed Their Support, Xu Shiqi and His Brothers Jointly Donated 200,000

Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters expressed concern for the innocent citizens injured in the street vendor petition and the Wansheng Department Store destroyed by the rioters. Yesterday morning, he visited President Bei Zuyi of the Central Bank and Director Liu Gongyun of the Central Trust Bureau to ask them to launch fundraising for relief. All the gentlemen expressed their support and immediately mobilized the staff of their respective banks and bureaus to start donating, and those who pledged donations were very enthusiastic for a time.

Professor Xu Shiqi also sent a letter to Director Fang, expressing his sympathy for the fundraising for relief. He and his brother Chen jointly donated 200,000 yuan and asked him to forward it to Mr. Gao Chengxi of Gaosheng Department Store to express his condolences.

### Street Vendors Are Preparing to Form a Friendship Association

[Our Newspaper Report] Street vendors in the city have been sending representatives to the Senate for several days to provide opinions and make petitions. The Senate believes that a few street vendors may not be able to represent the opinions of the entire group, so it specifically instructed the representatives to organize a systematic organization to collect public opinions, and then submit them to the authorities. Yesterday, street vendor representative Zhou Yizhong went to the Municipal Senate and claimed that the street vendors are about to establish a street vendor friendship association to facilitate communication and collect opinions for the benefit of the street vendors.

### Winter Relief Is Imminent, Please All Sectors of Society Donate Generously, Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, and Others Broadcast

All radio stations in the city simultaneously rebroadcast to expand the fundraising for winter relief donations. Mayor Wu went to Jiancheng Radio Station in person at 1:51 p.m. yesterday to broadcast the significance of winter relief. After Mr. Wu arrived at the station, he was received by Wang Xianqing, the general secretary of the Relief Committee. After a short rest, he went to the microphone to give a speech. Mr. Wu earnestly appealed to people from all walks of life to donate generously and work together for the good cause, and said: Due to the impact of the war, transportation in various places has been obstructed, and fuel transportation has been difficult, which has seriously affected various production businesses. The unemployed are engaged in street vending to make a living, so the street vendor issue is actually affected by the war. He is fully responsible for the security of the city, and there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Finally, Mr. Wu appealed to the citizens of the city to donate generously to save the refugees and prevent them from suffering from the cold and hunger, which would be a great merit.

At 5:00 p.m., Du Yuesheng, the president of the Local Association, gave a speech at Ya Mei Radio Station, saying: In the severe winter, the poor citizens are in danger of freezing and starving. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate with compassion to complete the relief goals of the association. At 7:00 p.m., Fang Zhi, the chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, broadcast at Guomin Radio Station, also calling on people from all walks of life to donate generously.

In mid-September, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Central Bank be ordered to handle re-discount and re-mortgage business to help the recovery and development of industrial and commercial production businesses.

As for small and medium-sized industrial and commercial loans, banks and money houses are guiding the formation of silver groups for verification and release, and the bank will provide convenience for re-mortgage or re-discount at any time.

### The Second Day of the Christian Conference, Dr. Li Rongfang and Dr. Tu Yuqing Gave Speeches, and the Paper by Professor Bade Tuzu Was Discussed in the Afternoon

[Our Newspaper Report] The 12th National Christian Conference began yesterday morning, with Dr. Wu Yifang as chairman and Dr. Li Rongfang leading the spiritual practice. Dr. Jiang Changchuan, Superintendent of the Methodist Church in North China, gave a speech on "The Mission of the Church in the New Era," believing that the power of the atomic bomb is not terrible, because it cannot overcome the world. The only thing that can overcome all difficulties and hardships is Christian love. Only it can eliminate human selfishness, suspicion, jealousy, etc. He then stated that the Chinese Church is facing great opportunities, but there is a great lack of talent, and this problem must be addressed and thoroughly resolved.

Dr. Tu Yuqing, President of St. John's University, also attended and gave a speech, analyzing the current situation and the opportunities for Christianity. He emphasized that Christianity must pay attention to the development of the world, but Christianity has its own position, such as advocating political equality, improving the economic system, and allowing freedom of thought, and providing opportunities for the full development of spiritual life.

The agenda for the afternoon was to discuss Professor Bade Tuzu's paper on "Communism and Christianity." Dr. Shoushan Bei read his paper, and then representatives gave speeches, all believing that although communism and the ideal heavenly kingdom of Christianity are similar, Christianity is a religion, not a political ideology. It is believed that only if humans love each other can there be an ideal of world peace. This is a human moral problem, which cannot be solved by political problems.

Today's agenda is to discuss church affairs and review the gains and losses of the Christian movement over the past century, and new proposals will be submitted to the conference for discussion.

The various power companies have notified the limits for each user, and we still hope that the citizens of the city will save as much as possible.

### "Meng Jiang Nü" to Go Abroad: New-Style Grand Opera to be Re-Performed Starting Today

"Meng Jiang Nü" is a comprehensive drama, a new-style grand opera combining music, dance, and singing. It is conceived, composed, and directed by the foreign musician A. Shavromoff, who has resided in China for over 30 years, in collaboration with outstanding Chinese veteran actors, famous singers, and dance masters. It was performed for only two nights at the Lyceum Theatre in the city in March this year, and most Shanghai residents did not have the opportunity to enjoy it, which was a regret. It was performed at the Lizi Society Theatre in the capital last month, with full houses every day.

### Zhonghe Apartment Sales Case: Investigation into Suspected Enemy Property

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Zhonghe Apartment and the five-story Zhonghe Hospital building on Laobazi Road were originally the property of the Japanese wife of Liao Huanzhang from Taiwan. They have been sold to the Danish firm Kangyi Yanghang and are currently managed by the Korean Huang Zhimiao. On July 29th of this year, the Supervisory Yuan sent a letter to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau requesting an investigation into whether there was any collusion to conceal enemy property. According to Liao Yixiong, the son of Liao Huanzhang, the property was sold to Kangyi Yanghang in April of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) for 300 taels of gold, introduced by the broker Yan Jinfu. There is a sales contract, and the deed is the proof of ownership. However, at that time, the price of gold was 890,000 puppet currency per tael, totaling approximately 267 million yuan, while the sales contract between Liao and Yan Jinfu only stated 150 million yuan in puppet currency, which seems inconsistent. The local procuratorate is currently investigating.

### Nanyang Tobacco Company Labor-Management Dispute Resolved: Labor Recognizes the Overall Situation, Management Accepts Demands

[Our Newspaper's Report] Three weeks ago, the workers of the Nanyang Tobacco Company put forward the following conditions: (1) Change the "daily wage system" to a monthly wage system to reward young and diligent workers. (2) Provide additional snack money for night work, also issued according to the workers' cost of living index. (3) Workers' wages should be paid as usual if the factory is shut down for boiler repairs. (4) Female workers should be given subsidies if their working hours are insufficient, to maintain their livelihoods. (5) Establish a pension system, with the amount of the pension determined by the length of service, with the highest amount being six months' salary. This labor-management negotiation lasted for nearly a month, and yesterday, an agreement was reached at the Social Affairs Bureau. The workers' opinions were largely accepted. The workers of the Nanyang Company showed great understanding of the overall situation and did not demand higher wages in the current situation of the depressed domestic tobacco industry. Therefore, the negotiations were able to proceed in a peaceful atmosphere and were easily resolved.

The workers of the Lehua Tobacco Factory put forward seven conditions, including: (1) Double wages should be paid for work on Sundays. (2) Holidays should be given on national memorial days, with wages paid as usual. (3) Female workers should be given 50 cigarettes per month as a reward. (4) Issuing year-end bonuses. Yesterday, during mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau, the two sides argued fiercely. The mediator believed that these demands were unlikely to be accepted. The Jiancheng Flour Mill was unable to pay workers' salaries for the second half of November due to losses. The person in charge intended to pay half of the salary first, which aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. Yesterday, representatives from both labor and management went to the Social Affairs Bureau for negotiations. However, because the official documents were not prepared and the procedures were not in compliance, the bureau ordered them to discuss it again another day.

### Mei Xun will Perform Xishi, Closing on the Last Day of the Month

Dr. Mei Lanfang is proficient in both martial and civil Kunqu Opera and can perform over a hundred plays. He has written many private scripts. Fan dances, sword dances, ribbon dances, feather dances, sleeve dances, and other dances, as well as costumes and props, are all unique, integrating the old and the new into one, and creating new ground for the opera. After the victory, he performed repeatedly, and the plays that were missed were repeatedly performed due to enthusiastic requests, resulting in many good plays not being performed as much as possible, which was a pity. Now, in response to repeated requests from the audience, he has decided to re-perform his early masterpiece, the first and second parts of Xishi, which the ladies of Shanghai should not miss.

"Xishi" needs no introduction. It is a very meaningful national opera. Mei's unique feather dance can be seen in the first part of Xishi. The second part has wonderful items such as walking alone in the empty corridor and floating in the hidden West Lake. All of the Xipi, Erhuang, Nanbangzi, and Erliu tunes are all wonderfully performed, with heavy singing and full of melancholy and loyal indignation, which is the unique spirit of this play. When the feather dance is performed in the Guanwa Palace, it is accompanied by the Huqin tune "Nazha Ling."

### Employees of the New New Company Crowded the Audience Seats, Paying Attention to the Development of the Li Ze Case; Li Emphasized that Taking a Puppet Position Was a Counter-Espionage Operation; Informant Vigorously Defended His Testimony in Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the victory, Li Ze, the general manager of the New New Company, was jointly reported by employees, who listed crimes of collaborating with the enemy and suspected him of being a traitor. After a trial by the city's High Court, Li Ze was sentenced to three years of imprisonment on June 8th of this year. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court for a retrial. The informant was also dissatisfied with the judgment and filed a petition on June 17th, requesting the original prosecutor to request a retrial from the Supreme Court, but the prosecutor did not consider it. The Supreme Court has now revoked the original judgment and sent it back for a new trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Ding of the High Court opened the court for investigation and summoned the original informants, Shu Yueqiao and Han Wucheng, for questioning. The audience was crowded with people, mostly employees of the New New Company and relatives and friends of Li Ze. The trial lasted from 2:40 PM to 4 PM. The court debate was adjourned to be heard again at a later date, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### Numerous Cameras Flashing, Li Ze Looked Embarrassed

Li Ze wore glasses yesterday, a brown striped flannel robe, and black Zhigong woolen shoes. After being escorted into the court by bailiffs, photographers immediately aimed their cameras at him. Seeing this, Li turned his head to avoid them. The photographers then separated to the left and right, each occupying a corner. Unable to avoid them, Li lowered his head to look at the ground or looked up, appearing quite embarrassed.

In response to the court's inquiries, he stated: "I am 43 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong. I have been working at the New New Company for 17 years. I started as deputy manager, and I have been the general manager since 1934. Before the Japanese entered the concession, they prepared to forcibly buy the New New Company. This was recorded in both Chinese and Japanese newspapers, and the New New Company also made a statement. After the Japanese army occupied the concession, the situation was not good, and unscrupulous Japanese people often came to harass us. In this situation, I discussed with the board of directors how to deal with it. Ito Masuzo, the owner of the Yiji Foreign Company, who had previously dealt with the New New Company, was consulted on how to deal with it. Later, Ito introduced the Japanese Kinoshita Yutaka, who was nominally hired as a consultant but was actually an employee, to deal with the harassment of Japanese soldiers and ruffians. This matter was approved by the board of directors. The chairman, Jin Zongcheng, testified in court when the trial first opened. Kinoshita Yutaka's monthly salary was 500 'military yen', until the first half of 1944 when he stopped coming. Regarding the puppet National Commercial Control Association, preparations began on March 15, 1943. The puppet National Defense Council and the Ministry of Industry decided on a list and appointed preparatory committee members. After receiving the letter of appointment, I was very embarrassed, because if I agreed, the government would investigate in the future, and if I did not agree, the environment would be difficult. As a result, I consulted with Huang Ruitang, a liaison officer of the Military Intelligence Bureau who often contacted the Xindu Hotel, and decided that it would be better to go along with the plan and do counter-espionage work. I first served as a preparatory committee member, then as a director, until the victory in August 1945. I don't remember exactly how many of the 33 meetings held by the Commercial Control Association I attended. However, I have never spoken or proposed a case to discuss and decide on the two unified control plans. The agency of the Commercial Control Association that handles the procedures for the entry and exit of materials was formerly the 'Military Allocation Association' run by the Japanese. It can be divided into two periods: before June 1, 1944, there was no Control Association. At that time, there were only professional committees organized by various industries. When the term of the directors and supervisors expired in June, the puppet Ministry of Industry discussed and decided to reorganize and set up control committees for rice, grain, edible oil, and other items. The chairmen of these committees were all standing members of the Commercial Control Association. Therefore, before June 1944, there was simply no work on controlling materials. After June, various control committees were established to be responsible for it. At that time, the directors' remuneration was 4,000 yuan per month for travel expenses." The court asked why he did not resign since he was forced to participate at first. Li replied: "This is not a question of resigning or not, because once you join, you have a plan and work to assist. My role as a director was completely superficial. I started working before I joined, providing information to the Military Intelligence Bureau." The court asked what kind of information it was. He replied that it was information about what the commercial association knew. Judge Yang asked: "Is there a person in charge of the Military Intelligence Bureau who can testify?" Li replied that there was, and in addition to the Military Intelligence Bureau's records, the handlers Huang Ruitang and Chen Hao could testify. At this point, the inquiry into the part about the puppet Commercial Control Association came to an end. Then he was asked about the matter of presenting the New New Company's water-heating iron pipes to the enemy in September 1944. Li replied: "This has been explained very clearly with human and material evidence in the first trial. This was not presenting iron, and it was not supplying the enemy. The New New Company's disassembled more than 200 water-heating pipes, totaling more than 20,000 catties, had been stored for several years. Because the enemy began to requisition water-heating iron, they were sold to the Senda Iron Factory in advance." The two informants who appeared in court, Xin Yueqiao and Han Wucheng, Han was a colleague of the New New Company, and Shu previously worked at the Xindu Hotel, but was dismissed for misconduct. At this point, Judge Yang instructed Li Ze to sit aside and summoned the two informants for questioning.

### Collecting Materials, Presenting Iron to the Enemy: Two Informants Testify on the Process

Shu Yueqiao stated: "I am 37 years old, from Cixi, Zhejiang. I am currently unemployed. I started working at the New New Company in 1934, and was transferred to the Xindu Hotel in 1943. Because the small account tips were secretly distributed by the management, the colleagues were very dissatisfied and elected me as their representative to request the company to publicly distribute them. On April 15th of last year, Li Ze used the Japanese Kobayashi of the Special High Section of the puppet Lao Zha Police Branch to force me to write a letter of repentance and resign. Kinoshita Yutaka, the consultant hired by the company, was a retired naval captain who attacked Guangzhou Bay. Li Ze wanted to use this to contact the enemy puppets. The puppet Commercial Control Association was an agency for controlling materials and looting materials. Li held the position of director until the victory. The so-called sale of water-heating iron to the Senda Iron Factory is fabricated evidence, because materials were controlled at that time and transportation was prohibited. Li presented all the water-heating iron to the Japanese, who loaded it onto Japanese military trucks. Everyone in the company knew about it. Li's claims are completely sophistry."

Han Wucheng stated: "I am 25 years old, from Jiangyin. I am currently an employee of the New New Company and have been working for 8 years. Li hired Kinoshita to be a consultant, mainly to contact the enemy and facilitate the collection of materials. Kinoshita Yutaka had an office in Room 405 on the fourth floor of the New New Hotel. Later, he was sued for occupying the house and no longer came. Li claimed that he hired a Japanese consultant to deal with the Japanese who often came to make trouble, but why did the Da Xin and Sincere department stores not use Japanese consultants, only the New New did? The puppet Commercial Control Association was an agency that controlled materials in the occupied areas and was directly under the puppet Executive Yuan. Li's claim that he sold the water-heating pipes to Senda is completely fabricated. Shu Yueqiao has explained the matter of being forced to resign very clearly. This is a past matter, but what can be stated is that this has nothing to do with the informant's position. Of the two documents previously submitted, one was to prove the crime of the Commercial Control Association buying up gauze, and the other was a gift registry found in the New New Canned Food Department, which recorded the occasional gifts to Mei Shiping, the puppet Minister of Industry, for collusion." Yesterday, Han also added three documents to the court, which described the details of the iron presentation in detail.

### Li Ze Makes Another Round of Arguments

The court continued to question Li Ze. Li stated: "The matter of buying up gauze was not decided by the Commercial Control Association. Wang Jingwei and the Japanese ambassador jointly issued a statement and announced the purchase method in the newspapers. I did not know about this beforehand. Afterwards, Tang Shoumin told me that Tang and Wen Lantin, out of consideration for the pain of the merchants, had negotiated several times and won back the handling of this matter by the Commercial Control Association, so that there was room for accommodation. The Commercial Control Association also set a remedial method, that is, semi-woven and woven products are not included in the purchase. Factories can keep three months' worth of raw materials, and shops can keep one month's worth. After receiving this news, I immediately notified many factories and shops, and a lot of cotton yarn and cotton cloth were able to escape. At that time, someone wrote a letter reporting Tang Shoumin, saying that I was undermining the control. If the court wants to prove it, it can ask Tang Shoumin. I did not know about the matter of sending gifts to Mei Shiping, because under the general manager, there are deputy managers and administrative directors, and I did not know about this kind of petty matter. The claim that Kinoshita Yutaka's office was located in Room 405 on the fourth floor of the New New Hotel is completely untrue. Kinoshita had an office on the fourth floor of the business building and did not come often. I do not know about the so-called criminal case of occupying a house. The reason he did not come was that after the puppet government recovered the concession, he had nothing to do and resigned from business. Regarding Shu Yueqiao's small account problem, what is said is not credible. The sale of water-heating iron pipes has been examined in detail in four joint hearings. The accountant Pan Xulun has checked the accounts of both parties and found no errors. As for serving as the chief joint guarantor of the first district of Shanghai, it was only from June 1945 until the victory, only for more than two months, and it also had a considerable effect." At this point in the inquiry, the defendant's defense lawyer submitted a document to the court, stating that the court still needs to investigate the matter of assisting in counter-espionage work, and the case was adjourned for further hearing. Li was allowed to meet with family members for a brief discussion before being escorted back to the Loyalty Jail by the police.

### Fabricated Charges of Treason Out of Spite; Hu Xirong Reaps a Bitter Harvest: Sentenced to Two and a Half Years of Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Pan Youbiao, an accountant at the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil depot, was credited with protecting company assets during the city's occupation. After the victory, he was promoted to Chinese Supervisor there, managing dockworkers alongside his colleague Zhao Yuesheng. Hu Xirong, a foreman at the same company, had beaten a foreign employee of the company during the city's occupation. Consequently, he was suspended and dismissed after the victory. Harboring resentment towards Pan and Zhao, Hu reported them to the military police and other authorities, accusing them of treasonous activities. However, after investigation, the court found no evidence of treason by Pan and Zhao, and dismissed the charges. Feeling unjustly disgraced, Pan and Zhao filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Hu Xirong of making false accusations. They also included a civil suit, requesting that the court's judgment be published in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Dagong Bao, and Central Daily News for one day each, with the cost borne by the defendant. They also demanded compensation for reputational damage amounting to one yuan in legal tender.

Yesterday, the local court pronounced its verdict. Wu Xirong, with the intent to cause others to be subjected to criminal punishment through false accusations, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of

two years and six months. The accompanying civil suit was granted in part, with the original judgment of this case to be published in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Dagong Bao, and Central Daily News for one day each, with the cost borne by the defendant. The request for one yuan in damages was deemed without merit and therefore rejected. Family members were sent to the Executive Yuan's relief and accommodation center.

### Bogus Personnel from the Korean Consulate Transferred to the High Procuratorate for Legal Handling

Family members were sent to the Executive Yuan's relief and accommodation center.

To understand the details of the false consulate personnel escorted from Korea to Shanghai yesterday, this reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office. According to the official, "This group of false consulate personnel and their families arrived in Shanghai from Korea on the second of this month. Personnel from our office, accompanied by the police bureau, went to the Qiujiang Wharf to identify the group based on the provided list. A total of eleven false consulate personnel were identified. These included: Feng Wenxiong, Consul at the Seoul General Consulate; Huang Boqun, Vice Consul; Yang Jingquan, Additional Vice Consul; and Attaché Consuls Zhan Quanguan and Xu Zigeng; Secretaries Jiang Chunxi and Zhou Zhenbai, Attaché Consul Wang Xiaoyi at the Incheon Office; Secretary Deng Junshan, Attaché Consul Jiang Daquan at the Busan Consulate; and Secretary Chen Weide. They were escorted to the High Procuratorate for legal handling. Their twenty family members have been temporarily sheltered and provided relief by the Executive Yuan upon request from our office."

### Widespread Decline in Commerce and Industry; Difficulty in Job Placement

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Job Placement Center of the Ministry of Social Affairs is actively strengthening job placement and guidance efforts. Plans include establishing five job placement stations in Zhabei, Yangshupu, Nanshi, the city center, and near Jing'an Temple. Academic and career training is planned for students at various schools. However, due to the widespread economic downturn in Shanghai's commerce and industry, job placement work faces significant challenges. The center places an average of just over two hundred people each month, which only accounts for one-tenth of those registered.

### Central Bank Recruiting Currency Counters

### Reader Inquiries Legal Questions

(1) Squatter's Rights

Pan Hongkui asks: I have several ancestral houses. Before the war, my mother rented out one of them without any written contract. In 1940, I wanted to take back the house for my own use, but the tenant kept delaying. Later, they even used the excuse of no written contract to refuse to move out. I ask: (1) From a legal point of view, is it legal to take back a rented house for one's own use? (2) Can a tenant stay indefinitely without a fixed-term lease? (3) Is the statement on the house rental certificate legally valid? (4) Can refusing to accept rent compel the tenant to move out? (5) If the tenant ignores my request, what should I do?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) (2) If you can prove that it is indeed for your own use, you can terminate the lease and request the tenant to move out. (3) It can be regarded as a lease agreement. (4) Refusing to accept rent during the lease period does not help. (5) You can ask the court for mediation. If mediation fails, you can sue according to law.

(2) Obstinate and Unruly

Yang Jinhua asks: My friend, Miss Jia, married Mr. Yi from the same village last April with her parents' arrangement through a matchmaker. After the marriage, she suffered various forms of abuse from Mr. Yi, causing both mental and physical harm. After being persuaded by neighbors, Mr. Yi expressed his willingness to repent, but he soon relapsed. Unable to bear it any longer, Miss Jia went to the township office and completed divorce procedures with Mr. Yi, declaring their separation. Recently, Mr. Yi suddenly went back on his word, overturned the previous agreement, and demanded 500,000 yuan in divorce compensation from Miss Jia. Now there are several legal questions, and I ask for your reply: (1) Can either party in a marriage file for divorce due to incompatibility? (2) Does Mr. Yi have any legal basis for demanding compensation from Miss Jia? Can he be charged with fraud? (3) Can Miss Jia demand alimony from Mr. Yi when filing for divorce?)

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) Since the divorce was 'resolved through the township office,' the marriage has already been dissolved. The subsequent 'living together again' is merely cohabitation, and Miss Jia can of course file for separation. (2) He can be charged with intimidation. (3) If she is not at fault, and her livelihood is endangered due to the separation, she can demand it to avoid being unable to survive suddenly.

### To Make Up for the Shortage of Raw Cotton for Yarn Production, the Government Decides to Purchase a Large Quantity of Foreign Cotton, to be Distributed to National and Private Yarn Factories for Use; Orders Amount to US$200 Million

[Our Newspaper's Report] It is learned that the government is weighing the situation of domestic cotton production and procurement, as well as the amount of raw cotton needed for yarn production by national and private yarn factories. It has been decided to order a large quantity of foreign cotton to make up for the shortage of domestic yarn production raw materials. It is rumored that the amount of foreign cotton to be ordered in the first batch has been approved at US$200 million. The government is currently considering how to increase the export volume of our country's major export goods to compensate for this huge outflow of foreign exchange. In the future, after this batch of foreign cotton is imported, it will be handed over to the Cotton Control Committee for proper distribution to national and private yarn factories for use.

Bei Zuyi, Governor of the Central Bank and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Commission, specially convened a meeting with the persons in charge of more than ten foreign cotton import companies in this city, including Meian, Fujia, Duanji Heyi, etc., at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. He informed them of the government's original intention in ordering foreign cotton and said that with the government's implementation of the import permit system, the import of foreign cotton would also require a permit. He instructed the companies to prepare to apply immediately. The amount of foreign cotton permitted for import has not yet been decided. The amount of the import permit for each company will be properly allocated by the Distribution Office of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Commission. It is rumored that the detailed procedures for ordering foreign cotton have been entrusted by the Cotton Control Committee to the China Textile Construction Company. If the conditions of various foreign companies are not met or the quoted prices are too high, the standing committee may consider directly ordering from abroad.

### The Six-District Cotton Spinning Association Discusses Regulating the Market

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association convened a meeting of its standing directors at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. More than ten people, including Wang Qiyu, attended. The meeting adjourned at approximately 2:00 p.m. It is reported that during yesterday's meeting, the directors presented various opinions on how to regulate the yarn and cloth market and eliminate the black market. The general suggestions included: (1) Restoring the free trading system that existed before the implementation of cotton yarn allocation. (2) The foreign exchange required to purchase foreign cotton can be offset by the foreign exchange earned from exporting yarn produced by each yarn factory. (3) The current rise in cotton prices is due to the insufficient inventory of raw cotton. Therefore, it is hoped that raw cotton can be supplied continuously, and the factories are willing to purchase it at market prices. The specific opinions are still being drafted and will be submitted to today's 15th regular meeting of the Cotton Control Committee for discussion.

### The Second Phase of Transporting Yarn and Cloth to the South Will Be Decided Soon

The application registration date for the second phase of transporting yarn and cloth to the south was originally scheduled to begin on the 2nd of this month. However, the Cotton Control Committee determined that there was still a surplus in the number of yarn and cloth reported for transport last month, after deducting the amount exported. This surplus will now be included in the calculation for this month, so the total amount has increased. At the same time, the manufacturers who applied to participate in the southern transport last month but were rejected for insufficient documentation have now completed the necessary documents and have been approved by the Cotton Control Committee. They can also apply for transport and export starting this month. Therefore, the quantity allocation must be re-determined, so the start date of the application must be slightly delayed. It will be formally decided tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. However, the increased quantity of yarn and cloth to be transported to the south is estimated at 2,000 pieces of yarn and 35,000 bolts of cloth. Previously, in order to favor the factories participating in the joint distribution of cotton yarn, the Cotton Control Committee entrusted the Six-District Textile Association to handle the application and issuance. This month, based on the existing records, it will still be handled by the Six-District Association. The association has already sent letters to its members to start applying. The number of cotton yarn reported for transport by private factories is 1,334 pieces, and 666 pieces by national factories. The number of cotton cloth, including the surplus from last month, is 40,316 bolts, with 26,877 bolts from private factories and 13,439 bolts from national factories. All factories participating in the joint distribution of yarn can apply for export with priority.

### Dullness and Fatigue in the Yarn and Cloth Market

Yesterday, the yarn market was calm. The Textile Construction Company listed its prices and distributed goods to wholesalers as usual. Among the familiar goods, only 20-count "Shui Yue Cao Bao" yarn was available, still priced at 1,775,000 yuan. The prices shouted outside the market were also stable. Sales to outside provinces were very scarce because the prices in the black market in other cities were the same, leaving no room for profit.

The Six-District Textile Workers' Union previously decided, at a price-setting conference, that the price of the 23-count cotton yarn spun by its members should be 10% higher than the price of 20-count yarn, at 1,925,000 yuan per 400-pound piece. This has been approved by the Cotton Control Committee.

Sales of cotton cloth to outside provinces remained sluggish. In addition, the dyeing factories on this street had already received a sufficient amount of gray cloth, so the market transactions were mediocre, and the stalls continued to be dull and sluggish. The "Long Tou" fine cloth was still scarce, and the price remained stable. The "Wu Fu Blue Chicken" showed slight softening, and the "Four Gentlemen" piqué hovered around 110,000 yuan.

### Rising Prices of Zhejiang Tung Oil

A merchant in this city received a call from Hangzhou, stating that the price of pure white oil of standard quality in Hangzhou has risen to 135,000 yuan per dan. In the Lilong area, it is 113,000 yuan per dan. In Lan, Heng, Jiang, Chun, and other places, the price ranges from 115,000 yuan to 126,000 yuan per dan. The quotation from Hankou yesterday reached around 135,000 yuan per dan. It is said that tung oil from Hankou is being shipped directly to Hong Kong, causing the price to rise sharply. Most of the tung oil exported from this city is shipped to the United States, and the price cannot be compared to the U.S. market price. However, there are very few tung oils produced and sold in Shanghai, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in this city. It is said that even merchants with strong capital only have 300 to 500 tons in stock, which is incomparable to the previous stock of 1,000 to 2,000 tons.

### Stable Bond Market

Government bonds stabilized slightly yesterday, and the transaction volume increased to more than 4 million yuan. "Tong Bing" was 1,350 yuan. Fu Yuan and a certain household on the fifth floor were selling. It once fell to 1,240 yuan. A certain household on the seventh floor came in low and rose to above 1,370 yuan before fluctuating. As a result, "Tong Jia", "Tong Yi", and "Tong Bing" each rose 50 yuan compared to the previous closing price. "Tong Ding" rose 30 yuan, while "Tong Wu" remained stable.

### Chu Fucheng and Others Plan to Establish the Zhejiang Silk Company

In order to seek the revival of the silk industry, Chu Fucheng, chairman of the Third District Chamber of Commerce, specially gathered silk entrepreneurs from Huzhou, Jiaxing, Deqing, Zhejiang, such as Xu Zhaokun, as well as financial giants, to organize the Zhejiang Silk Company. The capital is temporarily set at 1.1 billion yuan, which has already been raised. They are now actively planning to establish silk factories in Jiaxing, Deqing, and Hangzhou, preparing to start work and reeling silk next spring. The scope is as large as the Sichuan Silk Company.

### Rampant Usury in This City; Floating Capital Concentrated; Funds Flocking from All Regions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Usury is rampant in this city, with interest rates remaining the highest in the country. As a result, funds are flocking to Shanghai from all regions to be lent out at high interest rates. Furthermore, frequent transactions in gold and securities in this city have implicitly made Shanghai a distribution center for the country's floating capital. According to statistics on domestic remittances handled by the Central Bank, the total amount of funds remitted to Shanghai from all regions each month is consistently over 200 billion yuan. It is estimated that the amount of cash brought to Shanghai by other banks and travelers from other regions is twice the total amount of domestic remittances handled by the Central Bank each month, i.e., 400 billion yuan. Compared with the amount remitted in, the amount of funds flowing out of Shanghai each month accounts for three-tenths of the total. The most common destination for funds flowing out of Shanghai is the South China region.

### Abundant Food Oil Supplies; Glutinous Rice and Indica Rice Prices Firm

The rice market saw a total of over 14,000 shi arrive from the north and south. Prices in the producing areas were firm, and sales in the city were acceptable. Northern and Southern glutinous rice both rose by more than 1,000 yuan. Southern glutinous rice from the Sujia Road area was relatively scarce, so "Tongli Wujiang Liri" white glutinous rice rose strongly by 2,000 yuan. "Bi Mi" and "Bai Di Yuan Yin Yuan" were successively increased sharply. Flour mills continued to purchase as usual. Sundry brand flours were scarce, with an additional old generation of yuan added. City sales were active but not strong. Wheat remained stable and firm. Bran remained weak. Soybean cake was not concentrated in the market, and prices were mediocre. Mung beans were not available in large quantities. Nanyang slightly took over, opening up actively. Red beans remained scarce. Yellow soybeans were in low flow. Nanyang was still lazy, and the street was not refreshing. Sesame from Guangzhou was still better, and the market was stable. Recently, the oil market was flooded with supplies, especially with more tung oil from Qingdao. Supply exceeded demand, and prices continued to fall. Both raw oil and soybean oil continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil were flat.

### Oil Mills Re-Filling Application for Loan Amount

Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Bank's provision of a 1.5 billion yuan loan to oil mills, all procedures had been drafted by the bank long ago, such as loan applications and mutual guarantees. The reason why the oil mills have been slow to apply for loan amounts is that, according to regulations, the standard is based on the monthly sales volume of the oil mills. The number of loans applied for by various factories last time did not fully match the actual sales volume of each factory, and therefore, they failed to pass the review by the municipal government. It is also learned that the Oil Pressing Industry Association, in view of this, specially sent personnel to the Municipal Bank yesterday morning to re-obtain five copies of the loan application form, carefully fill in the loan amount for each factory, and implement the loan as soon as it is approved by the municipal government.

### Fewer Yarn Returns from the Re-Allocation Association

The large number of cotton yarn return orders from the Re-Allocation Association has long been a concern for all parties. The association also believes that technical improvements are still needed. The yarn coming from the yarn factories should pay attention to practicality. It is learned that the third and fourth phases of yarn allocation have been completed. The actual allocation list for each industry and factory has been sent to the Cotton Control Committee. Among the returned orders, in addition to 20-count yarn that is suitable for use (one piece), there are 9 pieces of 6-count, 1 piece of 12-count, 547 pieces of 10-count, and 53 pieces of 40-count Texcote yarn. It is heard that the 10-count and 40-count Texcote yarn are goods that have been returned and re-allocated many times. More than 1,000 pieces of the 10-count item have been returned successively. The Re-Allocation Association believes that it is very tricky. Yesterday (the 4th), the Yarn Allocation Committee of the Six-District Cotton Textile Association held a meeting. Representatives from the Re-Allocation Association attended the meeting to discuss improvements. The cotton textile industry has agreed to make adjustments. The first allocation of the fourth phase was allocated to the member factories of each industry association yesterday. The deadline for payment this time is Friday the 5th. The member factories have expressed difficulties to their respective associations, but the associations have advised them to comply strictly to avoid being cancelled. According to the person in charge of the Re-Allocation Association, there will inevitably be a large number of yarn returns for the 60-count yarn and 40-count Texcote yarn this time. The 40-count Texcote is of poor quality and is actually waste cotton.

### No Significant Fluctuations in Woolens

With the recent cold weather, sales of winter woolens have been good. The customers of various shops on this street are buying well. Judging from the general market situation, most of them have no significant fluctuations. They have not improved because of import registration, cancellation of orders, and rumors that foreign exchange is about to be adjusted again. The main reasons are: (1) There are an unusually large number of goods arriving. (3) There is a related relationship of high interest rates. (3) The period of actual winter sales is decreasing day by day. (4) The end of the Gregorian calendar is approaching in an instant. Both buyers and sellers do not want to store their goods, so it is expected that the woolen market will be difficult to restore to its previous peak.

### Current Situation of Money Exchange Businesses; Total of 188 Businesses

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the establishment of the Shanghai Money Exchange Association in March of this year, the number of members has been the highest, reaching 222. At the time of its initial establishment, there were 168 members. Currently, there are actually 188 in existence. The remaining 34 have been closed. According to the investigation: 10 of these applied to withdraw from the association, 1 was dissolved, 13 were closed, and 10 were suspended and did not pay membership fees. Among the 188 that exist, 169 originally had a license issued by the Central Bank to operate in foreign currency trading. In addition, 16 are also in the process of applying for a license. However, the Central Bank has not yet issued new licenses, and the association is sending a letter to urge their issuance.

In addition, the Central Bank plans to hire 250 currency counters. 215 people have registered. The Central Bank will be scheduled to hold examinations and screenings on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of this month.

### US Cotton Futures Report Rise

[United Press, New York, 3rd] Cotton futures closed today, rising from $1.40 to $2.50 per bale compared to the previous day. According to Orlins, cotton futures closed, rising from $1.70 to $2.85 per bale compared to the previous day.

### Textile Control Committee Investigates Cotton Inventory; Limited Time for Submission May Make Timely Filing Difficult

In order to understand the entire cotton inventory for reference when ordering foreign cotton, the Textile Control Committee (紡管會) has issued a cotton inventory survey form. It requires the submission of the cotton inventory as of November 30th, including goods that have been ordered but not yet received, within five days. The form is divided into five sections: (1) Type of cotton, (2) Nature (in storage or ordered but not received), (3) Quantity, (4) Storage location, (5) Remarks. All cotton inventory should also be categorized, including American cotton, Brazilian cotton, Indian cotton, Egyptian cotton, domestic American upland cotton, domestic native cotton, seed cotton, and other types of cotton. The Committee has also stipulated the following procedures for this inventory survey: (1) Each column in the form should be filled out accurately, and the forms should be collected by the trade associations and submitted to the Business Department of the Committee by December 5th. (2) The unit of quantity for raw cotton should uniformly be pounds. If sima dan (司馬擔) or shi dan (市擔) are used, they should be converted to pounds. The conversion rates are as follows: 1 sima dan = 133.33 pounds, 1 shi dan = 110.23 pounds. (3) Shaanxi cotton, Lingbao cotton, Hankou fine velvet, and Shashi fine velvet can be listed in the "Domestic American Upland Cotton" column. Tongzhou flower, Huoji flower, etc., can be listed in the "Domestic Native Cotton" column. (4) For factories within the same system, if the cotton usage is coordinated by the head office, the head office should fill out a consolidated form and attach detailed forms for each factory. (5) If the foreign exchange for ordered cotton has not been settled, it should be clearly noted in the "Remarks" column. The Textile Control Committee has printed and distributed the survey forms to textile factories and cotton merchants through their respective trade associations. Foreign cotton import firms will be directly issued the forms by the Committee. All forms are due to the Textile Control Committee today. However, according to responsible individuals from textile trade associations and others, the survey forms could only be sent to various yarn factories today and it will be difficult to complete the report on schedule.

### Cotton Association Registration; Cotton Inventory Over 90,000 Dan

The Cotton Business Association surveyed the cotton inventory quantity of this city's cotton firms and reported it to the municipal government.

### Strong Market Buying; "Cooked Red" American Cotton Resurgence

"Cooked Red" rose again yesterday, buying picked up and supplies decreased immediately. Opened at 2,743,000, then heard that money was tight in financial circles, and some members were selling. After opening, it gradually declined from 2,748,000. The Central Bank allocated 107 bars at a price of 2,735,000. Afterwards, although the low price retreated to within 2,730,000, buying gradually increased after 10 am, gradually stabilizing.

### Sparse Trading on the Floor; Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline

Yesterday was the last half-day of trading for the deferred delivery of Chinese stocks. There was not much trading on the floor. Both bulls and bears were preparing to compete in the fourth deferred delivery today. Therefore, superficial trading ultimately retreated as short-covering was more squeezed. It was still easy to raise it in the afternoon. Various stocks opened higher in the morning, carrying the momentum of the previous close, but due to the tightening of funds in the silver industry, there were those who took the opportunity to sell at high prices. Shortly after opening, it trended lower. Numbers 215, 224, 160, 198, and 233 were sold off one after another, gradually declining. Although there was a slight rebound midway, they continued to decline every ten minutes. Although numbers 151, 20, and 38 were supported, numbers 229, 152, 203, 44, and 92 were sold off, and the tug-of-war could not last long. Near noon, it ended at a low price. As a result, Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell by about half a percent compared to the previous close. Meiya, Huafeng, and Qinxing retreated slightly. Cold stocks Rongfeng Cement and Jinglun underwear rose slightly, and the rest retreated slightly. Deferred delivery Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhe, and Xinguang fell by about half a percent. Although Qinxing and Huafeng retreated slightly, they did not fall much. In the afternoon, the market continued to plummet, carrying the momentum from the morning. When Yong Yarn's low price of 445 yuan appeared, there was a sudden short-covering, and the floor helped such as number 233 bought in, gradually pulling it up. Numbers 215 and 213 bought in, and it rose to above 460 yuan near the close. As a result, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Qinxing retreated slightly compared to the previous close.

### Silk Weaving Industry Loan Amount Reaches Over 2.7 Billion in Half a Month; Central Bank Says It Should Be Used to Directly Purchase Raw Materials

[This newspaper report] The silk weaving industry loans undertaken by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have been in operation for two weeks since the 20th of last month. As of the previous day, the Bank of China had lent out more than 1.23 billion yuan, and the Bank of Communications had lent out more than 1.488 billion yuan.

The Central Bank's re-mortgages have also reached more than one billion yuan. However, according to a responsible person from the Central Bank, silk weaving industry loans should be used in principle to purchase raw materials. However, it has been heard that some manufacturers who have obtained loans often do not use the loans to directly purchase raw materials, which is inappropriate. If the facts are verified, the loans will be immediately recalled.

### China Trust Allocates Rayon; Total of More Than 2,900 Cases

The Central Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon for the electric textile industry for this month has been approved. The number of applicants is 330, and the approved quantity is 2,996 and a half cases, an increase of 674 and a half cases compared to last month.

Others all fell below the 4 million yuan mark. Dealers of silk satin took the opportunity to sell at high prices. Dachen Chicken Brand rayon quilts were reduced by another 10,000 yuan. Others were stable.

### High-Grade Goods Are Scarce and Priced Harshly; Tea Market Difficult for Foreign Firms to Activate

In the tea market for foreign firms, except for high-grade aged Keemun tea, which is scarce and in short supply, sellers of other teas are generally eager to sell off their inventory. Although there is strong foreign demand for Chinese tea, those with low quality are unwanted. High-grade goods are priced extremely harshly, so transactions remain quiet, and the market lacks any distinctive characteristics. As for the uncolored Ping Shui Xin Da Bang tea, which is sold to the Americas, tea merchants in this city recently sent telegrams overseas requesting price increases, but there was no response. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for China's tea industry to become active in the international market for the time being. Internal sales of red and green tea are sluggish due to lack of investment from local shops, and there is little activity from various buyer groups. Recently, there have been frequent reports that tea sales in Tianjin are becoming increasingly stagnant, so the situation continues to be less than optimistic.

### Runde Blue Slackens

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained flat, with ups and downs, but not much difference.

New Chao Qing sugar from Shantou brokers was offered at 100,200 yuan, Chongti Qing sugar at 100,000 yuan, and Juemian red sugar at 100,789 yuan, with hundreds of deals made. Xinghua brokers offered Kin Zhuang Gongbai at 131,500 yuan to 129,500 yuan, and Xing red at 120,000 yuan, with several hundred deals made. Several dozens of bags of Runde Qing sugar from Guangdong brokers were offered at 98,000 yuan, down by 2,000 yuan.

The highest price reached one dollar and ten cents per pound. The usual price of sulfur metamorphosis is only 24 cents to 26 cents per pound. Its main sales destinations are China and India. Before the war, the worldwide production of sulfur metamorphosis was 100 million pounds per year.

This is the first step in simplifying educational laws and regulations.

### The Last Group of Southwest Associated University's Returning Students Arrives in Beiping

### Current Situation of Education in Tangshan; Municipal Education Association to be Established

[This newspaper, Tangshan News] Tangshan City is an important town in eastern Hebei. Except for Fushun, it is the coal production center today. The population is over 200,000. The enemy puppets have long coveted it. Since Yin Rugeng, relying on the enemy's power, established the so-called "Eastern Hebei Autonomous Government," Guangshi was the first to suffer. After the "July 7th Incident," the enemy puppets launched a two-pronged approach, destroying the old culture and implementing enslavement education in order to anesthetize children and confuse young people in order to realize their aggression dreams. Last year, the Japanese devils surrendered, and after the Communist army disturbed and destroyed it, Tangshan's education rehabilitation work could not be actively carried out. This spring, the National Army recovered eastern Hebei and cleared the Communist army. Tangshan's rehabilitation work has been mostly completed, but education rehabilitation still faces many difficulties. Primary and secondary schools, such as Provincial Tangshan Middle School, Private Fengluan Middle School, and Beiren Girls' Middle School, have already been restored, but are limited by the environment and funds, and have not been able to restore their pre-war scale. The National Tangshan Institute of Technology, which is famous throughout the country for its railway and mining, also lacks funds, so that the practice factory, the physical and chemical laboratory, and the library are still empty, and students have no way to practice or refer to them. As for Tangshan's national education, it is even more tragic. All levels of primary schools are in danger of closing at any time. Although there are no reliable statistics on the number of out-of-school children and illiterates in Tangshan City, according to private statistics, it is nearly two-thirds of the city's population. Therefore, national education is even more urgently needed. In view of this, the provincial government has specially ordered the municipal government to convene relevant people as soon as possible to establish a municipal education association to be responsible for planning education rehabilitation, eliminating illiteracy, and helping out-of-school children enroll. It is reported that the Municipal Education Association has already started work and will be established soon.

### United Nations to Establish an International University in the Air; British Proposal Has Been Passed

[French News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The Collective Transportation Subcommittee of the United Nations Cultural Education and Scientific Organization met yesterday and passed two proposals on the establishment of international broadcasting programs. One was proposed by the United States, requiring the establishment of a committee of experts to study the possibility of laying a worldwide broadcasting network. The second was proposed by the United Kingdom and France, advocating the immediate appointment of a program committee to arrange international programs to be broadcast through existing radio stations in various countries so that cultural institutions can begin their broadcasting work without delay. The United Kingdom proposed a supplementary proposal advocating the establishment of an "International University in the Air," where authoritative scholars would give systematic lectures on the subjects of cultural institutions, translated into various languages when necessary, and broadcast everywhere in the name of the university. The proposal was also passed. Cultural institutions lack funds and cannot set up radio stations on their own, as construction costs are estimated at US$200 million and annual operating expenses at US$50 million.

### Second Municipal Basketball League Divided into Four Groups: Men's, Women's, and Business

### Full League Regulations Announced Yesterday

The second Shanghai Basketball League, jointly organized by the Municipal Sports Association Basketball Committee and the Shanghai Stadium, is scheduled to kick off on New Year's Day next year. The league regulations have been formulated by the organizing authorities and were announced yesterday. The key points of the regulations are excerpted below: Any sports organization registered with the Sports Association may register to participate, along with a registration fee of 10,000 yuan and a security deposit of 30,000 yuan. If a team forfeits a game once, its security deposit will be confiscated; if a team forfeits twice, its membership will be revoked.

The number of registered players is limited to ten for each men's team and twelve for each women's team. Once registered, no additions or deletions or changes are allowed. Unregistered players may not participate in the competition. The competition rules are the 1945-1946 American basketball rules for men and the rules of the Sixth National Games for women. All league matches will be held at the Municipal Stadium on Southwest Shanxi Road. Teams that are more than five minutes late to the court (according to the clock in the stadium) will be considered to have forfeited the game. If both teams are not present, both will be considered to have forfeited.

Teams are divided into four groups according to their skill level: Men's A, B, Business, and Women's. All groups will use a round-robin system. If there are too many teams in a certain group, the group will be divided into sections, and then an elimination system will be used to hold inter-section finals to determine the championship. The specified playing time for each game is 41 minutes for Group A, with a ten-minute break in between, and 32 minutes for Group B and the Women's Group, with a five-minute break at halftime. Teams without uniforms, or with uniforms without numbers, may not attend the competition, but this restriction does not apply to those with special permission from the referees and recorders. If a team has a protest, it should formally submit a written protest to the secretariat within two days after the incident, and submit it to the committee for judgment. A security deposit of 30,000 yuan should be submitted with each protest. If the committee believes that the protest has sufficient reason, the security deposit will be returned; otherwise, it will be confiscated. If the team members do not agree with the committee's decision, they may appeal to the adjudication committee, and pay an additional security deposit of 50,000 yuan. The decision of the adjudication committee is final and cannot be protested.

### Doubts About Article 9 of the Candidate Examination Law

### Examination Board Explains in Further Detail

Regarding the doubts about the time limits of each clause of Article 9 of the Provincial and County Public Office Candidate Examination Law, the Examination Board has previously submitted an explanation to the Examination Yuan. Regarding (1) Article 22 of the Implementing Rules of the Provincial and County Office Candidate Examination Law states that the Examination Yuan will revoke the certificate of any person who passes the examination but is later found to have any of the circumstances listed in Article 9 of this Law. However, for clause 1 of Article 9 of the Law, "Those who are wanted by the Republic of China," if they have already been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, have served their sentence, and have been announced to have their civil rights restored, can they still apply for inspection; how should the scope of clause 3, "Those who owe public funds," and clause 4, "Those who have a record of being punished for corruption," be defined, and is it limited to those who have this situation in the county or city where they are applying for inspection. Also, who should officially announce those who owe public funds, or under what legal form should they be prohibited from applying for inspection. For clause 6, "Those who smoke opium or its substitutes," is a court judgment required, or can it be determined after investigation.

(3) Also, how should matters be handled if the above circumstances were not known before the exam, but the above circumstances occurred afterwards. (3) Regarding Article 22 of the Implementing Rules of the Provincial and County Office Candidate Examination Law, which stipulates that the Examination Yuan revokes its passing certificate, what is the procedure and method for revocation, and if the cause for revocation is removed, should inspection be applied for again, or should the Examination Yuan reissue the certificate.

The Ministry of Interior and the Sichuan Provincial Government sent a letter to the Examination Board for explanation, stating that "Except for the inquiry in item (2), which should be handled in accordance with Article 21 of the Implementing Rules of the Provincial and County Office Candidate Examination Law and apply the provisions of Article 17 of the Examination Law, the scope of clause 3, "Those who owe public funds," and clause 4, "Those who have a record of being punished for corruption," has been previously submitted for explanation, "public funds" should refer specifically to money and not include all public property. If public property is owed, it must be handled in accordance with the provisions of clause 4 "Those who have a record of being punished for corruption," (limited to those who have received criminal punishment, without time limit) if it has been adjudicated by a court. In the record of corruption, in addition to including all public property, it seems that money is also included. Those who owe public funds do not seem to need to be judged by a court, and can be established as long as they are found to be true. Furthermore, it seems that both of the above clauses are not limited to those who have this situation in the county or city where they are applying for inspection. As for clause 6, "Those who smoke opium or its substitutes," it does not seem necessary to be judged by a court, and can be determined after investigation." Also, regarding the procedure and method for revoking a passing certificate, it seems that this committee should submit a request to the Examination Yuan to cancel the number of the passing certificate and make it public, and when the cause of the revocation is eliminated, since its active qualifications have already been reviewed, it seems that there is no need to apply for inspection again, only need to submit documents proving that the cause of revocation has been eliminated, and submit them to this committee for verification. After verification, it is transferred to the Examination Yuan for presentation and approval," and a general letter has been sent to the provincial and municipal governments for verification.

### A Sad Tune on the Songhua River

— A dispatch on November 24. Reporter Zhao Zhan from Shenyang

For one week after Chairman Chiang issued the ceasefire order, which came into effect in the Northeast at noon on November 11, the northern section of the China Chang Railway became tense again. The Communist army intended to apply the means of destroying the Beining Road to the China Chang Railway, attempting to constantly hinder traffic between Changchun and Shenyang, and assembled a force of more than 10,000 soldiers to lurk on the side of the railway between Gongzhuling and Siping. It was at this time that Zhao Jia , Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, and his wife toured Jilin, ostensibly to inspect the Xiaofengman Power Plant. They arrived in Changchun on the 19th and went to Yongji on the 21st. Because Director Du Zhangming was summoned to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd to report on the recent military situation in the Northeast, Zhao hurriedly returned to Changchun and returned to Shenyang on the morning of the 23rd. Guo Keti, Director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, also went to Xiaofengman, and the reporter also accompanied them on a one-day tour.

Scenery and People of Jilin

The Songhua River firmly anchors the homesickness of Northeastern travelers, tugging at the homesickness of the people of the Northeast. In the fourteen years after the September 18th Incident, she was celebrated in the mouths of Northeasterners who had fled to Guannei (inside the Pass).

I arrived at the Songhua River, and the Songhua River flows quietly. The gentleness of the Songhua River surpasses the beautiful scenery of the Jiangnan region.

Sitting on the special military train that Director Du took when he led his troops out of the Pass, I toured the scenery outside the window. Today, the traces of war are unfolded before the traveler's eyes on the Jichang Road. Every bridge and culvert is armed. The people of the Northeast do not understand why the "Eighth Route Army" wants to "dig up the road"? Why should the Chinese people go to war after victory?

Starting from Changchun, we enter the mountainous area in the east from the flat plains of western Jilin. The mountainous area is still east of Yongji. Along the way, there are undulating hills and sparse man-made forests. This area produces large amounts of timber and soybeans every year. In the past, forest protection and land utilization could be implemented in a planned manner. Now, the administrative efficiency in this area has been reduced. The forests are being felled, and bandits appear from time to time. I am very afraid that this free world after the restoration will return to the old appearance before the September 18th Incident and will not be able to move forward.

When we arrived in Yongji, it was already two o'clock in the afternoon. Those who came to welcome us at the station included Chairman Liang Huasheng, 60th Army Commander Zeng Zesheng, and 38th Division Commander Li Hong. Then, we drove to the Songhua River Guest House for a banquet hosted by Chairman Liang. The reporter thought it was a "victory meal," but after arriving, he found out that it was a "white fish banquet." (Note: Chairman Liang stipulates that new guests are to be treated with a victory meal, which only includes sorghum rice and beef. This time, it was a sumptuous banquet with white fish, a specialty of the Songhua River.)

Chairman Liang has his goals and firm beliefs in building a new Jilin. He said that the Communist Party had left Jilin half-paralyzed, and he wanted to build a complete Jilin. Below, I will introduce the achievements I have seen. One thing is particularly worth introducing is that Chairman Liang brought the moisture of the wartime rear. He gets up at four o'clock every day to train cadres and run schools, which is the style of young people. The party and league work is done very well, so that the people of Jilin feel that they are very close to the central government, and Jilin is moving towards a new future.

I would like to introduce Major General Li Hong, Commander of the 38th Division, in particular. He can be regarded as a representative of the National Army in Jilin. Li Hong's name is no stranger to those in Guannei. He was the first regimental commander of the 114th Regiment of the 38th Division to lead his troops on an expedition to Myanmar. He led the strong soldiers of Hunan from the southwest to the northeast. He is a native of Xiangyin, Hunan, and is taciturn. When the reporter talked to him, he felt that he was simple and honest, without any superficiality. He said that his brothers were unwilling to fight, but seeing how good the people of the Northeast were to them, they felt that relieving the suffering of the people of the Northeast was a responsibility. His brothers were too deeply moved by the warm love of the people. Fighting was like enduring the pain of cutting out sores. He said that he also missed his hometown very much and had not returned for several years. After listening to him, I felt that soldiers do not welcome war. Only when they need to protect something and have to draw their bayonets do they have the spirit of bravery. At the same time, the direction of the people's hearts is most closely related to the morale of the soldiers. The failure of the Communist Party in the Northeast was due to the loss of the people's hearts, which is indeed a true fact. Those who sympathize with the Communist Party feel sorry for the Communist Party.

After the banquet, we went to visit the Jilin Provincial Sports College, which was built with funds raised by the Dedication School Movement. It had only been open for three days and had 91 students, including 21 female students, two sports specialty classes, and one teacher training class. Chairman Liang is also the principal, and the school buildings and equipment are rarely seen in the southwest during wartime. All the students' expenses are fully borne by the school.

Education in Yongji City is very developed, with Jilin University and Changbai Normal College, 12 middle schools, and 30 elementary schools. The youth and children attending school account for one-tenth of the city's population of 240,000.

Then, we went to visit the Jilin Provincial Administrative Personnel Training Corps. Because it was getting late, we could not see the full picture of this large building. All the students gathered in the auditorium to wait for Chief of Staff Zhao to speak. Zhao was led onto the stage by Chairman Liang, and outlined the situation of the Communist army's occupation of the Northeast in the year since the victory. After he finished speaking, everyone went to the reception room to rest. Chief of Staff Zhao said to the reporter with a smile: Soldiers' speeches have a gunpowder smell, please be careful when publishing them.

The cadre training corps is a revolutionary furnace for administrative personnel in Jilin Province. All middle and lower-level cadres must undergo short-term training in it. There are currently 493 students, including 20 female students, indicating that women in Jilin have begun to participate in administrative work. I think the spirit of the cadre training corps lies in the couplet at the gate: "If you are a revolutionary, please come in; if you are not a revolutionary, get out."

After visiting the cadre training corps, Chairman Liang led the guests to the provincial government to visit his small broadcasting station. This station broadcasts programs to all parts of Jilin every day. The station call sign is XKGL, the frequency is 116XC, and the wavelength is 258.6 meters. Chairman Liang himself began to use the method of broadcasting orders, which reduced the trouble of official correspondence and increased administrative efficiency, which is a unique new approach. Chairman Liang said: "I have four broadcasting ladies." Then, he found a broadcasting lady and ordered her to broadcast a program ahead of time. This short, plump lady immediately started her program in Northeastern-accented Mandarin. Her voice became unnatural because she was in front of the chairman and many strangers. Then, Mei Lanfang's Beijing opera, mournful and desolate, was sent into my eardrums.

Spring in Winter

Early on the morning of the 22nd, I was invited to Chaoyang New House to swim. It is already the dead of winter, and there is thin ice on the streets. When we arrived at Chaoyang New House, I found that the spring of Jilin was in the swimming pool built by Chairman Liang. I walked from winter into spring, and my nearsighted glasses were covered with a layer of white mist. I had to take off my glasses and jump into the pool for a swim. When I came up, the breakfast table was full of eggs and milk.

The highest enjoyment for civil servants in Jilin is swimming in the morning. Chairman Liang sets an example, and they go to work every morning after swimming. Chairman Liang said: This way, they have a good spirit all day. After nine o'clock, citizens can spend 50 yuan to take a bath, which is very helpful for their health.

Chaoyang New House was originally the Chaoyang District Office during the puppet Manchukuo period. Many people died here at the hands of Japanese police. "Chairman Liang wants to change the bloody place into an entertainment venue to change the general impression of cruelty." Zong Jun, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Provincial Government Secretariat, explained this way. It took a month from construction to completion and cost 2 million yuan in circulation coupons. This swimming pool is the first in the Northeast. Everyone who comes to Yongji likes it, but the only bad thing is that it requires four tons of coal to be burned every day. In the Northeast, where there is a shortage of coal today, it cannot but be said to be a waste.

The night scene in Yongji City is on Henan Road. The shops are concentrated here. The lights are brilliant in the evening, and a sense of loneliness only begins to set in after the curfew at eight o'clock. Business is very depressed, goods have no source, prices are rising, and consumption power is greatly reduced, so the general small merchants have no way out and are constantly complaining. The famous Jilin Three Treasures are not as good as the scenery of the guest houses. Good wild ginseng is very expensive, and a small one costs 90,000 circulation coupons, which is equivalent to 1 million legal currency. Sable fur is only nominally famous and is completely out of stock. The value of Ula grass has also increased tenfold compared to before, but fortunately it is not a rare item in Jilin.

Prices in Yongji are also constantly rising. In October, rice (per catty) was 37 yuan, millet was 13 yuan, sorghum rice was 8 yuan, an egg was 7 yuan, and firewood was 120 yuan per load. In November, the prices doubled. Rice (per catty) was 58 yuan, millet was 25 yuan, sorghum rice was 15 yuan, an egg was 17 yuan, and firewood was 200 yuan per load. The common people are overwhelmed by prices, but the lives of civil servants are better because the provincial government supplies coal, rice, and other supplies.

Xiaofengman Hydropower Project

The Xiaofengman hydropower project was originally world-famous, ranking first in Asia and fourth in the world. It originally had eight 70,000 "Ke Wei Ai" generators, with a total power generation of 350,000 "Ke Wei Ai". After August 15, the Soviet army transported away six generators, and the current power generation is only 130,000 . It is currently planning to add three 70,000 "kilovolt-ampere" generators. If this plan is implemented and the situation in the Northeast is stable, overseas transportation will not be a problem, and it can be completed within three years. 15 percent of the Fengman dam project has not been completed and requires an additional 200,000 cubic meters of concrete. If the supply of cement is sufficient, it can also be completed within three years. At the same time, the completed dam project is very sloppy. If it encounters mountain floods and heavy rains in the summer, there is a danger of collapse. The dam urgently needs to be processed.

The Soviet army used a lot of effort to dismantle the Fengman generators. At that time, it mobilized 2,000 Japanese prisoners and 1,500 Soviet soldiers. The work started on September 15 last year and ended on November 3, lasting a total of 40 days. Chinese workers witnessed the Soviet army dismantling their machines, and none of them were not very angry!

It took the Japanese nine years to build the Fengman Power Plant, and the entire completion plan required 12 years. After we take over, we need to continue to complete the Fengman project, and it is feared that it will take the same amount of time. Director Guo told the factory workers that he hoped they would stick to their posts, exert their maximum work efficiency, and contribute to the country.

Looking at the scenery of Jilin, Xiaofengman is also the most beautiful place. In the summer, when the water is high, the river water pouring down from a height of 100 meters forms a waterfall, swallowing clouds and spitting out fog, which is a spectacle. Now it is winter and the water has receded. Standing high on the dam, the upstream looks like a lake, and the downstream looks like a belt. The 100-meter-high dam blocks the river water, and the situation is quite spectacular. After writing about Xiaofengman, I need to add a sentence, "Fengman Power Plant" has been renamed "Songhua River Power Plant."

### National Father Sun Yat-sen Historical Site Memorial Hall in Taiwan

— November 30th Airmail News, Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Jiang Muyun

Diagonally opposite the Taipei Governor-General's Office, at the original site of the Umeyashiki Inn, formerly operated by the Japanese, now stands the

National Father Sun Yat-sen Historical Site Memorial Hall.

In the second year of the Republic of China, after the failure of the anti-Yuan revolt launched by Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai, he planned to go to Guangdong and launch another uprising, sending Huang Xing ahead to make preparations. On August 2nd, Sun Yat-sen boarded the German ship "Jock" and left Shanghai for Fujian. At this time, the situation in Guangdong took a sharp turn, so he listened to the advice of the Japanese man Toga and made a short stop in Taiwan on the Japanese ship Fushun Maru. Accompanying him were Mr. Hu Hanmin and Mr. Dai Jitao. They landed at Tamsui and arrived in Taipei, where they rested at the Umeyashiki Inn.

Sun Yat-sen's stay at the inn was not long. It is said that he arrived at eleven o'clock in the morning and left at two o'clock in the afternoon. Sun Yat-sen did not like to talk much, only smiled. He did not eat much, nor did he drink alcohol. After lunch, Sun Yat-sen wielded his brush and left two pieces of calligraphy: "Comrades" and "Universal Love." One piece is preserved in the memorial hall, and the other is still in Tokyo. The inkstone he used is also treasured. After inscribing the words, Sun Yat-sen walked into the garden and had a photo taken next to a small rockery. They then set off for Keelung to board a ship leaving at four o'clock in the afternoon to visit Inukai Tsuyoshi and Toyama Mitsuru in Tokyo.

After Taiwan's retrocession, the owner of Umeyashiki, Fujii, presented Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy, which he had painstakingly preserved for thirty-three years, to Li Yizhong, the chairman of the provincial party headquarters, who was greatly inspired to establish the National Father Sun Yat-sen Historical Site Memorial Hall. A management committee has been organized, with Mr. Li serving as chairman, and Zhang Yanzhe, Lin Zigui, Huang Guoshu, and others as committee members. Gao Baisheng is responsible for the preparations. As Mr. Zhang Ji wrote in the "Memorial Hall Record": "In the years when Taiwan was ceded, Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause began to take shape. Now, the old objects are not lost, and the spirit is in heaven, which is truly a source of comfort and recommendation. Those who visit this hall will linger and reflect on his thoughts, so that they will be worthy of Sun Yat-sen, forever remember his cause, and glorify the nation. How close it is to fulfilling their admiration and how can it be merely a place for sightseeing?" Truly, the new Taiwan needs a deeper understanding of the Chinese revolution.

### A Variation on the Song of Exile

Embarking on the journey home, I was not troubled by the day's fatigue. To summarize the impressions of this first trip, it can be said that it was a pleasant journey. However, there were also unpleasant things. I saw representatives of the Military Mediation Department's 33rd Group withdrawing to Yongji. The American representatives were very depressed, feeling that Chinese affairs were impossible to sort out. From the perspective of the government representatives, the withdrawal of the group was not a big deal, and the door to peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communists was not closed. However, the American representatives lost their composure, thinking that something major must have happened. However, those familiar with the internal situation in China would not be at a loss because of this.

Chairman Liang once directed a new play himself, entitled "On the Songhua River," which told the story of the struggle against the Communists. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to see it performed this time.

On the Songhua River, I heard the song of exile again, but the tune was different from before. Although it was still about painful longing, the two emotions ultimately sang two different tunes. The tune of the song of exile heard in Guannei during the war was tragic and passionate, but what I heard now was national resentment and lament. What does this illustrate? It illustrates the pain and disappointment of the people of Northeast China. Many young people who had fled from the Communist-occupied areas were still hovering on the brink of starvation, singing the sad tune of the song of exile amidst the emotional turmoil of being lovelorn with their homeland.

Giving a blow to those who use violence, the people of Northeast China know how to do it. The people of Northeast China hate any violence as much as they hate the Japanese.

When our return train passed through Yongji, we received information at the station that bandits were active at Jiutai Station. Chief of Staff Zhao ordered the station to dispatch a road roller train to proceed as usual. We returned to Changchun safely, arriving at 10:30 PM.

### Looking at America Through Food, Clothing, Shelter, and Transportation

— Xiao Fu

The world is shrinking day by day, and the relationship between China and foreign countries is becoming closer and closer, especially the relationship between China and the United States. We must study the United States and the American people in order to gain mutual understanding. After understanding, we can compare and see how they are doing and how we are doing. The best way to look at a country or a person is to start with the simple things. The truth about things in the world is not in their peculiarities, but in their commonalities. We look at this country through food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and do not indulge in talk of culture or philosophy. Moreover, clothing and food are the basis of life, and from these areas, we can see the universal and everyday life.

Milk and Western Food

Here, "Americans" still refers to the ordinary majority of Americans. They drink milk every day, and it is not expensive. In today's inflation, it costs only one dime per pound. They drink it from infancy to adulthood, even to old age. The amount of food they eat is not large, but it is very nutritious. Breakfast consists of a few pieces of buttered bread, some oatmeal, and, if better, two eggs. They do not pay much attention to lunch. Dinner is a little richer, with a few slices of meat and some vegetables per meal. For ordinary people, or the simplest way of eating, that is all. Their daily eating habits are very different from the Western food in Shanghai's Western restaurants. The Western meal in Chinese restaurants is much richer than the Western food eaten by ordinary Americans. In short, they eat for nutrition, not for taste. Moreover, ordinary people eat quite well. I do not believe that there is a big difference in Western food. The food eaten by the President of the United States will not be much better than that of ordinary workers. The best dishes are nothing more than steak, pork chops, chicken legs, and lamb chops. The characteristic is that while no one enjoys delicacies, no one eats bark, so ordinary people are very healthy.

Toilet Facilities

All toilets in the United States are flush toilets. Clean toilet water makes it less likely for people to get sick, thereby raising the health standards of the nation. Here is an example of the toilet facilities in an ordinary school to give an idea of the rest. In the place for urination, there are urinals, some of which automatically flush every few minutes. Some use people to press the faucet. Tap water, like in China before the war, flows very smoothly. The place for defecation is mostly chamber pots. As a rule, there is white, soft toilet paper. The lids of the chamber pots are afraid of transmitting skin diseases, so another kind of paper is prepared, the size of which is consistent with the wooden lid of the chamber pot, and it is placed on top during defecation and thrown into the chamber pot after use, flowing down the drain. In the restroom, there are washbasins and paper for drying hands. The quality is very good, and it is very large. Wash your hands after defecation. Use paper to wipe your hands. Paper is better than public towels. From this matter, it can be determined that there are so many kinds of diseases that can be prevented because of this.

Hygiene and Nutrition

During World War II, less than one and a half American soldiers per thousand died from disease. It can be seen that they pay special attention to hygiene, even in the wild battle zones, and do not treat human life as child's play, let alone in schools?

The people are the foundation of the country, and the population is the treasure of the country. Life must be cherished. China is proud of its large population, which shows that it recognizes the importance of population. Since it knows the importance of population, why is it so negligent in nutrition and hygiene? During the War of Resistance, the insufficient nutrition of students was pointed out as national suicide. Now, after victory, not only must the nutrition of students be increased, but also the nutrition of the general population. Some say that Chinese disaster victims eat tree bark, so what is there to talk about nutrition? However, this is a morbid state. Are we just watching a nation decline day by day?

Sleeping Comfortably

When it comes to sleeping, "Simmons" mattresses are the enjoyment of special and very special people in China, but in the United States, although I dare not say that everyone has them, it is probably common. The so-called poor people in the United States also have such a bed. They also have a shower room, take a hot shower at night, and sleep comfortably. According to medical experts, sleeping on a soft bed for six hours is equivalent to sleeping on a hard bed for eight hours. If you have a good night's sleep at night, you can do more work in the morning. How can work be efficient if you do not get enough sleep? This point cannot be asked of China; it can only be said.

In short, the purpose of this article is to let readers know what kind of life ordinary Americans live and how ordinary Chinese people are struggling in dire straits. We are catching up quickly, increasing production, but we cannot catch up for a while. How can we withstand internal strife again?

### On Reading the First Draft of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted"

— Yao Shennong

Personally revised by Chairman Chiang, translated by Wu Jingxiong. First edition published by Commercial Press in October 1946, the entire book is 212 pages, the actual price is 2100 yuan.

"The Book of Psalms" is not only a hymnbook of Christianity; it is an immortal masterpiece in the literary heritage of mankind. Its value has long transcended the scope of religion and has deeply permeated the entirety of culture. The breadth and length of its influence can rarely be compared with it in ancient and modern literature. Therefore, we feel that the publication of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted, First Draft" is a major event in the cultural world and also a milestone in the relay station of Sino-Western culture.

Why is "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted, First Draft" worthy of such attention? Hasn't the Book of Psalms already been translated into Chinese? That's right, there are already Chinese translations—classical Chinese, Mandarin, dialects—there are many different versions. However, their translations all adhere strictly to the standards of the original text, and only "faithfulness" and "expressiveness" are achieved in the three words "faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance," while "elegance" is difficult to achieve. Archbishop Yu Bin said in the preface to this book: "Our country's translations are all awkward and difficult to read, making people feel disgusted." We think that anyone who has read the Chinese translation of the Bible probably has the same feeling. The Bible translation has been circulating in China for a long time, but it has not had a significant impact on literature, and the reason lies in this. We know that the original text of the Book of Psalms is a gem of ancient Israelite national literature, and the translations in various languages of Christian countries are also elegant and magnificent, occupying a lofty position in their literature, just like our Book of Songs. If we compare the existing Chinese translation of the Book of Psalms with the original text or European translations, we cannot help but feel too shabby and inferior. All we have is the dregs of the Book of Psalms, and we have not obtained the spirit of the Book of Psalms. What a great defect this should be!

"The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted, First Draft" is obviously made to fill this defect. What the translator pursues is the spirit of the Book of Psalms, not the shell of the Book of Psalms. In these one hundred and fifty translated words, we cannot find forced or awkward words and phrases, or raw or unintegrated meanings of the scriptures. When we recite them, we seem to be reading an ancient poetry collection of a mountainous country, and we do not feel that this is a translation of the Israelite Book of Psalms. This alone is beyond the reach of those who wield their pens casually.

This translation method cannot be compared with literal translation. I personally have no bias towards either literal translation or free translation. I think that the translation method should be based on the nature of the original text. If the original text is substantial, then literal translation is of course more accurate. If the original text is spiritual, then only free translation can achieve the wonder of "conveying the spirit." The Book of Psalms is undoubtedly a work belonging to the latter category. Mr. Wu resolutely transcends the limitations of words and soars in the realm of the mysterious and ethereal. This is completely in accordance with the internal needs of the Book of Psalms and is not deliberately showing off the translator's talent for writing ancient poetry.

The most difficult realm to achieve in free translation is "obtaining its spirit," and this is especially true when translating ancient works. Because in addition to spirit, the work also has a "style" that is inseparable from the spirit. The literature of an era has the style of an era, just as the Zhou Ding and Shang 　each have their representative characteristics of an era. The Book of Psalms was created from Moses in the 16th century BC to Malachi in the 5th century BC, lasting for more than a thousand years. Its era is equivalent to the Shang and Zhou dynasties in our country, and its ancient and simple language can only be compared with the poetry and diction above the Han and Wei dynasties. I think that before Mr. Wu took up his pen, he probably made a careful consideration of the style of the translated words, so the entire draft generally adopted the style above the Han and Wei dynasties. For example, the one hundred and nineteenth poem, known as the "Song of Songs of the Book of Psalms," verses 1 to 8:

"Happy is the gentleman, with a pure heart and innocent conduct, following the holy way, cautiously and diligently, leisurely and contentedly, following the Lord's rules, being precise and unified, without duality or error, the holy commandments are clear, how dare to abandon them, I pray that the Lord will guide me, to piously abide by the great law, so that I will be free of shame, the golden rules and jade precepts, so that I can joyfully sing, the Lord's spirit, with a righteous heart and sincere intentions, only the Lord is the model, only asking my Lord, not to abandon me."

Another example is the eighteenth poem, verses 7 to 13:

"The Lord's anger shakes the universe, the earth trembles, and the mountains collapse, smoke rises from the nose, fire spews from the mouth, sand and stones melt, and vegetation burns, the sky curtains hang down, and the Lord personally descends, with dark clouds under his feet, riding a divine steed and galloping, soaring on the wings of the wind, covering himself with heavy darkness as a curtain, and using it as a palace, yin and yang combine to form hail, and red smoke rises from the clouds, showing the majesty of the Most High, and shaking the sky with thunder."

If we compare the above-quoted translation with the original work, the reader can know that Mr. Wu has spent a lot of effort on style. If, when reciting it, the reader feels that the ancient and simple words of the original work are reflected between the lines, then it is enough to illustrate the abundance of the harvest obtained by the translator's painstaking efforts. The praise on the pen seems humble.

Comparing the Translation with the Original Work, Painstaking Efforts Are Fully Revealed

Style and spirit are qualities that are interdependent. Having style but no spirit is like a high sail but no wind, unable to see the use of the sail. Since Mr. Wu has achieved the above-mentioned accomplishments in style, let us examine again: does he also have equal achievements in spirit? If we temporarily compare verses 7 to 13 of the eighteenth poem of the Book of Psalms, which we quoted earlier, with the English translation and the popular Mandarin translation, we find that the popular translation is like this:

"Then the earth shook and trembled because of his anger, and the foundations of the mountains trembled and shook. Smoke rose from his nostrils, and fire burned from his mouth, even coals were kindled. He also made the heavens droop and descended himself, with dark clouds under his feet. He rode on the cherub and flew; he flew swiftly on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his hiding place, with the darkness of water, thick clouds of the sky, as his surrounding palace. Because of the glory before him, his thick clouds passed by with hail and burning coals. The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, and there was hail and burning coals."

According to the records of the Old Testament, this poem is a song of praise written by King David in memory of God's protection and care when he struggled with enemies and Saul in the past. Its temperament is most similar to Lisao in ancient Chinese literature, because they are both the offspring of poets' fantasies. Translating this type of work, if you only seek the faithfulness of the literal meaning and ignore the spirit of the original work, it is like cutting off the wings of the celestial horse and teaching it to drive in the mill! The Mandarin translation quoted above commits this problem. When we read it, we only see a lot of unbelievable absurdities, and we do not have an ethereal feeling. Conversely, when we read Lisao, we do not feel its exaggeration at all, we only feel like we are riding the wind, floating to a detached realm. Mr. Wu chose the style of Lisao to translate this psalm. We feel that it is the most appropriate choice. He not only maintained the ancient and solemn nature of the original work, but also maintained the unrestrained spirit of the original work. If you are not familiar with the Bible and ancient Chinese poetry and diction, such a competent and pleasant translation is impossible.

Abundant References, Worthy of a Masterpiece

The most commendable achievement of the first draft of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted" is of course "obtaining its spirit," but its precision is also beyond the reach of the non-circulating Chinese translations. Mr. Wu tells us at the end of the volume that his translation is mostly based on Swete's "English Translation of Psalms and Hymns." Because I have a teacher-student relationship with Mr. Wu, I learned that he referred to many classics, and for the sake of prudence, he repeatedly studied with Chinese and Western scholars who were proficient in scripture and revised each draft verse by verse with the Hebrew original, correcting many defects in the English and Chinese translations. Due to space limitations, I will only cite the first verse of the first poem of the Book of Psalms to see a glimpse:

"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night." (Mandarin)

"Not following the advice of the wicked, not following the path of sinners, not dwelling in the seat of scoffers, blessings descend. Taking pleasure in the law of Jehovah, thinking of it and maintaining it, day and night." (Classical Chinese) The first draft of "The Book of Psalms Translated and Interpreted" is:

"Long is the happiness of the gentleman, for good deeds bring together a hundred blessings, do not associate with those without disasters, be ashamed to stand with the lowly, avoid those who are frivolous and slow, disdaining to sit with them in the same seat, leisurely swimming in the holy way, soaking in it from morning till night."

Regarding these short two verses, Mr. Wu will put forward three arguable meanings in the footnotes. (1) The "hundred blessings" he translated, the Hebrew original text is plural, meaning that all kinds of blessings are available, the English translation is Blesseo, and the Chinese translation is "blessed" or "blessings," which all fail to include the meaning of the original text. (2) The Law in the English translation is generally translated as law in the Chinese translation, but according to the research of scholars of scripture, the original text actually encompasses the entire holy way, so Mr. Wu decided to translate it as "holy way." (3) The "soaking" he translated has the meaning of thinking about it and maintaining it, reciting it verbally and maintaining it mentally, and the English translation is Meditate, and the Chinese translation is "thinking" or "thinking," which cannot fully express the original meaning. Another example is the famous sentence at the beginning of the twenty-second poem: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? (This is the sentence that Jesus cried out when he was dying.) The Hebrew original is "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" There are a total of ten syllables. Mr. Wu translated it as: "Lord, Lord, why have you abandoned me like an inheritance?" The ten syllables of the ten characters coincide with the original text, and David's melancholy and sorrowful complaint are as if heard. The old Chinese translation is: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" or "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" Compared with Mr. Wu's translation, there is a real difference between those above the clouds and those on the ground.

Such examples can be found in almost any translated interpretation of the Book of Psalms, and I do not need to list them one by one. Mr. Wu deliberately pondered the style and spirit, sparing no effort, and at the same time, he can still be so meticulous in the meaning of the scriptures, striving for excellence. Apart from deeply rejoicing for the Book of Psalms, what else can we say?

However, Mr. Wu himself does not feel satisfied. Although it has gone through two years of deliberation and revision and three revisions by Chairman Chiang, he still refuses to admit that his work has been completed. He believes that this is only the first draft of the translation and interpretation and hopes to obtain the corrections of literary and academic circles at home and abroad after publication. This humble attitude is not only a footnote to the translator's scholarship and accomplishment but also a sign that the first draft of the translation and interpretation has been tempered thousands of times. This alone is enough to illustrate the value of this book, and we hereby extend our most sincere recommendation to readers.

### John Christopher (Continued)

— Jia Shui

(1) The Novel's Form, the Epic's Content

"John Christopher" is divided into ten volumes, translated into four thick books in Chinese, totaling 2,350 pages, approximately one million words. The above attempt to summarize the story in less than one four-hundredth of the original word count is inevitably flawed. Moreover, the book's merit lies not merely in its plot. The translator states:

"John Christopher" is not just a novel—it should be said to be more than just a novel, but a great epic of humanity. It depicts and celebrates not humanity's material adventures, but its spiritual struggles, not the conquest of the external world but the conquest of the inner world. It is a mirror to millions of lives, an adventure story of heroes and sages from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, a symphony in the style of Beethoven. (Volume 1, Translator's Dedication)

The author himself said:

I never intended to write a novel: this is obvious. What, then, is this work? A poem? Why must it have a name? When you see a person, do you ask if he is a novel or a poem? What I have created is a person. (Volume 3, Volume 7, Preface to the first edition) Therefore, we are not reading a novel, but a person. We are witnessing the growth of a genius soul and the many hardships it must endure.

We see Christopher's work. From childhood, "like all children, he hummed all day long," with his grandfather recording his best tunes, to later, after experiencing much labor, joy, and setbacks, he finally reached this state:

Christopher, abandoning his art, was astonished to feel rising within him an unnamed power, which he had not expected: neither his passion, nor his sorrow, nor his conscious soul... but a strange soul, indifferent to all that he loved and suffered, indifferent to his whole life, a joyful, sacred, wild, and inexplicable soul! It spurred him on like a steed, kicking his flanks with its spurs. Often when he had a moment to breathe, he would reread what he had written and ask himself:

--How, how did these come from me? (Page 2088)

We also see Christopher's friendships. From his earliest friends, his grandfather Johann Michael and his uncle Gottfried, to his later young friends, Aymery and Georges, there are many figures with varying degrees of closeness, goodness, and evil. But the closest and most influential of all was Olivier. After their first meeting, Christopher repeatedly said: "I have a friend."

I have a friend! He is far from me, yet close as a neighbor, forever in my heart. I have possessed him, he has possessed me. My friend loves me. "Love" has merged our two souls into one. (Page 1342) When Olivier died, Christopher's only thought was to be buried with "him," to end with him.

The suffering of the world is that a person almost never has a companion. Perhaps some partners, some chance encounters. The beautiful term "friend" is abused. In reality, a person can only have one friend in a lifetime. And even that is a happiness that few can enjoy. But this happiness is so wonderful that a person simply cannot live without it once it is lost. (Page 1959)

(2) Differing Views on the Worthiness of Women

We also see Christopher's loves, his girlfriends, because he never married. In this regard, I find two things quite peculiar about this book. One is that although there are pure Antoinette, serene Grazia, and other women, none of them possess extraordinary talent to match Christopher's. Compared to them, the women in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are much more outstanding. But the male protagonist in "Dream of the Red Chamber" seems so pitiful: what Baoyu lacks is precisely what Christopher has in abundance—vitality. "Dream of the Red Chamber" goes from something to nothing, "John Christopher" from nothing to something; one is passive, the other active.

Another peculiarity is that almost none of the women associated with Christopher have happy endings. Pina, Antoinette, Françoise, and Grazia all died. Although not due to Christopher's fault; but if they, especially Grazia, had never met him, then perhaps they would have lived longer, albeit more uneventfully. But, who knows? Maybe they preferred it this way. The fullness and brilliance of life are not measured by its length. Then there's Anna, even more pitiable. The relationship between her and Christopher, "that was not love, that was madness." Christopher went mad, walked away, and recovered; Anna went mad, and remained mad to the end. What was her inner life like? In comparison, perhaps those who died were happier. I say this not to criticize Christopher, but to admire the book's honesty.

It is often seen that in love, the weaker of the two gives the most, not because the other loves less; but because he is stronger, so he should take more. (Page 2141)

We also see Christopher's thoughts. The author has the protagonist grow up in Germany, spend an important part of his life in France, and end his days in Italy; he speaks of this person, and also of these countries. Therefore, this book is as weighty in quality as it is in quantity, because it is not just a portrait, but also a

huge historical painting—not only realistic, but also symbolic, containing prophetic meaning. The author uses the entire intellectual, social, political, national, and artistic history of the late 19th century as the background for this new hero. (Volume 2, Translator's Preface)

Although the translator wrote a preface at the beginning of the second volume and countless small notes throughout the book, readers like me still find many parts of the book obscure and difficult to understand. But I am therefore willing to reread this book in three or five years to see if my understanding of it has increased, and thus gauge whether I have made any progress myself.

(3) Difficult to Depart from Tradition: This Book is Christian

But one thing I seem to understand now is that this book is ultimately Christian, in the broadest sense of the word. After experiencing much.

Thus Christopher understood old Halton's wisdom, that every morning, before writing, he should kneel... "Watch and pray." Pray to God, asking him to be with you. Communicate with the spirit of life with piety and love. (Page 2090)

On page 2289, there is a reference to the passage in the "Gospel" where Mary Magdalene encounters the gardener. The translator did not add a note, which I think is a pity, because this passage is very interesting, and it is mentioned again four pages later, and even includes some dialogue. According to that passage in the "New Testament," "Gospel of John," Mary Magdalene, in general Chinese translations, is called Mary of Magdala, from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons. (According to our present view, she should be a talented and sharp-edged woman with mental disorder, and Jesus healed her mental disorder.) The first person Jesus saw after his resurrection was her, and she initially thought Jesus was the gardener. In this book, Christopher, after receiving the news of Grazia's death, drew his own strength from this passage. Is believing in resurrection superstition? Romain Rolland made Christopher believe in resurrection.

This is a huge work, of indescribable length, breadth, height, and depth. Not to mention the author's genius, the translator's erudition and hard work deserve the gratitude of those of us who do not understand French but wish to read this book.

The day you see Christopher's face is the day you will die but not die from misfortune. (Latin inscription under the statue of Saint Christopher in front of an old church door)

The long night is long, but it will eventually reach the end. The free souls of all countries who suffer and struggle will finally reach the other shore, welcoming the dawn and peace.

### From the 155th Anniversary of Mozart's Birth: On Testing Musical Genius

— Liang You Ting

If one asks, "Who is greater, Beethoven or Mozart?" that is a very foolish question. However, in fact, the general public is more familiar with Beethoven and neglects the supremely talented musical prodigy, Mozart.

Why say he was a prodigy? Because he indeed began learning the harpsichord at the age of three, could play waltzes in triple time and began composing fragments of music at the age of four, and performed publicly at the age of five; therefore, although he died young at the age of thirty-five, in those thirty years, his life was completely devoted to music, his works, his voice, representing his spirit and living forever.

Perhaps some people doubt: saying that he composed at the age of four sounds like a myth, and is probably an exaggeration. In fact, regarding Mozart's historical details, many historical books can prove that it is not a fabrication. The authoritative music forum, Paul Bekker's "The Story of Music," also has an unparalleled admiration for Mozart. He said: "Although there have been many musical prodigies throughout history, in any aspect, Mozart's talent is by no means something that ordinary musical prodigies can hope to match." The Encyclopedia Britannica also uses several pages to detail Mozart's life, with almost every year's activities recorded. It also says that Mozart composed at the age of four. (Note: The Western custom of four years old is four full years)

For all art, the factors for success are nothing more than talent and hard work. Mozart's success, although attributed to the proper education by his father (a famous violinist at the time), is mainly due to his rare talent.

Today, on the 155th anniversary of Mozart's birth, as we remember the "divine talent" of the musical sage, we first think of an issue of our own: the wasting of musical talent in China, and the waste of music education.

It must be pointed out that people's musical "innate talent" is unrelated to musical training. This is the result of modern musical education's testing. A junior music school uses the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability to measure a child's sensitivity to music, and sometimes finds one or two children who have not received considerable musical training before the test, but during the test can distinguish very well the pitch of scales, the size of volume, and the strength of tones, etc. For the same reason, if a child has received rigorous training, but he has no talent, then his performance in front of the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability will still be poor.

Therefore, although China has always had a very low level of music and music education is not widespread, in a population of ten thousand people, who knows if there is not an innate talent like Mozart? Or a prodigy similar to Mozart?

However, our musical talents are not easily discovered, nor will they be valued, let alone cultivated. Music schools are not necessarily full of geniuses, and true geniuses are often misled by their parents or by society. Furthermore, how many people can receive the baptism of music education from the age of three, like Mozart?

Therefore, many talents are wasted, and many people who are not suitable for becoming music experts are sent to specialized schools, wasting themselves and wasting the public.

My statement is not to say that music must be exclusive to "geniuses," but to say that people with low musical sensitivity can just entertain themselves with music or appreciate others' performances, and do not need to engage in the hard training of music experts. Because that would be futile.

In the United States, the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability are already widely used. There was once an eleven-year-old child who was singled out from the crowd. His family was poor, but his talent was outstanding. After testing, he received learning opportunities. Later, when he graduated from music school, he received four scholarships; at the age of twenty, he was the conductor of a symphony orchestra. There is also the fact that an elderly mother in her sixties hoped that her daughter would become a pianist, but she studied hard for two thousand hours of piano but still had little success; after testing, it was proved that her talent was too poor. Therefore, she happily gave up the hard practice of piano and became a shop clerk.

The famous American baritone Lawrence Tibbett was also tested, and the result, as expected, was that he was one of the top 3%.

From commemorating the musical prodigy Mozart, to thinking about the cultivation of musical talent, and then to thinking about China's music education, I really don't know where to begin.

Parents rarely discover their children's artistic talents, and even if they do, they rarely agree to let them study music, because music will not lead to success. However, the achievement of music must be due to hard practice from an early age, and it must be talent.

The establishment of the National Conservatory of Music's junior class is said to be in response to this; they also use the Seashore Tests of Musical Ability. However, there are too few parents who are willing to send their children to the junior class to study music for life; this is the fatal flaw of the junior music class, and also the fatal flaw of Chinese music!

We commemorate Mozart with deep sorrow, and we also look forward to the road ahead for our own music education with deep sorrow.

### Rainy Night

— Tao Xiong

It was already dark, and the rain had not stopped. I had been cooped up in the house all day and felt really bored. It was impossible to find someone to talk to, and there was nowhere to go for a walk. When I tried reading, I forgot the beginning after reading the end; when I tried writing, I couldn't write anything at all. Loneliness and solitude stole into my heart like thieves, making me feel infinitely troubled.

I seemed to see her shadow flickering before my eyes, and the words she had said rang in my ears again. It was really ghostly! Why did her shadow stick to my brain like a thin film?

Impatiently, I got up, found an empty bottle in the corner of the room, picked up my umbrella, and went out to buy a bottle of wine and a packet of peanuts. When I came back and poured the wine into a glass, I only thought: I'll just get half-drunk and go to sleep. Who knew, this devilish thing called wine often controls a person's will, it tempts you like a demon, making you drink until you're completely drunk.

After drinking the wine, my head swelled, my heart burned, the whites of my eyes turned red, and the infinite sorrow in my chest had to be vented to feel better, otherwise, I wanted to find someone to fight to feel relieved!

I could no longer control myself, and disregarding everything, I rushed out of the door, soaking in the rain, aimlessly walking down the street, my weak eyes half-open and half-closed, staggering, mumbling something. Her moon-like face, star-like eyes, and youthfully vibrant and seductive body were always flashing before me. Her smiling glance back and her delicate voice were always jumping in my memory. This gentle and kind girl gave me infinite joy and happiness, but also brought pain and trouble.

I finished walking one street, turned the corner, and walked down the second. The rain was still falling, there were few pedestrians, and there were hardly any cars. I boldly staggered in the middle of the road, the rainwater dripped down my collar into my back, feeling cool and comfortable. Suddenly, a car screeched to a halt behind me, and the driver stuck his head out and cursed: "Pig! Are you looking to die?"

I didn't say anything, just gave him a contemptuous grimace, and walked towards the side of the road. But he didn't let go of this opportunity to curse. "If you want to die, go jump into the Huangpu River!"

I didn't take it to heart and continued walking forward. Before long, I stopped on the sidewalk at the intersection, leaning against a triangular telephone pole. I felt thirsty and wanted to drink water, but there was no way. A trolleybus suddenly stopped beside me, the lights inside shining on me, and several people got out of the car. It was only then that I realized I was standing there. She was smiling and walking towards me from over there. I excitedly went up to greet her and shake her hand, but suddenly she disappeared! Disappointed, I looked around, cursing angrily: Ghost!

The trolleybus also turned the corner and left.

I walked into the third street, the streetlights only emitted a dim and weak light, the street was still dark, and people walking towards me could not be seen. I was thirsty and also starting to feel tired, leaning against a crooked tree to rest, my eyes slowly closing, my legs unable to support my whole body; so I hugged this sycamore tree to keep myself standing. It was only then that I realized that I was standing opposite her house. I saw lights shining from the house upstairs, and I thought: maybe they can give me a glass of water to drink, no, it's better to look up and beg God! I raised my head and opened my mouth, letting the rainwater drip into my mouth. A sycamore leaf was knocked down by the water, so I picked it up and sucked the rainwater on it with my mouth, although the amount was so small, it gave me a refreshing feeling.

The lights in the building across the street grew brighter, and shadows were moving. Who knows that in this modern building, there are still some remnants of feudalism! She is a member of this family, but she has no freedom of personal action, everything must be in accordance with the family's will, and the family's representative is her own widowed mother.

Last Christmas, her mother tied one of her legs with a rope? She had therefore drunk wine once and walked into a dance hall she had always hated, preparing to endure the fate bestowed by God - a path of a virtuous wife and good mother!

I thought of what a friend had said to me: Catholics are the most conservative, and their rules are the strictest, they will never marry non-Catholics!

I shuddered!

Rainwater dripped from my hair onto my face, my coat was soaked and had seeped into my underwear, and my trouser legs were stuck to my legs and were so heavy. I leaned against the tree, the tree knots pricking me, so I moved to the triangular cement pole two steps away from the tree to lean against.

Past events flashed through my mind like a dream, she had been drawn into this dream by me, and when the dream cleared, everything was forgotten. But this is not a dream, it is a fact!

The night was already very late! I stopped a passing car, I couldn't remember if I said anything to him. Because when I woke up, I was already lying in bed, the quilt and mattress were soaked, I changed my clothes as if I had come out of the river, I felt my head was too heavy to support, so I slept for a day.

Although I hate her a little, it also makes me miss her more!

The rainy night has long passed. But the emotion of longing still exists, the same as in the rainy night.

### Exercise

— Raphael

Raphael (Raphael Sanzio 1483-1520) was also a great master of the Italian Renaissance, but unfortunately he died young and left fewer works behind. His works are not as rigid as Michelangelo's, nor as mysterious as da Vinci's, but possess a full and beautiful charm.

### A Short Biography of the Musical Prodigy Mozart

— Hong Zanying

The German composer Mozart has always been known as a "musical prodigy," with unsurpassed genius and a magnificent spirit in his works. Some say he was Austrian, but in fact he was from Salzburg, a city in southern Germany, and later moved to Vienna; Vienna was then the world's musical capital, and musicians gathered here.

Mozart was born on January 27, 1756. His father was a talented violinist who served in a monastery. When Mozart was three years old, he studied piano with his sister. He was gifted and intelligent, and at the age of six he traveled with his father and sister to perform in various places. The two young siblings sat in front of the piano, skillfully playing with their small arms, and all who listened were amazed.

Mozart has a very famous anecdote: Once, he was performing in front of the Austrian Emperor. After the performance, he actually sat on the Queen's lap, kissed her neck, and pointed to the Princess, saying, "I want to marry her." This shows his passionate and unrestrained nature, which he had from a young age.

Mozart's works cover all departments, vocal music, instrumental music, symphonies, and religious music all have brilliant expressions. His symphonies are as famous as Beethoven's. Some people may think that Mozart's works are not easy to accept, but in fact his works are the most revolutionary. Paul Bekker said that he was "the first person to risk his life for freedom. His personality and thoughts are expressed in his works."

I believe that "high art is often lonely," is inevitable, and this has not affected the lasting value of Mozart's works in musical history.

Poverty and unrequited love plagued Mozart. In terms of his contribution to music, he was successful, he dedicated his entire life, but for him personally, he was traveling everywhere after the age of six, and as a result, he died at the age of only thirty-five from cold. He passed away on December 5, 1791 (that is, today, 155 years ago), and his soul returned to heaven amidst worldwide mourning.

May Mozart be aware of our distant memorial to him in heaven!

### Happy to Meet the Layman Daqian on the Sea and Receive a Poem as a Gift

— Zhou Xin

Ten years ago, we parted at Wumen, and today we meet on the sea. There are more new peaks under your wrist, and in your eyes there is no old pavilion; the princes share a common taste (Xin Yu has also recently come to Shanghai), the disciples follow you are also extraordinary talents (Yu Shengming has recently joined your school); I beg for a corner of your Yellow Mountain, and I hope to be able to compensate for the ashes left by the calamity. (You once painted a picture of Yellow Mountain for me and wrote a long postscript to record it, which was burned in the fire during the war, and I regret it to this day.)

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 113

— Ye Jingfeng

However, upon further reflection, it didn't feel right. Even if Pingzi was naughty, he wouldn't play a prank to this extent. The small piece of paper must contain important news, or secrets related to me personally. Thinking of this, I carefully hid the small piece of paper again. Just after taking a couple of puffs of cigarette, a thought suddenly struck me. I immediately tore off a blank page from my notebook. Looking around, I saw a beautifully written Mi Fu style calligraphy on a hanging scroll on the wall. The words were Li Houzhu's little poem, "When will the spring flowers and autumn moon end? How much do we know of past events..." I changed my handwriting, and casually used the school's propelling pencil to write on the blank page, "Spring flowers and autumn moon are spent casually, you know how much of the past."

Just as He Jian finished writing and folding it, he suddenly heard a faint sound of footsteps outside the door. He quickly hid the written slip in the cigarette case, put the cigarette case in his pocket, and put the notebook and pencil away as before. Just then, he heard two light knocks on the door. Before he could answer, the door opened.

He Jian turned to look and saw that it was not the one-eyed gentleman, but a Japanese man in a Western suit, with a calm and agile demeanor. He entered the room and bowed respectfully to He Jian:

"Are you Mr. He Jian? ... The Chancellor invites you to see him." He Jian stood up to greet him and returned the bow in the same manner, ready to leave. The man stretched out his hands and made a gesture, "I'm sorry." He bowed again, "There is a small formality here. I am responsible for all guests who come to see the Chancellor... I am truly sorry... truly sorry." He blocked the way.

He Jian understood what he meant, knowing that he wanted to search him. He elegantly took out the things in his pockets and placed them on the central round table, then walked over and asked the man to search him. The man looked at He Jian and said that there was no need to search his person, but he would have to take two items from the table, which he was very sorry about. He walked over and first picked up the propelling pencil, showing the Japanese habit of suspecting everything. He looked at it, tapped it, and then put it aside. The second item was the exquisite cigarette case, which he also inspected carefully. He found the folded piece of paper, glanced at it, and put it back as it was. Fortunately, this Japanese man was probably not of 100% pure blood, and his movements were not as dull, trivial, clumsy, and hesitant as those of the "purebred."

"The procedure is complete... It's just that... the school pencil and this cigarette case will have to be kept by me temporarily. I am very sorry."

Only then did He Jian, led by the man, pass through the large hall and walk through two winding corridors. The entire architectural design and style here were completely Europeanized. At the end of the corridor, the man stepped forward and gently opened the small door at the end, then made another bow and invited He Jian to enter. As the small door opened, He Jian heard a burst of soft and elegant music, like a samisen or a Chinese zither.

As He Jian stepped into the door, he suddenly felt a change of scenery. Everything was antique and classical, as if he had returned to the pure Japanese style of "Hakkō ichiu." Directly in front of him was a screen, a very elegant local art product. Behind the screen was a row of four lattice doors, with four "wind-defeating" lamps hanging above the doors and the screen. Although the lamps were Japanese style, they were electric lamps inside. As soon as He Jian stepped into the door, two heavily made-up and very enchanting women emerged from behind the screen, as if they were crawling out. It could also be said that they were bowing and crawling out all the way. Although the two women did not dare to speak loudly, they kept muttering, "Good evening," and "You've worked hard," and so on. When they were still two steps away from He Jian, the two women simply knelt down together and kowtowed incessantly. After kowtowing, the two formally crawled over, one on each side, and rushed to He Jian's legs to take off his leather shoes.

### Deposits

— Shaofu

The problem of repaying pre-war deposits has repeatedly caused disputes and lawsuits in court. If the authorities do not quickly agree on a solution to this problem, it will continue to emerge endlessly, causing hardship for the courts, banks, and depositors, and making it impossible to cope.

I once saw a middle-aged woman crying and making a scene in the Shanghai Bank, demanding that the bank repay her pre-war deposit at two thousand times the original amount. Naturally, this crying and making a scene had no result, but at that moment, who among those present (even the bank staff) did not sympathize with the middle-aged woman?

The Shanghai District Court once ruled on a similar dispute, ordering repayment at one thousand times the principal and interest at maturity. This was the first precedent for resolving pre-war deposit repayment disputes since the victory, and may serve as a reference for financial or administrative authorities when deliberating on solutions in the future.

When deliberating on solutions in the future, we believe that a compromise is necessary to be fair, so that depositors do not suffer too much loss, and the burden on banks should also be taken into account. In short, both sides must suffer a little loss.

Currency depreciation affects everything. This is an unavoidable damage in war. We cannot draw on the compensation from the defeated aggressor countries to pay for it, but we can take a step back and think, what if this deposit was lost in the war? Wouldn't millions of people be bankrupted? As for the banks, they may as well think more about the interests of depositors. Even if they slightly increase the burden, they have to grit their teeth and sacrifice.

### If I Opened a Funeral Home

— Takinotani

Shanghai people are the most clever in doing business. Not only do they borrow names like "Lu Gao Jian" and "Wang Mazi" as they are, but even locally made Chinese goods are fully equipped with Western texts. If they are forced to have a Chinese name, it is just translated from Western texts. Even more convenient and time-saving is to directly borrow foreign trademarks. For example, if there is a dog-head brand of cigarettes in the United States, and a cat-head brand of foreign wine in the United Kingdom, and they sell well, Shanghai will definitely have dog-head and cat-head brands of soap, handkerchiefs, and the like.

Following the example, the author makes the following design book:

(1) If I open a funeral home, I must borrow the name of the famous watch brand "Omega" as the name of the hall. Because "Omega" is the last letter of the Greek alphabet "Ω", meaning "last", "finished", "death".

(2) If I build a private railway, its logo must borrow the "Camel" of the famous American cigarette, to show that the driving speed is faster than the state-owned railway.

(3) If I open a flower shop, I want to use Forget-me-not flower as a trademark. The flower veins in the center of each petal are particularly emphasized!!! (Alas! Alas! Alas!) Three English letters, so that the lovelorn can vent a sigh.

(4) It is said that some large-scale recruitment agencies in the United States specialize in providing temporary workers to bosses of striking factories. If I also make a trademark of (Lucky Strike), because the direct translation can be used as "Lucky Strike"!

(5) If I open a recruitment agency specializing in supplying child labor to major manufacturers, then I will not hesitate to borrow the name of the American "Klim" milk powder, because "Klim" is KLIM, which is the reverse writing of "牛乳" MILK, and I secretly mean that the child labor introduction office may not be named "Dairy Cow".

(6) After talking about business, if I also join in the fun and make a so-called "political party", then the Swiss watch brand "Movado" is just right as "Party" and "Esperanto" (that is, "Esperanto") means "activities, continue activities".

(7) Let's talk about buying and selling again. If I open a hat shop specializing in supplying all kinds of people who are intent on making a fortune, then the famous American Eversharp ("Yongjian") brand of propelling pencil is very readily available, isn't it?

(8) Someone asked me, if you run a banknote printing company, what kind of foreign-flavored store name would you give it? Answer: Borrow the American readily available flashlight brand "Eveready", "Permanent Preparation", Permanent Preparation also.

(9) Say a digression. If someone runs a women's apartment that allows men to enter and exit, but prohibits this and that nonsense, then a readily available American commodity name for women only, called "Kotex" looks like "Hotel", how about it?

(10) But I still can't think of a suitable use to borrow this trademark: give, a woodpecker tied with a rope. That is a famous European household medicine for parents who do not want to have children.

All of the above are copyrighted, and may not be used in practice without the permission of "Free Talk". OIC, I know. (The last three foreign letters. It's just right to use as the trademark of the eyewear store. Just right.)

Two American teenagers (left and right, sixteen years old and seventeen years old) were sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to kill their father.

Shanghai Cross-section

### The Organization of Beggars 7

— Huang Jiamo

Opening Car Doors

Shanghai's cars are the best in the country. When cars stop or start on the street, it also creates an opportunity for almsgiving. At this moment, the old brothers of the beggar gang are not willing to miss it easily; because this is also a new way for the local kids to make money. Those who take cars are nothing more than rich old men and rich wives. The beggars are quick to open and close the car doors for them. In the pre-war period, they could get one yuan or several jiao for a little effort, but now they can get several hundred yuan. In places with more cars coming and going, they can have a very good income within an hour. Therefore, they follow suit, and the brothers in the gang are blinded by profit and flock to it. At present, there are more than 1,000 people in the city who specialize in this business. Their activity places are nothing more than the front and near of major restaurants, hotels, theaters, and dance halls. There are also places where books are gathered, as well as banks, apartments, and so on. They wait, and when they see a car parked, they run over to open the car door. After the rich old men get out of the car, they hurriedly close the car door with a shout, so they have a reason to ask the rich old men for money. They also say auspicious words. If they don't give money, they immediately retaliate with unfavorable and evil voices. Because once the rich old men enter the gate, they lose the opportunity to make money. If they don't call out quickly, they will miss the opportunity. The rich old men have learned from the past experience of being scolded, and know that it is not good not to give, so they are willing to pay to dismiss them quickly. But rich people often don't have change on them. They only have one or two thousand bills when they reach into their pockets. When there is no way, they have to grit their teeth and pay. This is all the good luck of the beggars. No wonder they enjoy it.

Sometimes when the drivers leave the car for something, they can also act as guards. If the car owner drives by himself, the beggars can volunteer to serve as guards. In fact, these people do not have the ability to guard, but only have the ability to receive rewards. When the car owner comes back, they all boast about their achievements in a plausible way.

In order to open car doors and earn a good income, the sections are rich and poor. The uncles of the gang have to divide the territory clearly. On the one hand, to avoid the same gang fighting, on the other hand, they can distribute the territory and reject the covetous eyes of laymen and rascals. However, only the children and the old and weak brothers are allowed to pull the car doors, because the old and young beggars are more likely to receive alms, but the young and strong beggars are all abandoned.

Rewards for Funerals and Celebrations

Beggars in various parts of China have always been in close contact with the people. Especially when holding wedding, funeral, birthday, and celebration ceremonies, it is always inevitable to be disturbed by the visit of beggars. This custom has been popular since ancient times. In Shanghai, the old brothers of the beggar gang are in the lead because of the geographical advantage and the harmony of people. This excellent job has always been regarded as a forbidden fruit, and other beggar gangs are not allowed to intervene.

The wealth of Shanghai residents is far better than that of the inland, and the customs are also fond of face. The uncle gangs in various sections are idle on weekdays, specializing in inquiring about weddings and funerals in their jurisdiction. They are really omnipotent, and the communication network is far and wide. The beggars linger in the streets and alleys all day long, and as soon as they get the news, they immediately report to the uncle generation, one pass ten, ten pass one hundred, and then the uncle reports to the beggar leader. At that time, they will lead the beggars to the funeral and celebration to ask for money. The way to ask for money is different for red and white matters. Please describe them separately:

### When a Fire Occurs

— Maozai translated from Reader's Digest

(Editor's note: This is an article from the June "Reader's Digest". Although the time is not fresh, but for the sake of the dry weather, the authorities are promoting fire prevention, it seems necessary to introduce it to readers.)

Firefighters always say that the most perfect house will also be the easiest to run out of from the inside. We can also say that the best homeowner is the one who knows how to quickly escape to the outside of the house in case of fire.

Do you think this is ordinary and very simple? Then, in the cities of the western United States, there are two teenagers who, when a fire occurs, they have the opportunity to cross from their bedroom to the balcony, and then step on the roof and jump safely into the garden below; however, they died at the door of the third-floor bedroom; the reason is nothing else, they, just like ordinary people, in the extreme panic after discovering the fire, went straight to the ladder - an action that can never be completed.

Fire Downstairs

Three-quarters of fire deaths are due to fire downstairs, hot smoke rising, and suffocation upstairs; when the fire burns below, smoke, flammable gases, and temperatures as high as eight hundred or one thousand degrees quickly spread to the upper part of the house; just imagine, waking up from a dream, dazed, panicked, and rushing out of the bedroom to the stairs, can you not fall to the ground halfway? The most pitiful thing is that these victims had stopped breathing long before the flames reached them, and they had the opportunity to escape?

Further thinking and training can indeed save thousands of deaths. You wake up and smell a very strong smell of smoke, remember, do not jump up and open the door. You should raise your palm and press it on the door above your head. If a wooden board is hot, do not open the door. Hot wooden boards or doorknobs show that the space outside the bedroom is full of suffocating smoke and flames. It is impossible to go to the stairs.

You should keep the door closed and try to get out of the window, or call for help at the window. With the door blocking this general current, you can wait for the savior to arrive, and you have more chances to be saved.

Assuming that you find that the door is not hot, you should also open it carefully; use your feet and buttocks to hold the door tightly, ready to close it at any time, with one hand raised and pressed on the door seam above your head, slightly open one or two inches to test for pressure or hot steam. If there is, close it quickly and seek a way out to the window.

Closing Door Techniques

Next, let's talk about the technique of closing the door; often, when we find that a fire has occurred, we are embarrassed and rush out of the door in a hurry, leaving the door wide open; we must know that the result of opening the door of the burning room will make the accumulated smoke and flames and hot steam spread horizontally and vertically to all parts of the entire house and accelerate its end. We should absolutely close the door at the right time, so that the flames and ripe smoke are confined in one room. Just for a few minutes of delay, the entire house may have the hope of being preserved.

Let's describe a fact. A young wife wanted to use some kerosene to light the gas in the kitchen. Unfortunately, the explosion of the gas filled the entire kitchen with flames; she was at a loss. When the horror was first settled, the first thought that came into her mind was the baby sleeping upstairs. She turned around and flew upstairs, snatched the child, and returned downstairs.

At the same time, the neighbors also discovered it and immediately called the fire department within a mile. The fire department came quickly, but when they arrived, they found that the pair of poor mothers and children were lying upstairs.

Her face showed the pain of being strangled by smoke and fire. Undoubtedly, they were killed by the rising smoke and flames - the only reason was that she did not close the door of the burning kitchen.

Firefighters admit that millions of the dead would be saved if they could understand, remember, and implement these two simple rules - opening and closing the door - they would still be happy and living happily.

Remember, you - my friend!

### Talking about Water Houses

— Hong Yu

It is reported that someone proposed: Land houses can be extended to the water. In fact, people living on the water, in addition to another ethnic group in Fujian Province, the "boat people", Cangwu in Guangxi, at the intersection of the Gui River and the Xun River, because the land area is small, the families living in the water, accounting for one-third. According to the structure of the boat, wooden boats are arranged horizontally below, and wooden boards are placed on top to create flat houses or buildings. There are also magnificent buildings that make people envious. Speaking of Shanghai), wasn't there also a floating hotel on the Bund along the Huangpu River outside Beijing Road before the war? The decoration was gorgeous, and there were floors and platforms, with noble Western food and cold drinks, specially supplied to the general wealthy gentlemen, leisurely spending the summer there. During the occupation, the enemy used it as a gendarmerie residence, and I don't know how many tragedies were staged in it! Now this floating hotel, the outline is still there, but the interior is completely different, so it has not been repaired and is open to the public for use. Others, like the Suzhou River area, many poor people have built a lot of camp-style thatched huts along the shore and riverside, but the foundations have wooden stakes nailed in the water. Those residents, since they do not have to pay housing donations and land taxes, are leisurely humming in it. "Three flowers bloom, again and again" of the clear song. According to this, building houses on the water is indeed very possible. But it seems impossible to rely on it to solve the housing shortage. Because the key to the housing shortage is not the real lack of houses, but the lack of large yellow croaker and small yellow croaker. Now some people set this daydream, to expand the territory on the water, in fact, they are also calculating that since it is near the water, it is easy to catch fish. But it should be noted that although the Huangpu River has the hat of the word Huang, it lacks the word "gold" below. At the same time, the yellow croaker is not produced in the Pujiang River, but must go to the sea to catch it. Knowing this, we can know that there are many empty spaces in Zhabei and Nanshi, so there is no need to "hang and langdang" to daydream on the water.

Low Key

### Prohibition

— Yu Yuan

If usury were to be completely eliminated one day due to the most severe prohibitions, my prediction is: one, those who make a living from usury will lose their jobs; two, hot money will grab gold; three, more than two-tenths of the shops will immediately declare bankruptcy; four, Chinese stocks will plummet to the point where no one dares to buy.

### Pressure

— Yu

Nanjing and Shanghai are eliminating pedicabs, and inland cities are eliminating wheelbarrows; this elimination means pressing down one level. Pedicabs go to inland cities, and wheelbarrows go to the countryside.

### Tears

— Chen Dexin

"When the candle tears fall, the people's tears fall, and where the songs are high, the complaints are high!" Please enjoy and use, gentlemen and ladies who are free and easy day and night, savor it more! Do more good! A boat can carry you, and it can also overturn you, be careful!

### Cold

— Hesong

Everyone says it's cold this year, but I think that in addition to the weather factors, the more important thing should be that everyone's clothes are less than in previous years.

### Frozen

Recently, people have often frozen to death, and most of them are children.

I still remember that a few days ago, some young people lined up to express their gratitude to the municipal government and other agencies. Because they were originally wandering in the streets, but now they are "not afraid of hunger and freezing." The mayor said in his reply that it is the government's responsibility to raise and care for the wandering.

I hear more people expressing their gratitude to the government!

### Remembering Mr. Mo Dehui

— Gan Lai

Recently, there have been rumors that the government is about to reorganize, and the seat of the President of the Executive Yuan has become the center of speculation and discussion from all sides. A few days ago, it was rumored that Zhang Qun and Sun Ke had the highest voice, and recently it was suddenly rumored that Mo Dehui had a good hope. Regarding Zhang and Sun, this journal has already recorded them before. Now, let me talk about this old Mr. Mo.

Mr. Mo is sixty-four years old this year, with the alias of Liu Chen, originally from Shuangcheng County, Jilin. After graduating from the regular course of Beiyang Higher Police Academy, he served in the police circles of Harbin. He served as the director of the Harbin Police Bureau, and the magistrates of Shuangcheng, Yushu, and Binjiang counties in Jilin Province. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he served as a consultant for the Headquarters of the Commander of the Security of the Three Eastern Provinces. In the fifteenth year, he served as the acting governor of Fengtian Province. When Zhang Zuolin was bombed and killed at the Huanggu Tun Railway Station, Mr. Mo was nearby and suffered minor injuries.

In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he took office as a member of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, the Chairman and Supervisor of the China Eastern Railway. In May of the same year, he was sent to Soviet Russia as the full representative of our country to the Sino-Soviet Conference. He had experience in negotiating with Russian officials. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Russian Emperor awarded Mr. Mo the St. Stanislaus Third Class Medal.

Mr. Mo's lifelong behavior can be summarized by the eight characters "integrity and kindness". He does not like to be flattered. On the contrary, if a friend can frankly criticize his faults, Mr. Mo will be very happy and immediately correct them.

For a period of time, he would stay in his hometown and live alone, as a person in the opposition. He devoted himself to local autonomy and education and other matters, so in today's Northeast, Mr. Mo is still a "popular figure."

After the victory, the Northeast could not be successfully recovered, and then the flames of war ignited. Mr. Mo looked at his hometown from afar, unable to return home, and was saddened by national affairs. He once wept bitterly in public and became a kind-hearted old man.

Mr. Mo Dehui had an excellent political reputation in the past. Today, with a detached position of being non-partisan and non-factional, he is not a suitable candidate for an important position in the central government.

### Who is the Murderer?

— Ge Chunliang

In a fleeting moment like a shooting star, Sullivan, a once prominent tycoon, was suddenly shot dead, collapsing with bullets riddling his body on the stone steps in front of the National Farm.

He was a cruel murderer, feared not only by the shop owners extorted by his underlings but also by his own followers. His arrogance and selfishness grew in proportion to his power, but when he refused to share the spoils equally and sought to enrich himself alone, he was killed.

Before the trial, Professor Hodaney knew that eight of his disciples were planning to "send him off." Their names were (1) Bai Mou, (2) Ma Er, (3) Li Jin, (4) Wu Te, (5) Ye Jiu, (6) Xu Xin, (7) Qiao Sheng, (8) Bao Dexing—these were the most formidable of the disciples—one of whom killed his old man, Sullivan.

After several dangerous investigations, Professor Hodaney learned the following facts.

(1) Bai Mou, Li Jin, and the murderer were the most dissatisfied with Sullivan.

(2) Among the eight, one was Sullivan's personal bodyguard (private protector), and it was very secret; only Ye Jiu and Qiao Sheng knew who he was.

(3) The day before the murder, Xu Xin, Bao Dexing, Bai Mou, and the personal bodyguard lost a lot of money in the casino.

(4) A week ago, Ma Er, Ye Jiu, and the murderer jointly demanded that Sullivan publicly and equally distribute the spoils. After being refused, Wu Te and the murderer persuaded the personal bodyguard to "take him out," but it was unsuccessful.

(5) In this revolt against Sullivan, the leaders were Xu Xin, Bao Dexing, and the murderer.

All eight have been arrested. Since they refuse to tell the truth, Professor Hodaney, based on the above five facts, identified who the personal bodyguard was and who the murderer was.

Who is it? Who is the personal bodyguard? Who is the murderer? (Translated from Pockor Ententainer)

The answer will be revealed tomorrow.
