Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech

[Special Dispatch from Guling by Central News Agency, 24th] The following is Chairman Chiang's speech at the Lushan Summer Camp: It has been nine years since the end of the Lushan Summer Training Corps, which began on July 7th of the 26th year of the Republic [1937] when the War of Resistance started. During these nine years, our nation has encountered unprecedented dangers and hardships. Fortunately, thanks to the bloodshed and sacrifice of the people and soldiers across the country, we were able to achieve final victory. In this first summer after the victory, it is truly a rare opportunity for all our young people to participate in the Lushan Summer Camp to receive training. As you enter the camp today, I hope everyone will recognize the significance and purpose of our training. Under the guidance of your teachers and officers, study and learn, cultivate your body and mind, and especially hone your moral character and forge your integrity, so as not to fail as followers of the Three Principles of the People and to fulfill your great mission of revolution and national reconstruction.

As everyone knows, since the September 18th Incident, China has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made calamities, internal troubles and external threats coming one after another. By the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the crisis of the nation had reached its extreme point. At that time, most people in the country had lost confidence in the future of national revival and the success of the revolutionary cause, believing that the national crisis was beyond salvation. It was precisely at this time of national crisis and popular demoralization that we founded the Lushan Training Corps in the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. From then on, once a year, we gathered military and political cadres to study the situation of the National Revolution, discuss major domestic and foreign policies, strengthen resolve, cultivate spirit, strive for self-improvement, and prepare for a final showdown with all reactionary and aggressive forces at home and abroad, as well as false revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. Finally, in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], as the Japanese寇’s aggression against China intensified day by day, forcing us to the final moment when we could no longer tolerate it, we decided to launch a full-scale War of Resistance against Japan. Therefore, our Party led the military and civilians, concentrated our forces, persevered, became more courageous in the face of setbacks, fought hard for eight years, and finally achieved the goal of driving out the enemy and recovering our national territory today. It can be said that this victory is all due to the effects achieved by the five years of summer training at the Lushan Training Corps. This five years of summer training in Lushan can be said to be the only pivotal force for our Chinese nation to be reborn from the dead and to turn danger into safety. This great historical significance is something that our young people must know.

Because the past Lushan Training had such great achievements, the officers and students of our Lushan Summer Camp today must especially recognize the importance of the mission you are shouldering. You must know that our Lushan Summer Camp this year is different from the summer camps of previous years. Therefore, in the camp, we must not only cultivate our body and mind and study academics, but also recognize the current situation, the revolutionary situation, and the future of our nation. Therefore, we must especially study how to seek social stability, the people's welfare, and national unity, and ensure the great victory of the War of Resistance that our soldiers and civilians have won with sacrifice and bloodshed over the past eight years, in order to implement the Three Principles of the People and complete the modern construction of the Republic of China. We must have clear answers to these questions, and be able to put them into practice, be practical and realistic, continue our spirit of resistance, not fail our revolutionary integrity, cultivate a great personality, lead the youth, be the vanguard of the people, remain consistent throughout, not fail to be a model for the people, and not fail to be followers of the Three Principles of the People. Only then can we achieve the purpose of participating in this Lushan Summer Camp.

### Tang Enbo Talks About the War in Northern Jiangsu

The National Army Fights Back in Self-Defense

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 24th] Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Tang Enbo, recently arrived in Nanjing. The reporter made a special visit to his private residence to talk about the situation of the war in Northern Jiangsu. Mr. Tang first used a journalistic term, saying, "We military personnel who work in the field very much hope that those who work in the office will be able to achieve successful political negotiations." He then said, "We do not want to fight, but to fight back. They attacked us, so we cannot but fight back. As for Northern Jiangsu, we have made appropriate defenses for self-defense, and there is absolutely no possibility of Shanghai being threatened. The 共 army's offensive tactics are all disruptive, so although there are many people, they are not accustomed to positional warfare. The most suffering people at present are the refugees in Northern Jiangsu, who are displaced and in extremely miserable conditions. As for the territory of Nantong County, the 共 army has now been cleared, and it is more peaceful than it was two months ago." It is heard that Mr. Tang will still go to a certain place in Northern Jiangsu in the coming days to inspect, and his command headquarters will be moved from Wuxi to the capital.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by Central News Agency, 24th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 4:30 PM on the 24th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:

Question: Will peace talks be resumed soon, and will they be held in Nanjing or Guling?

Minister Peng replied: Peace talks have never stopped, and they can be held in Nanjing or Guling at any time.

Question: The Central Daily News recently stated that the government will implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. To what extent is this news correct?

Minister Peng replied: The government's efforts to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, such as the government taking over the entire Northeast, reorganizing the army, and restoring transportation, have all encountered unexpected obstacles. Recently, the government decided to automatically implement the most important resolution of the Political Consultative Conference, which is to convene a National Assembly on a regular basis. This date is quite far away in order to have sufficient preparation time, but the 共 side has objected to this date without giving sufficient reasons. The government will continue to work in this direction. In short, the most important thing in the economic aspect at present is to restore railway transportation, especially the railways in Shandong. If this is done, it will have a major impact on prices. In economics, this is the most important factor. The most important measure in the political aspect is to convene the National Assembly, because this move is the key to ending tutelage and starting constitutional government, urging all parties to quickly achieve it.

I have never drafted the so-called two documents either." The Ambassador said that, "My two days in Lushan allowed me to have four in-depth conversations with Chairman Chiang, which deepened my understanding of the Chinese situation. It is true that I said I was more optimistic when I went down the mountain than when I went up. As for what that foreign reporter said, 'I think both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are suitable for China's national conditions,' these words did not come from my mouth."

At 10:00 AM, General Marshall visited the Embassy and met with the Ambassador for an hour, the content of which was still to exchange views on the National-Communist negotiations. The Ambassador was originally scheduled to go to Beijing yesterday, but he has to stay here because the negotiations have not yet begun.

### U.S. Reiterates Policy Towards China; Promote Peace and Unity; U.S. Newspaper Hopes for National-Communist Cooperation and Self-Help

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] A State Department spokesman reiterated today the U.S. policy towards China: intending to unite all parties and factions to form a coalition government. At a press conference held by the spokesman, when asked about the important declaration made by Madam Sun Soong Qingling in Shanghai, which advocated the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, what was the opinion of the U.S. government? The spokesman answered with the above statement, and said, "The U.S. policy towards China has been announced repeatedly, which is to promote the unity of China, and this is also the mission of Special Envoy Marshall in China." The spokesman also asked the reporters to pay attention to the recent statement by Deputy Secretary of State Acheson on U.S. policy towards China, in which one important sentence was: The United States will do its best to prevent civil war in China and send Japanese troops home.

[This Newspaper News] San Francisco broadcast, Senator Bei Bo said: He does not hesitate to endorse the military aid to China bill, if the munitions provided by the bill will be used for civil war, but he believes that legislation can be formulated to authorize Marshal Marshall to supervise the application of the munitions. In the House of Representatives, Chairman Blum of the Foreign Affairs Committee said: He can find a way to specify this in detail when the committee passes it, but other leaders feel that there is little hope that the bill will be passed in this meeting. In the Senate, the bill is being discussed by the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] The Philadelphia Inquirer commented on the development of the Chinese situation today, calling the resurgence of conflict between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists a "dangerous and deeply disappointing shift." The newspaper continued: "We should do everything we can to prevent a civil war in China, but if U.S. lend-lease military supplies encourage China's belligerent actions, then these supplies should be stopped immediately and efforts should be made to withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China. We should not leave U.S. soldiers and Marines in an unconscious conflict, which will inevitably plunge the Chinese people deeper into the abyss of misery."

The Toledo Blade of Ohio commented in an editorial on July 20th: "Peace cannot be forcibly imposed on China. Only if Chinese leaders cooperate with each other can peace come. If China does not help itself, we cannot help it. The hard work of our special envoy General Marshall will be in vain unless the leaders of both the central government and the Communist Party immediately stop their efforts to undermine peace."

### My Northeastern Industrial Equipment Completely Moved Away by the Soviets: The Largest Natural Resources in the Far East Vanished, Pauley Releases Preliminary Report

[United States News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Edwin Pauley, President Truman's personal representative investigating reparations issues for defeated Axis powers, accused the Soviet Union at a press conference today of excessively removing industrial equipment from Northeast China. He also strongly advocated for implementing the European reparations plan according to the Potsdam Agreement. Pauley's preliminary report includes the details of a 49,000-mile journey across Europe and Asia.

In his prepared statement, Pauley stated: "My report finds the following three main points: There has been no large-scale removal of industrial equipment in the Soviet-controlled area of northern Korea. Many Japanese industries, though still in a state of shutdown, have complete equipment. The industry south of the 38th parallel relies on the industry in the north, and the industry in the north relies on the south. If Korea can obtain Japanese light industry, it can also receive considerable industrial assistance. The situation in Northeast China, in terms of moving industrial equipment, is exactly the opposite of the mood in Korea. According to examples we have seen in Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, and Harbin, all power, steel, mining, gasification, and other manufacturing plants, during the Soviet occupation, had all movable equipment completely removed. It is regrettable that this kind of industrial machinery could not remain in place. This machinery was the pinnacle of Northeast China's natural resources and was considered the largest natural resource in the Far East. The lives and happiness of nine hundred million people benefited from these factories. In my opinion, the people of the Far East will need at least a century to recover their losses. The reparations plan under the Potsdam Agreement has not been successfully implemented. This failure is partly because some countries are unwilling to view the defeated nations as a whole economic unit, as was agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. Unless the occupying powers can cooperate sincerely and strive to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement, we will repeat the mistakes of World War I. After World War I, the Allied powers, including the United States, funded the reconstruction of Germany's war machine, which was then used against us in World War II. At that time, we did not remember the main objective, which was to eliminate Germany's war potential. This time, we must avoid such mistakes. The Potsdam Agreement is a guarantee to prevent such a tragedy. I hope that no country or group of countries will forcibly cancel the Potsdam Agreement." Pauley continued: A policy is being considered to withhold Germany's reparations to the Soviet Union in order to offset the materials removed by the Soviet Union from Northeast China. Pauley also stated: The United States has never agreed to the Soviet Union's request for $10 billion in reparations from Germany, and he personally does not approve of it. Pauley reiterated his own and the U.S. government's belief in the Potsdam Agreement. Pauley also stated: Japan's investment in Northeast China amounted to tens of billions of dollars, of which about $2 billion has been taken away. Northeast China is now reverting to an agricultural economy. Pauley also revealed that he intends to find a way to coordinate actions to move some Japanese factories to Northeast China. General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, has recommended this step to the Far East Commission in Washington.

Today, world peace is indivisible. Therefore, we hope that China will be strong, consolidate its national victory, and consolidate its coastal defense. Although the number of warships given to China by the United States this time is small, its significance is very profound. Mr. and Mrs. Kirk returned to Qingdao by plane in the afternoon.

Regarding the levy of grain, the central government originally stipulated that this province’s land tax for this year, according to pre-war rates, would be collected in rice at three dou per yuan, plus a 30% (nine sheng) levy for public grain, plus an additional 1.5 dou. In total, 5.4 dou of rice would be levied. Subsequently, Chairman Wang and Speaker Leng made several trips to the capital to request a reduction in the levy amount. The Ministry of Food approved a central government reduction in the levy of 0.5 dou, totaling 4.9 dou. This amount would then be collected at a 40% discount, meaning that those who paid one yuan in grain before the war would pay 1.96 dou of rice this year. As for the advance levy of land tax, since the grain collection period is still far off, the military provisions for July, August, and September are not secured and must be advanced. The county was originally assigned 30,000 shis, but after vigorous efforts, it was reduced to 20,000 shis of unhusked rice, which will be processed immediately and must be delivered by the end of August.

Wuxi: All Ten-Plus Silk Factories on Strike

In this county, regarding the issue of wages in the silk industry, Commissioner Xu of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Magistrate Xu convened a meeting on the 17th of this month at the county government to mediate between labor and management. Because labor and management had vastly different opinions, the meeting ended on an unhappy note. On the morning of the 22nd, when work began, female workers in over ten factories in the eastern district suddenly went on strike. When the Industrial Union learned of this, it dispatched personnel to persuade them and convened an emergency meeting of all the female workers to mediate. The issue of resuming work has not yet been resolved. Because the responsible persons of the silk factories have all gone to Shanghai to attend the first board of directors meeting of the Three Districts Silk Industry Association, Magistrate Xu Yuanruo has sent a handwritten note to the Silk Factory Association, urgently telegraphing the association’s president Gao Jingyuan and others to quickly return to Wuxi and await mediation.

Songjiang: Land Tax Grain Levy Decided Amount: The province’s land tax grain levy has been reviewed and decided upon in a meeting convened by the provincial government. The decided amount will be 3 dou of tax per mu, 9 sheng of public grain, and 1 dou advance levied, all calculated at 40%, with the actual levy at 1.96 dou per mu. The advance levied portion will be returned in the future, and the collection is set to begin on September 1st.

Hangzhou: Tian Xiushan Case Submitted to the Capital for Instructions

The notorious bandit Tian Xiushan of eastern Zhejiang, after being captured by the self-defense team in the Wangyu county area, has been escorted to Hangzhou. He was interrogated by the Provincial Security Command, and Tian the Bandit confessed without denial to all the crimes he committed. Currently, the Provincial Security Department believes that the Bandit Tian case is quite complicated. He also has the status of an active military officer, serving as a major general advisor to the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, so a document has been prepared and submitted to the central government for instructions to determine a suitable sentence.

Editorial

### The Path of Local Politics

The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference opened on the 20th of this month. For days, the conference has reviewed the government program, the three-year construction plan, and other administrative measures. The representatives also put forward motions on civil affairs, finance, grain, education, construction, public security, conscription, public welfare, and local self-government, totaling more than 150. They will be categorized and discussed in detail. At a time when the nation is struggling and the local areas are suffering, the convening of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference by Chairman Shen Honglie to discuss what should be built and reformed locally and actively promote local self-government is particularly significant. Although we are located in the city, and lately because of the entangled national affairs and repeated international crises, our attention is often focused on the development of the domestic and international situation, our hearts are always thinking about the local areas and caring about the local areas. Because if local politics are not handled well, nation-building is like building a castle in the air, and if the nation is not built well, its international status will inevitably decline. Therefore, we not only value the convening of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference, but also have great expectations for it. We remember that before Chairman Shen came to Zhejiang, the Zhejiang people in Shanghai hoped that he would build Zhejiang into a model province. Therefore, the success or failure of the Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Conference is not only related to Zhejiang Province, but also to the general local politics.

Speaking of local politics, it is felt that the local areas have long been corrupted beyond repair. During the War of Resistance, in order to support the nation’s established national policy, the local areas disregarded everything and contributed massive manpower and material resources to the nation in order to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance. For eight years, the local areas were exhausted and on their last breath, which has long been known to all. After the victory, the national situation still could not be stabilized because of the Communist Party problem, and any local area would be affected to some extent. The so-called "liberated areas" under the control of the CCP need not be mentioned. Even in the Jiangzhe area, which is known for its prosperity, the people's livelihood, especially the rural life, can be said to be unspeakably miserable. The people of the whole country tightened their belts, gritted their teeth, and endured hardships for eight years to win the victory. But unexpectedly, the country won the victory, but the people's suffering remained, even to the point of being in deep water and burning fire. How will the government be able to face the people! Therefore, the first task of the local officials, who are the "parents of the people," is to understand the people's suffering, and the first step of governance is to let the people recuperate and gradually wake up from the ruins of the war. This is true for all provinces, and Zhejiang is no exception.

There are many ways to relieve the people's suffering, but the most important thing is that they must be practical and easy to implement. If you only know how to talk eloquently, it may sound pleasant, but it is not practical. Not only may it not reduce the people's suffering, but it may even increase the factors that prevent people from living and working in peace. Therefore, today's local authorities should first rest with the people and do fewer things that disturb the people. The people are already extremely grateful. The people's hopes for the government are very simple: first, integrity and honesty, and second, efficiency in handling affairs. And at the moment, abolishing the harsh levies and reducing the people's burdens is even more urgent. Although we also oppose the political philosophy of "non-action and governance," seeing the current local situation with thousands of holes, we really feel that the government must start by cultivating vitality. "If the green hills remain, there will be no fear of running out of firewood." We want to appeal to the people to let them keep some "green hills" first, so that they can contribute their "firewood" in the future.

At present, the situation in our country's rural areas is, frankly, "Nineteen provinces and regions report disasters, and 30 million people are starving." The entire rural area is on the verge of bankruptcy. How to revive the rural areas is the most serious problem at present. Taking Zhejiang as an example, the panic of rural manpower and plowing cattle, and the lack of fertilizer, have also become thorny problems. The American experts of the Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group have already arrived in China. Although they are responsible for the task of reviving the rural areas, "agricultural scientification" will still face many difficulties in practice in China's rural areas with backward knowledge. Therefore, we believe that popular education in rural areas should be strengthened in particular.

We have studied the politics of various countries in the world and know that all countries have their grassroots organizations. The nation-building strategy planned by the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, also first focused on the grassroots organization with the county as the unit of self-government. Therefore, in today's China, if you want to implement democratic politics, you must first earnestly promote local self-government. Sun Yat-sen's Doctrine of People's Rights advocates first training the people in various places to exercise the four political powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum, so that they can fully express public opinion. The main spirit of the new county system promoted by President Chiang is also to "strengthen local organizations, promote self-government, and lay the foundation for revolutionary nation-building." Therefore, the work of nation-building and rejuvenation should start from the county level, and the province is only located between the central government and the county, responsible for promoting the central government's policies and supervising local self-government. If Zhejiang Province is serious about being a model for the whole country in this period of nation-building and rejuvenation and moving towards the road of political democratization, then the Zhejiang authorities should make extraordinary efforts to complete local self-government as soon as possible, and cultivating the people's spirit of the rule of law is especially urgent.

Although a history of political thought in our country has revealed democratic ideas very early, the traditional concept of emphasizing the rule of rites rather than the rule of law for thousands of years is also undeniable. Therefore, the general spirit of the rule of law in society still needs to be greatly promoted and cultivated. Especially at present, the administration of the general lower-level local areas should pay special attention to the rule of law. The Chinese proverb has always said that "It is easy to see the King of Hell, but difficult to be a judge," which shows that senior officials may still value the law, but the scribes, servants, and yamen runners, taking advantage of their power, really make the people uncomfortable. Now that we want to promote local self-government, the affairs of the local areas should be entrusted to the people who are elected by the people to be responsible for handling them, and there is no need to borrow hands from official governance. And those who are elected to handle self-government should especially respect the rule of law. In this way, from the bottom up, the spirit of the rule of law will be widely cultivated, and the advantages of democracy will be carried forward, and the common malpractices of local politics today can be swept away. Instead of singing democracy in vain, it is better to work hard and promote local politics in a down-to-earth manner. All provinces should do the same, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which is holding an administrative conference, should take the lead.

### Target Fleet of Eighty-Seven Vessels, 30,000 Personnel; Atomic Bomb Re-tested This Morning; Destructive Power Even More Intense Than Last Aerial Explosion

[This Newspaper Report] A San Francisco broadcast on the 24th announced that the underwater atomic bomb test will be held at 8:35 AM tomorrow morning (Bikini time) at Bikini Atoll. All preparations are complete. It will explode 20-30 feet underwater. Scientists believe that its destructive power will be even stronger than the last test.

[United Press, Outside Bikini Atoll, 24th] Unless a storm breaks out at the last minute, this historic fifth atomic bomb will explode at the scheduled time tomorrow morning. Scientists are confident that it will not cause tsunamis, earthquakes, or storms in any part of the Pacific Ocean. More than 30,000 personnel participating in the test are now waiting for orders in various locations. Only the 87 target ships remain in the lagoon.

[Associated Press, Atomic Bomb Test Observation Ship Appalachia, 24th] Early this morning, a small boat was towed into Bikini Lagoon. It is believed that the atomic bomb will be detonated under the small boat. The bomb will be covered with a curtain so that the sailors who sink the bomb into the water will not see it. Dr. Holloway will handle the procedure of detonating the atomic bomb. The observation ship Panamint, carrying scientists and foreign observers, and the observation ship Blue Ridge, carrying military observers, may arrive from Kwajalein late tonight. Vice Admiral Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test, has ordered the bomb to be detonated immediately after 8:35 AM (Bikini time) tomorrow morning. At the same time, weather observation work has not stopped all day. If the weather is bad, an order may be issued to postpone the explosion until midnight (Bikini time).

### One Million Tons of Seawater Thrown into the Air Will Form a Huge Plume-Shaped Water Column

[United Press, Onboard the McKinley, 23rd] Meteorologists predict that the weather will be good on July 25th for dropping the first atomic bomb to explode underwater, causing unexpected and enormous pressure on seventy-five ships. The dense clouds over Bikini Atoll have drifted south for a hundred miles with the tropical air. Underwater explosions do not require perfect conditions, but there must be wind reaching a height of 20,000 feet, blowing from east to west, to carry away water droplets or raindrops containing radiation. The sky also needs to be relatively clear for photographic recording of the explosion. According to a scientist, the shock of an underwater explosion will be a hundred times greater than the aerial explosion on July 1st. Dr. Shay, the Director of Scientific Forces, stated that there would probably be no flash visible in an underwater explosion, only a fountain erupting from the water's surface, reaching a height of two or three miles. Oceanographers predict that this water column will branch out, with water splashing in all directions, resembling a tall pine tree, creating a spectacular sight. Scientists also suggest that this water column will not boil and will emit little steam. The plume-shaped water column stirred up by the atomic bomb will be relatively narrow, with its tip almost solid, like a projectile, initially traveling at about two thousand feet per second. Within a fraction of a second after the explosion, a large hole, shaped like a giant pot, will form under the rising water column in the lagoon, with an opening two thousand five hundred feet wide, exposing the lake bottom about a few feet below the previous level, with a diameter of about one or two hundred feet. This giant hole is formed because the explosive force pushes outward to the sides. However, it is expected that all target ships, except for the battleship *Arkansas*, will not sink into the giant hole. Scientists predict that the atomic wave will not cross Bikini Atoll, only reaching about three or four hundred feet inland.

A Large Amount of Seawater Pours onto the Ships

[United Press, Onboard the *Appalachian*, Atomic Bomb Test Observation Ship, 23rd] When the atomic bomb explodes underwater, X-rays with several radiations in the water will explode into danger. An underwater explosion will throw about one million tons of seawater into the air, much of which emits X-rays and other less dangerous radiation. Seawater itself will not have radioactive, but the and other ordinary atoms in the sea will become extremely hot due to the influence of radiation. A large amount of seawater will pour onto the ships, and in addition, a dense fog containing X-ray tube elements will drift with the wind and the ships. According to Major General Parsons, who dropped the Hiroshima atomic bomb, a large amount of water containing beta radiation will fall like a shower on the spot. When this seawater evaporates from the ships, some of the beta rays or X-rays may be evaporated, but most may remain on the deck. In addition, a few seconds after the underwater explosion, another type of beta ray or X-ray hazard is expected to occur above the cloud of steam. When this steam passes over the ships, radiation will be left on board.

Possible Discovery of New Factors

[Central News Agency, Onboard the *Appalachian*, Bikini Atoll, 23rd] Scientists estimate and calculate based on previous small-scale underwater bomb tests, stating that many unknown factors will appear during the second atomic bomb test. Generally speaking, the underwater shock will be at least ten thousand times more violent than any underwater explosion experienced in history. This fifth atomic bomb may convert forty to ninety percent of its atomic energy into the water itself. According to Blandy, the atomic bomb test authorities will not issue special eye protection to the reporters this time, because although we can get closer to the explosion this time than the first time, it is not expected that we will see any light from the underwater explosion. The ships carrying the reporters this time are about eleven miles from the target center, which is more than half the distance we were from the target center during the first test.

### Eight Arab Countries Request the United Nations to Handle the Palestine Issue, Hoping the United Kingdom Can Respect the Charter and End the Trusteeship Status Soon

[Reuters, New York, 23rd] The United Nations Secretariat announced tonight that Egypt has applied to the United Nations General Assembly to study Egypt's and other Arab countries' request to address the current situation in Palestine and establish a new government. The countries jointly submitting this application with Egypt include Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Yemen.

### Draft Peace Treaty Announced, Britain Expresses Disagreement

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British Foreign Office announced tonight that Foreign Secretary Bevin "did not express much approval" for the cable from U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes requesting the immediate publication of the draft peace treaty. The spokesman stated in a not entirely decisive tone that the British government may refuse on the grounds that publishing it at this time would not be very helpful. Conversely, Britain believes that publishing this draft, which has not been fully agreed upon, before the Paris Peace Conference may reduce the chances of reaching an agreement.

Cable to Britain

The Egyptian cable to Britain, sent on June 20th, stated in part: "The Egyptian government earnestly hopes that the resolutions taken by the United Nations can be implemented immediately and achieve their objectives. To impose a trusteeship system on Palestine would be a violation of the Charter. Therefore, the current situation arising from the trusteeship must be brought to an end, and a new government must be established in accordance with the principles of the Charter." The cable reiterated the earlier request for negotiations and strongly emphasized that the guarantees stipulated in the White Paper must not be violated. Finally, it emphasized that the Egyptian government, in order to avoid turmoil in Palestine and for the sake of the security of the Arab countries in the Middle East, must respond to the people's demands. The cable was signed by Egyptian Foreign Minister It.

### Truman Deeply Regrets Jewish Atrocities in Jerusalem, Arab Higher Committee Protests to Britain

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] U.S. President Truman issued a statement tonight regarding the bombing of the British military headquarters at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, denouncing it as an act of "wanton slaughter of human beings." He stated, in part, "I have learned of the bombing of the Palestinian government and British military headquarters and express my deep regret. I believe that every responsible Jewish leader will share my sentiments. This act of violence occurs at a time when U.S. representatives are meeting in London to discuss the handling of the Palestine issue, and its result is only to hinder a peaceful resolution of this difficult problem."

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd] The Palestinian Arab Higher Committee sent a telegram to the British government, demanding strong action to suppress terrorist activities. It stated that if the British government does not immediately suppress terrorist activities, the Arab people will have no choice but to engage in self-defense, and the British government will be responsible for the consequences that may arise.

### Met Seven Years Ago and Used Today, A Key Suspect in the Rong Case Arrested in Fuzhou, Zhu Chansheng Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday, Identified the Hostage and Received US$5,000, Luo Weiquan, Who Guarded the Ransom, Also Arrested in Pudong

[This Newspaper] Thanks to the diligent pursuit by military and police agencies, over twenty ringleaders and accomplices in the Rong Desheng kidnapping case have been arrested. Another key suspect in the case, Zhu Chansheng (alias Xu Menglin), fled to Fuzhou. After the Municipal Police Bureau learned of this, they urgently telegraphed the Fuzhou Water Police Corps to dispatch police to arrest the suspect at the International Hotel. The Municipal Police Bureau sent officers on a ship to escort him back, and he arrived in Shanghai at approximately 0:30 AM yesterday for processing. According to the suspect's confession to the Fuzhou Water Police Corps, he is 47 years old, from Wuxi, unemployed, and resides at No. 131 Dongsiwen Lane, Xinza Road. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for theft in 1927. Regarding the Rong Desheng kidnapping case, he served as an inside man because my husband (the so-called "old man"), Rong Binggen, is a relative of Rong Desheng. As far back as seven years ago, when something happened in Rong's factory, my husband handled everything. At that time, I often went with my husband, so I was very familiar with Rong Desheng. As for the kidnapping process, Yuan Zhongzhu, who I have known for many years, approached me. At the end of March, I met Yuan on the street, and he invited me to his house to chat. After arriving at his residence, we talked about how he spent 2 million legal tender when he was arrested last time, and now he is very short of money and wants to do something to Rong Desheng, but he doesn't know him personally. You are very familiar with him, please help me. I asked him how I could help. He said that I only need to lead him to recognize Rong Desheng's face, and I don't need to worry about anything else, let them handle it. I agreed at the time and arranged to meet him at Dasanyuan Teahouse at 8:00 AM on April 3rd. When I arrived, I met Yuan and went to the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Zhongzheng South Road to wait. At about 10:00 AM, I saw Rong Desheng passing by in a black car with the license plate 21162. I told Yuan that the person sitting on the left side of the car was him. Yuan looked carefully and said, "I recognize him," and then we returned home separately. Before parting, Yuan instructed me to meet him at his house in three days. When the time came, I went to Yuan's residence and met him. Yuan's friend Zhang Mingda (real surname Luo, nicknamed "Old Man") was also present. Yuan asked me, "Will you take me to see Rong Desheng's face again today?" So I went with Yuan to the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Zhongzheng East Road. At about 10:00 AM, Rong Desheng's car drove past again. Yuan Zhongzhu stepped forward to take a closer look and said, "I recognize him now. The one surnamed Zheng is also watching on Second Road. Once you have seen him, I will notify you when things are successful in the future." After speaking, I went home. More than twenty days later, I saw news in the newspaper about Rong Desheng being kidnapped. Later, I found Yuan Zhongzhu in a swallow's nest in Huanghe Road. He said that this matter was very difficult and there was no way to contact him, so he told me to go to the countryside to avoid the limelight. He would notify me when there was news, and we would meet at Xiaomaoniang Swallow's Nest on Fourth Road next time. So I went to Wuxi to avoid the limelight temporarily. About two weeks later, I met Yuan at Xiaomaoniang Swallow's Nest. He said that things had been settled and the money had been placed with Zhang Mingda, and it would be handed over in three days. On the fourth day, I met at Xiaomaoniang's house. Yuan gave me US$5,000, saying that there were too many people involved, so I should use less. Shanghai is no longer a place to live, so it's best to leave this place. So I returned home. A week later, I hurried back to my hometown of Henglin in Changzhou and bought about 100 jin of orchids, spending more than 1 million yuan. About a week later, I returned to Shanghai. While drinking tea at Dadong Teahouse, I met Shen Bomin, a compradore of Dengkeng Shipping, through the introduction of my friend Meng A'er (named Youzhang). Shen talked about how cheap sugar was in Fuzhou and proposed to invest together to buy it. After Meng, Shen, and I agreed to each invest 2 million yuan, a total of 6 million yuan, we entrusted Shen to buy it. So I handed Shen Bomin a ten-tael gold bar, which was converted into 2 million legal tender. Because the situation in Shanghai was too tense, I used the pretext of buying sugar to take the Dengkeng Shipping to Fuzhou, arriving in Fuzhou on June 29. I opened room 6 at the International Hotel, and later moved to room 3. On July 6, at about 6:00 PM, I went out to cool off and was arrested by the Water Police Corps. As for Shen and Meng, they knew nothing about the Rong Desheng kidnapping case. When I arrived in Fuzhou, I only brought 95,000 legal tender. After arriving in Fuzhou, all the miscellaneous expenses were borrowed from Shen Bomin, totaling 400,000 yuan. Please deduct it from the 2 million yuan gold bar. According to a responsible person from the Municipal Police Bureau, although Zhu has been extradited to Shanghai, the police officers handling the case have traveled back and forth for many days and have been mentally exhausted along the way. After a short rest, they will bring the suspect out again, interrogate him strictly, and record his statement. As for how they learned that Zhu was a key suspect in the Rong case, it was very tortuous and also a coincidence. Because a police officer lived in the same alley as Zhu, he caught a glimpse of Zhu buying furniture and wearing gorgeous clothes after getting the loot, which was very different from before. So he aroused his attention and made many inquiries. On June 25, he reported to his superiors. After reporting to his superiors, he led the police to search his house and discovered that Zhu himself had left Shanghai. He also learned that his wife had returned to Henglin, so he became more suspicious and rushed to Henglin by car, arrested his wife, and confiscated US$3,000, a diamond ring, and a gold bracelet, and brought them to Shanghai for interrogation. She then revealed everything. The next morning, another tip was received, saying that a tailor was accompanying Zhu on the Dengkeng Shipping to Taiwan that morning. At that time, the ship had already sailed out, and the police authorities sent a telegram to Chief Yu of the Fuzhou Water Police Corps, asking him to assist. When the Dengkeng Shipping entered Wusongkou a few days later, they sent police to arrest the compradore Shen Bomin, who confessed that Zhu was in Fuzhou. When the ship sailed abroad again, they sent officers Zhang Faxiang, Chen Xianrong, and Ren Gongqin to board the ship. When they arrived in Fuzhou, Zhu had already been captured by the Water Police.

[Another report] Luo Weiquan (nicknamed Luo Shusheng), the key suspect in the Rong case who was responsible for guarding the ransom, was tracked down by Tao, the director of the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Command, who ordered his subordinates to step up the investigation. Under the instructions of their superiors, Zheng, the director of the Shanghai West Inspection Office, and Wang, the director of the office, conducted several discussions and investigations. On the 19th of this month, they learned that Luo was at the Longwang Temple in Pudong, and the No. 7244 civilian ship transporting the ransom, had come to Shanghai from Pudong. They immediately sent Huang Xiexin, Zhou Yunjiang, etc., to the No. 3 Wharf of the South City Guanhua Bridge, detained the ship, and arrested the boatman Pan Jinlong (who claimed that he did not participate in the kidnapping).

The Shanghai-Hangzhou group of the Receiving and Investigating Team for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region will officially begin operations today at Room 217 on the second floor of the Bank of China. The group held its first meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, presided over by the team leader Zhang Zhiben at the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office. Attendees included committee members Fan Zhengbo, Cheng Zhonghang, Wu Wangji, Zhang Qingzhen, and Secretary Xu Longchuan, totaling six people. The following was decided: (1) The committee meetings of the Investigating Team and the receiving and dispatching of documents will be at the Supervisory Commissioner's Office. For the convenience of accessing case files and registers, the office will be located at Room 217 on the second floor of the Bank of China (note that this location is only one floor away from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, the main target of the investigation). (2) Committee meetings will be held every Wednesday at 10:00 AM. If there are important matters, they will be convened on an ad hoc basis. (3) In addition to transferring personnel from various agencies according to the investigation methods, the Investigating Team's working methods should also seek the earnest assistance of people's organizations, especially various trade associations. (4) Committee members Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji were appointed to draft a work plan to be presented for discussion at the next meeting.

Complaints Must Include Real Names

It is reported that, as of yesterday, the Investigating Team had received more than ten letters of complaint from the public. However, many of them did not include real names and addresses. Therefore, the team discussed this matter during its first meeting yesterday morning. After the meeting, the person in charge of the team stated that, according to the investigation procedures, the team can accept confidential reports from the public. If anyone knows of any illegal or corrupt practices regarding the receiving and handling of enemy and puppet materials, they can list the facts in writing or provide evidence for processing. However, the informant must write their real name and detailed address and must not make false accusations out of malice. The team will keep the informant's information confidential. Furthermore, due to the busy workload and limited funding, the team will transfer some personnel from various agencies in the city to assist with the work. It is reported that Zhang Quan and Wang Shiwei have already been transferred from the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office to serve as staff members of the group and will begin work today.

### Joint Federation for Safeguarding Navigation Rights Discusses Opening Two Ports at Yesterday's First General Assembly

The Joint Federation for Safeguarding Navigation Rights convened its first general assembly yesterday afternoon at the Dada Datong Joint Venture office on the Bund. Attendees included representatives from the Songhu Pilot Association, the Chinese Seamen's Union, the Chinese Marine Engineers Association, the Chinese Merchant Shipmasters Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Tongsha Pilot Association, and the Shanghai Shipowners Association. Jin Yueshi was elected chairman. Standing Committee Member Li reported on the progress of the appeal to open up four ports along the Yangtze River. After President Song adopted public opinion and revised it to the "Method of Designating Nanjing and Hankou as Temporary Berthing Docks," the representatives discussed it and unanimously resolved to appeal to the government that the import of foreign goods is more harmful than beneficial to the national economy, and inland navigation is of great importance to national defense. The second item of the method proposed by the government to designate Nanjing and Hankou as temporary berthing docks, which allows certain types of commercial goods to be loaded and transported on foreign vessels sailing inland, still has many drawbacks. It is particularly detrimental to the country's agriculture, industry, commerce, and navigation industries. It should be revised to limit imports to relief supplies and government supplies, and there should be no restrictions on exports. Imported foreign goods of a commercial nature that are sufficient to constitute a large amount of import surplus should not be smuggled in. Those who violate this will be treated as smugglers. In addition, the government was requested by telegram to promptly order the Jianghai Customs to cancel the announcement of the opening of coastal navigation rights on March 21 of this year.

[Report from this newspaper] Chen Guoquan, the director of the Puppet Rice Grain Control Committee, was examined by the High Court's collegiate panel yesterday morning, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 31st.

This continued for four years until the Pacific War broke out and he was discovered by the enemy and then monitored. The defendant initially joined the puppet government out of compulsion. After joining, he maintained the people's food supply and did his best to reclaim civilian rice, otherwise, it would all be seized by the enemy as military rice. This was entirely for the service of the people. During his two years in office, he never embezzled or got rich. The law is based on reason and should not listen to false accusations. He asked the court to make a fair judgment.

Gan Deyun, a former member of the puppet Legislative Yuan, was previously sentenced to seven years in prison by the High Court. Gan refused to accept the verdict and appealed for a retrial.

### Sihang Warehouse Occupied; Unable to Store Customer Goods

[Report from this newspaper] The Sihang Warehouse was the site of the Battle of the Eight Hundred Heroes in 1937. During the period of occupation, it was seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, the original owner, the Sihang Savings Society, repeatedly applied to various agencies for its return, but to no avail. Finally, when Chairman Chiang visited Shanghai, the entire case was submitted for his review, and he approved its return after the municipal government investigated. Only 70% of it was returned successively, and tens of millions of dollars were spent on repairs before it could resume operations. Unexpectedly, the Storage and Transportation Office of the Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau recently took possession of half of the warehouse's ground floor with military police stationed there, making it impossible to accept and store the goods promised to customers.

Streamlining Traffic and Planning to Expand North Xizang Road

[Report from this newspaper] Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, in order to guide traffic onto the right track and raise public awareness of traffic regulations, is planning (1) a large-scale traffic publicity week, with special emphasis on the following points: (1) Regulating the time and route of slow-moving vehicles (for example, heavy freight vehicles will have their operating hours restricted, and rickshaws will have their routes restricted), (2) Strictly enforcing one-way traffic, (3) No parking on main streets (at most, temporary one-sided parking will be allowed), (4) Empty vehicles should be parked in parking lots (the Public Utilities Bureau plans to build several parking lots in the city and notify those with parking facilities, such as the International Hotel, to open them), (5) Strengthening traffic police (training traffic police).

Regarding another plan to streamline traffic, Zhao is particularly focused on the development of North Xizang Road. He believes that this road is the best trunk line connecting north-south traffic, and most of the buildings on both sides were destroyed by the war, so development would be less difficult.

China will refer to the situations in various countries and promote standardized exercises so that the general public can reach the prescribed standards through physical education training. At present, physical education training is only applied to students in schools, and there are few concrete measures for the general public. In the future, the Ministry of Education plans to hold standardized exercises, selecting provinces and cities across the country with more physical education facilities and habits to guide them according to their own situation and first establish role models, and then promote them throughout the country. This kind of public physical education training will first be piloted in several provinces and cities (such as Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, etc.), with the local sports field as the place for training the public in physical education. Educational administrative authorities will stipulate standard testing methods so that people know what extent physical exercise must reach in order to meet the standard physical fitness and be a healthy citizen. All ball games and various physical activities in schools will be incorporated into the training, and methods will be stipulated for conducting tests on time. The whole population should strive to gradually reach the standardized exercises. The standard exercises for the people established by the United Kingdom and the United States are at a higher level.

The South China soccer team led by Li Huitang is coming to Shanghai. Upon the initiation of Madame Sun Yat-sen, Mayor Wu, and others, the Municipal Sports Association Football Committee scheduled three disaster relief charity matches. The first match was originally scheduled to be against the Western Union team at Yiyuan today. However, it was learned yesterday that the South China team's visit to Shanghai was at the invitation of the China Welfare Fund Committee, and the team must first obtain the committee's agreement before playing. Before obtaining the agreement, the team cannot participate. At the same time, the Football Committee also issued a notice yesterday stating: "The disaster relief charity match originally scheduled for today between South China and the Western Union team has been temporarily canceled because the South China team has not yet obtained the agreement of the China Welfare Fund Committee. Therefore, today's match, and the already arranged schedule, are temporarily canceled."

Business News

### Factories with Meritorious Service in the War of Resistance Granted Priority to Take Over Superior Enemy Factories, Mostly Steel, Machinery, and Hardware Factories

[Report from our office] It is learned that in order to give preferential treatment to the industrial community in the rear, the Executive Yuan has selected 13 factories in the rear that are relatively large in scale, well-managed, and have made great contributions to the war of resistance, and specially granted them priority to take over enemy factories with similar businesses and products. Among these 13 factories, steel, machinery, and hardware factories account for the majority, and there are also pigment, rubber, electrical appliance, pencil, and asbestos factories. The enemy factories taken over will also be selected from those with better equipment and a certain scale of production. This matter is currently being negotiated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Management. Once the takeover is ready, it will be handed over to the designated factories. It is heard that the designated factories are eager for the government to find a way to make the valuation of the equipment of the enemy factories cheap and reasonable. It is hoped that the highest valuation will not exceed the current price of similar machines in the United States. Otherwise, the factories will have to order a large number of new machines from the United States. This equipment cannot be completed in a short period of time, and it will also consume a large amount of national foreign exchange funds, which is not appropriate. After a reasonable price is estimated, the factories hope to pay 30% of the total amount first, and the difference will be evenly refunded within five years. Among these enemy factories taken over with preferential treatment, some have already started production and have accepted external orders. It is said that there will be no shutdown when the takeover is made, and it will not hinder production and delivery.

### Foreign Paper Floods the Market, Paper Merchants' Profits are Thin; High Costs of Domestic Paper Make Competition Impossible

[Report from our office] Recently, paper prices have generally declined. Our reporter specially visited people in the paper industry to inquire about the current situation of the paper industry. According to the report, since the tightening of silver coins at the end of June, many paper shops in the city have been cutting prices to sell their inventories in order to adjust their capital turnover, so the market has been trending downstream. This is because transportation in various places has recently been blocked from time to time, and paper exports have become sluggish. On the one hand, the number of foreign goods arriving has increased day by day, which has led to a general decline in paper prices in the city. Here are some examples to illustrate this: Ordinary double-page newsprint is currently about 14,500 yuan per ream. Canadian newsprint is currently about 27,800 yuan per ream, which is about 30% lower than a dozen days ago. Taking the recent batch of Prince paper from the Soviet Union as an example, the price is only 22,000 yuan per ream. Taking the yellow paper edition as another example, the price reached 1.5 million yuan per ton in October last year, but after the China Paper Industry Corporation repeatedly sold it, the recent price has dropped to 540,000 yuan per ton. However, the cost of foreign goods is now increasing. For example, the cost price of Canadian newsprint when it arrived in Shanghai a few months ago was about 120 US dollars per ton. Recently, it has risen to more than 300 US dollars per ton. The average cost per ream is about 15,000 legal tender. If you add the loss of interest during the several months of ordering, the profits of the imported paper merchants are no longer as abundant as they were a few months ago. As far as the inventory in this street is concerned, it cannot be said to be abundant, but it is not short. However, most paper manufacturers are still unable to reduce the cost of their products due to increased labor costs and high raw material prices. On the other hand, cheap and high-quality foreign goods are constantly arriving, and business is still at a loss. The situation is extremely depressing.

### Gold and Paper Money Level and Weak

Yesterday, the gold market was stable after a brief rise. There were no speculators supporting the price, and the upward trend was still difficult to sustain. It opened at 1.98 million in the morning and gradually declined slightly. The central government's allocation of ten bars was priced at 1.9625 million. It became even weaker after ten o'clock. Later, the US dollar suddenly weakened, and it fell to 1.94 million near noon before stabilizing slightly. In the afternoon, it hovered around 1.95 million. As a result, it fell more than 20,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were 10,800,000. Silver was level. The hidden discount was also level, and the interest rate was between 1.2 and 1.5 jiao.

In the foreign currency market, some people still misinterpreted the words "pound sterling and US dollar currency" in the announcement issued by the Central Bank. It was still above 2,600 yuan outside the customs when it opened in the morning. Soon, real goods continued to flow out, and the buying interest weakened again. It was around 2,550 yuan near noon. There was no change in the afternoon. As a result, it fell 50 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also fell, falling from 565 yuan to below 560 yuan. As a result, it fell 10 yuan from the previous close, and the Hong Kong exchange rate has been leveled. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 550 yuan to 560 yuan, the British exchange rate was 9,000 yuan for sale, the Indian exchange rate was 670 yuan to 680 yuan, and the US exchange rate was still sluggish.

### Chinese and Foreign Stocks Decline Across the Board

Chinese stocks were inseparable from the old tune, first soaring and then slumping. At high prices, the big players' supply and demand were inconsistent, so the retail investors did not know what to do, and the market was chaotic. The best-selling ones were Yongsha at 695 yuan, Mei Ya at 4,750 yuan, Jingfu at 285 yuan, Xinguang at 280 yuan, and Qinxing at 195 yuan. The weakest were Yongsha at 535 yuan, Mei Ya at 4,250 yuan, Jingfu at 240 yuan, Xinguang at 235 yuan, and Qinxing at 155 yuan. In the afternoon, they rose slightly after falling to a low point. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha and Mei Ya fell slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by 10% to 10% cow, and small and medium-sized stocks in unpopular sectors also fell by 5% to 10%. Yuanlao stocks also saw a small decline.

Foreign stocks were helpless. Buyers watched from the sidelines and could not withstand the excessive supply from various sectors outside the industry. The market price continued to fall. Yisha was at 9,700 yuan and Yinglian was at 9,800 yuan. There were a few transactions, and buyers disappeared. The weakest was near noon. As a result, Yisha, Yinglian, Huide, and Steel fell by more than 5%. Ye Guang fell by a little less than 10%, and the rest fell slightly.

### Silk Market is Sluggish

Yesterday, the silk market was unusually quiet, and prices were sluggish. The price of 120-count Guangtianqiao rayon fluctuated between 1.66 million and 1.67 million yuan throughout the day, which was slightly shorter than the previous day, 10 to 20,000 yuan. The quoted prices of other miscellaneous brands of goods were similar to those of the previous day, and there were very few transactions. The factory was stable but revealed sluggishness. Real transactions were weak and very few transactions were made. Silk goods were also weak. Quilt covers and checked crepe were not traded yesterday. Only Huajin crepe was heavily searched by Ke Bang, and the price was profitable. The rest was flat.

Unified Class C Debt Stabilizes at the 800 Mark

Public debt was even more sluggish yesterday. Transactions in various debts were even more idle. The rise and fall were small. Unified Class C opened at 810 yuan in the morning. During the process, it fell from 820 yuan to 790 yuan, but it still stabilized outside 800 yuan near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, A, B, and C debts were level, D debts rose slightly, and E debts fell slightly. Retail investors moved to the stock market, and the trend is unlikely to change.

### Sugar Level and Weak

Yesterday, the sugar market tended to be level. Although the Chao Bang still quoted 94,500 yuan for raw sugar, a small number of transactions continued to be made at 91,200 yuan. The Guang Bang quoted more than ten pieces of Beihai Dazhuan raw sugar at a price of 75,000 yuan. Only quotations were made and there were very few transactions.

### Yarn and Cotton Level and Dull

Yesterday, the yarn market was neither prosperous nor disgraced, and transactions were still extremely dull. Because the market price in Jingwu and other places was similar to the intermediate price, traffickers hesitated, resulting in a particularly dull market for small yarns. Because factory numbers were unwilling to sell cheaply, large yarns were also in a stalemate.

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegrams fell. The current cotton price in this port was high and level. Because the manufacturers were not easy to negotiate and approach, the holders were unwilling to compromise, resulting in difficult transactions. The manufacturers did not trade at all, and the flower numbers also only decorated transactions. The market is still optimistic.

### High Japonica Rice Stable, Secondary Indica Rice Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the North and South rice markets received a total of 8,700 piculs. The market situation in the South was active but not booming, while the North market remained sluggish. The high japonica rice maintained its position, but medium and lower grades continued to decline by 2000-3000 yuan. Medium and lower grades of glutinous rice also continued to decline slightly by 3000-4000 yuan. High-quality goods were relatively stable, but sales were not brisk. The open market for white yuan rice noodles was sluggish due to weak digestion in the local market. Goods arriving from Wuxi by warship flooded the market, creating false excitement, and prices fell by 400-500 yuan. Wheat from Ningbo and Shantou was sluggishly received, with only slightly higher quality being picked up, softening the market and causing a rebound of 400-500 yuan. Factories had no intention to purchase due to the falling price of flour. Bran was scarce and remained firm. Yellow soybeans from Keya were selectively purchased at slightly higher prices, keeping the market firm. Broad beans, mung beans, and yellow sesame were flat. Raw peanuts were selling well in other areas, and although prices were high, they were not in danger. Soybean cake sales were sluggish. Oil prices continued to rise by 1000-2000 yuan due to demand from the Guangdong merchants and a continuing scarcity of supply.

### Preliminary Review of Stock Exchange to be Completed in One or Two Days

[Report from our newspaper] As of yesterday, the preliminary review of brokers' qualifications by the Stock Exchange Preparatory Committee's subcommittee was half completed. The remaining half is estimated to be finished in one or two days. After the preliminary review is completed, a full meeting of the Preparatory Committee will be convened to conduct the second step of the review.

Chinese Debt Continues to Fall in England, Expected to Improve After End of Internal Strife

[Reuters, London, 24th] The trend of Chinese public bonds during the first half of 1946 has continued to decline. Although there have been no large transactions, the decline in recent weeks has been particularly pronounced. The "Investor's Chronicle," in commenting on the situation, questioned whether the public bond market might be about to turn around. The article pointed out that the end of the struggle between the National Government and the Communist Party is a major factor for China's future. Although the National Government is militarily stronger than its rival, it has shown great tolerance and genuine political demeanor despite any pressure from the Communist side. If the internal strife can be ended quickly, the current price of Chinese public bonds can often be stabilized. A table of the current state of Chinese public bonds is listed below:

Summer Life

### Sunglasses: A Seasonal Accessory, A Blessing for Eye Protection - Introducing Important Knowledge

In the scorching summer sun, sunglasses are an extremely common item, almost like Hong Kong shirts and shorts. For fashionable women in the city, wearing sunglasses is not only for eye protection but also carries the meaning of a seasonal accessory. Imagine adding a pair of black glasses to white shoes, white clothing, and white skin, concealing the pair of black eyes that best express human emotions, easily creating a sense of mystery.

Just by paying a little attention to the passersby on the street, one can imagine the considerable sales of sunglasses in the summer. As for the United States, which has always liked to be unconventional, sales are naturally much larger. It is said that the total number of sunglasses sold each year reaches about 20 million pairs.

However, while many people use sunglasses as decorative accessories, their main purpose is still eye protection. Now, we want to raise a question: do sunglasses actually protect the eyes?

### What Kind of Sunglasses Cannot Protect Your Eyes

According to statistics from the United States, the more people who wear sunglasses in the summer, the more people suffer from eye diseases, and many people have found blind spots on their eyeballs. A famous ophthalmologist once pointed out that the comfort that sunglasses give to the eyes is very questionable, and in most cases, they have absolutely no protective ability.

Originally, solar radiation is formed by many different types of light. In addition to visible light, there are also invisible ultraviolet rays and glaring heat rays. Low-quality sunglasses are like a piece of smoked and dyed glass, only able to block the dazzling visible light, but they cannot effectively filter out invisible and potentially harmful light. Usually, in bright sunlight, human eyelids will automatically adjust, only allowing the necessary amount of light to pass through the eyeball and produce a clear impression on the retina. However, black sunglasses block visible light, causing the eyelids to open wider than they would without glasses, exposing the sensitive parts inside the eyes to harmful light that the lenses cannot block.

### Can You Make Iced Coffee?

— Lu Ying

You have certainly had iced coffee, but do you know how many ways there are to make it? You will definitely say, "It's simple enough, there are two ways." Yes, two ways. One is to brew the coffee and put it in the refrigerator to chill. The other, if you don't have a refrigerator, is to let the coffee cool down first and then add a few ice cubes.

However, these are not good methods. Because coffee contains rich oils, putting it in the refrigerator to chill will cause the fatty substances to separate from the water, with fat particles floating on top and the liquid underneath becoming thin like water. So, the first method is not good. As for the second method, ice cubes are made of water, and adding ice cubes to coffee is like adding a large amount of ice water, diluting the rich coffee flavor, which is also not good.

The most scientific method is: first, brew the coffee extra strong (if you originally used one spoonful per cup, you need to use one and a half). Pour it into the refrigerator and freeze it into small cubic ice coffee cubes. When you want to drink it, just take out a few cubes and put them into a cup of hot coffee. You will immediately have a cup of rich and cold iced coffee!

### Yellow-Green Sunglasses Are Most Beneficial to Human Eyes

— Jia Nan

According to Dr. [Blank], an associate professor of ophthalmology at New York University, the best sunglasses must be able to absorb ultraviolet rays and heat rays, and for general colored light, they must be able to absorb them partially and evenly, so that the proportion of natural colors will not change due to wearing sunglasses. According to experimental results, yellow-green sunglasses are most beneficial to the eyes and are recommended to the public by scientists.

At the same time, in addition to color, the lenses must also be carefully polished according to scientific principles. As for the fashion of wearing sunglasses, it should be limited to situations where the sunlight is intense. Wearing them at other times is not only useless but harmful.

A pair of eyes is the greatest treasure on the human body. Their structure is extremely delicate and requires special protection. In this scorching summer, ladies must pay extra attention when purchasing sunglasses.

### Baked Alaska

— Lu Ying

The most common cold drink in summer is of course ice cream, a truly refreshing tonic for the spleen and stomach. But there is also the invention of "Baked Alaska," have you ever heard of it? The method of making "Baked Alaska" is as follows: take a piece of cake, cover it with ice cream, about half an inch thick. Then soak the surroundings in beaten egg whites. In this way, it can be placed in the oven to bake. After baking for about five minutes, take it out, and it is a serving of "Baked Alaska." Because of the separation of the egg whites, the ice cream inside is guaranteed not to melt.

### The Season of Floating Melons and Submerged Plums - A Discussion of Watermelons

— Beihai

The weather is hot, and watermelons are also on the market. The street vendors wiped their sweat while waving palm fans to drive away flies, shouting at the top of their lungs, "One hundred yuan for one watermelon!" In the alleys, watermelon vendors are constantly doing business at the back doors every day. On both sides of the road, large groups of flies buzz incessantly, circling on watermelon rinds. The sound of cicadas is noisy, truly the season of floating melons and submerged plums.

How much money will Shanghai people spend on watermelons this year? You may not believe it - according to the lowest estimate by people in the industry, it is 6 trillion yuan! Among them, Pinghu melons alone will be worth 3 trillion yuan.

First Crop Melons Are of Poor Quality

Early summer is the time when melons and fruits breed, but unexpectedly, this year's continuous rain has affected their growth. Therefore, although the first crop of watermelons this summer has been on the market, it is not as plentiful or of as good quality as in previous years. Due to the high cost of labor and transportation, the price per dan has reached about 40,000 yuan, and even the most ordinary ones require more than 20,000 yuan. Fortunately, Shanghai has plenty of wealthy customers, and the watermelons transported from the suburbs to Shanghai every day can be sold out completely.

As for the watermelons sold in Shanghai, the largest number each year is Pinghu melons. According to this year's lowest estimate, they are worth more than 3 trillion yuan. In the past, the watermelons grown in Pinghu were called "Three White Melons" - that is, white skin, white flesh, and white seeds, also called "Snow Flesh Watermelons." However, the "Three White Melons" are now outdated, and the "Potato Melons" have taken their place. It is said that this melon seed was passed down from Tanglou. The best Pinghu watermelons are produced outside the South Gate, and every one can be said to be sweet and delicious.

Judging Ripeness by Looking at the Skin Color

As the saying goes, "Buy melons by looking at the skin color." In fact, "buying melons by looking at the skin color" can only identify its ripeness. Generally speaking, when a watermelon is ripe, its skin color is dark green, the pattern is clear, and the bottom skin color is yellow. If the melon skin is green and the bottom color is white, it means that it is not yet ripe. The thickness of the melon skin can also be determined by whether the melon skin is smooth or not. Therefore, from the farmers who plant the melons to the fruit merchants, they all rely on the skin color to assess its value.

Melon Vendors Make a Fortune

It is said that there are specialized melon vendors who specialize in looking at the skin color, and they can indeed make a fortune in the melon market every year. Their only skill is that seven or eight out of ten watermelons that they select can be guaranteed to be ripe just right, because overly ripe watermelons will turn into a loss. However, the value of these selected watermelons is also half higher than the market price. This higher price is the reward they get from experience. But to buy truly sweet watermelons, you still need to pay attention to where they come from, otherwise it is still unreliable.

Second Crop Melons Start to Hit the Market

The first crop of watermelons has been affected by the rain, and the sweetness is not enough, and they are prone to rot. However, the second crop of watermelons has begun to hit the market. So, to eat good melons, you just need to wait two or three days. In addition to Pinghu watermelons, Shanghai also has Bing melons produced in Sanlintang, which are also very famous. Next are the watermelons from Datuan in Pudong and Chongming. In addition, there are also many watermelons transported and sold from the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. However, they are all classified as miscellaneous melons and are mostly sold in the North Market. According to estimates from the North and South markets, the total value of watermelon sales this year can reach 6 trillion yuan.

Hami Melon, the Supreme of Melons

In China, the best watermelons are produced in Hami, Xinjiang, and Dezhou, Shandong. As for Taiwan melons, they are only superficially good. As for the watermelons produced in the southern United States, they are huge, weighing more than 30 catties, but their sweetness is not as good as our Hami melons.

Eating watermelon in the hot summer can not only relieve the heat but also reduce the occurrence of sores and boils in children. It should be noted that it should not be eaten with greasy dishes. In addition, watermelon is also of great help in the treatment of typhoid fever caused by heat stroke. Therefore, every year when watermelons are on the market, some fruit merchants specially refrigerate them until winter before selling them.

### Palm Trees, Miami Beach at Night: Dancing All Night Long, Gambling Rampantly, Over 150 Nightclubs

— Jun Mo

Since the end of the war, Miami Beach has once again resumed its crowded, lively scene this summer. In fact, in the 50-year history of Miami, it has never been as lively as it is this summer. Money is flying everywhere, and no one knows where so much money comes from. Perhaps the four years of war have created many nouveau riches, and these people don't seem to care about spending money at all. Five US dollars for a meal, a check for one thousand US dollars can only be used to pay for one hundred US dollars a week for rent. Chauffeurs earn two to three hundred dollars a week in tips, and ties sell for one thousand five hundred US dollars each.

Generally speaking, this flood of money has four destinations: accommodation, department stores, food and drink, and gambling. Speaking of accommodation, it is absolutely impossible to find a place to stay in Miami today. If you want to take a nap in a chair in the hotel lobby, you have to pay a high price, and you have to see if you have connections. Because this year, groups of tourists have arrived by car, train, and plane, exceeding twice the original population of Miami, which is 250,000. Although hotel rooms are regulated to cost no more than 37.7 US dollars per day, in reality, they have already risen to 60 US dollars. After the rooms are all booked, many people have to rent a bench to sleep on or rent a platform on the roof.

The Office of Price Administration is truly dumbfounded.

Two girls borrowed a floor to sleep on for one night, rent: 15 yuan.

Another person borrowed a woodshed in someone's backyard to sleep on for one night, rent: 16 yuan.

Families with empty rooms are asking for sky-high prices, because they don't want to rent them out.

But as a result, people immediately want them, without bargaining at all.

The Miami Herald sarcastically said that luckily, Miami law stipulates that you cannot spend the night in the toilet, otherwise, if the landlord rented the toilet to someone, one thousand US dollars a season, everyone would be scrambling for it.

Tourists who come to Miami, after playing for several nights in a row, say: The Miami night under the palm trees is truly a Lantern Festival every night. The 150 nightclubs there are packed every night, and no one complains about the price being too high.

Money came easily at first, and it goes easily now. On the gambling table, with a roll of the dice, ten or twenty thousand US dollars flows into someone else's pocket. People don't even raise an eyebrow, and no one takes it to heart.

Spring and Autumn

### Loneliness

— Xi Shou

At dusk, I often walk to that hilltop and sit sadly under the shade of an old oak tree. My gaze casually falls on the plain below the mountain, watching the changing scenery there.

The Shana River nearby meanders, its waves surge, and its foam sparkles; it flows all the way into the distant darkness. The lake at the foot of the mountain, however, is still, a pool of sleeping water. Venus has already appeared in the blue sky above the lake.

The hilltops covered with dark green trees still have a last ray of light cast on them by the drooping sun. Then, the moon rises, whitening the horizon.

At this time, my gaze suddenly falls on the Gothic spire. The religious sounds overflowing from the church spread in the air. I stop walking and listen to the coarse bell, mixed in with the harmonious hymns, striking the last few tolls of the day.

But in the face of these gentle landscapes, my soul is indifferent, neither feeling tempted nor enthusiastic. I look down at the earth, like a wandering shadow. The lively sun can no longer warm the dead.

I look in vain at one hill after another, from south to north, from east to west, in every direction of this vast and boundless expanse. My moonlight fully surveys it. I can only say: "There is no place where happiness awaits me!"

Temptations have long flown past me. What do those small valleys, those mansions, those thatched huts have to do with me? In my eyes, they are nothing but empty things. River, rocks, forest, you are valuable things in the wilderness, but you lack a person, and everything becomes lifeless!

### Each and Every One's Eden

— Zhong Yuan

Whenever I see the stars on a summer night, I always remember a lovely place.

A gentleman once gave that place a strange name: "Each and Every One's Eden." I asked him with a smile what it meant, and he replied:

"Golgotha is the place where Jesus was crucified, called the Skull Place by the Jews, that is, the Place of Suffering. The Garden of Eden is the garden that God created for the first ancestors Adam and Eve, a carefree paradise. Well, 'Each and Every One's Eden,' what does this mean? You should know, right?"

"That gentleman seemed to be named Zhang, or maybe not, it's a little hazy now. But I still clearly remember that when he said these words to me, he was lying on a white iron bed filled with the smell of medicine. Next to the bed was a tea table with a vase of fresh flowers, two medicine jars, a thermometer, a teacup, and a glass straw for drinking boiled water.

A lonely hospital room, was that gentleman's "Eden"?

Naturally, it was more than that.

In the next small hospital room, on another white iron bed filled with the smell of medicine, lay a beautiful young lady. I didn't know her surname or given name, nor did I know where she came from, because she was very silent and very mysterious. But I could see that her illness was very serious, at least ten times more serious than mine, right? She couldn't get up and walk around and play like me. She coughed, had a fever, and constantly called out "Mommy" in a low voice.

However, every night, in the quiet, beautiful summer night, I often heard that young lady laughing softly.

Whether intentionally or unintentionally, I couldn't say myself. In any case, every evening, my feet would involuntarily wander to the outside of Mr. Zhang's and that young lady's room. There was a large balcony there. I leaned against a row of cement railings, looked up at the twinkling stars in the sky, and listened quietly to their conversation.

"Are you feeling better today? Did you finish your milk?" It was Mr. Zhang's voice.

"I'm feeling a bit better today, but I still can't drink the milk," the young lady replied softly.

"You're not listening to me again. You're not being good!"

The young lady didn't answer, but laughed softly. Ah! What a delicate laugh! "She's being coquettish," I thought. "Are they in love?" I thought again. So the next day, I went to Mr. Zhang's room and playfully teased him: "You're not listening to me again, you're not being good!"

Mr. Zhang smiled. Was it a bitter smile? No! It was a genuine laugh. "Don't tease me, you should be happy for me!" he once said to me.

Yes, I should be happy for him. But I couldn't forget that he was a man and that young lady was a woman. When a man and a woman are close, it's love. What is love? Isn't love a beautiful ladder? When climbing up this ladder, the only proper ending is marriage and bearing children. But they, a pair of patients on the verge of death, were also getting close, also in love. This was a bit too pointless! Did they also think about marriage and bearing children?

In my heart, a strong, thick wall stood tall. Inside this wall, although there weren't any indestructible old ethical stones, I couldn't deny that countless tiny traditional viewpoints, countless unconscious purely materialistic considerations, like a pile of tenacious mud and sand, had built this wall, blocking my sympathy and understanding for this poor couple, until one day, a very accidental day.

That day, Mr. Zhang seemed to be in particularly good spirits. He was wearing a blue striped terry cloth bathrobe, leaning against the bed, holding a small white envelope in his hand, his eyes watching the door, waiting for someone to pass by. When he saw me, he called out to me:

"Thank you, would you do me a favor?"

I chuckled: "Are you asking me to be a matchmaker? Of course! But when are you inviting me to the wedding feast?"

Hearing this, he smiled, but this time, I saw very clearly that he was smiling bitterly, an extremely awkward bitter smile.

"Why do you laugh at us with such words?" He began to say to me quietly: "Do you think we've forgotten where we are? Do you think we're still dreaming empty worldly dreams? Alas! Why don't you reach out and feel our aching chests? Why don't you look at the heavy cross on our backs?..."

He took two breaths and continued:

"However, I don't think our actions are completely pointless. What is this world anyway? What is true, what is false, what is meaningful, what is meaningless? Let me tell you, when I wasn't sick, I was busy all day long, and I never thought about these things. But since I carried this heavy cross on my back, I felt that even though I am mortal, why can't I be like Christ, on the terrible Mount Golgotha, in the moment of darkness, still use a gentle voice to give a fellow sufferer some comfort and say: 'Today I will be with you in paradise!' My relationship with her is based on this wish. My wish, I have told you, is to find paradise in suffering, which is what I call 'Each and Every One's Eden.' Of course, this is not limited to small relationships between men and women."

He finished speaking, looking at me wearily. I was very surprised. How could a gentleman I had only known for a short time say such a thing to me? But I understood him, I sympathized with him, so I delivered the letter to that beautiful young lady next door. At the same time, I asked the young lady's name and learned that her surname was Mei, and her given name was Lifang.

Mr. Zhang and Miss Mei Lifang died on the same night three weeks later, only an hour apart.

When their bodies were wrapped in pure white sheets and carried out of the hospital room, the stars on the summer night were so beautiful and bright. I stood under the pure starlight and silently blessed them...

The above is not writing a novel, nor is it telling a story, but describing a true event I saw in a certain hospital six years ago.

Now I want to tell you why I am describing this event.

This is because not long ago, I published a novel. The plot in that novel was somewhat similar to the above event. So a friend wrote to me and said that in this turbulent era, novelists should be brave warriors, opening up great scenes and blowing magnificent trumpets! They should not be coy and shrink back into narrow corners, describing some sad and meaningless affairs between men and women.

Although I am not a novelist, I cannot help but thank that friend for his guidance. But I would also like to tell that friend that in this turbulent era, there are many brave warriors, but even more are people struggling in hunger and disease, approaching death! They carry heavy crosses on their backs, wandering on the terrible Mount Golgotha, in pain, in despair, happiness has forgotten them, the world has forgotten them; but I cannot forget them, because I myself am one of them. Therefore, I know that my words will be seen by brave warriors, but I hope they will not be abandoned by a group of poor fellow sufferers, and I hope they can understand my purpose, which can also be said to be my wish, which is what Mr. Zhang said: to find paradise in suffering! To build "Each and Every One's Eden!" Of course, this is not limited to small relationships between men and women.

### Staying as a Couple, Flying as a Pair (95)

— Zhao Qingge

Coincidentally, Liu Ziyun's hometown was Wuhan, so she also used the excuse of escaping the war, resigned from her position at the girls' school, and decided to go with Lihua.

Regarding Liu Ziyun's going to Wuhan together, Mrs. Mo and Zhang Xian did not object either, because they knew that Liu Ziyun was from a famous family in Wuhan, and had considerable influence in the area. They wanted to use Liu Ziyun to open up relationships in this new environment, so they were willing to travel with her. Furthermore, they knew that Dong Shaoling was not going to Wuhan, and without Dong Shaoling, they had fewer concerns. Therefore, they welcomed Liu Ziyun's company even more. Their view of Liu Ziyun was: as long as Dong Shaoling was not around, no matter how close Liu Ziyun got to Lihua, it was not enough to threaten them. Because Liu Ziyun was ultimately a woman, and there was no danger in women liking women.

Lihua felt a serious pain because of her separation from Dong Shaoling! Although Liu Ziyun comforted her: Dong Shaoling would soon go to Wuhan anyway, and there was no need to take the temporary separation to heart. But Lihua couldn't help but feel vaguely sad! She thought: even for two or three days of not seeing each other, she felt empty as if she had lost something, and now she was going to be apart for many days, even months. Wasn't she going to be even more empty? Therefore, her heart began to feel a new kind of awkward worry! Her spirit also began to fall into a dazed, confused mood!

On the eve of their departure, Lihua, behind the backs of Mrs. Mo, Zhang Xian, Liyun, and Liu Ziyun, mustered up the courage to quietly run to the girls' school, found Dong Shaoling's dormitory, stood at the door, without shouting, nor walking in. In the silence of the darkness, her heart was filled with shy, fearful, anxious, and restless waves! For a long time, she slowly stepped forward.

The famous domestic violinist Ma Sicong went to Taiwan to perform and spend the summer a week ago. It is said that he can return to Shanghai in two months. It is also said that a symphony orchestra in Taiwan intends to invite Mr. Ma to be its conductor.

The Shanghai Music Association recently plans to hold a "Record Concert" on a regular basis every week in the Nanyang Garden. According to the Association, record concerts are educationally meaningful and have long been popular in Europe and the United States.

The Municipal Symphony Orchestra, formerly known as the "Municipal Council Orchestra," experienced considerable difficulties due to funding issues after its restoration. It is now temporarily funded by the municipal government with 20 million yuan per month. The musicians receive approximately 300,000 yuan per month each, and they regularly rehearse and perform. The performance times are every Wednesday and Saturday, and the location is at the Yihui Hall.

The former Municipal Council Orchestra improved Shanghai's musical standards and introduced orthodox Western music to Shanghai audiences. Now the Municipal Orchestra will also have greater tasks and contributions.

### The Problems of the 20th Century

— Commonplace

Two months ago, The Commercial Press published a translation by Zhu Baoxian, entitled "The Problems of the 20th Century." It was written by Lord Davies ten years after the League of Nations was established, dating back seven or eight years now. The targets of his criticism seem to have become a thing of the past. However, the "how to reduce the causes of war" discussed in the book is indeed the most serious and pressing major problem of the 20th century. This problem has not yet been solved and still requires people to work hard to solve it. This book proposes concrete scientific solutions, which are of great help to solving this problem. It is still worth discussing carefully. Now, I will first briefly introduce the contents of the book, and then add my own opinions on this issue.

Avoiding War

The book consists of twenty-one chapters. It first states that "avoiding war depends on the League of Nations to uphold fairness; disarmament will not succeed, and fairness cannot be implemented; disarmament depends on the establishment of security guarantees." Therefore, it advocates that "international police must be organized using scientific methods." It proves this with the history of the Greek city-state league, the Great Harmony Plan of Sully, Saint Pierre, and others. Such an organization is not only necessary but also achievable. Unfortunately, the gentlemen who drafted the League of Nations Charter at the time were mostly constrained by traditional concepts such as "national sovereignty," "absolute right of self-defense," and "competitive nature." They only perfunctorily followed the "Hurst-Miller draft" and completely rejected the proposal of the French representative Bourgeois to organize an international police force. Even the proposal to organize a permanent body to discuss such issues was rejected. As a result, the League of Nations became a hollow discussion forum. Although there was an International Court of Justice and an Arbitration Tribunal, the Executive Council had no power to enforce its judgments or rulings. As a result, international security remained non-existent. Not only could disarmament not be achieved, but the arms race was even more intense than before 1914. Next, it refutes the fallacies of the absolute "national sovereignty" and "absolute right of self-defense." It argues that national sovereignty and the right of self-defense are only relative, not absolute, in the international arena. Competition between countries, like various domestic competitions, must be subject to the restriction of rules, otherwise it will lead itself to destruction. Next, it extends Hobbes' "contract theory" to explain international relations, first amending the Covenant of the League of Nations to make the League of Nations a rudimentary confederation. The Executive Council should be reorganized by representatives from the five or seven major powers together with four smaller countries to preside over the committee, exercising international police control to make it a servant of fairness and a protector of international society. By applying domestic private law to international public law, the international arena will become a rule of law. Force will only be used to maintain fairness and punish contracting states or aggressor states. Surplus force will naturally be reduced without the need for disarmament.

International Police Force

The organization of the international police force is based on the "principle of weapon allocation." It is divided into two phases. The first phase is a trial period of twenty-five years. Those who wish to withdraw from the organization during this period must notify three years in advance. The armed forces of all member states are divided into three categories: (1) "City Police Force," equipped with batons, swords, and pistols; (2) "National Police Force," equipped with rifles, machine guns, cannons, and old-fashioned warships from before 1914, to maintain domestic security; (3) "International Police Force," which, in addition to temporarily requisitioning the national police forces of member states, also forms an "International Special Forces," equipped with newly invented aircraft, submarines, poison gas, and tanks after 1914. It is also agreed that all new weapons invented by member states in the future must be reported and used by the International Special Forces, with severe punishment for violations, to ensure that the international police force enjoys weapon superiority. Weapons, except for self-made aircraft, are purchased or leased from member states. Soldiers and officers are also borrowed from member states. However, the Commander-in-Chief and the four commanders of the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Poison Gas are elected by various powers on a rotation basis, jointly forming the General Staff, maintaining close contact with the general staffs of various member states on a regular basis. Peacetime expenses are shared by members according to the proportion of the League of Nations' annual fees. In wartime, all expenses are taken from the contracting state or aggressor state. The headquarters is located in Palestine, and the mainland stations and branch station military bases are selected for lease in four types of territories: mandated territories, neutral zones, important military locations, and small countries. At the end of the trial period, the weapons of the second phase are entirely self-made, and the soldiers and officers are entirely recruited and appointed by themselves. The apportionment of maintenance costs for their bases remains the same. During this period, member states wishing to withdraw from the organization must notify ten years in advance for it to take effect.

This method, although it cannot eliminate war, at least changes the nature of war. Although it cannot disarm immediately, the arms race can at least be stopped and hopefully gradually reduced. Although there are some shortcomings in the technical aspects of the organization that are too accommodating to nationalism, which are inevitable and still need to be discussed by experts, it has changed the concept of absolute sovereignty to a better one; the concept of absolute right of self-defense to one of mutual assistance; and the concept of competition to a spirit of cooperation. Psychologically, this is a great progress. If the League of Nations had adopted this plan that year, World War II might not have occurred. Now, after World War II, the United Nations has been established, with a conference of chiefs of staff of various member states attached to discuss issues such as international police. Prominent figures such as Einstein are also loudly advocating for it. If this method is carefully adopted by the United Nations, the so-called problem of the twentieth century cannot be said to be completely solved, but at least there is a way to solve it.

The Current Situation

But, looking at the current international situation where there is no mutual trust, is this method feasible? I cannot help but doubt.

First: The "contract theory" was originally a hypothesis of public law scholars and civil rights theorists, with no basis in history. According to the enlightenment of sociology, the people's surrender of the right of self-defense to be exercised by society on their behalf was originally forced by the so-called sovereign at the time—the chieftain or monarch—to maintain the治安秩序 within the territory. It was not out of volition. It later evolved into a judicial system. At the end of the Middle Ages, some scholars fabricated the contract theory to explain this phenomenon in order to promote civil rights and humanitarianism. However, experience always surpasses theory in governing human behavior. Today, the international arena is still in a state of anarchy. Who is the new sovereign? Who dares to assume the role of the king? Who can force whom to surrender the right of self-defense, and who is willing to automatically surrender the right of self-defense without a definite security guarantee?

Second: Examining the establishment process of various federations or confederations, they all have special historical backgrounds. The ancient Greek alliance was led by Athens and Sparta alternately. Modern examples such as the Swiss Confederation were due to united resistance against enemy countries. The Soviet Union and Germany were driven by a strong state. The United Kingdom of Great Britain was even due to the evolution of the empire. In short, it is not due to external coercion, but to internal coercion. Who is the coercer in the current international arena? Although it is said that if there is another world war, human civilization will be destroyed, which can force countries to unite peacefully. However, human actions always prioritize emotion over reason, and it is always easy to share adversity but difficult to share prosperity. You don't need to look far at ancient history, just look at the current US and Soviet Union as an example. They used to join hands to resist the Axis powers, how loving they were. They have all tasted the pain of World War II, which was fiercer than the first. If there is a third one, with the addition of atomic bombs, it will be much fiercer than the second. Logically, they should unite. However, once the ceasefire, they argued and refused to yield, as if forgetting the past and disregarding the future. It also seems that because they care about the future, they are arguing even more fiercely. Some people say that this is a struggle between democracy and socialism. I am afraid that this is still a superficial façade, and the "competitive impulse" is probably still at play in its bones. How can such a confederation be formed? Even if it is reluctantly formed, without a center capable of promoting it, it will be useless, just like the League of Nations in the past, which was centered on Britain and France. Britain and France could not cooperate, which led to the collapse of the League of Nations and triggered World War II. I think everyone remembers this short history of more than twenty years. The ancients said: "One pond cannot hold two dragons, one nest cannot hold two heroes." Unexpectedly, these words are still useful today. Human progress is truly pitiful!

Third: Military science progresses by leaps and bounds, and new weapons are invented endlessly. How can an international authority always maintain weapon superiority? According to reports, the United States has now invented "germ warfare." One ounce of botulinum toxin can poison 200 million people. The cost is only one-fortieth of that of an atomic bomb, but its effectiveness is thousands of times higher than that of an atomic bomb. Even poison gas cannot catch up with it. Manufacturing does not require a large factory, just a laboratory or distillation room is enough. The current international covenants are unreliable. Suppose one of the countries harbors ambitions or is dissatisfied with this "great nation" and "supreme force," it only surrenders the new weapons known to the international community, and keeps the new inventions of the germ category secret for its own use. I would like to ask what methods can be used to stop it? Strict inspection? I am afraid that excessive interference will easily cause rifts. Moreover, it is not easy to inspect. I would like to ask what methods the international police force has to maintain its advantage at all times?

It is a Psychological Problem

I am raising these questions not out of pessimism, but to draw everyone's attention to a deeper level. The so-called "problem of the 20th century is a psychological problem" and cannot be solved solely by organizing some strong force. Organization can indeed affect psychology, but improving psychology is ultimately a prerequisite for solving this problem. European culture, since Greece, has benefited greatly from analysis and struggle. After Darwin and others invented the law of evolution of survival of the fittest, they applied the "law of the jungle" of the biological world to all aspects of human social life. Everything is done with a spirit of struggle. The names of struggles emerge endlessly, and even religious groups that advocate cosmopolitanism struggle. Although Kropotkin and others promoted "mutual aid" to save this madness, the environment they created always made them feel that mutual aid is only for internal use, and struggle is still necessary for external use. Everyone knows that now that transportation is developed, the world has developed into a large and boundless whole. Some people also know that the world is a whole, and peace is indivisible, so they want to use violence to conquer the whole world. According to Mencius's theory that "the world is settled in one," there is also a reason, but we must also know that Mencius said "those who do not like to kill can" and "those who subdue people with virtue are kings, and those who use force to pretend to be benevolent are hegemons." Subduing people with force is not as good as subduing people with virtue. Subduing people with force, even if it does not follow in Hitler's footsteps, is only hegemony. Why not go a step further and seek to be the king that the world belongs to? Don't say that humans are the same as other creatures! Humans are ultimately different from animals: they have reason and morality, and there are ways to coexist and prosper in this large and boundless circle. What is the method? That is to strive to promote the "Doctrine of the Mean" taught by Chinese Confucianism and correct the traditional outlook on life of Europeans and Americans: from "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself" to "those who use great things to serve the small ones are happy." The so-called problem of the 20th century will not become a problem. Even if there is a problem, it is not difficult to solve it. Now the United Nations has an attached Scientific, Educational and Cultural Commission, which also seems to see the importance of international education. However, looking at their declaration charter, they only plan for cultural exchange and cultural cooperation, and have not found a guiding principle that meets the needs of the times to do their central work. I hope everyone will pay attention to this point.

### China Yearbook

— Zhou Ping

The seventh English edition of the China Yearbook, published by the Liberty Tribune, has been published. The content includes all major events in China in the years 1944 and 1945. As the name "Yearbook" implies, it is published once a year, but according to the editor's statement, due to the shortage of paper and the difficulty of collecting statistical data during the war, it had to be published as a combined two-year edition. The chief editor is Cao Wenyan, the consultant is Qian Qian Shu, and the writers are 　jia or heads of various departments. The content is divided into eight parts: (1) General Theory, which discusses China's geography, astronomy, population, climate, history, philosophy, literature and language; (2) Political Parties and Politics, which includes Sun Ke's statement of Mr. Zhongshan's political philosophy, Pan Gongzhan's explanation of the status of the Kuomintang and the National Government, and Shao Lizi's report on the process of the Senate; (3) The Organization of the National Government, which includes the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Supervisory, and Examination Yuan, as well as the affairs of the Interior, Mongolia and Tibet, and overseas Chinese; (4) Military Affairs, which includes Chen Cheng's discussion of military affairs, Zhou Zhirou's explanation of the Chinese Air Force, and the situation on various Chinese battlefields, and finally mentions Japan's unconditional surrender and China's acceptance of the surrender; (5) China's Relationship with the World, which explains various international conferences and China's diplomatic situation; (6) Finance and Economy, which discusses China's finance, banks, currency, foreign trade, domestic industrial development, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, grain and other issues; (7) Culture and Social Work, which discusses education, research, publishing, religion and various educational and economic undertakings; (8) A chronicle of major events in the past two years.

The book has a total of 1164 pages. It is truly a miracle that such a large book can be published in China during the war, and it also shows the country's emphasis on cultural undertakings. The printing and binding of this book are very exquisite, and some articles are also written very beautifully. From this book, you can see the progress of China during the war, and it can also be said to be a very complete historical material of China in the past two years. However, there are three points that we would also like to raise with the editor for discussion. First, we feel that some articles are slightly formulaic, seemingly official documents, and not deep enough into the people. It is not intimate. Second, the whole book focuses on planar narration and fails to fully explain the development of China in various aspects in the past two years. For example, the book talks about national philosophy and literature but does not mention any changes in the past two years. Also, the political dynamics of the past two years are not clearly and thoroughly explained. We believe that from the perspective of explaining the developments in recent years, only the sixth department's chapters on financial and economic development are relatively satisfactory. Third, we believe that there are still some omissions in this book. For example, the doctrines and activities of various parties and factions are hardly mentioned, the cultural movement is not clearly portrayed, and the religious undertakings of Islam and Buddhism are not mentioned at all. We hope that the editors will pay attention to the above three points when editing the eighth issue.

### Man and Brain

— Shaofu

A country child came to Shanghai, took a circle around Nanjing Road, and came back shouting with a headache, and slept on the bed for a full day before returning to normal. Adults are actually a little difficult to support, but the resistance to stimulation is different.

I often see a child who grows up in the city, sometimes sitting there in a daze, wondering what he is thinking about. He is only about ten years old, a kind of precocious and thoughtful state. I don't know whether to be happy or sad?

The burden on people's brains now is heavy enough, and science seems to have no way to test what a brain nerve should manage, and what the brain can store...

Let me give you a small question, dear reader, have you ever counted how many numbers you have recorded in your brain? If you write them down one by one, wouldn't it surprise you? For example, the house number of your residence, telephone number, shirt size, salary amount, family age, birthday, number of newspapers, appointments with friends, check number, debt dealings,... all are numbers, and these numbers are increasing day by day with your social relationships.

The item of numbers alone is enough to make a person dizzy. I have tried to ask several friends (including myself) about the main postal debts, such as express mail, registration, airmail, domestic and foreign. As a result, no one can answer.

Not only are the numbers gradually increasing, but they are also changing every day. Rice prices are something that everyone is concerned about. The rise and fall in the past month has cost us a lot of brain cells, not to mention the "烚赤哪美鈔哪" (untranslatable slang)!

Numbers don't count, good heavens! There are countless "things"! These things are not as tangible and mechanical as numbers, and can be simply memorized. Tell me, modern people, modern people living in the city, can they live long?

At first, I really didn't understand why various tonics and supplements are so popular in the city, and why memory decline and insomnia are so common. It turns out that city people are too willing to worry about their brains. They can recite the time of the insomnia programs on a certain radio station and the showtimes of a certain movie theater. How can they blame their brains for not being up to par?

### Red Flag Underground

— Yi Ji

Recently, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu launched a large-scale offensive. In addition to increasing the main force, they also forcibly recruited people from various villages to serve as vanguards and cannon fodder. The young and strong men in various villages fled one after another. A party member forcibly recruited a farmer.

The farmer said: "I am fifty-two years old. Can I be exempted?"

"Your body is still strong, so carry things for us!"

"I can't jump, I can't walk far, forgive me!"

"If you can't carry things, come with us to attack. It's good to strengthen the momentum. On the battlefield, one more person will make the enemy see one more black spot."

This party member was considered naive, and did not use their usual deception tricks, and directly pulled the farmer to be a small black spot. Of course, the small black spot that was pulled was not just that middle-aged farmer, but also many other black spots. These black spots sacrificed themselves for the Communist Party.

People in northern Jiangsu with more assets are guilty because they have wealth. They are "fleeing in fear of crime." Young and strong people without assets are afraid of being small black spots on the battlefield, so they have to flee. Therefore, refugees are everywhere in southern Jiangsu!

A big landlord, in order to preserve his family property, flattered the Communist Party. The county-level party members knew that he was insincere, but believed that it could be used as propaganda material, so they praised him as an "enlightened gentleman," appointed him as a senator, and gave him some small conveniences. Middle-level people looked askance and often said that the "big landlord" was opening his mind. When he went to the countryside to collect rent, the township-level cadres surrounded him and insulted him, and sometimes wanted to tie him up and throw him into the Yangtze River. When he reported to the county-level party members, they would give him some comfort and sometimes intercede with the township-level cadres to solve some minor problems. Now that the Communist Party is 　窮七見(impoverished and desperate), they no longer perfunctorily treat these people. The big landlord's fields have been divided up, and he has to flee. If he doesn't flee, he might really be sent to the Yangtze River to see the Sea Dragon King.

The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have been dragging on for a long time. The Communist Party is doing its best to plunder and oppress in northern Jiangsu. The people are suffering terribly, but the Communist Party's ugly face has also been exposed a lot. In the past, when we talked about the strange phenomena in the liberated areas to people in southern Jiangsu, people generally thought that we were telling myths. Now they should understand. Alas! Who doesn't love their hometown? Why do tens of thousands of refugees flee? There can't be so many fools in the world. They would never flee and become refugees unless they had suffered all kinds of hardships!

### Dedicated to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun (10)(7)

— Zhou Shoujuan

I remember the time when we were taking refuge from the bandits in Nanping Mountain Village in Anhui. Because I deeply missed our deceased son Rong, I once wrote a Ci poem called "Dian Jiang Chun": "Graceful soul, spring comes, traces all over the empty mountain road, clouds in the valley protect. There is the grave of my deceased son. Sleeping alone underground, with whom does he speak in loneliness? Do not be afraid! Plant some plum trees. Good companions living together." Thinking of this poem, I also thought of the old saying "peace after burial." During the second seven-day period after your death, I discussed it with Bao Mei and others, and we all thought it would be good to bury you within the seven-week period, so that you could accompany our deceased son, and neither of you would be lonely. Therefore, I entrusted the undertaker at the funeral home to transport your coffin to the Guta Cemetery under the mountain in advance. At the same time, I contacted Mr. Jiang Zhongchuan and Mr. Chen Weiyin, who were in charge of the cemetery, and finalized the arrangements. On the 29th, at 7 a.m. before the seventh seven-day period, I, along with Bao Mei, Shi Jing, Zheng Er, and Mei Er, a group of five people, took a boat to Linggu to bury you. That day, it suddenly started raining again, arousing endless sorrow and confusion in me. Fortunately, Rong's tomb, although it had gone through a great calamity, was still intact, and the tombstone was still standing upright, with the posthumous photo in his Boy Scout uniform embedded on the front, full of vigor. The inscription by Mr. Huhu on the back was also clearly readable. Fortunately, your tomb had already been dug in advance, and the procedures were very simple. Taking advantage of the temporary break in the rain, we buried you. The weeping of Bao Mei and Mei Er echoed the sound of the earthworkers shoveling soil, striking my heart one after another, crumbling like clods of earth. Alas, wind! From now on, Rong will be protected under your loving care and will not be afraid. And you, having this child to please you, will surely not feel lonely at night. But since I lost you, my lonely shadow is desolate, and this loss is irreplaceable!

After the news of your death spread, relatives and friends in Shanghai were very shocked and grieved. They sent letters of condolence one after another, and gave generous gifts, all advising me to take a detached view, and to find solace for myself. The lines from my brother-in-law Yiyi, "Though life and death are different, affection between relatives remains the same," gave me the greatest comfort, knowing that my love is boundless. The senior Mr. Shushu had broken his strings three times and had been through similar experiences. He specially wrote a pair of elegiac couplets: "With thoughts of the old garden, follow your husband back to seclusion, willing to choose a nearby place to live until old age." "Autumn dreams filled with European waves, reading Yuanzhen's elegiac poems, feeling the sympathy of those who have suffered the same illness." Sharing the same sorrow can alleviate some of my grief. My literary friend Mao Yuman also sent a scroll of elegiac poems, which are two heptasyllabic poems: "Purple orchids wither, willow catkins droop, white stones and clear springs move in the small calamity; silver candle shadows mournfully hang, pearl curtains faintly recite posthumous poems; moths suddenly break out of the same palace, phoenixes leave empty nests to face the sun; after finishing the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, doubled sadness, in the human world and in heaven, love always remains." "Piles of old books stir up deep sorrow, under the flowers, the father-in-law speaks of painting eyebrows; paper leaves and lotus flowers communicate the wonderful Dharma, red lessons are ordered at the window next to the bamboo fence to write new poems. The elegance of pulling out a hairpin hangs on the red bamboo brush, raising the tray with a smile, the music blends with the zither silk; realizing that humans and heaven are originally one breath, the six likenesses of bubbles and illusions are unbearable to hold." Elegant and mournful, they are truly excellent words. However, to compare you to a talented woman, you would be ashamed to accept. But if I say you are a typical good wife and loving mother, then you can accept it without hesitation.

Gleanings in Brief

### Enemy and Puppet Materials Are Molding Away; No Date Set for Sealing and Sale

— Wuling Ren

Zeng Guofan's diary records: "Minister Luo Yin served as an official in the provinces of Zhili, Hubei, and Zhejiang for a total of twenty-five years. His family did not have a single humble dwelling, and he only sent three hundred taels of silver home. His wife never wore a fur coat her whole life, truly the first honest official of the day." If it were today, then people would certainly ridicule Mr. Luo's style, and for the wife of an official not to wear a fur coat her whole life, is truly a pity.

It is estimated that four-fifths of school-age children in Beiping are out of school. In Ningbo and other places, enemy and puppet period textbooks are still being sold and used for enslavement education. In Shanghai, amidst the movement to respect teachers, a school principal was found to have raped a female student. Who would have expected such a thing?

Enemy and puppet materials are sealed in warehouses, left to mold and rot. Even if they were immediately unsealed and sold, they would be sold at a great discount. At the same time, warehouse rent has increased, and as a result, enemy and puppet materials cannot be moved out, making it impossible for them to continue operating, causing great distress. I don't know what benefit the authorities see in "hoarding" so many enemy and puppet materials?

I hailed a rickshaw at the intersection of Pentang Lane and Nanjing Road to go to Dixiwei Road. He asked for twenty yuan. I asked if it could be cheaper. The rickshaw puller gave me a cold look and said, "If you want cheaper, you can take the tram." I don't hate him for speaking so harshly, but I blame the tram company for allocating so few trams to that route.

### Please Take a Look at Northern Jiangsu! No Sincerity, Only Deceit; No Love, Only Hate; "Democracy" on Their Lips, "Despotism" in Their Hearts!

— Ji

People are dissatisfied with the reality, and so they yearn for vague things. This is human nature. That is why many people who like to talk about politics and have not tasted the flavor of the Communists have a good impression of the Communist side. But in many places in northern Jiangsu, we have been under the rule of Yan'an for seven years. Tears have run dry for seven years. I hope that people from the Democratic League will quietly come to northern Jiangsu as ordinary citizens and stay for a few days to see what it's like. Will they embrace and weep with the suffering compatriots!

Some people say that the Communist Party is not a party, but a religion. Our experience of the past seven years has made us feel that this is absolutely true. The words, actions, treatment of people, and handling of things by party members are all the same as those of religious followers. They are always the same routine. Once inside, they lose their reason and blindly follow the party's orders.

Communist Party members are all extremely radicalized people. They have strong organizational skills and do things thoroughly. This is what moves people. They have such power because of these abilities. When officials do things, they consider it done after completing six or seven tenths of the task. When they do it, it's not twelve tenths, but twenty-four tenths, so the people suffer twelve tenths.

Radicalized people are too enthusiastic about doing things. They always pay attention to everything the common people eat and say. If it doesn't suit their will, there is danger. Therefore, the people in the liberated areas always feel that they are being monitored all the time, and there is a possibility of danger happening anytime and anywhere, so they cannot help but flee.

Some people say: "The Communist Party members' dictionary does not have the word "sincerity," only the word "deceit," no word of "love," only the word of "hate." "Democracy" is on their lips, "despotism" is in their hearts." Our observations over the past seven years have made us feel that these words are not wrong at all.

They also have no laws. They also claim to have a three-trial system, but the court rarely opens trials. Everything is handled by township and district cadres. Lower-level cadres only have preconceived notions and no legal principles. The relatively poor are always victorious. In the dilapidated countryside, where do you find the bourgeoisie? A hard-working person who has a little savings is often tricked by unemployed poor people. Now hard-working people are not happy to work hard to farm the land. If the harvest is good, people will pay attention, and they will be bullied, and there will be danger.

### Swimming Is Also a Problem

— Li Jinxiang

Currently, only the Hongkou public swimming pool is open in Shanghai. Therefore, although the ticket price is high, the pool is still often full, and there is a constant stream of swimmers, even more prosperous than in previous years.

Originally, swimming is an excellent form of exercise, which is of great benefit to human health. When summer arrives, young men and women who love swimming want to immerse themselves in the clear pool water to pass the hot summer.

But this year it is unlikely.

(1) High ticket prices—definitely not something that ordinary commoners can often afford.

(2) The journey—how much time do you think it would take for commoners living in the French Concession or Nanshi to go to the Hongkou swimming pool? Transportation is so inconvenient.

(3) Too many swimmers—the small Hongkou swimming pool is crowded with one or two hundred people, and then they become like sardines, bumping into each other. Some people get hurt, some people get kicked. This is what most swimmers find most troublesome and very annoying!
