### Northeast Ceasefire Agreement Signed; Effective Until the 22nd of This Month; Personnel Designated for Changchun Executive Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Today is the ninth day after the announcement of the Northeast ceasefire order, with only six days remaining until the ceasefire deadline. Yesterday, the specific measures for the Northeast ceasefire, drafted by Envoy Marshall and government representatives with the CCP representatives regarding the first item of Chairman Chiang's ceasefire order instructions, and the agreed-upon document "based on the three agreements on the Northeast ceasefire deliberated by the Military Tripartite Committee in Chongqing on March 23rd," were reviewed by General Beall at 11 p.m. last night after presenting it to Chairman Chiang. This afternoon, Envoy Marshall, government representative Xu Yongchang, and CCP representative Zhou Enlai re-signed the agreement one by one, after which the agreement was declared complete.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The organization of the Changchun Forward Headquarters of the Military Mediation Executive Department and the specific measures for the Northeast ceasefire were determined at noon today by the Military Tripartite Committee Marshall, Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, government representative General Cai Shoulien, and CCP representative General Rao Shushi. It is reported that General Beall is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 16th with Major General Li Minran, deputy leader of the CCP's Shenyang Central Group, and Major General Wang Shoudao of the 27th Group, for work. It is reported that Li and Wang visited Envoy Marshall at 9:30 this morning and had discussions with General Beall.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] It is reported that there are currently four groups in the Northeast Executive Group of the Military Mediation Department. After the establishment of the Changchun Forward Headquarters, there may be an increase of seven or eight groups. Government representatives for these groups are currently being selected and dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense. CCP representatives will be selected and dispatched from Yan'an. The overall situation has indeed revealed a ray of dawn in a state of contradiction. This morning at 11 a.m., Colonel Hill, chief of the Traffic Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, visited Zhou Enlai at Plum Garden New Village to exchange views on the restoration of traffic. According to the CCP's own statement, they have obtained a close proposal. Huang Yifeng, the CCP representative of the Traffic Management Section of the Beiping Military Mediation Department, also arrived in Nanjing by plane from Beiping at 3 p.m. today. Mr. Huang was summoned by Zhou Enlai to come to Nanjing to participate in traffic negotiations. It is reported that Minister of Communications Yu Dawei has formulated an entire plan for the restoration of traffic based on the chairman's instructions and the conclusions of previous meetings with Envoy Marshall and Zhou Enlai, Colonel Hill, etc. Once all parties' opinions converge, formal negotiations will be held within days to make a final decision. If the CCP genuinely intends to restore traffic and no accidents occur, this agreement can be completed.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Today, General Marshall seems likely to seize a good opportunity to achieve agreements on a ceasefire, restoration of traffic, and reorganization of troops before the ceasefire deadline on the 15th. However, most observers express extreme pessimism about a long-term solution. Reliable sources here say that after lengthy talks between Marshall, Zhou Enlai, and Yu Dawei, an agreement has now been reached between the KMT and the CCP on the traffic issue.

However, with only seven days remaining until the ceasefire deadline, many urgent issues remain to be resolved.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Nanjing New Citizen Evening News on the 15th carried a news item stating that both parties had signed the Northeast ceasefire measures and that Chairman Chiang had personally signed the news. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Chairman Chiang's attendant secretary, who said: The Chairman did not sign any documents of this agreement. According to what I (the secretary referring to himself) know, General Beall visited the Chairman the night before last and presented a proposal to add to the Northeast Executive Group to conduct mediation. The Chairman stated that since the Communist army had long occupied Siping Street, Changchun, and other places, the March 27th agreement had been completely destroyed by them. However, the Chairman, in view of the enthusiasm of the United States for mediation, and in order to achieve peace as soon as possible, as long as there are detailed and effective ceasefire measures by June 22nd, he would not object to this proposal. However, the validity of this agreement can only be limited to the 22nd of this month, it was said. It was also heard that, regarding this point, Minister Xu also made a special statement when signing the agreement, so the report in the newspaper is inconsistent with the facts.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] According to the U.S. proposal, if negotiations are successful in the future, the Military Mediation Department will send at least eight groups to the Northeast. These groups may be stationed in Harbin, Qiqihar, Hailar, and Haicheng. It is also reported that Marshall, Xu Yongchang, and Zhou Enlai will soon go to Shenyang.

### Communist Troops Active in the Songhua River Area; Taking Advantage of the Ceasefire to Continuously Launch Attacks; National Army Asks the Executive Department to Swiftly Stop Them

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] A unit of the 21st Brigade of the 7th Column of the Communist Army's Jireliao Field Military Region attacked the bridgehead positions on the north bank of the Songhua River defended by the National Army at 9 a.m. on the 11th, destroying two lines of obstacles. The National Army defending the area was forced to resist, resulting in fierce fighting. By the hour of Chou (1-3 am) on the 12th, the Communist army retreated northeast. However, at daybreak on the same day, it again launched a full-scale attack on the National Army from the west side of the railway, all of which failed. Since the morning of the 13th, they have retreated towards Taolaizhao. Yesterday, about 20-odd Communist soldiers arrived from Shulan at Ma'anshan, more than 20 kilometers north of Lafa, and then scurried through Guangcen, more than 10 kilometers southwest of that location, to build fortifications. Furthermore, the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Communist Army stationed in Lafa, namely the 22nd Brigade, are still entrenched in the Bohe area. The Communist Army is taking advantage of the ceasefire opportunity, breaking faith, and attacking the National Army. The military authorities have telegraphed the Executive Department to swiftly stop them.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] A reporter went to the front line of the Songhua River on the 9th to inspect and visited General Pan Yukun, commander of the forward garrison. According to Mr. Pan, before the ceasefire order was issued, the National Army had advanced to Taolaizhao, 17 li (Chinese miles) north of the Songhua River, and to Wujiazhan, 50 li west of Taolaizhao, and Wukeshu, 40 li east of Taolaizhao. After receiving the ceasefire order at 9 a.m. on the 7th, they immediately stopped the pursuit as ordered. Unexpectedly, three hours after the ceasefire order took effect, at 3 p.m. on the 7th, 700-800 Communist soldiers attacked Wukeshu. At 9 p.m. on the same day, another force of about 1,000 attacked Taolaizhao and Wujiazhan. On the 8th, a Communist unit, including 300 cavalry, attacked Halaha, failing and retreating. At 11 p.m. on the 10th, Communist soldiers, carrying artillery and more than a dozen light and heavy machine guns, attacked Xiaochengzi, 8 li from the Songhua River, and were immediately repelled by our defending troops. According to information obtained on the 10th, the Communist Army is currently massing forces towards Wangjiazhi, attempting to cross the river and launch an attack.

After Chairman Liang delivered a brief opening speech, Mr. Du delivered a speech on the spot. He first explained Chairman Chiang's concern for the compatriots of the Northeast since the September 18th Incident. Although Chairman Chiang had made a trip to Changchun before, he was unable to meet with many compatriots, so this time he specially represented Chairman Chiang to come here to express his condolences. He then explained the importance of national unity and construction, and finally elaborated on the protection of foreigners and the "army loves the people, and the people help the army" aspects. Subsequently, Feng Changzeng, a representative of the citizens, delivered a welcome speech, expressing a warm welcome to Chief Du's arrival in Changchun, and praising and thanking Commander Yu Enxin of the 10th Air Force District for his achievements in Changchun.

### Defending the Land and Protecting the People is a Duty Inescapable; Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Releases a Statement Yesterday; The Government Hopes to Resolve Everything Within Fifteen Days

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department recently released the following statement: The government earnestly hopes to resolve the most pressing issues within the fifteen-day period, while the Communist side wants to discuss the traffic issue first, and then the issue of reorganizing and integrating the armed forces. If this is delayed, then these urgent problems will not be effectively resolved within the prescribed period. It is hoped that the Communist side will pay attention to the fact that the Communist side has launched widespread attacks in the past week, but the Communist side has propagandized that it has been attacked by government troops and is acting in self-defense. This is putting the cart before the horse in propaganda. May I ask, if the Communist side did not attack, how could important cities and towns such as Dezhou, Taian, Zhoucun, Jiaoxian, Zaozhuang, and Hanzhuang have been occupied by the Communist side? If the Communist side cannot withdraw from these cities and towns occupied after June 7th, then is it not obvious that they have torn up the ceasefire agreement? Someone asked why the government dispatched fleets to Qingdao one after another. We can tell you that the Communist army has recently besieged various places near Qingdao and repeatedly attempted to land without success. The government has the responsibility to defend the land, protect the people, and maintain law and order, so it cannot just sit idly by.

### Traffic on Four Railways, Including Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, and Beiping-Hankou, is Being Restored; The Entire Shenyang-Changchun Section Will Open Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] According to sources familiar with the matter, the Ministry of Communications has begun preparations to restore traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou, Jiaoji, Beiping-Hankou, and Longhai Railways. It is expected that the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways can be repaired within a month and a half. However, traffic restoration must be preceded by a ceasefire, and a ceasefire must be preceded by troop withdrawal. Based on the current negotiation process, people who generally care about the traffic issue all confirm that quickly determining the Communist army's defense zone to solve the two major problems of "ceasefire" and "troop withdrawal" is a prerequisite for restoring traffic. It is understood that Envoy Marshall is recently using his extraordinary wisdom to work on this and will soon submit it for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The emergency repair work on the Shenyang-Changchun section of the China Changchun Railway has been completed. A trial run from Siping to Changchun was conducted today, and the situation was good. It was decided to resume full traffic on the entire Shenyang-Changchun section at 7:30 a.m. on the 16th. Furthermore, the section from Shenyang Dashiqiao to Yingkou on the same route has also been repaired and opened to traffic yesterday.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] Half a month after the Northeast ceasefire order was issued, railway traffic continued to be destroyed by the Communist army. More than 400 Communist soldiers at the Tuzitou Station, 10 li from the Jin-Yu section of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway, attacked the escort team at 2 a.m. on the 13th and were repelled around 4 a.m. In the Yaoguantun-Xingji section of the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, seven rails were destroyed by landmines planted by the Communist army at 2 a.m. on the 13th. After the Railway Bureau sent a team to repair it, it was repaired at 8:15 a.m. on the same day.

### The Situation in Qingdao Turns Mild; Government Sends Ships to Standby

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The tense situation in Qingdao and Jinan, which came on fiercely and left in a hurry, has eased due to the result of U.S. Admiral Kirk coming to Beijing to ask Envoy Marshall for instructions and the CCP repeatedly issuing statements that they do not intend to attack Qingdao and Jinan. According to those who came to Beijing from Shandong yesterday and today, the sea off Qingdao is indeed calm, but Jinan is still heavily surrounded.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 15th] Qingdao was safe and sound on the 14th night and the 15th day. However, there is still fighting in the Xiaozhuang Yongyuan area of the suburbs. The fighting in Jimmo Gaoning is particularly fierce. Land transportation between Qingdao City and outside counties is cut off. Mayor Li Xianliang drove to Xiaozhuang to inspect on the afternoon of the 15th. In the afternoon of the 15th (Saturday), the U.S. military took its usual holiday, and the 24 U.S. cinemas were open. Merchants from Shanghai and other places were massively selling off their stocks, and prices of various goods fell, and grain prices also eased.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei, when issuing a statement today on the government's policy towards the serious situation in Shandong Province, said: We are now dispatching naval vessels to Qingdao under the threat of the Communist army, because the government cannot sit idly by. Dispatching ships is fulfilling the government's obligation to maintain domestic stability and order. Mr. Peng also said: If the Communist army does not withdraw from the cities it has occupied since June 7, [then they have obviously torn the ceasefire agreement to shreds.]

[Our News] The Navy's Office of the Special Commissioner stationed in Shanghai is being reorganized and a Fleet Command is being established since the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense. The commander is concurrently held by Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and Wei Jimin is the Chief of Staff. Currently, due to the tense situation in Qingdao and the Communist army's attempt to land from the sea, the Command has dispatched the Changzhi, Yongde, Xianning and other ships to stand by, and Wei has also gone to Qingdao to inspect a few days ago.

### Chen Yi's Statement; Probably Has Another Purpose

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] Chen Yi issued a statement yesterday and telegraphed the Military Mediation Department at the same time, saying that he welcomed the government to send personnel to Linyi to discuss and resolve the Shandong issue. Responsible persons on the government side today said that Chen Yi's move is a conspiracy, and its intention is to create a fait accompli and seek compromise with a superior position, so negotiation is possible, but the Communist army must first withdraw from the cities it has recently occupied, otherwise there is no need to discuss.

[United Press, Qingdao, 15th] Chen Yi, commander of the Communist New Fourth Army, today asked the government not to use Qingdao to transport National Army troops to the Northeast and guaranteed that he would not attack Qingdao. Mr. Chen held talks with U.S. military officers at his battlefield headquarters on Wednesday, during which he firmly denied that his troops intended to attack Qingdao and declared: The Communist army's activities in various towns near Qingdao are to deal with puppet troops. Mr. Chen sent separate letters to Admiral Kirk, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and Clement, commander of the U.S. forces in Qingdao, stating: He was very concerned about the rumors that the National Army's 4th and 53rd Armies were about to leave Shanghai for Qingdao and then to the Northeast, and he intended to ask the U.S. military to prevent it on their behalf. The talk of the Communist army attacking Qingdao has gradually subsided today. Hao Ding, a representative of the Communist Party, and Larson, a representative of Kirk, flew from Qingdao to Linyi on a small reconnaissance plane to meet with Chen Yi. After a seven-hour meeting, they returned to Qingdao. Chen Yi put forward three suggestions, namely: (1) The National Army guarantees not to use Qingdao, (2) A dispatch of an executive team to Qingdao to deal with small-scale conflicts in the surrounding area, and (3) Welcome U.S. technicians and capital to develop various coal mines in the Shandong occupied area. Hao left Qingdao for Nanjing this morning to report the suggestions to Zhou Enlai, or Zhou will relay them to Envoy Marshall.

### U.S. and Chinese Military Joint Defense of Qingdao; U.S. Claims There Is No Such Thing

[Our News] According to the U.S. naval authorities here, they told reporters yesterday: The Communist army has had no impact on the U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao so far, and the naval dynamics in Qingdao are as usual.

It is also learned that Admiral Kirk, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, will move to Qingdao with his staff this month, but the exact departure date has not yet been determined.

[Central News Agency, this city] Admiral Kirk, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy in China, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday: Regarding the actions of the Communist army attacking Qingdao, the countermeasures taken by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao cannot be clearly stated, but the U.S. military has its own policies. When the reporter asked about the strength of the U.S. Navy in Qingdao, Admiral Kirk said: The strength is increased or decreased at any time to adapt to the environment.

### 22 Military Traitors in Beiping Have Been Investigated by the Provisional Headquarters; Lu Ying, Former Head of Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, Indicted

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 15th] The 22 military traitors Wen Kai, Huang Haipeng, Ying etc. arrested by the Beiping Provisional Headquarters have been actively interrogated by the military law department of the Provisional Headquarters, and the investigation has been completed today. After two more weeks of investigating evidence of crimes, a public trial will begin. Also, nearly 200 Japanese war criminals have been arrested by the Eleventh War Zone, among whom the more important ones include Lieutenant General Uchida, who was a division commander and formerly stationed in Tianjin, and Colonel Mochikawa, who specialized in intelligence. Former Supreme Commander of the North China Dispatch Army, General Neiji Okamura, is still sitting securely within the Liaison Headquarters. Although he is a core member of the Japanese control faction and one of the main plotters of aggression against China, it has not been heard that he has been listed as a war criminal. The Eleventh War Zone has arrested about 200 war criminals, but few of them are needed, and even fewer are automatically reported by the people. The Military Law Bureau here believes that this is an overabundance of leniency on the part of our people. Among the nearly 200 war criminals, verdicts have been rendered in 21 cases, indictments in more than 30 cases, and investigations are underway in more than 30 cases.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Far East and Pacific Branch of the United Nations War Crimes Commission held its first meeting after the return to the capital on the afternoon of the 14th.

### Ministry of Finance Revises Banking Regulations to Restrict the Establishment of New Banks and Strictly Prevent Speculation and Hoarding

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Ministry of Finance is actively taking steps to improve financial control. In addition to the existing commercial banks, the establishment of new banks will be restricted, and bank management will be strengthened to guide their lending to construction projects and prevent speculation and hoarding.

### Suzhou High Court Prosecutor Investigates Rice Hoarders Zhang Weiru and Hong Junxiang for Providing Grain to the Enemy

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 15th] Suzhou rice hoarders Zhang Weiru and Hong Junxiang illegally used the huge sum of money allocated by Wu Rongsheng of the Shanghai San Tai Rice Mill to absorb more than 5,000 dan of rice at high prices within three days. As a result, the price of rice in the market jumped from more than 10,000 yuan to more than 36,000 yuan. After Sheng Zhixing, a candidate senator of the Provisional Council, reported the matter to the Provisional Council, and a unanimous attack from the press, the Suzhou authorities decided to thoroughly investigate the matter.

### Editorial: Severely Punish Corrupt Officials and Rice Weevils

The grain loan fraud case has now become a major case that has attracted widespread attention! It is not because of the large amount of corruption involved in the case. To be honest, ten billion yuan is not a huge sum of money from today's currency value. Calculated at five thousand times the price, it is only two hundred thousand yuan. Even if it is all embezzled, it does not seem to be a major corruption case before the war. The reason why the grain loan case is receiving unanimous attention from both the government and the public today is due to three major reasons: (1) Rice prices have risen alarmingly. The government implemented grain loans to suppress rice prices, but there are still corrupt officials and rice weevils who take advantage of this opportunity to engage in fraud and enrich themselves. This is truly insane. (2) Cracking down on hoarding and sanctioning speculation have long been the consensus of society and the decision of the government. However, some people still want to take advantage of the low-interest public funds to fulfill their dreams of hoarding and speculation on "people's food." How can they not be condemned by everyone? (3) The National Government has repeatedly emphasized the severe punishment of corrupt officials, but since the victory, rumors of corruption have spread. Now that this undeniable major case has been discovered, people want to see what measures the government will take to show its determination to eliminate corruption.

Good! Now there is hope! When this major case first occurred, we knew that the central authorities had dispatched special agents to Shanghai to investigate secretly. Later, Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Inspector, officially filed charges and announced the investigation results. The court has also scheduled a public hearing. According to the Central News Agency, the main culprit in the case was already under close surveillance the night before Da Ren, and the Garrison Headquarters also received a hand-written order from the highest authorities to strictly investigate the case. Focusing on the case, we believe that the results of the investigation and interrogation will definitely reveal the truth. No matter how corrupt the officials or treacherous the weevils, they should not be able to escape the law.

However, what makes us particularly saddened and indignant about the grain loan fraud case is, as Inspector Cheng said, "directly harming people's livelihood and indirectly undermining the government's credibility." It cannot be compared to ordinary corruption cases. According to the facts listed in the indictment published by the Inspector's Office in the newspapers, the following points are summarized: (1) There are no restrictions on the commercial firms applying for grain loans. Officials and merchants collude and cheat each other, and most of them are pre-arranged by the Grain Administration Office. (2) After the "grain merchants" obtain the loans, some do not immediately go to the production areas to purchase grain, but instead lend them out at high interest rates and reap the benefits. Some do not immediately sell the grain after purchasing it, attempting to hoard and speculate. Some divert the proceeds from the sale of grain to other uses. The Grain Administration Office has failed to fulfill its supervisory and assessment responsibilities for these situations. (3) In late April, rice prices soared. The Grain Administration Office, citing market disputes, ordered the suspension of sales of grain loan rice for as long as ten days, causing rice prices to rise sharply. (4) The Grain Administration Office has cleverly created the item of "review fee," but there is no such provision in the loan measures approved by the Ministry of Food. (5) When the loan was approved, public opinion strongly criticized it, but the Grain Administration Office turned a deaf ear. "What are they relying on to be so fearless, and who is the mastermind behind them?"

From the five points mentioned above, the reason why the grain loan fraud case should be investigated is entirely due to "fraud" and not due to "grain loans." Recently, a viewpoint has suddenly emerged that the grain loan case is wrong in policy, not in technique. Its intention is nothing more than to say "there should not be grain loans," as if there would be no fraud without grain loans. All the blame should be borne by those who approved the grain loan policy. This is truly "ingenious speech"! Because of the high price of rice in Shanghai, everyone said that there was little rice in storage, high interest rates, and high costs, so they requested low-interest grain loans. At that time, did anyone object? Moreover, if the government did not approve the loan and the price of rice continued to rise, everyone would have accused the government. So what is wrong with the government allocating funds for grain loans! To be fair, "grain loans" are not guilty, but those who "fraudulently" handle grain loans are indeed guilty. Therefore, what the government is investigating today is the crime of those who handle grain loans and have fraudulent "techniques." If there is anything wrong with the grain loan case, it is wrong with this fraudulent "technique"!

Secondly, the rice weevils in this case are rumored to be of different sizes, and there are also merchants mixed in. "It is gratifying to expose both foxes and jackals", but for the sake of rectifying the discipline, it is better to kill jackals than to kill foxes, and it is better to punish corrupt officials than to punish treacherous merchants! Because killing foxes and letting go of jackals, and punishing treacherous merchants and acquitting corrupt officials, this method is still following the old path of "officials protecting each other." As a result, "those who steal a country become princes, and those who steal a hook are executed." It is not only insufficient to punish one as a warning to a hundred, but it may also cause public resentment. We dare to say one more honest word: if there were no corrupt officials, even if treacherous merchants wanted to be "treacherous," they would have no way to sell their "schemes." The ancients have long said: "The failure of the state is due to corrupt officials; the loss of virtue of officials is due to bribery." Inspector Cheng also said: "If you want to eradicate treacherous merchants, you must first eliminate corrupt officials." This is an irrefutable saying. Moreover, we believe that to punish corrupt officials, we must first punish the big corrupt officials who preside over the fraud. Inspector Cheng is also well aware of this. The only pity is that in his indictment, he only said "who is the mastermind behind them?" Although it seems to be on the verge of being revealed, it is ultimately hesitant. People have always believed that the Inspectorate can only "swat flies" when it comes to indicting corrupt officials, but they remain silent on high-ranking officials. However, in almost every case of embezzlement and fraud, there is a mastermind behind it. As a result, it is often the "one and a half official" small officials who suffer, while high-ranking officials remain at large. Therefore, officials should not be afraid of power and should not avoid risks, and should try to file charges as much as possible, especially against these masterminds. Only by severely punishing those in power who commit fraud can we truly punish one as a warning to a hundred. Taking this case as an example, not to mention the mastermind behind the scenes, Yang Xizhi, the special commissioner of the Grain Administration Office who was charged, is already enjoying himself abroad. Moreover, after the Ministry of Food abolished the Grain Administration Office and established the Storage and Transportation Office, Yang Xizhi still had to be appointed as the director and deputy director in Da Ren. What else can be said!

### Four Foreign Ministers Resume Meeting in Paris, US and Soviet Attitudes Remain Firm, Treaty Issues Will Still Be the Focus of Contention

[Our Newspaper Report] Paris, 15th Broadcast: A few minutes ago (1:00 AM, Shanghai time, on the 16th), the four-power foreign ministers' meeting resumed. British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived first, and Molotov arrived late. They immediately started the meeting to discuss the agenda. The meeting is still in progress.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: Soviet representative Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin shook hands in the Luxembourg Hall, showing their goodwill. It can be seen that there is still hope for compromise in the future for the four foreign ministers.

[United Press, Paris, 14th] The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union gathered here today. At that time, the US side sent out the news that the US and the Soviet Union had a firm attitude towards the dispute over the treaty, which was no different from the situation at the last meeting a month ago. US Secretary of State Byrnes arrived first on President Truman's private plane. Shortly thereafter, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov (accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Deganosov) also arrived in succession. According to Byrnes's aides, since the adjournment of the meeting in May, the US and Soviet governments have not exchanged opinions diplomatically. If the Soviet attitude has eased, it will be known at the meeting. After Byrnes entertained reporters here tonight, the general impression was that Byrnes was still optimistic, but there was no factual basis for whether a considerable agreement could be reached on the major disputes between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Netherlands. The US still insists that Trieste should belong to Italy, and the Balkan countries should be open to trade with Western countries. The Italian reparations should be limited to what it can afford. The US still wants to sign a 25-year mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, Britain, and France to jointly monitor the disarmament of Germany.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Before leaving for France, Bevin smiled at the airport and said: I have always had hope for the foreign ministers' meeting. God is the master of all things. I hope God will be more merciful this time.

[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] After arriving in Paris today, Byrnes said: I am very happy to come back again. Connally also told reporters that he was very optimistic. The US delegation immediately started work, giving the impression that they would spare no effort. In reality, the atmosphere of this foreign ministers' meeting is more favorable than the last time. President Truman's special plane [Sacred Cow] on which the US delegation was riding has flown back to the United States.

### The Division and Unity of the World All Depend on This Meeting

[US Information Service, San Francisco, 14th] Before the opening of the foreign ministers' meeting, American newspapers published editorials one after another, discussing and commenting on it. The New York Times emphasized the importance of the Paris peace talks yesterday, stating briefly: "During the war and in the turbulent first year of peace, meetings of foreign ministers and heads of state have been held many times, each of which was important in nature, but none was as important as the upcoming Paris meeting. The Paris meeting will determine whether the outcome of the war will be one world or two worlds." The newspaper's editorial writer mentioned Secretary of State Byrnes's plan to divide the administration of Germany, saying: "The meeting that will reopen on June 15th has the hope of restoring the wartime cooperation policy of the Allies. Otherwise, the relations between the major powers will become increasingly tense, and there will be a tendency to accelerate the division of the world into two."

### The Fate of the Potsdam Agreement Can Be Decided

[French News Agency, Paris, 14th] When the foreign ministers' meeting reopens, the fate of the Potsdam Agreement can be seen. According to international sources, the British and American delegations believe that if certain matters in the Potsdam Agreement, which they consider to be major points, cannot be implemented, then the entire agreement should be considered invalid. If so, then the decisions made by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union regarding the eastern border of Germany will no longer be respected.

### German-American and Soviet Occupation Zones Sign Agreement to Exchange Products, British Occupation Zone Takes Over German Private Farmland, and Allows Allied Reporters to Enter and Investigate

[United Press, Berlin, 14th] It was learned tonight that the authorities of the American and Soviet occupation zones have reached an agreement stipulating that they will exchange products worth 100 million marks each quarter. Although this agreement is only an expedient measure to promote the economic unification of Germany, it is a further step than the previous trade agreement with the Soviet occupation zone, because the previous exchange of products was only worth 19 million marks. The US authorities especially praised the establishment of a permanent joint committee for German administration, whose task is to implement the product exchange agreement and promote trade in the US and Soviet occupation zones. It is reported that the Soviet occupation zone will exchange rubber, film, X-ray balls, electric automobiles, etc. for tires, pipes, dyes, graphite, steel, generators, etc. in the American occupation zone.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] British Deputy Military Governor of the occupation zone, Major General Robertson, announced that Britain has decided to immediately take over privately owned farmland with an area of more than 500 hectares in the zone. This is a transitional measure taken by the military government before receiving and reviewing the land reform report, which is being prepared by an advisory committee.

Robertson also said that the German British occupation zone is now open for investigation by Allied reporters, but the convenience for Russians is limited to the scope permitted by the Soviet occupation zone.

[Reuters, Herford, 14th] It is reported that the British member headquarters of the Allied Control Commission will move to Hamburg. It is expected that it will not be completed until the autumn of next year.

### Ex-King of Italy Arrives in Portugal

[French News Agency, Lisbon, 14th] After staying overnight in Barcelona, Spain, ex-King Umberto of Italy and his entourage arrived here by plane at 12:20 PM today.

### UN Atomic Energy Commission Meeting; US Representative Proposes Establishing an International Organization; Atomic Bombs Banned in Warfare; Decide on Appropriate Control System

[Associated Press, New York, 14th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a brief meeting today to decide on organizational matters. As a matter of customary procedure, the presidency of the meeting was to be rotated among member states in alphabetical order. Therefore, after US representative Baruch served as temporary chairman, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will serve as chairman for the first month. The committee then adjourned until June 19, and the representatives of various countries will immediately inform their governments of the full text of the US proposal.

The US representative read President Truman's telegram to the committee, which stated: "Please convey to the representatives of all countries that I deeply feel that the work they are engaged in is of great significance and unparalleled. The success or failure of this matter is related to the fate of the entire world. On behalf of all Americans, I wish you a smooth journey."

During today's meeting, Baruch's warning was: "World peace or world destruction rests solely with this committee."

[Further Dispatch] At the first meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission today, US representative Baruch proposed the establishment of an international atomic energy development organization. If there is an appropriate management system, he is willing to destroy all atomic bombs and stop manufacturing them. This proposal has a significant impact amidst the renewed meeting of the four foreign ministers in Paris. Baruch's proposal became a special document in the UN organization, stating that the United States will insist that no part of this organization for the development and peaceful application of atomic energy shall have veto power.

Proposal Content

The US proposal advocates banning the use of atomic bombs in warfare. The world and the entire organization should not only hold pious thoughts, but must have enforceable sanctions and "teeth" in international law as its backing. Punishing those who violate international faith should be the core of today's security system. If an appropriate system for managing atomic energy can be agreed upon and implemented, the United States is willing to make the following recommendations: (1) Stop manufacturing atomic bombs; (2) Dispose of existing atomic bombs in accordance with treaty provisions; (3) The international atomic organization should receive detailed reports on atomic energy production.

The international atomic organization should start with raw materials and take the following measures: (1) Various atomic energy activities that pose a danger to world security should be managed and controlled by the international organization; (2) For all other atomic energy activities, the international organization has the authority to manage, inspect, and issue licenses; (3) The international organization has the obligation to promote the use of atomic energy for beneficial purposes; (4) The international organization has the active responsibility to research and develop atomic energy so that it is in an advanced position in atomic knowledge, and thus can understand and detect the misuse of atomic energy. All countries should draft the most severe penalties for the following violations of the international management organization: (1) Hiding or using atomic bombs privately; (2) Hiding or using raw materials suitable for making atomic bombs privately; (3) Seizing any factories or property belonging to the international organization or licensed; (4) Arbitrarily interfering with the activities of the international organization; (5) Violating or resisting the licenses approved by the international management organization, creating or operating dangerous plans. (The following is a US News Agency dispatch.)

Basic Essentials

Baruch also proposed the following measures to represent the basic essentials of a comprehensive plan: (1) The management organization should formulate a comprehensive plan for the control of atomic energy; (2) The primary purpose of the management organization should be to obtain and maintain complete and accurate information on the world's supply of uranium and thorium, and thereby control it; (3) The management organization should implement full control over the production of fissionable materials; (4) The management organization should have the sole and absolute authority to direct research within the scope of atomic explosives; (5) All activities that are inherently dangerous to security and completely entrusted to the management organization should be distributed throughout the world, while raw materials and fissionable materials should not be concentrated in one place; (6) Part of the work of the management organization is to promote the peaceful benefits of atomic energy; (7) Problems should be continuously reviewed, and the dividing lines between dangerous and non-dangerous activities should be revised; (8) All factories that operate uranium and thorium should be regulated by the management organization; (9) All activities that are inherently dangerous should be completely entrusted to the management organization to reduce the difficulty of inspection; (10) All qualified representatives of the management organization must have guaranteed access; (11) The staff of the management organization should be employed based on merit, and as far as possible, without regard to nationality; (12) Once the charter of the management organization is adopted, it must be gradually implemented; (13) During the deliberations of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, the United States is prepared to provide the necessary information; (14) A purely national atomic energy development management organization should be subordinate to international atomic energy control. The committee should clearly define the scope of authority and responsibility for such national management organizations.

Soviet Union Has No Objections

[Associated Press, New York, 14th] Soviet representative Gromyko declared: "The situation in the Atomic Energy Commission is proceeding smoothly. Baruch's speech was well-written and well-delivered. I have no opinion to express on its content." British representative Cadogan also said: "Baruch's speech was excellent and can be said to be just right." Australian representative Evatt said: The committee will meet next Wednesday, and various countries will successively submit replies. The Atomic Energy Commission is composed of all members of the Security Council, in addition to the eleven countries of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Australia, the Netherlands, Egypt, Brazil and Mexico, plus Canada. Although Canada is not a member of the Security Council, because it actively participated in the development of the atomic bomb with the United States and Britain, it was given a permanent seat on the Atomic Energy Commission.

### Curie's Suggestion: If a Co-Management Agreement Cannot be Established, Scientists Should Stop Research

[Reuters, New York, 15th] Curie, the leader of the French delegation to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, suggested at an information conference here yesterday that if an international co-management agreement for atomic energy cannot be established, atomic energy scientists should immediately stop their research work.

### The Experiences and Colds of the Four Foreign Ministers

— Special Report by this Newspaper

The conference of the foreign ministers of the four countries, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, reopened in Paris yesterday. It is said that this conference will give a definite answer to the question of the division and integration of the world after the end of World War II. The importance of the meeting is evident.

At the beginning of the meeting, we would like to introduce to the readers the experiences and tendencies of the four foreign ministers. Perhaps it will be helpful to understand the development of the meeting.

Byrnes

US Secretary of State Byrnes has served as a member of both houses of Congress, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and the director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. However, serving in a diplomatic position is a first for him. In August 1945, he accompanied President Truman to the Potsdam Conference, and in October of the same year, he attended the first foreign ministers' conference, where he became famous as a "peacemaker."

Byrnes was born in South Carolina and came from a poor background. His subsequent experiences have made his words rounded, gentle, and very skillful. In Congress, he understood that major bills cannot pass without compromise. Therefore, his meetings are aimed at bringing factions that are in deadlock closer to each other, making concessions to each other, and finally reaching an agreement from the disputes.

Byrnes believes that his experience can be applied in international negotiations as well. He believes that once the leaders of various countries gather together, as long as they compromise with each other in a courteous manner, the crux of the problem can be resolved without a doubt.

Molotov

Molotov is a diplomat with extensive experience. He is quick-witted, composed, and full of confidence. When he is silent, he seems to be a person without opinions, but when he speaks, he fully shows that he understands the cold and realistic world very clearly. He is perhaps Stalin's oldest and closest colleague. The two of them rose from the revolutionary movement together, and both are "old Bolsheviks." Molotov's implementation of Stalin's line is also one of the most serious.

Bevin

Bevin has little diplomatic experience, which is similar to Byrnes. He is stout, weighing 240 pounds. His reaching today's position is entirely due to his involvement in the trade union movement. His many years of struggle in the trade union have made him rise to become the leader of several important unions. He is known for his tenacity and uncompromising nature. He has not received a formal education in his life, but through hard self-study, he has a deep understanding of economics and history. During the war, he was the Minister of Labor in Churchill's cabinet and the commander-in-chief of British manpower mobilization. Last year's election results made Attlee the prime minister. He was eager to find a suitable person to accompany him to Potsdam to attend the summit meeting, and as a result, he chose Bevin. In British history, no foreign secretary has ever come from a working-class background like Bevin.

In addition to the above characteristics, Bevin also has his irritable temper and spicy cursing tone. At the London foreign ministers' conference and the recent Security Council meeting, he quarreled with Molotov and Vyshinsky, both blushing with anger.

Bidault

Bidault is a new official. He only became the foreign minister of France after the liberation. He was previously a history professor and journalist at the University of Paris. He was instrumental in leading the secret resistance organization during the French occupation. At forty-six years old this year, he is younger than the above three, and his diplomatic experience is not rich. The important international conferences he has attended are the San Francisco Conference, the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the First Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. He is now the leader of the Progressive Catholic Party.

### East Indies Army Continues Resistance; British and Dutch Issue Final Warning; Artillery Battles in Bekasi Frontline

[News from this newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast: The British and Dutch authorities today issued a final warning to the Indonesian army: If the East Indies army continues military action, the British will deploy a large number of aircraft to carry out bombing.

Indonesian sources pointed out that the Allied forces are gradually expanding the defense line around Batavia, which is an attempt to launch another attack. Recently, it was rumored that Indonesians have concentrated in the Surabaya area, and the Dutch army will take over Batavia, and the Indonesian army is preparing to counterattack. These rumors are difficult to grasp, but the sound of mortars and artillery in Bekasi is indeed clearly audible here.

### US Policy Remains Unchanged; Determined to Aid Jewish Immigration; Dispatching Officials to Britain for Consultation

[US News Agency, Washington, 14th] President Truman said at a press conference today that the United States is still striving to allow 100,000 Jews to enter Palestine. The President also said that the United States does not intend to change immigration laws to allow more Jews to enter the United States from Europe. The President declined to comment on Bevin's statement, because it is said that no formal notice has been received from the British side regarding this matter. At the same time, according to the State Department, two State Department officials and two Army officials set out for London yesterday to provide consultation to Ambassador Harriman in Britain when discussing the situation in Palestine with the British.

[Reuters, London, 14th] In order to hold talks with the United States, the British government has selected officials from relevant departments to form a delegation, led by Bullock, to discuss various matters arising from the recommendations of the investigation committee. The British government will make a decision after the talks have yielded results.

[Associated Press, Manila, 14th] The Philippine government hopes that the United States Congress will immediately pass a bill so that the Philippines can acquire the Japanese hemp factories and other foreign assets in Mindanao, as the country has never declared war on Japan or other Axis powers. President Roxas announced today that an agreement has been reached with the US authorities regarding this matter.

### Falsely Conveying an Imperial Edict; Utterly Outrageous! Japanese Prosecutors Arrest People

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 15th] On the 15th of last month, starving people held an anti-imperial demonstration here. The slogans included a false imperial edict that satirized the comfort of the imperial family and the starvation of the common people.

### Municipal Measures: Opinions Expressed by the Press, Mayor Discusses Rice, Public Food Supply Unworried, Yellow Publications Determined to be Banned

Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Mayor Wu Guozhen held the second press conference in the municipal government conference room, reporting on municipal facilities and listening to opinions from the press. More than 40 people in charge of various newspapers and observers attended. Mayor Wu first reported on two points: (1) Regarding the grain issue, after the municipal government strived to dredge sources and investigated stockpiles, rice prices have gradually stabilized. If rice purchased from abroad can be continuously imported before the new grain is harvested, the food supply issue for the city can be reported to be worry-free. On this point, we hope that friendly nations will provide as much assistance as possible. (2) The municipal government has decided to ban general obscene and harmful to public morals yellow publications. Since they have not applied for registration according to law, the municipal government has the right to prohibit their publication and distribution. After the report, he raised the following issues: (1) Housing shortage, (2) Traffic order, (3) Vendor problems, (4) Economic crisis, and asked the attendees to express their opinions. A brief summary of each person's opinion is as follows:

Grain Issue

Zhu Baiying of Shangbao advocated: (1) The government should not excessively control the transportation and sales of grain to avoid affecting the import of rice and grain from outside the market. (2) Please ask the government to negotiate with friendly nations to facilitate our grain merchants to purchase food from grain producing families.

Housing Shortage

Wang Yun-sheng of Dagongbao, Zhou Chong of Zhonghua Shibao, Zhu Peiji of Qiaoshengbao, Zhu Baiying of Shangbao, Li Zikuan of Dagongbao, Cheng Cangbo of Xinwenbao, and Zhang Zhihan of Huamei Wanbao spoke one after another. The opinions of each person can be summarized as follows: (1) The allocation of received houses should strive to be reasonable, fair, and rapid. (2) Revise the building regulations to allow and encourage landowners and capable citizens to build houses. (3) Protect the property rights of owners and strictly prohibit second landlords, third tenants, and high-priced transfers. (4) Investigate the names of the agencies publishing housing advertisements in newspapers. (5) Investigate housing advertisements in newspapers, such as those offering top prices, and ban the bad habit of asking for gold bars for the top price. Cheng Cangbo specifically pointed out that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has failed to allocate and handle the received houses fairly and reasonably for several months, and has not made a public report. He requested that the mayor invite Director Liu of the bureau to attend the next reception for the press to report on the process of handling the received houses. The audience applauded unanimously in agreement.

Yellow Publications

Wang Yun-sheng and Zhu Baiying expressed their opinions, which can be summarized as: (1) Pay attention to the yellow text in large newspapers. (2) If newspapers and publications contain records that harm a person's reputation, the victims should be encouraged to file a lawsuit according to law. (3) The supplements of each newspaper may as well slightly lower their level to meet the needs of general readers, but to the extent that they do not become "yellow."

Traffic Order

Wang Yun-sheng, Zhou Han, etc., respectively put forward the following opinions: (1) Restrict the driving of large trucks on main roads during the day. (2) Methods such as clearing trams and bus stations. (3) Plan to open underground traffic. (4) Designate parking locations for empty cars and prohibit parking anywhere on the roadside.

Economic Crisis

Wang Yun-sheng advocated: (1) Strive for fairness in the burden of donations and taxes. The rich should pay more. (2) Vigorously simplify tax collection procedures. (4) Reduce administrative expenses. Zhu Baiying believes that the biggest economic crisis at present is the excess of import over export in foreign trade. The main reason is that the government and the general public pay too much attention to the level of the exchange rate, while neglecting the application of the entire exchange policy. In fact, a too low exchange rate is indeed beneficial to imports, but not to exports, and it hinders the survival and development of the domestic industry. A too high exchange rate is not necessarily beneficial to the industry either, because a too high exchange rate will inevitably stimulate the soaring of prices and wages, and increase the prices of foreign raw materials and production tools that must be imported. Because the production costs of various factories increase greatly, the products still cannot compete with cheap foreign goods. If the government can flexibly use the exchange rate policy to facilitate the import of necessities and prohibit the import of non-essentials, then a slightly lower exchange rate will not cause the disadvantages of foreign goods dumping. He hopes that Mayor Wu will suggest that the central government consider adopting it.

### Mayor Reports Again: Advocates Credited Brown Rice

After listening to everyone's opinions, Mayor Wu briefly reported on the above issues again: Regarding the grain issue, he intends to advocate the use of brown rice on credit by citizens, saying that experts have researched that brown rice contains far more vitamin B than polished rice. If the people of the whole country can all eat brown rice, not only can the amount of grain be increased by 10%, but it will also be beneficial to the health of the people. He has now ordered the Bean and Rice Industry Association and various rice mills in the city to mill rice according to the specified standards, and has telegraphed the central government to order the whole country to travel uniformly. Regarding the distribution of houses, it is decided to handle it according to the two principles of complete openness and thorough investigation. A part of the German community in the city will return to their country at the end of this month, and the houses they leave behind will also be allocated reasonably. Mayor Wu also reported that the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan was originally concurrently served as the Deputy Director of the committee by Huang Boqiao, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Office. Later, after the Executive Yuan's office was abolished, Mr. Huang resigned from the post of Deputy Director of the Housing Allocation Committee. After I took office, because Mr. Huang was very familiar with the situation in Shanghai, I still asked him to continue to serve as the Deputy Director of the Housing Allocation Committee, and he agreed. After the report, the symposium adjourned in a very harmonious atmosphere.

During the meeting, Hu Boxiang proposed to use the national product campaign to awaken the people to use national products as an honor, and not to specialize in selling foreign goods, which consumes huge amounts of foreign exchange, affects China's entire economy, and hinders the development of national industry. Later, Tian Heqing presided over the discussion of proposals, Hong Nianzu presided over the revision of the association's articles of association, and invited Luo Qinghua, Xu Zhaohou, Sun Daosheng, etc. to give speeches. Finally, China Ya Pu'er Electrical Appliance Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, etc. were elected as supervisors. The new board of directors and supervisors will soon be in office, and will unite with other groups to strengthen the promotion of the "Love Our National Products" campaign, which will make a significant contribution to the national product community.

### Cuban Overseas Chinese Suffers Oppression, Overseas Chinese Leader Zhu Jiazhao Returns Home to Consult and Negotiate, Hoping to Remedy the Situation When Concluding Commercial Treaties

[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Zhu Jiazhao, a leader of the Cuban overseas Chinese community, recently came to Shanghai. A reporter from this newspaper made a special visit yesterday. Mr. Zhu stated that Cuba originally had 80,000 overseas Chinese, but now because the Cuban government absolutely prohibits Chinese from entering the country, the number has been reduced to more than 20,000. When Cuba became independent, the overseas Chinese had tried their best to assist and resist the Spanish government, the ruler of Cuba at the time. Therefore, the Cuban people and the overseas Chinese have always had close feelings. Unexpectedly, recently, the overseas Chinese have been subjected to oppression. Among the workers in factories, if there are 10 workers, the number of Chinese workers is not allowed to exceed 5. If a Chinese worker dies or cannot continue to work for other reasons, they must not be replaced by another Chinese. At present, the Cuban overseas Chinese are all over the age of 45. If the government does not provide relief, the Cuban overseas Chinese will disappear in 20 years! Mr. Zhu first consulted with Mr. Li Dijun, our country's minister to Cuba, about this matter before returning to China. After returning to China, he went to Beijing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and other places, requesting that the situation be remedied when concluding commercial treaties between China and Cuba. Mr. Zhu has lived in Cuba for more than 30 years and has served as the chairman of the Cuban China Anti-Japanese Support Association. He is particularly enthusiastic about organizing branches in various places. He first donated money to help General Ma Gushan and the 19th Route Army, and made great efforts to resist the war. Mr. Zhu said that Cuba still has a monument to commemorate the contributions of the overseas Chinese in assisting the founding of the country.

### Jiangnan Shipyard: No Ships to Build, Shipyard Desolate, Steel Rusty, Only Dragon Bones Listen to the River

"Our current work, in terms of our equipment and capabilities, can be said to be using a bull knife to kill a chicken!"

Ou De, Director of the Personnel Office of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy, said with a wry smile to the reporter.

Today, when the industrial community is generally encountering a bankruptcy crisis, the shipbuilding industry is also struggling to maintain itself in a near-suffocating and depressed situation. The Jiangnan Shipyard is the only shipbuilding industry in the country. Its predecessor was the Nantie Factory. It was only taken over from the enemy and puppets in August and September last year. The machinery and equipment were not damaged. Except for a small part that needs to be repaired, the rest is old, but it is still generally usable. Director Ma Deji is a veteran in the shipbuilding engineering industry. As early as 1944, Mr. Ma organized a "Shipbuilding Service Group" and led more than 20 young technicians across the ocean to serve in major shipyards in the United States. On the one hand, they represented the government to participate in the work of the United Nations, and on the other hand, they allowed his cadres to learn some practical shipbuilding experience. This service group gave the American people a very good impression. Especially after Mr. Ma and Victory, Jiangnan Shipyard was responsible for it, and actively contacted the American side for new machines and materials, preparing to greatly develop China's shipbuilding industry.

"But," Mr. Ou said with emotion, "materials, equipment, and talents are all available. The only trouble is that no customers come to the door. Shipbuilding is not like other industries, which can produce goods first and then wait for people to buy them. We have sufficient power to build large ships of 10,000 tons, 20,000 tons, or even 30,000 tons, but who is willing to inquire? Not to mention merchants, even the government only knows how to buy ready-made ships from foreign countries!" Why is that? Because it is much cheaper to buy from foreign countries than to build in China. Foreign ships do not need to pay taxes when imported, but the machines and materials used to build them are not given tax-free preferential treatment by the government. Coupled with the expensive freight and the wages and management costs affected by commercial prices, it is of course more cost-effective to buy ships directly from foreign countries.

Mr. Ou continued to tell the reporter that the current work of the shipyard is limited to repairs. Although the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation (行總) recently ordered some small wooden boats for transporting goods from the shipyard, it is not worth the engineering value at all. There are now more than 2,000 workers and more than 200 staff members, most of whom are technicians.

"We must maintain this group of technicians. Although the current treatment is very poor, I believe they will be used one day," Mr. Ou said firmly.

The reporter asked to see their shipyard and factory. He asked Engineer Yun Weixian, who had also participated in the "Shipbuilding Service Group" and returned from the United States not long ago, to lead the way.

Building Small Wooden Boats with a Bull Knife, all three shipyards were resting ships under repair. In the first shipyard, a ship of about several thousand tons was nearing completion, with newly painted paint shining brightly. In the second shipyard was a very small inland river ship. The third shipyard was the largest. A giant ship painted with patches of yellow anti-rust paint was parked there. A dozen workers were working separately. The ship was named "Onward" and was about 10,000 tons. It was a ship on the President Line. Mr. Yun said: It is very puzzling that the ships of our own government agencies sometimes do not come here for repairs when they are broken.

Past the shipyard was the construction yard. The tall steel frames seemed a little rusty. A red keel quietly lay there. The surrounding area was piled with materials for building small wooden boats for the General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation. Several small boats had already been painted, and another batch of US landing craft were being converted into cargo ships. Seeing this situation, the metaphor of "using a bull knife to kill a chicken" floated into the reporter's mind again. Bull knife, bull knife, when will you find your bull? (Written by Wen Zhong)

### Explanation of the Crime of Treason for Employees of Organizations Under Enemy and Puppet Control: Must Depend on Whether There are Criminal Facts

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously requested an explanation from the Guo medicine industry and other 50 industry associations regarding "whether serving as directors or supervisors of industry associations is treason." The request was submitted to the Executive and Legislative Yuans for explanation through a telegram, but there was no reply. Recently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a document again, and sent Supervisor Luo Qinghua to Beijing to urge for instructions. It is heard that Mr. Luo returned to Shanghai yesterday. The reporter, knowing that this case has attracted the close attention of all parties, made a special visit to Mr. Luo to inquire about the results. Mr. Luo said that the "Regulations on the Handling of Treason Cases" already clearly stipulate how to deal with people who held positions in people's organizations within the scope of enemy and puppet control. Industry associations and chambers of commerce are all industrial organizations. If they held positions within the scope of enemy and puppet control and had the facts of infringing on others by virtue of their power, they can be regarded as traitors if they are reported or accused, and comply with the provisions of rigorous investigation and prosecution. If they only held positions and there are no criminal facts described in the latter part of Section 10, they are not traitors and are not subject to the provisions of Article 15 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. It is said that the explanation of the Judicial Yuan is based on the legal meaning of this article. Furthermore, those who hold positions such as Baojia chiefs and Lianbao chiefs within the scope of enemy and puppet control should be "autonomous" personnel referred to in Section 10, not officials recommended by the enemy and puppet as in Section 1. If there are no criminal facts and they are reported or accused, they will also not be punished according to Article 15 of the Punishment Regulations. The "Regulations on the Handling of Treason Cases" is a procedural law for punishing traitors and should be based on this. The meanings of "affiliated" and "scope of jurisdiction" are different and cannot be discussed together. The phrase "under the rule of the puppet government" in the Executive Yuan's order has led to the mixing of the distinctly different "affiliated" and "scope of jurisdiction," which requires much explanation. During my trip to Beijing, I explained the previous situation to the senior officials of the Central Standing Committee, the Organization Department, the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Social Affairs, who have all understood. An instruction will be sent to the association soon.

### General Meeting and Dinner Party Held by Newspaper Colleagues Association

[Reported by this newspaper] The Newspaper Colleagues Association held a general meeting and dinner party at the Fuzhou Road Fouhualou last night. More than 200 colleagues from the newspaper attended. Huang Jiping, Dong Jiancheng, Zhao Junhao, He Xiya, Zhao Zongyu, etc. were elected as the presidium. After reporting on the association's affairs, the handover ceremony for new and old staff members was held. Immediately after, a dinner party was held. During the dinner, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of the newspaper, gave a speech, saying that the newspaper is the oldest newspaper in China, which is well known. He wished to encourage his colleagues with the words "Although Zhou is an old country, its destiny is always new," hoping that they would redouble their efforts to make the oldest newspaper the newest and most progressive newspaper. Then, in the midst of exchanging toasts and flying lights, entertainment was held. Mr. Wang Ruoqi and Zhou Dongming, two famous Qin performers in Shanghai, played the strings for Zhai Pengnian, Shen Zhenchao, and Tong Xutian, reporters of the newspaper, and three famous ticket holders, Miss Zhu Min, Wu Husheng, and Mao Jinfang, all showed off their singing voices and had a great time.

### Recent Situation in Shanghai Women's Circles: The Women's Movement Association Plans to Open Relief Homes and Nurseries; the Women's Youth Association Provides Poor and Sick Loan of 50,000 Yuan Per Person

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to understand the general situation of the women's circles in this city, the reporter made a special visit to the Women's Movement Guidance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Women's Youth Association yesterday. Ms. Qian Jianqiu, the director of the Women's Movement Guidance Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said that it is extremely difficult to count the total number of working women in Shanghai. Among them, the largest number is of working women, followed by civil servants and teachers. There are currently 18 women's groups under the committee's jurisdiction, responsible for guiding the members. Furthermore, the association has always taken the promotion of women's rights and the relief of women's suffering as its purpose. In view of the large number of illiterates, it has already opened two labor literacy schools, one on Xiaosha Road and one in Pudong. The association is now working closely with the Social Affairs Bureau to open "Women's Relief Homes" and "Nurseries," with the aim of providing relief to poor women and infants. It is hoped that they will be established soon, and they are now actively working on it. In addition, the committee has also planned to set up a large "Household Goods Supply Cooperative," which will directly distribute daily service equipment to various manufacturers and sell it to relevant groups to avoid merchants from profiting from it. It will definitely benefit housewives a lot. However, the most difficult thing at present is housing, personnel, and funding. It is hoped that preparations can be made to provide assistance.

Furthermore, Ms. Zhong Guoying, a worker in the Department of Working Women of the Women's Youth Association, said that the association's members include women from all walks of life. Its main task is to help prepare for women to establish organized groups in order to overcome difficulties with collective strength. The practical work that the association is currently actively carrying out is: (1) Job Placement: Anyone who is physically and mentally sound and has a reasonable attitude can register. This kind of work has never been interrupted for more than ten years. Many people have been continuously introduced to work in various agencies, most of them as tutors, nannies, and typists. (2) Poor and Sick Loans: Women who have productive capacity and are indeed poor and sick can apply to the association for a loan, with a limit of 50,000 yuan each time, to be repaid in installments after five months. The fund comes from the paper flowers that were sold on "March 8" Women's Day. It is said that there is still a balance. (3) Low-Priced Cafeteria: It will open in the association's dormitory on Yuemingyuan Road. Each customer will be given ten mouthfuls of bread, a cup of milk powder, and a little butter or jam for only 100 yuan. This is allocated by the "General Administration of Relief and Rehabilitation" for 100 customers per day, limited to the association's members. Women in difficult circumstances can first apply to become members. The association is scheduled to move to 495 Gordon Road at the end of this month. (Xu Cai)

### Yuan Jufan and Wang Yongkang Each Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment, Li Hanqing Suffers Nervous Breakdown, Wailing and Answering Irrelevantly

[Our Newspaper] The High Court of [the] Jiangsu [Province] handed down verdicts yesterday on four cases of traitors: (1) Yuan Jufan, the former head of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau; (2) Wang Yongkang, a member of the puppet Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. The two criminals were found guilty of communicating with enemy countries and plotting to resist our own country. They were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprived of their civil rights for five years, and all of their property, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, was confiscated. (3) Zhu Ruilin, the owner of a nail factory, was found guilty of colluding with enemy countries and supplying the enemy army with military supplies.

(4) Lu Laisheng was found guilty of colluding with enemy countries and plotting to resist our own country. He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for three years, and all of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated.

Li Zulai and Nine Others on Trial

The case of Li Zulai was also heard yesterday by the Special Criminal Court of the High Court. Li was wearing a lemon-colored silk long gown and new cloth shoes with white soles and black faces. According to his testimony, he was not a member of the Kuomintang and was the deputy manager of the An Yu Qian Zhuang before the war. His entry into the Bank of China was not due to influence, as his uncle and two elder brothers were originally managers of the Bank of China and had a historical relationship with the bank. He also stated that he never used the rescue of those arrested by puppet secret agents as a means to extort money, and that he had no special relationship with She Aizhen, the wife of Hu Shibaobiao. He requested that She Aizhen be summoned next time for a direct confrontation in court if they did not believe him. He further claimed, "I have never severed ties with the central government over the years. After the victory, I was introduced by Mr. Du Yuesheng to surrender to the Military Intelligence Bureau. I initially thought I could be released, but I never knew it would take nine months and I still haven't been cleared of wrongdoing." Subsequently, the defense attorney requested the court to summon witnesses Du Yuesheng and Wan Molin, and presented a letter of thanks from the famous writer Li Jianwu, who had been helped by the defendant to be rescued, as proof. After Clerk Li Jinzhang took detailed notes, Judge Yang Ding adjourned the hearing for further questioning.

Li Hanqing, a 56-year-old from Suzhou, was introduced to Japanese Major Nanben by Shao Shijun in 1937. Relying on enemy power, he forcibly seized our central tax revenue agency in the concession. Shao was then rewarded with the position of Chief of the Puppet Jiangsu Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau's Inspection Office. In the spring of 1941, he was transferred to the position of Director of the Guangdong Sericulture Office under the Puppet Ministry of Finance, and later transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Shanghai Sericulture Tax Bureau. When he was brought to trial yesterday, Li suffered from rheumatism and a nervous breakdown, rendering him unable to walk or speak. He was supported by two prisoners into the courtroom. Upon seeing his family in court, he burst into tears, and his wife cried even more bitterly. Judge Qiu then allowed him to sit down for questioning, but his wife continued to cry incessantly. The judge, finding that Li's responses were jumbled and incoherent, briefly questioned him before adjourning the hearing for further questioning. The defendant requested bail, and the court stated that a separate application must be submitted. The hearing was then adjourned.

Furthermore, the cases of suspected traitors such as Fan Yongzeng, of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau; Ruan Xingzhou, Deputy Director of the Nanjing Radio Station of the puppet Political Security Bureau; Fu Hongyuan, staff member of the puppet Chamber of Commerce; Wang Xingjian, technician of the 76th Radio Station; and Guo Zhenxiang and Wu Baofu, detectives of the Dongchang Branch of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau; and Ha Junqiu, an intelligence officer of the puppet Zhenjiang Special Service Station, were also brought for questioning and adjourned for further hearings.

Two Cases Concluded

[Our Newspaper] Wu Yuren and Cai Gengshun, who successively served as Section Chief and Deputy Director of the Special Consumption Tax Section of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Director of the County Administration Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, Lieutenant Colonel Instructor of the Pathogen of the Central Military Academy of the puppet Army, Director of the Zhejiang Eastern Supervisory Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Finance, and Chief Secretary and Magistrate of Hu County of the Sixth Administrative Inspectorate Office of the puppet Anhui Province, were tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants stated that they were 37 years old and were a middle school teacher before the war. They had eight family members to support and were forced by life, so in November 1939, through a friend's introduction, they met Luo Junqiang and took up a puppet position. They deeply regretted it now. However, during his tenure in 1942, he rescued Ju Jing, a special commissioner of the China Seamen's Special Party Department who was detained by the enemy's Gendarmerie in Petain Road. Moreover, after the victory, on September 28th of last year, he surrendered to the Military Intelligence Bureau on Avenue Dubail. He hoped to be leniently dealt with and given a chance to start anew, for which he would be eternally grateful. The defendant also hired a lawyer for defense, and Ju Jing also appeared in court to testify. The court concluded the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:30 PM on the 22nd.

On the same day, the case of Xue Qishou, an executive officer of the Suzhou Station of the puppet Secret Service Headquarters, was also concluded, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of the 22nd.

### Actively Improving Electricity Supply; Retail Water Stations Added in West Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] In the West Shanghai area and Zhabei, some of the water pipes have been damaged due to years of disrepair, resulting in significant water leakage. At the same time, due to insufficient pressure, residents in that area often have no water to use. According to Deputy Director Zhang of the Bureau of Public Utilities, the water pipes in West Shanghai were not expanded by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company due to the extraterritorial railway. Currently, repairs are difficult due to a lack of materials and funds. The remedial measure is to open fire hydrants as much as possible and provide free water supply at specified times every day. At the same time, upon application by residents, the Bureau of Public Utilities will send personnel to install faucets near accessible water pipes to set up water stations. As for the city's electricity problem, it has been gradually improved. The Zhabei Electric Power Company has a generator with a capacity of 20,000 kilowatts, which will be repaired in a month. At the same time, the Yong'an Textile Factory's self-provided generator, which can generate over 10,000 kilowatts, will also be restored, which will not only be able to supply its own needs, but also supply other electric power companies. In addition, a 35,000-kilowatt floating generator ordered by the Jiangnan Electric Power Plant will also arrive this autumn. The machines ordered by the Shanghai Electric Power Company in the United States will arrive in Shanghai one after another by the end of the year. Therefore, the city's electricity supply will be sufficient by next spring.

Many Subjects Do Not Necessarily Kill Children; Examination is What Harms Children's Physical and Mental Health

A lively and intelligent child unfortunately died of tuberculosis after three years of schooling. A certain parent blamed the heavy elementary school curriculum and the excessive number of subjects. Judging from the facts, it seems to be true. In fact, even if we assume that each subject is a poison that harms children, dividing it into several small packages and eating them separately (i.e., separating each subject) is better than combining them into a few large packages and swallowing them whole (i.e., merging related subjects). So, I think that when revising the elementary school curriculum, there is no need to calculate the number of subjects based on the combination or separation of subjects. If the subjects are listed more specifically on the timetable, the preparation before class can be clearer and easier for children and teachers. Therefore, I advocate that elementary school subjects may as well be separated! Many subjects do not necessarily kill children. What can harm children's physical and mental health is the examination! Because in elementary schools, there are monthly tests, semester exams, temporary tests, and graduation exams. Most teachers do not use these to examine whether the teaching materials and methods are suitable for general children, but instead use them as a means to force children to study hard, deliberately making children's spirits and emotions very tense! Children with a competitive spirit become uneasy while eating and cannot sleep well, always in the terror of passing or failing, feeling dizzy and mentally and physically exhausted. The experts who revise the elementary school curriculum standards, I wonder if they might agree to reduce the suggestion of monthly tests, so that the weak children's physical and mental health will not be excessively stimulated and tense, and they can develop and grow naturally! (Qian Dasan, 35, 6, 13, in Zhenjiang).

### The Bureau of Social Affairs Strictly Limits Rice Shops' Sales Profits to No More Than 6% of the Selling Price; Rice Shops Must Register All Rice Stock

Various rice shops in this city purchase grain and sell it to citizens, but there has never been a standard for the profits they take, resulting in inconsistent retail rice prices. Moreover, most do not issue invoices when selling, which easily leads to abuses. Now, the Bureau of Social Affairs of this city has specially ordered the Rice Shop Merchants' Association to correct this. The instructions are recorded as follows: "Upon investigation, the price difference between the purchase price of rice and the retail price at rice shops in this city is vast. If this is not corrected, it will seriously affect the people's food supply, which is truly inappropriate. After careful consideration, it has been decided that, from the date of this order, the retail price of each rice shop must not exceed 6% of the total purchase price. Invoices must be issued upon sale, and the names and addresses of the buyers must be separately registered for verification. The Association is hereby ordered to quickly forward this order to all its affiliated rice shops for compliance."

Furthermore, it has been learned that recently some rice shops have been selling all their rice stock mixed with impurities in the hope of obtaining even greater profits. They are also claiming that their stock is low and not easily purchased on the market, so they are applying to be allocated rice at market prices. However, after investigation by the Association, these rice shops still have sufficient stock to meet the needs of their retail outlets. This is a case of illegal hoarding and refusal to sell. To prevent hoarding and promote the widespread circulation of rice, the Rice Shop Merchants' Association is registering rice stocks. If a rice shop's stock is indeed scarce and cannot be purchased on the market, the Association will request the rice market to allocate rice at market prices. As for the rice shops that have been approved to request rice allocation, in addition to the 33 approved on the 13th, another 145 were added on the 14th, and it is said that there were more than a hundred more yesterday.

Yesterday, the rice market opened unchanged. Flour was sluggish, factory prices were uncertain, bran sellers were eager to sell, new bran was expected soon, and confidence was low, falling by one or two hundred yuan. Soybean cake fell by two or three hundred yuan, soybeans fell by five or six hundred to one thousand yuan, wheat was stable, broad beans were arriving in large quantities from various sources, the market was oversupplied, and the situation was weak. Oil prices were also stable. The number of customers and goods registered at the rice market yesterday increased slightly, totaling 3,221 *shi*, including 534 *shi* of white *japonica* rice, 433 *shi* of *indica* rice, 38 *shi* of early rice, 570 *shi* of *yangyou* rice, 379 *shi* of *duyou* rice, 617 *shi* of *wuyou* rice, 7 *shi* of white *yuan* rice, and 703 *shi* of milled rice.

### Gold Prices Dip Slightly

Refined gold was slightly flatter yesterday. Reports indicated that there was still hope for the current situation, and many people were selling off their holdings. After opening, the price rose briefly to 1.93 million yuan, but was soon suppressed. US dollars eased, falling to 1.89 million yuan during the session, before receiving some support. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 182 bars at a price of 1.9 million yuan. After this, the situation stabilized, hovering around 1.91 million yuan. In the afternoon, the US dollar fell sharply, and gold prices were also dragged down slightly. However, due to the fact that it was Saturday, it was not easy to sell. Compared to the asking price, it fell by 45,000 yuan. Gold ornaments were 1 million yuan, silver bullion was 2,200 yuan, and silver dollars were selling for 1,380 yuan. The black market exchange rate was stable, and interest rates did not change.

### Large Investors Exit, Government Bonds Decline

Yesterday, two large investors exited the government bond market at the 7th floor. After opening, the price fell from 4,900 yuan to 4,500 yuan, before being slightly absorbed by a certain Northern gang on the 5th floor, ending at 4,600 yuan. As a result, it closed 450 yuan lower than the previous day. Category D bonds only fell by 100 yuan due to bargain hunting. Categories A and B also fell by 350 yuan, and Category E fell by 400 yuan.

### Rayon Continues to Rise, Silk Goods See Another Opportunity

Rayon continued to rise sharply yesterday. No. 120 Tianqiao had bright stock, opening at 1.58 million yuan, with the highest bid at 630,000 yuan, before returning to 578,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, it traded at 560,000 yuan, resulting in a rise of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. No. 120 Meinu traded at 1.5 million yuan in the morning and 430,000 yuan in the afternoon. Xuhui traded at 1.451 million yuan in the morning and 400,000 yuan in the afternoon. Semi-dull goods were in high demand, and the price was particularly good, rising by 780,000 yuan. No. 75 Jin Nan Banyan was priced similarly to the previous day. Silk goods, which had been weak for two days, saw another opportunity yesterday. Mei Ya quilt covers traded at 1.58 million yuan per 100 pieces. Da Cheng checkered silk traded at 5,700 yuan per yard for immediate delivery and 7,730 yuan for future delivery, up 450 yuan from the previous day. The raw silk market was stable. User silk, superior grade 20/22, traded at 2.15 million to 2.22 million yuan. Ten bales of Jardine Matheson goods traded yesterday, priced at 1.8 million yuan. There were no transactions in user Jardine Matheson goods, and asking prices remained unchanged.

### Silk Fabrics and Decorative Items Are in High Demand in the United States

[Report from this newspaper] After the war, housing allocation in the United States is also very uneven. Therefore, people's residential areas are never excessively luxurious, but strive to meet practical needs. The arrangement of interior furniture also adopts small and exquisite styles. Therefore, decorative items on the surface are also small-sized silk fabrics as their demand target. Before the war, our country's silk fabrics sold well in the US market and enjoyed a long-standing reputation. Therefore, the demand for our Chinese goods is very eager.

### Ramie Cloth Is in Season, Supply Is Scarce and Prices Are Very High

Ramie cloth from Jiangxi, especially from counties such as Wanzai, Yihuang, and Shanggao, has a more abundant output and is of excellent quality. In the Shanghai market, ramie cloth has a smooth and broad sales channel for clothing and mosquito nets. However, due to poor transportation, there are no large shipments to Shanghai. Currently, it relies only on peddlers for transportation and sales, resulting in a small quantity and high prices due to express shipping and high transportation costs. A few days ago, more than a hundred pieces of Shanggao ramie cloth arrived in Shanghai and were snapped up in an instant. There is currently no stock available. According to industry insiders, if large quantities can be shipped to Shanghai, transportation costs will be lower and prices can be slightly stabilized.

### Foreign Currencies Cannot Be Converted, US Dollar Plummets

The Central Bank issued a special notice yesterday to all designated foreign exchange banks stating that, from today, regarding all prohibited import goods and goods listed in Central Bank Notice No. 42, as well as other unapproved applications, the designated banks shall not accept foreign currency banknotes or sell foreign exchange.

Regulations have also been stipulated regarding foreign currency trading by the 250 Class A foreign exchange firms in this city. They must report to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank every week. If any activity exceeding the scope is discovered, their operating permit will be revoked. As for foreign currency exports, the limit remains at 200 yuan per person. Exceeding this limit requires special permission from the Ministry of Finance; otherwise, the local customs authorities will handle the matter according to law upon discovery.

The US dollar opened at around 2,730 yuan and was immediately surrounded by selling pressure. Soon after, it fell to 2,670 yuan before receiving support. However, the process was mediocre and trading was not very active. It remained at around 2,700 yuan until noon, and the situation still felt unsustainable. In the afternoon, due to the fact that it was Saturday, sellers, due to rumors that foreign firms were prohibiting the acceptance of US dollars, were cutting prices to sell. There was a lack of support. Although trading was light, asking prices fell sharply. Bids fell to 2,400 yuan. Hong Kong dollars also fell by 5 yuan, Indian rupees by 560 yuan, and Hong Kong exchange by 455 yuan, with few transactions.

### Asphalt Suddenly Soars

Since the previous week, the asphalt market has suddenly become active, and the market has turned sharply upward. Hangzhou is facing a shortage of supply due to the scarcity of sources from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in no goods available. Internal asphalt has risen from 50,000 yuan to slightly over 60,000 yuan, and Shuanglian mixed oil has also increased to 55,000 yuan. In just one week, all oils have risen by more than 10,000 yuan, breaking the dull situation of the past six months. During this reporter's trip to the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area, observations revealed that inventories are extremely low. The stock of high-quality goods such as Heben asphalt is estimated to be less than 3,000 pieces. To meet the autumn demand, there is a risk of interruption. It is also said that the stocks in Jinlan and other places are also very low. Therefore, it is difficult to expect Zhejiang oil to flood in. However, Hubei asphalt is blocked in the production area, and the quantity is actually quite large. If transportation can be smoothed, large quantities will certainly be shipped. Shanghai can choose between the north and the south, taking the cheaper option. Otherwise, there will be no supply. Recently, various firms have already procured about 1,000 pieces from Hankou. It is said that the combined arrival price of Macheng oil in Shanghai is no more than 50,000 yuan, arriving soon. The sharp rise in Zhejiang oil will certainly be hit. The selling prices of various firms have been increased along with the market. It is estimated that Heben oil is 80,000 yuan, internal asphalt is 72,000 yuan, Du asphalt is 68,000 yuan, Deqian is 64,000 yuan, Lan oil is 60,000 yuan, and Macheng oil is 55,000 yuan.

### 5,000 Tons of Cork Shipped from Norway to Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] A large shipment of cork has arrived in Shanghai. During the war, cork imports to Shanghai disappeared, and there was a great shortage of bottle stoppers. It is now learned that the Norwegian vessel "Jing Hai Ke Qi Hao," managed by Tianxiang Foreign Firm, has shipped 5,000 tons of cork from Oslo, Norway. The ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday evening and is docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. It is also reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Chen" ship sailed to Taiwan with a small amount of cargo, only about 1,200 tons, of which rapeseed cake accounted for the majority with more than 3,430 pieces.

### Yarn and Cotton Cloth Are Both Sluggish

Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and sales were sluggish because various trading groups had extremely light demand. Due to the weekend, there were few transactions in the market. 20-count yarn fell by 120,000 yuan, and small-count yarn was particularly weak because the market in the interior was also very depressed.

Yesterday, New York American cotton telegraph reported a drop of 17 to 24 points. The near-term was US$29.06, the forward was US$29.24, and the Memphis spot price was US$29.87. Spot cotton trading in this port was stagnant because US cotton had fallen back, and it was also Saturday. Factories were mostly taking a wait-and-see approach and there were no negotiations. Only flower shops made some small purchases. Market prices were stable.

Grey cloth continued to show weakness because demand from all sides was weak, and it was also the time for the China Textile Construction Company to open sales. Everyone was watching and not moving forward. Prices of cloth from various shops fell by 250 to 500 yuan. However, blue cloth is gradually entering its peak season, and bleached cloth is scarce and relatively stable. When the China Textile Construction Company opened sales, the goods listed were not very enthusiastic. There was no drill. The price of grey cloth fell by 500 yuan compared to the previous period. Drill rose by 500 yuan in the afternoon.

### Under the Pull of Major Investors, Yong'an Yarn Makes Progress; Greater China Increases Capital and Issues Dividends

After a slight rest the day before yesterday, major investors in the Chinese stock market rose again yesterday, still making progress in Yong'an Yarn. The rest of the stocks were lagging behind. Yong'an Yarn rose from 6,400 yuan to 6,720 yuan, and then slightly retreated. Mei Ya retreated from 4,700 yuan to a low price at closing. The three small stocks also went from high to low. The rise and fall of unpopular medium-sized stocks were mixed. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong'an Yarn rose by more than 200 yuan. Mei Ya, Jingfu, and Xinguang all fell slightly. The same was true for unpopular small stocks. The rise and fall of medium-sized stocks were mixed. Veteran stocks were slightly weak. Yong'an Company rose again. Foreign stocks were calm as usual, resulting in less speculative activity. The process was extremely mediocre. The supply was more abundant, and the situation was slightly depressed. At noon closing, compared to the day before, Yi Yarn, Yi Beer, Gangye, British Linen, and Guanghuitdefeng all continued to fall slightly. Paper Industry Asia was still stable due to its low price.

Greater China Match held its shareholders' meeting yesterday and resolved to change the registered capital from 100 million fake yuan to 100 million legal tender and to issue a dividend of 8% and a bonus of 1.9%.

### Qimen Tea Production Decreases

The production of new Qimen black tea in Anhui this year is not optimistic. The output has been greatly reduced, mainly only around 30,000 *dan*, which is truly vastly different from previous years. As for the tea market in this city, trading has also decreased because the sellers are stubbornly raising prices. The supply has suddenly become scarce. Although shops and guest firms on this street and other places have demand, it is not easy to purchase smoothly, so prices remain stable.

### Hungarian Hyperinflation: Astronomical Numbers Reappear

[United Press Budapest, 14th] The inflation in Hungary is still endless. A streetcar ticket costs 1,600,000,000,000 pengő. A newspaper costs 2,000,000,000,000 pengő. The new high value of the Hungarian pengő against the US dollar is a ratio of 1,000,000,000,000,000 pengő to one US dollar (this number is accurate).

### The Soviet Union Will Sell Silver in London

[Reuters London, 15th] It is reported that the Soviet Union may sell silver in the London free market, seemingly with the intention of selling low-priced silver and obtaining high-priced British pounds. Currently, the free selling price of silver in London is between 280 pence per ounce. The Soviet Union may sell it at a slightly higher price. This price has exceeded the US limit price of 71.11 cents (equivalent to 42.4 pence). Based on this, the current London silver price is actually equal to US$1.00, which has exceeded the domestic silver price of 90.03 cents per ounce for the next two years approved by the US Senate Appropriations Committee. The US Senate Committee has approved that the US domestic silver price can be increased to 129 cents after two years. This number is larger than the current price in London and is comparable to the high price in the Far East.

### Brazilian Cotton Exports: Government Issues New Regulations

[Reuters Rio de Janeiro, 15th] The Brazilian Ministry of Finance has announced that, henceforth, for Brazilian cotton exports, exporters must prove that 30% of the exported cotton was purchased from government reserves in order to be approved. This is a newly announced regulation aimed at reducing government reserves and removing the government's "competition" in the cotton export market.

### US Car Prices Increase; Further Increases May Be Necessary in the Future

[Associated Press Washington, 14th] By order of the government, the prices of many US cars have been increased again by 4% to 8% based on the previous price increase. According to government officials, the Price Administration may order another price increase. According to the recent price increase, the export prices of 16 models of cars from Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Hudson, Nash, Packard, and Studebaker have increased by US$33 to US$167 each, with an average increase of US$87.50. The reason for the price increase is said to be to compensate for the losses incurred by various companies due to increased wages and the purchase of high-priced steel and other manufactured parts. However, the price increase order does not apply to cars manufactured in Europe after the war, but all cars manufactured after May 22 can still be priced higher, and car buyers must pay the full amount according to the newly set prices.

### Summary of Market Information

Timber: The market is showing a fluctuating situation, with slight rises and falls, and trading is weak. It is reported that more foreign pine continues to arrive, so the price is soft and weak.

Bricks and Ashes: Sales in the market have been average for days because factory repairs and separate purchases of shops are still considered prosperous, so market prices will not fall miserably for the time being.

Pepper: The trend has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, the Nanjing gang began to favor it, and demand was average. Unexpectedly, the Hankou gang followed closely behind, and the market suddenly became active, rising by about 10% to 20%.

Western Medicine: Guest firms are quite active in moving saccharin and quinine, and prices are firm. Penicillin shipments continue to arrive, and the price is tending to fall.

Cigarettes: Direct sales of British-American cigarettes have become smoother, and prices are rising in unison. Except for a slight rise in Gaole and Brandy cigarettes from Chinese merchants, the rest are stable.

Chemical Raw Materials: Various goods are still trending weakly. The price of imported caustic soda is only half of the market price, so all parties are weak. Soda ash is slightly popular due to strong export sales.

### Export Loans: Maximum Term is Three Months, Loaned at 70% of the Goods' Value

To support the export industry, the Central Bank has launched low-interest loans for exporters. After formulating measures and soliciting opinions from the banking and export industries in advance, it began to implement them on the 14th, and the designated banks are following them. Exporters who apply for loans from the designated banks can be loaned in advance. If the funds are insufficient, the Central Bank will provide them as much as possible at a simple interest rate of 6%. The loan period must not exceed three months. The loan is 70% of the value of the goods of each exporter. The target of the loan is exporters with a long history and reliable credit. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank, who spoke to a reporter, the bank has always handled import and export businesses in accordance with the government's established policies, and is currently using various methods to assist and support them as much as possible within its power. This time, the low-interest loans for the export industry are only one aspect of support, aimed at reducing costs, opening up the international market, and developing international trade. In the future, it will also provide assistance with transportation and other issues.

### World Cotton Production Decreases Sharply

[Associated Press Washington, 14th] According to statistics from the US Department of Agriculture, the total amount of world cotton currently on the market is 21,655,000 bales (calculated at 478 pounds per bale), which is the smallest amount in 22 years. The current cotton harvest has decreased by 12% compared to 1944-45 and 30% compared to the average harvest before the war (i.e., 31,000,000 bales).

The US cotton production this year is estimated to be about 9,015,000 bales, compared to 12,230,000 bales last year and an average of 13,149,000 bales before the war. In addition to the United States, the cotton production this year is about 2,900,000 bales in India, 1,091,000 bales in Egypt, 1,950,000 bales in Brazil, and 1,875,000 bales in the Soviet Union.

### Five Associations Jointly Telegraph the Ministry of Economic Affairs: The Call to Control Yarn Prices; Hoping that the Textile Construction Company Will Restrain and Stabilize Market Prices

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the soaring price of yarn, the Handkerchief Industry Association, the Underwear Industry Association, the Knitting Industry Association, the Towel and Blanket Industry Association, and the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city are finding it difficult to manufacture and sell their products due to the high cost of raw materials. After a meeting at the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss rescue methods, it was decided to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to implement yarn price controls in order to maintain production. Excerpts from their original request are as follows:

Yarn Rises 5,000 Times; Prices Rise 3,000 Times

Last September, the average selling price of 20-count yarn was only 117,500 yuan, but now it has risen to a huge 1.2 million yuan.

Compared to the 25th year of the Republic, it has risen more than 5,000 times, while the general price index is still only around 3,000 times. It is clear that the increase in raw material prices is leading to price increases and threatening the manufacturing industry. Initially, our industry believed that the Japanese textile industry, which was our most fierce competitor and imposed the most pressure, had disappeared. Domestic and Southeast Asian markets could take the opportunity to revitalize Chinese goods. However, the soaring price of cotton yarn makes it difficult for manufactured goods to break even. The domestic market will be occupied by foreigners, and it will be difficult to expand foreign sales without restraining yarn prices. According to statistics, in the 25th year of the Republic, each *dan* of cotton cost 40 yuan. In the 35th year of the Republic, in April, it cost 90,000 yuan. The multiple of increase is 2,250 times. The cost of 20-count cotton yarn in the 25th year was 233.8 yuan, and in April of the 35th year, it was 1.2 million yuan. The multiple of increase is 5,125 times. According to the fact that each piece of 20-count yarn weighs 400 pounds and requires 350 *jin* of cotton, calculated at the average market price of cotton in May, which is 90,000 yuan per *jin*, then each piece of yarn requires 315,000 yuan in raw material costs. Other costs such as wages, power, and manufacturing are about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, so the total cost is about 700,000 yuan. Last month, the average price of yarn cloth was 1.2 million yuan, and the profit margin was more than 70%. The profit margin for other fine yarns is even greater. At a time when cotton production is still low, wages are high, and taxes are heavy, yarn factories should be able to balance profits by selling cotton yarn at a fair price. Manufacturing industries of cotton products are no longer the enemy of foreign goods. Now, they disregard everything, scooping up high profits, causing cotton product factories to be unable to stop or close. Opening factories is not easy, so they have to reluctantly buy in to avoid the cutoff of raw materials. If the direct costs cannot be controlled, then they have to take from one place to pay for another, reducing indirect costs, and even subsidizing with their own capital to barely maintain production. However, income does not cover expenses, and the day of total collapse is not far off. Among them, there are many factories that are unable to support themselves and finally close down. If one industry thrives while many industries wither, prices rise while people's livelihoods are strained, and the yarn industry will be difficult to enjoy its benefits for long, and how can it be obtained? We believe that price controls are a necessary measure when the economy has not yet returned to normal. Developed countries in Europe and America have mostly not abolished them.

Take the Price of Rice as an Example; Control Cannot Be Delayed

Take the price of rice in this city last month as an example. Once controls were implemented, it immediately dropped from 70,000 to within 50,000. Now, for the price of yarn, the raw material for clothing, is rampant, how can we continue to let it go? The state-owned China Textile Construction Company, which controls yarn cloth and influences the market, should set an example and restrain market prices. If privately-owned yarn factories still raise yarn prices, then the government should strongly suppress them. If it is unavoidable, the effect can be seen. Not only is this what our industry expects, but it is also what patriots feel. Some may think that the high price of yarn is due to supply not meeting demand. However, judging from the existing yarn spindles of the China Textile Construction Company, only half are in operation. Its production capacity should be expanded. If the goal is not to make excessive profits, then how can restraining yarn prices hinder the increase in production? In order to jointly maintain the current industrial crisis and preserve the weak foundation of the cotton products industry, we dare to jointly request the Chairman to review and approve the implementation of controls on the selling price of cotton yarn, stipulate the maximum profit, earnestly increase production, and order the China Textile Construction Company to implement it first, so that the cotton products industry can survive, and the people's livelihood after the war can be restored. We await your orders with utmost respect.

### For Demanding the Liquidation of the Traitorous Literary Scoundrel Cen Weixiu, the "National Daily" Was Ordered to Cease Publication by the Hong Kong Government

— Special Correspondent Lin Youlan

This paper's Hong Kong, 11th dispatch

For the past half-month, rain clouds brought by subtropical monsoons have obscured the towering Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. The low atmospheric pressure has made people feel suffocated, as if foreshadowing a major event about to occur.

On the 5th of this month, the Chairman's Guangzhou Headquarters announced the second list of wanted traitors. Because the Huai Prefecture [area] had resumed the agreement with our side during the period of civil and military administration, all agreements were invalid. Therefore, the Headquarters had specially sent Li Hanchong, the director of the General Staff Office, to Hong Kong in advance to discuss new methods for arresting traitors with the Governor, determined to intensify the work of eliminating traitors without avoiding the relatively special environment of Hong Kong. The traitors hiding in Hong Kong are facing their doomsday, everyone is in danger, and they are urgently seeking ways to escape.

### The "Republican Daily" Requests the Arrest of Cen Weixiu

One of the names on the second list is Cen Weixiu (a native of Enping County, Guangdong, in his fifties), the chief cultural traitor in Hong Kong, the general manager and printer of the "Overseas Chinese Daily," whose investigation has been strongly advocated by Hong Kong public opinion for half a year. The overseas Chinese community was excited to hear the news. On the 7th, the "National Daily" published an article titled "Wanted Cen Weixiu," promoting the overseas Chinese community to "take united action to thoroughly liquidate Cen and his 'Overseas Chinese Daily,'" and put forward three principles: (1) Cen must be captured alive, (2) the "Overseas Chinese Daily" must be boycotted immediately, and (3) the movement of assets and equipment of Cen and the "Overseas Chinese Daily" must be closely monitored. "Overseas Chinese are requested to take immediate action." On the 8th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" published an article titled "For National Integrity and Social Justice," praising our authorities' actions in eliminating traitors, and believing that "the 'Overseas Chinese Daily,' which has always been promoting for the enemy, destroying the war of resistance, criticizing the Allied countries, and insulting the leader, is still published as usual, which is a great shame on social justice." Therefore, "it is hoped that the local authorities will seriously consider allowing the publication of the 'Overseas Chinese Daily.'" Also, "it is hoped that the patriotic overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will make a solemn statement on sanctioning this enemy newspaper in order to maintain the dignity of national laws and regulations." Guo Bingqi, the Major General of the Guangzhou Headquarters' Military Inspectorate in Hong Kong and Kowloon, also met with reporters from Hong Kong on the 7th and asked "overseas Chinese to pay close attention to the actions of traitors, report to the government anytime and anywhere, and fulfill their obligation to assist the government in arresting traitors." The surging righteousness is enough to seize the courage of the traitors.

### The Governor of Hong Kong Orders the Newspaper to Cease Publication for One Month

Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 8th, a bolt from the blue struck. The Governor of Hong Kong, together with the Legislative Council, issued an order: ordering the "National Daily" to cease publication for one month from the 8th. According to a government spokesperson, "The promulgation of this order is because the Legislative Council believes that the content of the second editorial of the newspaper on Friday, June 7th of this year—Reporter's note: The second editorial of the 'National Daily' on that day was 'The Last Way for the Communist Party to Serve the Country 1,' and the second was the aforementioned 'Wanted Cen Weixiu'—is to cause the public to misunderstand the Hong Kong and Chinese authorities' legal extradition of enemy elements, and contains the meaning of encouraging the public to despise Hong Kong laws and order." It is "implemented according to Article 24 of the Second Ordinance of the 1922 Defense Act published by Government Notice No. 775 on the October 7, 1938 Gazette."

At the same time as this decree was issued by the Hong Kong Government Information Services, about 30 hours after the "National Daily's" article on Cen Weixiu met with readers, armed police officers from the Hong Kong government, carrying an emergency warrant, ran to the "National Daily" office, which was established by the Propaganda Department of our country, to carry out the task of sealing the newspaper. After the newspaper protested against the sudden order, the newspaper's office, composing room, and printing press were sealed off: a small hemp rope was passed through the door buckle, and both ends of the hemp rope were sealed with red sealing wax on a thick white paper with the words "This house is sealed by order, and no one is allowed to enter without authorization, by order of the police superintendent." Two armed police officers were stationed outside the gate day and night. On the morning of the 9th, when the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong saw the "Emergency Announcement of the National Daily" and the news that the "National Daily" was ordered to cease publication for one month by the Hong Kong government published in various newspapers, the sound of the British court's wise instructions to promote reform of the political system and strengthen Sino-British alliance friendship suddenly occurred, causing a few stubborn colonial bureaucrats to disregard our government agencies and stifle public opinion. Therefore, it attracted their attention even more than the Pingshan Airport incident last winter. The reporter sent an urgent telegram at 5 pm on the 9th to briefly report the situation. Now, given the importance of the law and national system, I will inform the compatriots who are concerned about the Hong Kong issue about the causes and consequences of the incident:

Since Japan's surrender, Hong Kong has become a refuge for traitors, big and small, in the South China region. Loyalty and treachery cannot coexist, and black and white must be distinguished, so there has been discussion of the issue of eliminating traitors. On January 8th of this year, the "National Daily" published an article on "Thoroughly Eliminating Traitors." On the 15th of the same month, it published another article "Eliminating Traitors Often Begins with Culture," and on the 17th, it questioned "Where Do Cultural Traitors Go?" On February 6th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" published two editorials, "Sino-British Cooperation to Search for and Arrest War Criminals in Hiding." On the same day, the evening edition of the newspaper published an open letter detailing the enemy newspaper. Later, under the title "Please Look at the Ugly Face of the Enemy Newspaper," it successively published editorials of the "Overseas Chinese Daily" during the period of Hong Kong's occupation, which were all malicious and inflammatory words used by the "Overseas Chinese Daily" to promote for the enemy, making people's hair stand on end when reading them!

### Negotiations Were Conducted, but Repeatedly Restricted by the Environment

At that time, our authorities had already conducted close negotiations with the Hong Kong government, but due to the special environment of Hong Kong, the newspapers were unable to fully express their opinions and call for further action. On April 19th, the "Overseas Chinese Daily," which had not been republished for long, published an article demanding that our anti-traitor authorities stationed in Hong Kong "punish Cen Weixiu of the 'Overseas Chinese Daily.'" The wording and sentences used were more direct and clear than before. The "Overseas Chinese Daily" was shocked and ashamed under the banner of justice, and did not hesitate to use all means to struggle and try to reverse the declining trend. The reporter's dispatch on "Hong Kong's Cultural Barrier" on May 8th has already been reported in detail, and it is believed that the readers will remember it. On that day, the "National Daily" published an article "Serving the People and Severing Ties with Traitors" and published "A Letter to Mr. Xu Shiying Regarding the 'Overseas Chinese Daily's' Speculation in Fundraising and Disaster Relief," exposing the "Overseas Chinese Daily's" conspiracy to obtain titles from political figures, confuse overseas Chinese, launch disaster relief, and deceive the government, giving the traitors a merciless blow. After the Guangzhou Headquarters issued an announcement on May 17th to announce the first list of key members of puppet organizations or traitors with serious crimes, the anti-traitor work in Hong Kong has entered a new stage, and the prestige of justice has greatly increased. On May 24th, the "Industrial and Commercial Daily" published an editorial "Distinguishing Between Loyalty, Treachery, Good and Evil." The Guangzhou Headquarters' second list of traitors was announced. The newspapers witnessed that the national law had been established and believed that the time was ripe to speak freely, which led to the unfortunate incident of the "National Daily" being ordered to cease publication. However, this incident shocked the overseas Chinese community and taught them how the stubborn elements in the Hong Kong government treat our government's laws and decrees, and the institutions they have established, and how they treat those who are traitors and have betrayed their country, whom more than 90% of the residents of Hong Kong despise. At the same time, they also saw one of the reasons why the anti-traitor work has been launched for half a year but has not yet achieved significant results.

### Full of Praise for the Barbarians, Showing Shameful Traces of Insulting England

Just as millions of overseas Chinese could not have dreamed that after our Headquarters explicitly announced the list of wanted traitors, the Hong Kong government, which has paid special attention to the friendship between China and Britain after the war, would give the "National Daily," which represents the opinions of the overseas Chinese, such a severe punishment, they also could not have dreamed that the "Overseas Chinese Daily," which boasts of "subtly implying to the readers to enhance their beliefs," would make a straightforward statement in the conclusion of its editorial "A Few Words to All Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong" the day after the "National Daily" was ordered to cease publication: "We are greatly encouraged by the wise local authorities, which further enhances our excitement and firm confidence." The "Overseas Chinese Daily" "cleverly" used the word "encouragement" to lightly shift the monstrous crimes committed in the past onto the "wise local authorities." The "Overseas Chinese Daily's" support for the Japanese寇's actions to destroy our country's war of resistance may be ignored by the British, but the "Overseas Chinese Daily's" past full of "British barbarians" and "British barbarians," and its extreme insults to the British Empire and its royal family, were also encouraged by the "wise local authorities"? Cen Weixiu was so ecstatic that he not only angered the overseas Chinese community, but perhaps even angered the British, who uphold justice, enforce the law like a mountain, and have allied with China!

### Cherishing Diplomatic Relations, Hoping the British Authorities Will Consider

The British authorities' spirit of the rule of law has always been admired by people around the world, and the overseas Chinese, who cherish the precious friendship built by China and Britain for more than 100 years, especially in this war where they have shared weal and woe, pay close attention to the defense law promulgated before the war under special circumstances, but applied to Hong Kong after the war, where London has decided to give the people greater freedom. They feel that after this Pacific War, although the vicious Japanese have been defeated by the Allies, the defense law that punishes the "National Daily" for promoting sanctions against big traitors once allowed the Japanese to publish newspapers in Hong Kong that slandered our government and undermined our war of resistance. Since this law can be applied today, the Japanese can come to Hong Kong again to run the "Hong Kong Daily" before the war! Some overseas Chinese even pointed out that the Hong Kong government's re-announcement of the defense law in 1938 was the day when the Japanese, who were hostile to our country, were carrying out large-scale activities in Hong Kong. Given this relationship, they are looking forward to a clear attitude from the wise London authorities.

After our supreme commander Chiang Kai-shek ordered British General Xia Hui to represent the acceptance of the surrender of the Japanese army in Hong Kong in the Chinese war zone, they firmly believed that the British authorities had adopted an equal attitude towards them. All the bad measures before the war should no longer exist. Now, the "National Daily," which is sponsored by our government, has been severely punished for advocating taking action against wanted traitors. However, the overseas Chinese still believe that the Hong Kong authorities, which are so compliant with local laws, should not despise the national laws of their allied country, which is close at hand. They would not protect a wanted traitor who has sold himself to the enemy, and sacrifice the friendship of millions of Hong Kong overseas Chinese, or even 450 million Chinese people. Therefore, until now, they have not lost their cherish for the friendship between China and Britain. The reporter has reason to believe that the wise British authorities will not let them lose this cherish, and at the same time arouse unanimous resentment from the entire Chinese people!

### The Government's Responsibility to Refugee Youth

Mr. Editor: Thank you very much for publishing the words of "The Voices of Refugees" in your newspaper. However, the admirers are probably only us, the group of refugees! Only refugees know the taste of being a refugee. We only brought out the few coins we had, but we have to cope with this environment where everything costs money. The shadows of hunger and death are always behind each of us refugees. But we can't wait to die, we still have to live. We all have the ability to work, but where is there a place that is willing to employ us refugees who are poorly clothed and have no "substantial guarantor"? We have also done our best for the war of resistance. Now that we have won, why does the country listen to us and not care about us? We don't need to talk about our plight in vain. We must ask the government to give us work to do, and use our brains to exchange for the necessary food and clothing. We must ask the government to immediately implement the following measures: (1) Conduct refugee youth registration; (2) Concentrate refugee youth to stabilize their lives; (3) Test each person's knowledge and ability; (4) Assign them to various government agencies, schools, factories, and shops to enable them to do their jobs. The above four points are easy for the government to do. But for us refugee youth, we don't know how to praise and sing their praises!

Wang Shaoshang, a refugee youth from Northern Jiangsu

### The Suffering of the People of Yancheng

Mr. Editor: It is now the stage where the Communist Party of Northern Jiangsu has become deeply rooted. In the past, it was only divided into districts and counties, and the leaders were not yet fully sound. Since the winter of last year, the districts have been changed to provinces, and the organization of the province is said to be divided into eight administrative regions, governing more than 70 counties in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, and the Su-Wan Border Region Provincial Government has been established, and the administrative structure is becoming increasingly strict. Our people are suffering more and more, and will fall into a state of eternal damnation. However, because our government's banner is flying high in Nanjing, it is not comparable to being far away in Chongqing in the past. It is only separated from the Communist Party-occupied area by the Yangtze River, which is only a narrow strip of water. We believe that the danger is very great, and not only we refugees are suffering. I previously read in your newspaper's June 2nd issue the appeal of Lu Guojun, a representative from Taidong, for the people of Northern Jiangsu, and listed various items, all of which are facts and not rumors. If the government can send someone to investigate, they will be shocked and furious, and send troops to the north. Otherwise, north of the Yangtze River will be no different from Soviet territory, truly connected to the Soviet Union, and incurable. We are from Yancheng, formerly part of the Communist Party's Yancheng-Fuyu District, and now changed to the Fifth Administrative Region of the Border Region Government. The suffering from the Communist Party's ravages is similar to that of Taidong. What we have personally endured and what Lu of Taidong et al. have not fully stated are as follows: (1) Pretending to be public opinion. Whenever the Communist Party wants to do something, it must always pretend to be public opinion and hold meetings. People mistakenly believe that it is a democratic facade and discuss it carefully. As a result, those who speak on the spot are assassinated either on the same day or in two or three days, or they are charged with crimes and killed. In our Yancheng, such as Wu Jikang, Zhou Tiejun, Sun Yue, Lü Dacai, Qiao Yuebo, Liu Jiaqing, and Liu Yiqing, etc., are all important local gentry who were suddenly murdered. May I ask, who else dares to touch the dragon's scale again? This matter should be requested that Mr. Huang Yanpei and others go in person to thoroughly investigate the truth, so as not to be deceived by the Communist Party again. (2) Universal hunger. The Communist Party government has many ways to extract wealth from the people, and the result is that no family can have food. Landlords and gentry have no food to eat and cannot guarantee their lives in the morning or evening, but they can also be considered to have committed a crime worthy of death, while other people, such as businessmen, refugees, and tenant farmers, also have no food to eat and all die together. The Communist Party's collected land tax and public grain are full of pits and valleys. Is this what they call a democratic government? (3) Forced conscription. The Communist Party forcibly conscripts strong men, assigning one or two soldiers to each household, with many names, such as national soldiers, provincial soldiers, county soldiers, militiamen, stretcher teams, transport teams, and comfort teams. At this time, the strong men of our county, fearing their coercion and enticement, also fled together with the landlords and gentry, otherwise they would end up in ditches and gullies. (4) Encroachment on land. The Communist Party's strategy for encroaching on land is roughly divided into three types: (1) confiscation, (2) settling accounts, (3) opening rivers. With these three methods of encroaching on land, there is no piece of clean land left in the entire Northern Jiangsu. (5) Demolishing houses. In the Northern Jiangsu region, there are no less than tens of thousands of public temples, ancestral halls, city god temples, and land temples, all of which have been completely demolished by the Communist Party. Other residences, such as those of gentlemen Qiao Zhonglin, Hu Qidong, Ma Yongxu, Xu Chongda, Wu Yibai, and Hong Weiyang, etc., numbering no less than several hundred, have also been completely demolished by the Communist Party. In the four townships of our Yancheng, there is almost no residence left. The enemy and puppets in this place did not take such drastic actions. (6) Forcibly robbing miscellaneous items. The Communist Party ordered all bandits and hooligans to carry out a large-scale accounting strategy, first demanding grain from landlords, and if there was no grain in the house, they ordered the bandits and hooligans to rob all the stored miscellaneous items and clothes. (7) Humiliating women and children. The landlords and gentry were forced by the Communist Party to flee to the south of the Yangtze River one after another. The women and children left in Northern Jiangsu were forced by the Communist Party to organize women's salvation associations and children's corps, and village and town cadres forced them to parade, sing Yangko dances, and the cadres teased them at will. Who doesn't have women? Who doesn't have a family? There is nothing more destructive to etiquette. The children's corps were forced to race, and they often got injured on the spot, fainted immediately, or suffered from hemoptysis after running, which is innumerable. The Communist Party directly wants to eliminate our Northern Jiangsu people, and not only grabs our land and robs our miscellaneous items. All of this is what Lu Guojun, the representative of Taidong, and others have not mentioned. It is now heard that the Communist Party has signed an agreement with our government. We intend to appeal through your newspaper, and respectfully ask the government to give an order to the Communist Party troops to withdraw from Northern Jiangsu immediately, so that we can return to our hometown and live in peace, and we will be infinitely blessed. Wu Miao, Wei Weifu, Yi Shiyan, Liu Beilan, Qiao Riwu, Hong Hai, Zhao Yidong, He Qitong, representatives of the refugees from Yancheng in Xixi. June 11th.

### Important Views Published by the Hong Kong Media

The Hong Kong media has begun to express their opinions on the incident of the "National Daily" being severely punished by the Hong Kong government. The "Sing Tao Daily" yesterday published an article titled "Promoting Sino-British Friendship," expressing "infinite sympathy" for the "National Daily's" "unexpected encounters in order to maintain national integrity and rectify national laws and regulations." The newspaper quoted the process of British and Japanese diplomacy towards China in our modern history, emphasizing the mistakes made by the Japanese, and "hoping that the enlightened British government and Hong Kong government, who respect history, can understand the psychology of the Chinese residents of Hong Kong, and even the feelings of the entire Chinese nation." The "Chinese Character Daily" also published an editorial today titled "Sino-British Cooperation and the National Daily." It is said that "After the war and after all kinds of lessons, the one million overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have now realized. Now it is definitely not as easy to be deceived and anesthetized as it was before the war." Finally, it said: "We do not want to have the slightest harm to the feelings of the two nations because of small things, and we do not want to have the slightest obstacle to the cooperation of the two nations because of the development of small things. We hope that the authorities will handle it properly as soon as possible." It is learned that other Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong will make representations in the coming days in order to maintain the status of our overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and reaffirm the friendship between the two major nations of China and Britain.

According to sources close to the Hong Kong government, when the Legislative Council met to discuss the sealing of the "National Daily," McDougall spoke the most. McDougall strongly advocated using the outdated 1938 Defense Act to support Cen Weixiu. Cen Weixiu's "Overseas Chinese Daily" has praised McDougall immensely in recent days. When McDougall was the Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, he made a remark of "deeply gratified to have found the right person." McDougall has recently sent many plainclothes detectives to protect Cen Weixiu and the "Overseas Chinese Daily," and has allocated a car specifically for Cen Weixiu to travel in and out. When Duo followed the British army back to Hong Kong (McDougall was the director of the London Intelligence Agency in Hong Kong before the war), it was rumored that Cen Weixiu had given him a large sum of money. McDougall also intends to protect other traitors in Hong Kong. The overseas Chinese in Hong Kong feel somewhat disappointed because our government officials stationed in Hong Kong have failed to adopt effective policies to maintain national discipline and boost morale, and have allowed traitors and villains to be arrogant.

### The Various Circles of Guangzhou Protest to the Hong Kong Government Regarding the National Daily Incident

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Guangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 12th [of the month]

After eight long years of sacrificial struggle, we have recovered many of the territories we lost under unequal treaties. Perhaps only Hong Kong and Macau remain temporarily unrecovered for the sake of maintaining friendship. Unfortunately, one unfortunate incident after another has occurred precisely in these two places, especially in Hong Kong, often making us feel that the "friendship" we gained is repaid with others' "unfriendliness." Look, there have been many instances, such as Portuguese police officers in Hong Kong insulting and assaulting our national soldiers… These may be minor matters, and for the sake of the Sino-British friendship forged in times of shared life and death, who cares if we suffer a little? We are unwilling to quibble. However, the sensational Pingshan Airport incident has just passed, and another unfortunate event follows closely: recently, the Hong Kong National Daily was forced to suspend publication for a month simply for calling for the punishment of traitors. The arrival of this unfortunate news has left the people of Guangzhou astonished and indignant. The Hong Kong government sent a large contingent of police to the National Daily to carry out the order, intending to seal up the entire newspaper office. The newspaper's staff members said that if the main entrance was sealed, the large amount of lodging would become a problem. After repeated requests, they finally agreed to only seal the newspaper's office, typesetting room, machine room, and editorial department.

A Brief History of the National Daily's Struggle

As we all know, the Hong Kong National Daily is one of the overseas party newspapers directly under the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang. From its founding in 1939 until the last day of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in December 1941, it continued to publish. It is remembered that on December 25 of that year, at 4:00 PM, amidst the sounds of artillery fire, the British troops defending Hong Kong had completely surrendered, and the Japanese troops marched from Wan Chai to the Central district. However, at that time, the newspaper's staff, together with the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army led by General Chen Ce, still managed to distribute the newspaper on the morning of the 26th under heavy Japanese guard. They then burned the newspaper office on Pedder Street before retreating. This was something that all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong at the time knew. The newspaper's past spirit of upholding justice and its pronouncements were deeply loved by the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. After the victory, the newspaper resumed publication in Hong Kong under the order of the central government. At that time, our country's military delegation had formally notified the Hong Kong authorities, and the registration with the Hong Kong government was under the name of the Central Propaganda Department. Unexpectedly, this time, simply for calling for the punishment of traitors, in Hong Kong, a place regarded as governed by the rule of law, at a time when people around the world unanimously demand freedom of the press, the Hong Kong government, on trumped-up charges, without any legal procedure and without notifying any of our agencies, hastily ordered the newspaper to suspend publication for a month and even seal it up. This is not only unprecedented in the 105-year history of Hong Kong as a port, but also an unprecedented example in any democratic country!

A Glimpse of Hong Kong Government Regulations

What exactly is the content of the regulations cited by the Hong Kong government this time? The gist of the Defense Law promulgated by the Hong Kong government in 1922 states: "If a state of danger or emergency exists in Hong Kong, the Governor has the power to execute orders if any of the following conditions exist." The gist of Article 24 states, "No publication may incite people to not work or to break off relations with a certain shop." It is discovered that the order was promulgated after the Hong Kong General Strike, designed to prevent workers from striking. Is Hong Kong still in a state of danger or emergency today, when the world has declared peace? Moreover, in the past, when the Hong Kong government punished newspapers with suspension, the most serious incident, even in a state of emergency, did not result in a suspension of more than 27 days. This time, the most severe measures were taken for this incident, which shows that the Hong Kong government clearly has ulterior motives. In fact, according to another source, there is an inside story to this matter: because Cen knew that his crimes were numerous and he would certainly not escape the law of the country, he desperately flattered the ruling figures in the Hong Kong government, hoping to use the power of the British to cover him up. Therefore, the Hong Kong government had been paying attention to the National Daily's usual attacks on traitors and puppets, but this time they took decisive action. Of course, we still hope that this news is just a rumor; otherwise, the Hong Kong government's move would have the suspicion of protecting Cen and others!

The President of the Newspaper Reports the Matter Upon Arriving in Guangzhou

For this issue, the colleagues in the Hong Kong press originally wanted to unite to support the National Daily, but later everyone thought that after all, it was on other people's (?) territory. If they did not handle it well, they would likely suffer the same fate as the National Daily, so they had to find other methods and did not make any obvious expressions!

The president of the newspaper, Zhang Husheng, after the incident occurred, ran to Guangzhou to report the matter to the relevant authorities and appealed to the people of the country. The press here also felt that the Hong Kong government's unreasonable flogging of our colleagues was extremely infuriating.

Convening a Meeting to Decide on Various Matters

In addition to writing articles protesting the Hong Kong government, a joint meeting of the directors of three organizations, the Provincial and Municipal Reporters' Association and the Newspaper Industry Association, was held on the 12th of this month. It was decided that these three organizations would promote the convening of a general assembly of all circles in the city. The important resolutions at the time included: (1) Sending a telegram to the whole country, urging the government to sternly lodge a negotiation through normal diplomatic channels, and asking the people of the whole country to provide assistance. (2) Sending a telegram to people all over the world, appealing for condemnation of the Hong Kong government's destruction of freedom of the the press. (3) Following diplomatic channels to demand that the Hong Kong government immediately revoke the order to suspend the National Daily and punish the people responsible for handling this incident in the Hong Kong government. (4) While the Hong Kong government's unfriendly attitude toward our press exists, all promises from the Hong Kong authorities to assist the city's newspapers in purchasing newsprint and inviting the city's reporters to visit Hong Kong will be temporarily rejected. At that time, the entire atmosphere was激昂, with a sense of not giving up until the matter was resolved. Some even believed that for the sake of our territorial sovereignty, we should "recover Hong Kong!" In Guangdong, the birthplace of the revolution, there is actually a colony of another country, which is simply a disgrace to the people of Guangdong!

This time, the Hong Kong government, with this small matter, has taken such unreasonably severe measures against the representative agencies established by our government in Hong Kong. This is clearly a lack of respect for our government, which could easily erase our past friendship. Our last hope is that this is just the Hong Kong government's mistake, and not that of the British authorities.

### How Britain Solves the Food Shortage

— Special Correspondent Xueyan

London Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 4th [of the month]

Although Britain's food production is not enough to meet its needs, due to a good transportation system and sufficient preparation, it has surprisingly managed to avoid any embarrassment amidst the world's food shortage. Furthermore, it has made appropriate arrangements for all parts of the empire. For example, as far as the Far East is concerned, there is a need for food everywhere now, but Siam still has surplus rice. However, Siamese rice has long been designated by Britain as its exclusive preserve, only for the enjoyment of the people of the British Empire and not to be shared by other countries. As far as Britain's own food problem is concerned, the most thorny issue is the British-occupied zone in Germany. Although Britain is self-sufficient, it is still very difficult. It has no surplus strength to distribute to its former enemies. Therefore, the food supply in the British-occupied zone of Germany has been stretched thin since last winter and is difficult to cope with. The amount allocated has been reduced again and again, to the point where it can only barely sustain life. However, the result of reducing food is also a reduction in productivity. The problem caused by this is not simple. Unexpectedly, the food in the Soviet and American-occupied zones is very sufficient. Therefore, the businesses run by Germans in these two zones are far better than in the British-occupied zone. As a result of the Germans' psychological reaction, the problem gradually affected management, and the feeling that a way to compensate needs to be found is very urgent. First, of course, is to ask the British people to save more food. The amount of wheat used to make beer has been reduced, and the amount of rations distributed to soldiers has been reduced to be equal to that of civil servants. At the same time, a bread-saving campaign is being launched on a large scale by the Ministry of Food, with eye-catching slogans posted everywhere, urging people not to waste bread. However, it is inevitable that this type of passive measure will not have a great effect. Therefore, the Minister of Food, Ben Smith, went to the United States to discuss solutions. However, the atmosphere in the United States is clearly different from that in Britain. From the American perspective, when all of Europe is experiencing a food shortage, only Britain has reserves. It seems inappropriate for Britain not to distribute part of its stored food to relieve Europe, but instead to beg for aid from the United States. Therefore, Smith's mission clearly did not succeed. The British cabinet had no choice but to recently send Morrison, the government party leader in the House of Commons, to the United States. Morrison's mission has been completed in some sort of compromise.

### Sunday Forum: Do Not Sully the Essence of Democracy!

— Miao Jie

"Democracy" is truly an ancient and yet novel term. Ever since Aristotle coined this term, it has been constantly shouted and roared about by people of various eras, from different standpoints, and with different meanings, soaring into the clouds. It seems that any action, as long as it is prefaced with the word "democracy" or invokes the name of the people, can be completely irresponsible. Beneath this guise of "democracy," countless sins have been concealed or fabricated, just as people have abused "freedom."

Sun Yat-sen told us in the Three Principles of the People: "To learn from foreign countries, we must catch up from the front, not follow behind." This statement encompasses social, political, and cultural aspects. However, most reform experts and leaders today do not truly understand Sun Yat-sen's analogy, thinking that only in science must we catch up from the front, while in other aspects, we must recite or reenact foreign history. In fact, if we are determined to strive towards the goal of democracy in the right direction, we should first of all avoid the various disasters that have occurred in the process of "democratic politics" over the past few centuries and not repeat the same mistakes.

The essence of "democratic politics" lies in using the good will of society, from the bottom up, to effectively control the will of the government. To put it plainly, it lies in using the people's will for the "common good" to govern the will of those few who hold the power of the state and implement governance. The people of a country number in the millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions. Among these millions of people, on the one hand, we cannot, like Rousseau or Durkheim, believe that society has a "public opinion" or "collective consciousness" that exists beyond the individual, nor can we, like general social contract theorists, believe that people can mutually grant protection and form a simple and unified will through concluding contracts. On the other hand, if every person should have equal opportunities to express their impulses, exercise their intelligence, and express their opinions, then how can the principle that the government's actions under "democracy" are based on (the government's will must encompass and integrate the will of the entire people) be achieved? There is usually a mistaken view that to realize the will of the group, one must suppress the will of the individual. In fact, this theory is illusory; what existence does a group have apart from individuals? If a university excludes all students and professors, all that remains is the name; nothing else exists. If it were possible for everyone to suppress their own will, whose will would become the will of the group? If everyone has no will, then there is no such thing as the will of the group. As long as the will of the individual does not override the will of others, the will of the individual will also and necessarily always be consistent with the will of the group. When the wills of millions of people converge in one place, they stimulate each other and adapt to each other, and in the process of harmonious coordination of human nature, the public good that benefits both oneself and others can be extracted from each will, synthesizing the greatest, final, and most comprehensive social goodwill. Therefore, the goodwill of society is nothing more than the "common good" that millions of people have tempered and condensed through various considerations and judgments. If this goodwill of society can in fact become the source of state law and the basis of government actions, then it is the true realization and completion of "democracy." However, this also simultaneously reveals that the success of "democracy" must rely on the two conditions of "rule of law" and "responsible politics." If the law is not respected for a single day, if it does not have power for a single day, then it cannot compel the few powerful rulers to comply with the goodwill of society. If the highest authorities that make up the government do not have a conscious responsibility for the results of their actions, there can be no guarantee that the goodwill of society will be carefully and properly implemented. That is to say, in a sound and complete "democracy," the people must not only be able to generate the goodwill of society but also be able to concentrate the power of the entire body as the final sanction entrusted to the government for the implementation of the social goodwill.

Although the meaning of "democracy" is not difficult to explain clearly, the spirit of "democracy" is extremely easy to be insulted, damaged, and even completely destroyed. Therefore, it is urgently necessary for us to identify and reject the various confusing and misleading regressive concepts of "anti-democracy" or "false democracy" that are currently prevalent.

First, "democracy" is not simply "majority rule." Under "democracy," it is never permissible for the will of one person in the people to be superior to the will of another person, or for the will of this person to be controlled by the will of that person. Everyone's will is equal, has the same value, and has equal opportunity for expression. The majority often knows social values and perceives social needs better than the minority, which can be proven by historical facts. It is also undeniable that the majority, through collective wisdom, often has more and higher intelligence. But if it is said that the majority should and must be superior to the minority, or that the interests of the minority must be sacrificed for the sake of the interests of the majority, this is devoid of logic. Ibsen, in his play "An Enemy of the People," stated: "The majority is always wrong, the minority is always right." Although this may be an overstatement, there is no reason why the wisdom and interests of the minority cannot be respected and protected. In a group of one hundred people, it cannot be that because ninety-nine people unanimously believe that another person must die, that person should be legitimately sentenced to death. Therefore, "people's courts" and the like are truly not worth emulating. The licentiousness of the majority is as worthy of condemnation as the tyranny of the minority!

Second, "democracy" should not be "mob rule." Aristotle, in his famous book "Politics," had already cleverly pointed out: "Mob rule is to democracy as tyranny is to enlightened monarchy." According to Aristotle, under "mob rule," what occupies the supreme position in the country is not the law but the ignorant masses; the commands of the masses must disregard the authority of the law, and those who are violent and arbitrary occupy the key positions of the state, and those who are greedy for profit and disregard righteousness invariably seize high positions and generous salaries. However, since the first French Revolution, followed by violent revolutions in some European countries, people seem to have become confused again, believing that "mob rule" is the climax of "democracy." This seems to be deliberately imitated in some places in China as well. However, in the eyes of social psychologists, mobs are nothing more than groups of crazy and blind animals! Every one of them has lost their own reason, relying only on emotional impulses, leading good people to hell and falling into the path of beasts. No wonder the British sociologist MacIver said: "Crowds are stupid, cruel, immoral, passionate, and easily agitated. Even if the passion of the crowd is used in the right place, it is nothing more than a group of fools; if it is used in the wrong place, it is simply a flood of savage beasts. It only knows how to make some simple and frightening roars, it only knows how to destroy, not how to build. Before Christ, it only chose Barabbas, the thief." Terrible! Unfortunately, this kind of politics has recently been seriously spreading across our country!

Third, "democracy" is definitely not "struggle politics." "Class struggle" and "direct action" are the specialties of Marxists and syndicalists. This poison can be said to be caused by the distortion and misunderstanding of Darwin's theory of the struggle for existence. Darwin inherited this term from Malthus, and it does not refer exclusively to the "hostility" and "competitive reaction" of organisms, but includes "the interdependence of animals," especially "the individual's life and the success of reproduction." Marx and Engels said in the Communist Manifesto in 1913: "The history of all past societies is the history of class struggles." This is clearly an absurd and dogmatic statement! No social organization can be clearly and absolutely divided into many opposing classes, and even Marx and Engels themselves did not have a clear analysis of social classes in their writings. Of course, there are often facts of conflict and antagonism between individuals and individuals, classes and classes in society, but this is definitely not a fundamental and universal phenomenon in society. Only social "cooperation" and "interdependence" are the most fundamental and most universal. If the forces of social separation exceed the forces of social harmony, then society would have collapsed and been destroyed long ago. Where would there be a battlefield for class struggle? And no class can indefinitely oppress or destroy other classes and survive safely for a long time. Since Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid" was published, people have been sure that human progress originates from "cooperation" and "interdependence," not from mutual hostility, antagonism, and jealousy. For example, the opposition between workers and factory owners, no matter how serious and sharp, is still superficial and relative. Whether workers or factory owners, both must rely on the other's cooperation to survive and prosper. If either party aims to overwhelm or destroy the other, the result will be the decline of production and the shrinkage of the economy, which is tantamount to suicide. The only question is how to reasonably and fairly distribute profits under the condition of mutual dependence. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen said that social progress is due to the harmony of the interests of all classes, not due to conflict, which is truly the truth.

Fourth, "democracy" is no longer "property politics." The beginning of "democracy" was indeed due to the expansion of the property of the middle class. Because the class that owns vast property naturally feels keenly aware of its relationship with the interests of the state in order to maintain the safety of its property, and having property also has the power to seek the development and enrichment of its personality. Therefore, the political interests of property owners are always relatively strong, and the demand to participate in politics is also relatively keen, eventually overthrowing monarchical autocracy and laying the cornerstone of "democracy." But this cannot lead to the conclusion that property must permanently control "democracy." Modern "democracy" enables everyone to have equal opportunities to participate in deciding the social goodwill of politics. However, since the talent and experience of individuals cannot be denied to have differences in level, the efforts and social value of individuals in political participation should also have differences in superiority and inferiority. However, those with property are not necessarily intelligent. There is no correlation between property and wisdom. Property is not necessarily due to the individual's efforts and value, and there is no proportional relationship between them. Therefore, property in "democracy" really has no basis to determine decisiveness and importance. If property is still influencing politics, the people cannot have equal opportunities. If property is still used as a standard for measuring the level of people, the effectiveness of individual personality has no social evaluation standard. Therefore, we must reject the concept of "property politics." But it is not to say that this can be achieved simply by a law stipulating that "everyone can acquire the qualifications of a citizen without being restricted by property." This always requires thoroughly clearing and fundamentally eliminating the direct and indirect forces and influences of property from the inner layer of politics.

Fifth, "democracy" is not necessarily "party politics." Whether it is British-American "democracy" or Continental-style "democracy," it seems that the implementation of modern "democracy" cannot be separated from "party politics." But this cannot prove that "democracy" must or must be "party politics." At most, it can only be said that at present, "party politics" is a relatively appropriate method of implementing "democracy." But this cannot be used to defend the various "party politics" that are currently prevalent, saying that all "party politics" are worthy of praise and admiration at the present time. A political party must be composed of true representatives of a group of people, and its roots must be deeply rooted in the inherent personality of a group of people. It is only a microphone for the people's will. It leads the people to promote themselves by appropriate methods. It stimulates the people's political interests and shows them how to supervise and how to judge the means of government actions. It should have no interests of its own party other than the interests of the people it represents. The party's struggle to seize power is only a reflection of the people's will to decide the government's actions. Only such "party politics" can be tolerated by "democracy." If a political party leaves the people or even betrays the people, the people will also abandon the political party. If a political party only cares about saying its own words, no longer conveys the will of the people, or does not even ask about the will of the people at all, then its criticism of the government is only venting its own personal anger and has nothing to do with the people. Its seizure of power is only for its own interests and does not benefit the people in any way. The result is nothing more than the formation of a multi-party distribution of spoils! What is said about "coalition government," what is said about "participation of all parties and factions in politics," if separated from the people, is more of a parasite of democracy than a lucky star of "democracy"!

### Social Services: Responding to Readers

Legal Questions

(1) Zhang Qiuping asks:

Dear Editor: I am a middle-aged woman, the mother of a girl. My marriage was arranged by my parents, marrying me to my current husband as a concubine. My parents were also helpless because he used his power to force the marriage. Although I was a child at the time, I had a deep negative impression in my mind. However, because of the separation, I lived through it vaguely for several years, simply a nominal couple. I have asked him for a divorce several times, but not only did he not respond, he even scolded me slowly. He has always held the attitude of insulting women. I still remember the slogan of the March 8th Women's Day, "Long live women" and "Down with officials taking concubines," which made me infinitely happy and sympathetic, because I am an unfortunate person who has experienced it firsthand and a pitiful person who has lost the meaning of life. Therefore, I have to issue a call to the ladies and ask for help from the gentlemen. May I ask: (1) Under his sinister influence, what methods should be taken to divorce in order to ensure safety? (2) After the divorce, who will raise the child, and are there any regulations on education expenses? (3) Is it possible to preserve personal savings? (4) If a divorce is not possible, what crime should I commit under the law if I run away privately? (5) If he uses murder to deal with me during an argument, what crime does he commit?

[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin]: (1) The relationship between a husband and a concubine cannot be considered a marital relationship. Therefore, if you want to break away from cohabitation, the divorce regulations under the law do not apply. You can request it in accordance with Article 1127 of the Civil Code. As for ensuring safety, it is a matter of fact and should be handled accordingly. (2) The children born to a concubine are "illegitimate children." Their relationship with their biological mother is regarded as legitimate children and does not need to be recognized. If they are recognized by their biological father, the biological father should also be responsible for education. There are no specific regulations on education expenses. (3) If it is your own property, it can be preserved. (4) An adult family member can leave the family. If there is no other criminal behavior, it is not a crime. (5) It is the crime of murder.

(1) Hua Xiaoping asks: I was born in Wuxi. I have been doing business in Shanghai for 20 years. In my hometown, besides my 70-year-old mother, I also have an older brother who is now 45 years old. He does not do his job properly and associates with bad people. Before the war, my mother reported him for harming his direct relatives, and he served six months. His temperament has not changed. He does not cultivate the ancestral fields and hangs around in teahouses every day, gambling. Next door to us is the ancestral two-room foundation of my uncle. My uncle was drafted by the enemy during the war and has not been heard from until now. He is probably no longer alive. So, a legal issue of stealing and selling has arisen. May I ask: (1) Can my brother establish the status of seller? (2) If my uncle's descendants do not exist, can I establish the status of plaintiff? (3) Is stealing and selling other people's property a civil or criminal offense? Which article? (4) Does the Land Rights Clearing Law formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government apply? (5) The pseudo-township chief committed bad deeds during the enemy and puppet period, such as forcibly requisitioning military grain, ordering road maintenance, swallowing military rice, smoking opium, and bullying the people. Must he be reported separately? Can it be heard in this case as an incidental appeal? (6) If I file a lawsuit in the Wuxi court, and the plaintiff lives in Shanghai, can the summons be sent to Shanghai? Sincerely, Hua Xiaoping

[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin]: (1) Your brother has no right to sell. (2) If your brother and your uncle are within five degrees of kinship or relatives living together, you have no right to sue; otherwise, you can report it. (3) If there is indeed an act of seizing other people's real estate, it can constitute the crime of Article 320, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (4) The Land Clearing Law formulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government can be used, but this case must be able to prove that it is indeed an illegal sale, and the contract is invalid. (5) If the pseudo-township chief has the crime of traitor, he should be reported separately, and the High Court is the first instance. (6) If the plaintiff lives in Shanghai, the summons can be entrusted to be served. Except for the necessity of the person appearing in court, you can entrust a lawyer to act as an agent.

### Water and Soil

— Shaofu

There is such a story in "Yanzi":

When Yanzi was in Chu, the king made Yanzi drink. When the drinking was at its height, two officials tied a man to the king. The king said: Who is the bound man? He replied: A Qi person, sitting for stealing. The king looked at Yanzi and said: Are Qi people good at stealing? Yanzi avoided his seat and replied: I have heard that oranges grow in Huainan and become oranges, but they grow in Huaibei and become trifoliate oranges. The leaves are similar, but the taste is different. What is the reason for this? The water and soil are different. Now, the people who grow up in Qi do not steal, but they steal when they enter Chu. Could it be that the water and soil of Chu make the people good at stealing?

Encountering I don't know how many friends who came to Shanghai, they rushed away after finishing their affairs. When asked afterwards, the answers were consistent: "I can't stand it." The meaning contained in the three words "I can't stand it" is very rich, it can be understood without words. As for the friends who are stuck in Shanghai and cannot slip away, they have to bear it even if they can't bear it.

In the past few days, MPs and SPs have been arresting mobile glass cabinet stores on the road, and vendors have a lot of complaints, thinking that the most aggrieved are non-military supplies, which were also swept away by these foreign adults.

In fact, even if it is military supplies, the good vendors are still wronged, because they did not go deep into the barracks or swim to climb the warships to steal them.

Some time ago, an American sailor escaped after robbing and resisting arrest by firing a gun. To be honest, when they were stark naked (there is a cartoon, drawing them returning home stark naked) and could not return home, they could do anything to eat without paying, strip pigs at night, rob, and do anything. In the middle of the night, the sharp ghost howling of the MP and SP patrol jeep on the road is just a sign that the days are not very peaceful. The vendors use US dollar bills to buy the small odds and ends they need to sell, probably not guilty!

Alas! The water and soil of Shanghai treats Chinese and foreigners equally.

### The Life of a Dance Hall Employee

— Cao Yu

I am a dance hall employee. In the minds of most people, dance halls are generally seen with prejudice and misunderstanding. It seems that everything in a dance hall is vile, shameless, and indecent, whether it is the dance hall itself, the dancers, or the general employees (including head waiters, waiters, accountants, etc.). The dance hall is seen as a den of iniquity, a source of depravity, and a stopover for licentiousness. Perhaps in reality, some employees are indeed dominated and swayed by the environment; but it is too much to force this dirty hat on the head of every employee. In fact, many of us are unwilling to be part of the muck. The only reason we go to dance halls is because we are driven by the whip of life, and probably no other more certain reason can be found.

Heavy with Sleepiness　Most people think that our life in this atmosphere must be pleasant and joyful, because we are immersed in the fragrant air and the world of charming songs all day long. But who can understand or sympathize with the suffering we endure? For the sake of business, while others are snoring in sweet dreams, we are just starting to get busy. When others have already worked half the day after the sun has risen high, we just get up, heavy with sleepiness. Every day from 2:30 PM to 11:30 PM, there are actually nine hours of work, with no chance to breathe except during dinner time. Even a common laborer doesn't work so hard! With all this, isn't our spirit already suffering enough?

If someone asks us how our treatment is, it's better not to say: the salary we directly receive from the boss is so little it's practically nothing. But the extra tips we get in the name of employees are partly taken away by the boss. Unless you experience it yourself, outsiders may find it hard to believe.

Treating Everyone Equally　Some people even want us to fill out some kind of survey form. It is said that the purpose of filling out this form is to issue dance hall employee service permits in the future. There are several almost ridiculous items in it, including "Whether you have the consent of your parents or husband?" "Whether you have a contract to sell yourself?" "Whether you have been seduced and lost your virginity?" Good heavens! Not every employee is a dancer. This must be a joke to us. In fact, we are men, so how could we have husbands, and what about "contracts to sell ourselves, seduction and loss of virginity"? We really don't understand how these could apply to us.

And there are some gentlemen who often come to dance halls, not to sell overdue weekly magazines, but to force the sale of so-called American glass combs that sell for eight or nine hundred yuan on the market, but they want two thousand yuan each. Often, they come to the dance hall to dance under the pretext of investigation. Eating for free is even more common. Sometimes, if the waiter is a little slow or not attentive enough, a scolding is unavoidable. It's lucky if they don't get beaten! When the boss sees it, he will immediately come over to apologize and scold the waiter for no reason, because they are "officials"! Isn't this enough? Please, gentlemen, stop looking at us with discriminatory eyes! You can know that dance hall employees are also capable of "doing certain things and not doing others." "The lotus seed has bitterness in its heart," who will sympathize?

### Dozens of Mysterious Concubines in the Inner宅 of "Emperor Ma" in Tianjin

The "One Heart Heavenly Dao Longhua Holy Religion Society" in Tianjin was recently banned by the authorities. The head of the society, "Emperor Ma," and his deputy, Tao Yunxiang, along with forty-five young and beautiful female members, fled upon hearing the news.

The "One Heart Heavenly Dao Longhua Holy Religion Society" originated in Dingwang Village, Changshan, Shandong. Its "founder," Ma Shiwei, courtesy name Guanying, was a local rogue who was restless. Later, he had a whimsical idea to claim himself emperor, creating a heaven and using unorthodox methods to mislead the villagers. The society has more than 100,000 members, half male and half female (note: the beauty lies in the fact that it is half male and half female), with the most in Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi.

According to police statistics, since August of last year, thirty-seven "imperial concubines" who faded away like fragrant jade have been taken out of this "imperial palace," and they all "coincidentally" died of "septicemia."

It is also said that "Emperor Ma" claimed to be the "Second Crown Prince of the Jade Emperor descending to earth," and his "subjects" called him "Buddha Seat," "Father Lord," or "Emperor." Outsiders only knew him as "Ma the Benefactor" or "Ma the Religious Leader."

The Heavenly Law Society was moved to No. 47 Yangjia Garden during the period of occupation, and it was wide and beautifully decorated, its magnificent appearance like a palace. All the personnel in the society were members, and no outsiders were allowed to enter. Even the constables, rickshaw pullers, tilers, carpenters, tailors, and cooks were all handled by people from the society, like a small world. The inner residence of the head of the society was especially mysterious and magnificent, with dozens of beautiful women, who were the concubines of "Emperor Ma."

In addition to widely recruiting disciples, appointing ministers, and accepting concubines, "Emperor Ma" also arbitrarily changed the calendar, setting one month to forty-eight days and one year to eighteen months. Members all grew their hair and beards, wore tall hats with left-fastening lapels, and were as weird as possible.

It is said that once the Deputy Mayor of the Social Bureau, Director Hu, came to the society to inspect, and happened to encounter a Peach Banquet being held in this palace. Du Hu inquired whose birthday it was, and the deputy head of the society, who was called "Imperial Father-in-Law," replied, "It's the good day of the Wuji Holy Mother." The subjects said it was "Daddy's birthday," and the concubines said it was "Her Majesty's birthday." The answers were completely contradictory, putting these two wise officials in a quandary.

### On Hua Xiren

— Cao Zuohan

The persona of Hua Xiren in *Dream of the Red Chamber* is somewhat like the common archetype of the traitors who have been arrested now.

When she was a maid, she lost her virginity to Bao Erye, which was out of necessity; Mother Jia originally wanted her to take good care of Bao Erye, so she should have yielded. After Bao Erye became a monk, she left the Grand View Garden and the Jia family, and also left her own elder brother and sister-in-law's house, which was also out of necessity, because she did not want to implicate others because of herself. Finally, she married Jiang Yuhan to be a young mistress, which was still out of necessity; how could she lightly brush aside a good intention? In the continued dream of the Red Chamber, it is written that she reunited with Bao Erye, which was probably out of necessity; because of deep affection, one day of love brings a hundred days of kindness, and the Hua girl cannot be an unrighteous wife.

What are the faces of the traitors who are being interrogated now like? Some say: it is because the whip of life is unbearable: this is out of necessity. Some say: it is because of the enemy's kidnapping and coercion, unable to straighten their backs in front of bayonets, this is also out of necessity. Some say that in order not to let the people in the recovered areas suffer, and in order to save people, they plunged into the muddy water, with a compassionate wish and the spirit of "I will not go to hell, who will go to hell," this is even more out of necessity. Some say that they were in the camp of Cao but their heart was in Han, some were Su Wu herding sheep for seven or eight years... In short, becoming a traitor is because it is out of necessity.

Not only is it out of necessity, but they are also doing "underground work"!

The concept of chastity for women in the era of *Dream of the Red Chamber* and the national ideology of modern people are equally important. It is a small matter to starve to death, but a great matter to lose one's chastity. Therefore, Xiren is ultimately a promiscuous woman, she became a traitor to etiquette, and traitors are the scum of humanity, they became traitors to the nation, and they should all be spurned.

The above is a discussion of the two; now let's discuss Xiren specifically.

Speaking of the matter itself, she is also a tragic and pitiful person. First, let's talk about her loss of virginity. The title of the fifth chapter of *Dream of the Red Chamber* boldly reveals "Jia Baoyu First Tries the Joy of Clouds and Rain." This word "try" shows that she was innocently made Bao Erye's love experiment, just for the enjoyment of the young masters, and the Second Master did not have any real feelings for her. However, she herself should at least bear three points of fault for this unfortunate event. Because she knows more about things than Bao Erye, and she seems to have a slight intention of seduction. Beginning lightly, the ending is naturally hasty. The scene of the collapse of the tree and the scattering of the monkeys can be imagined on the evening of the engagement.

The reason why she pleases so much is just like the young ladies in the public house flattering the young masters, and the young ladies in the social scene flirting with the young masters: they are sick with vanity.

Those who pursue vanity will never get vanity, and those who are enthusiastic about vanity will be destroyed by vanity. It is really a rare miracle to be able to get along well with unequal status. Because you are doing your best, and he is still indifferent, when he gives you a little bit of leftovers, you are already flattered. The one who suffers is still the person below. Alas, the disease of vanity cannot be eliminated. It is really helpless, alas, it is really harming many people.

Let's talk about her changing her chastity again. She is not a member of Bao Erye's house, and she has not gone through a clear path. Basically, there is no chastity to keep, which is said from a formal point of view. In essence, the Second Master no longer loves her, so he became a monk, "Since you have no affection, I will also rest," who should she keep chastity for?

So her marriage, as it is said now, is really not worth discussing. What I find strange is that there are quite a few loyal dogs of a family now, and the master may not even treat them as well as Xiren, but they are stern and righteous, with an icy face. I really don't know who they are keeping chastity for? I am afraid it is still for the future job, maybe they want to flatter and seek his favor.

Correction

In the June 12th issue of this column, "Four Poems of Martyrdom by Three Loyalists in the Late Ming Dynasty," the character "屈" (qu, bend) in the sentence "戰關河志未屈" (zhan guan he zhi wei qu, fighting the Guanhai River, the will has not bent) was mistakenly printed as "舒" (shu, extend) by the typesetter. Also, in the annotation, "家玉常乘一黃馬，神駿趨捷，"(Jiayu often rides a yellow horse, divine and swift) the character "神" (shen, divine) was mistaken as "黃" (huang, yellow). Also, the author was Mr. Zhang Baiyuan, which was also omitted. We hereby correct it.

### Banana

— You Xin

I haven't tasted bananas, or even seen the color of bananas, for eight years. This time, I fled to Shanghai from the rear like an escape, and the first time I saw bananas, I had an incredible love for them. Ah! Banana, your color is so lovely yellow, your fragrance is also unparalleled in nature, banana, if I had a lover as beautiful as a flower, I would rather abandon her, I can use all the tenderness of loving her for you. If I had dazzling gold, I would rather exchange it for banknotes to exchange for you. But, banana; I am a poor boy, gold bars have big eyes, it never walks into my pocket.

The day before yesterday, in a fruit store on Nanjing Road, I saw your beautiful face again, banana, I seemed to see your eyeballs staring at me hard, you kept waving to me. My heart was pounding constantly, and my face was flushed. I knew you loved me, I am not grass, trees, iron or stone, the fire of youthful love is burning me so uncomfortably. I secretly took out the banknotes from my pocket with trembling hands. Good heavens! Only one hundred yuan left! I wanted to cry, but I didn't have a drop of tears, but I dare to swear to you, I love you, I will always love you, but I'm afraid I can't afford to buy you!

I did not despair and shyly entered the door of the fruit store. A proud clerk greeted me. He looked me up and down with searching eyes and asked: "

"Sir, what do you want to buy?"

"I want to buy bananas, how much does one cost?" I then asked him.

"At least two hundred yuan, how many do you want to buy?"

"Too small! I don't want to buy them!" I felt that my tone of voice sounded strangely pitiful.

"Small? We have big ones! Are you buying them or not?" He was a little impatient.

"I'm not buying!" I shook my head shamefully, looked at the end of the bunch of bananas one last time, and hurriedly left the store door, heartbroken, only wanting to cry, my eyes seemed to be afraid to open, fearing that someone in this world would see me.

Alas! Goodbye, banana, goodbye for now. Maybe you won't understand me, because I made you feel disappointed. But I still ask for your forgiveness. When I receive my June royalties, I will come to visit again! Goodbye...

### Eating Chili Sauce

— Leng Feng

It is a well-known fact that the monthly income of friends who are civil servants, even the big shots in the bamboo character head class, is far less than that of a rickshaw puller wearing rags. However, this cannot be generalized; because those who always sit in the office only get a fixed salary, which is of course far less than the income of a rickshaw puller; if your job has outside duties, or you are in charge of general affairs and accounting, there is naturally another way to make money, so friends who sit in the office, cannot help but be jealous of these money-making experts. However, this jealousy cannot be a frontal conflict, so what can you do? Friends who hold a pen are somewhat artistic in their way of speaking, so there is the following conversation.

At the dinner table, everyone was picking at a chili sauce dish with their chopsticks. Mr. A spat out a few bones in front of him and said, "How is it that this kitchen is really good at making things, there is no meat in it, I am always eating bones."

Mr. B then said, "You don't have the ability, you can only eat some bones, the meat has already been eaten by others."

Mr. C also said with a smile, "This is too unfair, those who eat meat eat meat, and those who eat bones eat bones."

Mr. D also came to say, "It's not bad that you have some bones to eat. I don't even have the luck to eat bones, I can only find dried tofu."

There were eight people sitting at a table, four of whom said this, and the other four, some pretended not to hear and continued to put white rice in their mouths, and some did not speak, but showed a knowing smile on their faces.

Whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, the whole society is like this.

### Please Open the Bedbug's Mouth and Eat Two Bites of DDT

— Wuling Ren

Ma Weiliang, a lieutenant adjutant of the Receiving Japanese Military Supplies Committee of the Former Third Front Army, forcibly occupied the house of Liang Muru, a Cantonese woman in a garden villa on Huanlong Road, Shanghai, and then topped it off with forty taels of gold; after Liang moved to the Verdun Garden on Yarepe Road, she was again evicted and occupied by Ma, and all her furniture and clothes were occupied, resulting in being sued and detained; Commander Tang ruled that Ma had ruined military discipline and punished him according to the regulations on punishing corruption, and he was tied to Wuxi Station for execution at noon on the 11th. If it is said that killing one to warn a hundred, then I hope to cut off Ma's head and send it to Shanghai first, and show it in the Hongkou area for a few days, and then transport it to Tianjin and Beijing and other places for a tour. Even if there is not much effect, it is good to let the people feel happy.

After being sunk for several years, there are many places of road damage in Shanghai, so when riding a rickshaw on the road, when encountering road damage, you have to twist and avoid it; at first, I thought the rickshaw puller was afraid that the customer could not bear the decadence, so he was especially careful; later I learned that the reason was that the rickshaw company stipulated that if the tires were damaged, the person renting the car would have to pay for the repairs. The twisting and avoiding is only for oneself, and there is no intention to please the customer. But unconsciously, it has already achieved the point of "benefiting others and benefiting oneself".

Four thousand bags of rice from the Hong Kong "General Association" went missing. It is learned that the authorities are investigating everywhere in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and as a result, they have been found in two rice stores. That's good! That's good! The stolen goods are still there, and fortunately they have not been snatched away by the people; if they were snatched away by the refugees, wouldn't they have been divided and eaten long ago, how could they be able to hang up the stolen goods again.

The Chongqing Municipal Health Bureau tested the efficacy of DDT, and used a quilt cloth dipped in DDT to wrap a live bed bug. After two hours of viewing, it was still unharmed. I think it would be better to open the bed bug's mouth and feed it some DDT, and see if it can still survive?

Going to the volcano to find excitement, gambling is also to find excitement, and the result is likely to be ruined and bankrupt; on the contrary, injecting a vaccine can prevent cholera, and it can also be said to be a kind of excitement, why are people afraid and unwilling to get vaccinated?

### In Memory of Mr. Yu Shangyuan

— Cao Bi

Reading Mr. Tao Xiong's "Remembering Mr. Yu Shangyuan" in a Shanghai newspaper, I couldn't help but recall my own impressions: that adorable old man! He must have white hair now.

It wasn't easy for him to manage the drama school for ten years; especially after the school moved to Jiang'an, it was a difficult period. He couldn't find teachers or recruit students. However, despite the harsh environment, he remained optimistic and persevered through the arduous stage in Jiang'an. Such diligence paid off; it created glorious achievements, and soon he received commendation from the education authorities. The school was upgraded to a specialized institution, transforming from a three-year vocational school to a five-year college, truly "deserving of the name!" There was another difficult matter in Jiang'an: everyone clamored to move! In the end, he gave everyone a clever conclusion, saying, "To successfully move, first, we must improve our school." Under this directive, everyone stopped talking about moving and focused on their studies, as if their competition was the Chongqing Opera School in Beibei. As a result, this effort earned victory; the education authorities requested him to move to Beibei and close down the Chongqing Opera School. In order to train even more outstanding talents, he formulated the 'Three-Three System,' dividing into elementary, middle, and advanced levels for a continuous nine years, so that from childhood, they would be imbued with theatrical knowledge, thus training drama talents without bad habits, and correctly achieving the so-called "genius education" goal of drama. I hereby wish him success in this new system.

His success in running the school also came from a spirit of freedom. I think no school was more free than the drama school. Publishing newspapers, holding discussion forums, literary soirees... almost every week, providing students with more opportunities for research, observation, and practice. He was always among the first to arrive at these events, as he considered them just as important as regular classes.

His age was far from ours, but his spirit stood with us. He was unpretentious and easygoing, able to talk to anyone, and everyone was his friend; whether a worker or the Minister of Education. He once said: "Our school doesn't get as much funding as XX school because I can't even sit halfway on a stool when talking to the minister."

His vitality was so strong that wherever he was, he could create a happy environment and joyful events. For example, when watching a play, he would say: "You should learn from me; no matter how bad the play is, you have to appreciate it properly, don't just criticize it with Aristotle's theories at the first touch." Yes, correct criticism should indeed begin with appreciation!

He thought about drama even when smoking. "Pure tobacco leaf" inspired him to invent many "gadgets". For example, "Drama Cakes," which were eaten during the annual Drama Festival, had a comedy mask on them. Eating them felt like eating mooncakes on the Mid-Autumn Festival... And the nationally-implemented performance tax started when he directed "The Inspection Commissioner." In Jiang'an, there were no electric lights, only gas lamps for performances. Because there was no way to control them, he instructed Huang Yuehan, a fourth-term student, to create a lamp controller for gas lamps, which was the "Yuehan Lamp," famous for a time in the theater world. Now, many touring theater groups are imitating the "Yuehan Lamp" for performances in rural areas. Also, when the students were eating too poorly, he thought of "Watching Plays with Goods," and the entrance of the theater was like a vegetable market, piled with "nutrition".

However, he pondered even more deeply about drama, thinking about how to align it with the times. This can be seen from several articles: one is "Sending Drama to the Countryside," and the other is "Sending Drama Back to the Barracks." Consequently, half of the drama school students enlisted in the army, ranking first among all schools nationwide in terms of the proportion of students joining the military.

His knowledge was profound. In his 25-year drama career, he founded the Drama Department of the National Beiping Art School, as well as the Beiping Little Theater and the Chinese Drama Society. He published "Drama Journal," "Crescent Moon," and "Study Literature." He taught at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Jinan University, and Guanghua University. In 1935, he was hired by the Ministry of Education to conduct research in Europe. He also served as the manager of "Crescent Moon Bookstore," and he directed plays such as "The Merchant of Venice," "The Inspection Commissioner," "Othello," and "The Wild Duck." He wrote plays such as "The Statue" and "Military Mutiny," and he translated "The Admirable Crichton." He also wrote "Notes on Conversations with Gordon Craig and Stanislavski," and he acted in "Oppression." He has such accomplishments, perhaps because he studied at Carnegie University and Columbia University in the United States. However, he honestly told us: "During his studies, he had to borrow light from the latrine to study hard."

But now he is busy with administration all day, and he barely has time to read the newspaper.

Mr. Shangyuan is forty-nine years old this year, with white hair, but he still spares no effort for drama education. He said that the purpose of living is for the sake of future generations. He sees students as his children, who will continue his drama career. He believes that "the meaning of life lies in creating succeeding lives in the universe," which is his life philosophy. In his study, he always carries a hanging scroll, which he often gazes at, and often recites with a smile:

"Love the country, love drama, love the alma mater, love classmates!"

### General Review of Shanghai Spoken Drama, Part Two

— Guan Yu

Four. "Story of a Mountain City"

This is a play performed by the Hard Work Theater Troupe. The director of this play is the same director as "Model of All Teachers," and the playwright is also the same playwright as "Model of All Teachers." Two of the actors are also from "Model of All Teachers." Therefore, it makes us wonder why its completeness and seriousness are not the same as "Model of All Teachers." The acting of the actors is also not as uniform as "Model of All Teachers." This may be because the director did not seriously take responsibility, or perhaps there was no connection between the actors. Therefore, a few of the actors stand out.

The most satisfying actor is Ma Xiaonong playing Aunt Mo. The most obvious scene that we can specifically point out is: after Cai Hongshan sent Xiang Tianhe to the warehouse, he called Guan Dayuan again. Lizhu knew that Xiang Tianhe would be caught, so she bribed Aunt Mo to chase him back. As soon as she left, Cai Hongshan came to look for her. Because she was not there, he asked Aunt Mo. Aunt Mo was counting the money that Lizhu gave her. As soon as she saw Cai coming, she quickly hid the money behind her back. At first, she did not say anything, but stammered. Later, because Cai took out a pistol to threaten her, she panicked and told him that Lizhu had gone to the warehouse. As soon as Cai Hongshan heard this, he chased after her. Only then was Aunt Mo relieved and started counting her money, and she showed the eighteen yuan that Lizhu gave Tianhe. Here, she was secretly paying attention to Lizhu, showing her panic when she saw Cai Hongshan's pistol, her hesitation when Lizhu gave her money, her hesitation when Cai asked her, and finally the joy of counting the money. She expressed all of them well, and completely grasped the character of this short-sighted and unintelligent woman and created the outer shape.

Secondly, Shi Hui playing Cai Hongshan, being able to act out all his ruthlessness, is also not an easy thing. For example, he wrote a check to Xiang Tianhe, but Tianhe refused it, so he was furious. He suddenly raised his voice in anger, and in the midst of turning around, he slapped the piano board with his palm. This made his anger and the atmosphere of the rich man come to life. Afterwards, because of Lizhu's persuasion, he said when he walked to the door:

"Think about it, the check is here." This scene can be said to be the most wonderful part of the whole play.

Again, there is Shen Yang who plays Han Er. This character is a young master from a scholarly family in the past, but now he is a down-and-out man who can't do anything. He only knows how to play the flute, drink wine, and play with potted plants. Perhaps he liked to play with watches when he was young, so he can still repair watches now. When he is drunk, he will also act crazy. He is completely a self-proclaimed elegant person and an upper-class person who has been poisoned. Because of this, he has become a useless person in society. Shen Yang grasped these parts and brought his entire excellent acting skills into play. He brought this kind of character vividly before the audience. For example, he is afraid of Xiang Shouzhi. When he is drunk, he wants Shouzhi to play with potted plants with him, but Shouzhi accidentally breaks the potted plant. This is the thing he cherishes the most. Even if someone offered him a high price of 100,000, he would not sell it. Now that it is broken, he does not dare to quarrel with Shouzhi, but shouts and walks outside. Coincidentally, he is hit by a car and brought back. Shen Yang completely controlled this character, consistently without being excessive or insufficient in any way, and acted it out.

Other actors are also very competent, but it is a pity that the level is not uniform enough.

Among the performances of Hard Work, this play can be compared with "Jin Xiaoyu."

Five. "Thunderstorm"

This script has been out for almost twenty years, and it is called a life-saving play. No matter which theater troupe is losing money and cannot continue to support itself, as long as it performs it, it can continue to exist. I remember when I was in Anshun County, Guizhou last year, the Guofeng Theater Troupe of the Military Medical School lost money in two performances. The person in charge was very anxious because the performance fees for both performances were advanced by the government and had to be repaid when they were due. Later, someone suggested performing "Thunderstorm." Sure enough, this play not only recovered the money lost, but also had surplus money to do the next performance. Therefore, I am even more convinced that "Thunderstorm" is a life-saving play.

"Thunderstorm," which is currently being performed at the Grand Theater in Shanghai, is not an official public performance by that theater troupe, but a group of famous actors gathered together for a blitzkrieg.

There is no director's name in the performance of this play, nor are there words such as collective director. Looking at the performance, the background of the dance and the movement of the actors are indeed terribly bad!

In the scenery, we can clearly see many drawn lines and shapes. Therefore, it makes us feel very fake.

Among the actors, the one who is least able to show the character is the one who plays Zhou Chong. He is wearing a double-breasted modern suit and white shoes with black trim. Just from these, he is not a Zhou Chong. Secondly, Zhou Ping is a pale and weak person, but the actor's agile movements and loud voice give us a character who is not Zhou Ping. And the actor who plays Lu Gui is showing off a little trick here, causing laughter from the audience. What is most strange is that in the third act, when Lu Dahai asks him for money to return to Zhou Chong, the actor says the three sentences of "No, no, no, give." in the same tone and the same voice. This naturally caused laughter from the audience, but it is not very suitable for the character. I seem to remember that the script did not have these words.

The actresses are much more serious than the actors. They did not play any small tricks in the play. However, there are also more serious actors among the male actors, that is, Qiao Qi, who plays Zhou Puyuan.

This script seems to have been changed a lot. These changes are for the performers to cater to the audience's low-level interests. But it only damages part of the script. The original

This play is quite successful commercially, but there are many problems with its artistic achievement. In a nutshell, commercial success cannot make up for one ten-thousandth of the artistic failure. In the performance, besides the script, there is only the actors' magic weapon. So some people say: this performance is just "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own divine powers." These divine powers are not noble acting, but low-level tricks. But it cannot be denied that only a few actors are more serious!

Six. "The New Official Takes Office"

This play was formerly named "Demons Dance in Chaos," and it was published in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Because the current political stage has such bad behavior of officials, this play has not lost its meaning and timeliness. It describes an empty city under the control of the enemy, where a group of rogues and ruffians pretend to be new officials to take office. The style after taking office is to oppress the people and sell prohibited goods. As a result, the people attacked the city and captured them alive.

In the play, Chen Wanxing seduces Liu Dianyuan's concubine, Aunt Sun, in the first scene. Therefore, in the last scene, Aunt Sun tells Chen Wanxing the news that Liu Dianyuan is selling arms, which causes the two sides to turn against each other, causing Liu Dianyuan to kill Aunt Sun, and Chen Wanxing to move a bayonet. The cause and effect of this section is only briefly outlined in the first act of the script, and Chen Wanxing and Aunt Sun's affairs are not clarified in the other acts. And the director did not bring them together in the position to imply the relationship between the two sides. Therefore. It is very incredible to say that Aunt Sun leaked the news, which may be the director's negligence.

Among the actors, the image captured by Zong You is relatively obvious: wearing a fire-colored jacket without buttoning it, or hanging the jacket on his arm, inserting a long folding fan into his collar, and holding a birdcage in his hand, he looks like a rogue. However, the tone of speech is a bit slow, as if it is too "gentle".

Luo Yu, who plays Little Cabbage, can act out the "I don't care" look of a prostitute without leaving a trace. When she is quiet, she seems too lazy to move; when she is moving, she immediately waves her hands aggressively and fights with Aunt Sun. When Liu Er wants to molest her, she simply pulls open her collar and exposes her chest for the other party to stab. These actions vividly outline the character of a prostitute and introduce it to the audience. It really brings this character to life.

Fang Bo plays Chen Wanxing. The first point that can be praised is: he is a fat actor, but he did not use his appearance to use a bad low-level humorous trick to attract the audience, but seriously used his noble performance to make the audience pay attention to him. He plays a butcher in the play. He only wears a set of old Xiangyun yarn short jacket and pants, barefoot in shoes, and holds a banana fan in his hand. This appearance already looks like a butcher who is resting. The flirtation with Aunt Sun in the first act does not make us feel bad. This is his stage ethics and the performance of not playing low-level humor. The fight in the last act is not delayed by his obesity, so we feel very real. This fat actor cannot be compared with those actors in the past who only knew how to play low-level tricks but did not know acting skills, and only relied on their appearance to play with the audience.

The cast of this play is relatively uniform. Although it cannot be said how uniform the performance is, it is quite acceptable. The actors also have their own characteristics, but it is not personal development.

The morality of actors lies in making the performance complete, rather than making themselves stand out beyond other actors.

### Zhang Yiyun Will Return North Soon

— Deng Gong

No Performance in Shanghai

Famous Kunqu opera actress Zhang Yiyun came to Shanghai this time to visit her maternal grandmother and participated in the charity performance for the Northeast at the Tianchan Stage, which was well received. The actress told reporters backstage at Tianchan that she does not intend to perform in Shanghai and will return north soon. Zhang Yiyun is the younger sister of Du Yun, one of the four great Kunqu opera actresses. She was very popular in performances in Pingjin. This time, she came to Shanghai but did not perform, which will surely disappoint many opera fans.

### Film Criticism: "Song of the Marines"

— Zhu Xi

It is said that this is a good film that once caused a sensation in the wartime capital, and it is also said that it is adapted from a famous American film and drama. However, after watching it, I cannot see its merits. Now I would like to say a few words about this film from an artistic point of view. This film has very little drama. Only a few places are good: (1) The soldiers who participated in the First World War now see the Second World War again, and also see the barracks they used to live in. One person even hums the old song from that year... At the same time, watching their sons also repeat their tasks one by one. (2) The descendants also have military band opera performances, and the previous generations assist and supervise the stage work of the descendants. When a few old men are jumping on the stage, and their wives and children are watching from the audience, it really gives a good effect.

In addition to these two points, when Katie Smith sings "God Bless America," several family-to-family shots are quite active. However, compared with the section in "Jia Hui Liang Yuan" where "I think I'm in love" is sung, it is far worse.

Using men to impersonate women in military performances is a fact and is filmed in the movie. The first effect is not bad, but if he repeatedly uses it at all costs, then the effect will gradually decrease.

It is always good to see a large-scale military exercise on stage once, but if you see it twice, you will lose interest. This is the same principle as the previous one. Although its background is often changed, the stationary background drawn here can only give people a joy of one or two yarn clocks, and the remaining other parts often give people an ordinary impression.

I don't understand why the director made this play so closely guarded within the scope of the stage. It is simply putting the camera stand under the stage and shooting towards the stage. When there is a scene of actors on the stage, he also stops, and waits for the scenery to be changed before shooting again, so that the audience is watching a movie, but they still feel like they are watching a stage play.

The insertion of President Roosevelt and General Marshall watching the play is also an arrangement to enhance "adapting to the American people's hearts." However, it uses a long shot - a substitute - about this point, I think even Americans are very disappointed. In fact, for this type of film, as long as the publicity is effective, it is not impossible to even invite President Roosevelt to join a shot.

The play is also very flat in terms of arrangement. The front part uses subtitles a lot. Although this can give the audience a "antique" feeling, the supervisor should never forget that making the audience bored is more important than any other problem. Replaying a movie from thirty years ago is definitely not something that can be welcomed by the public.

The whole play lacks climax.

Joan Leslie's role is of no importance. The question of whether to marry or not seems to be somewhat contradictory. I believe that most American men are definitely not so insightful that they would not care about marrying their lovers because of war. So why use Ronald Reagan and Joan Leslie to overthrow this question? If a woman is used as a soldier's lover in a play, there are many usages, why decide on this kind of small writing?

In terms of scenery, it is good on stage, but it seems to be not enough in the movie. There are a few scenes that are meaningless, and it is not a pity to have a few less. The scene of the sailor standing in front of the ship is the most wonderful.

In terms of actors, George's performance on stage after several injuries is good. Other actors, Ronald Reagan, Alan Hale, etc. are all average.

In short, this play can be a sensation in the United States, but not in our country, especially in Shanghai after the war.

### Distant Love

— Yu Fu

The Second New Film of China Electric Second Factory

Under the leadership of Xu Suya, the Second Factory of the Central Film Studio has completed Wu Yonggang's "Loyal Family," which will soon be seen by audiences in this city. The authorities of the China Electric Second Factory saw that foreign films were flooding the market and a large amount of foreign exchange was flowing out, so they wanted to actively produce films to resist foreign films. Therefore, after completing the work of "Loyal Family," they immediately started the work of the second new film "Distant Love."

"Distant Love" is written and directed by Chen Liting, and the actors include Zhao Dan, Qin Yi, Wu Yin, Zhang Yan, etc.

This is a historical narrative film. The entire play takes sixteen years. From the female protagonist A Ling being a nanny, to A Zhen being educated, becoming a professor's wife, participating in the nursing work of the January 28th Shanghai Incident, and then participating in the battlefield service of August 13th, until she returns and leaves her husband when the Anti-Japanese War is won.

In this film, the playwright tells us: the social environment and the influence of characters will make a person decide the way of life in the future, whether it is great or small!

The story of the film begins with:

In the winter of 1929, Professor Xiao Yuanxu gave a lecture at the Shanghai Women's Progressive Association. Because it took too long, his lover Zhu Manli became impatient and broke up with him unhappily. Professor Xiao Yuanxu therefore wanted to create an ideal wife himself. Therefore, the young nanny in his family became his target.

Professor Xiao passed on his knowledge to A Zhen, so that A Zhen was no longer a nanny, but "a modern Miss Yu." Under the influence of Miss Wu, the person in charge of the Women's Progressive Association, she participated in women's work, which made her know many female workers who lived a hard life. At the same time, her brother was bullied by the Japanese and ran away from the factory to become a soldier. Her father was also too poor to live.

### A Strange Tale from New York

— Feng Chang

This film is very good, composed of several short segments; in my overall rating, it should be a "B+". It has a strong dramatic flavor, and is more lively and brilliant than "Flesh and Spirit."

The entire film consists of five segments. The first is delicate, the second is light and cheerful, the third is the most profound, making you shed tears amidst laughter. The fourth cannot quite carry on the momentum from the previous segment, and the fifth is the conclusion, which can comfortably relax your tense heart.

The main character of the film is a large formal dress. Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Ginger Rogers, and others are supporting actors, but they are extraordinarily well-cast, and each can satisfy more than your needs.

Among the "good" aspects, to pick out the best, it is still the two Charleses and Ginger Rogers.

I originally intended to review this film in this newspaper, but due to time constraints, I will first provide a brief introduction here, and then give a more detailed review in another newspaper.

### A Discussion on Stage Technology

— Wen Quan

Three: The Symbolism of Color

The symbolism of color arises from history, customs, and religion, which over thousands or hundreds of years, have become almost fixed, evoking certain emotions and associations in people. Understanding this reflection and association of historical emotions allows us to use the power of various color symbols in stage sets as we desire. This not only expresses the special mood of a particular play, preparing appropriate emotions for the characters, but also gives the scenery an unexpected and mysterious vitality, supporting a higher artistic value for the drama. The symbolism of each color is listed below:

1. Bright Red: Symbolizes bloodshed, tragedy, danger, destruction, crime, bravery, stubbornness, revenge, anger, passion, greed, great sound, patriotism, piety, purity, nobility, splendor, emphasis, and creativity.

2. Pink: Symbolizes truth, love, beauty, shyness, health, and bewilderment.

3. Scarlet: Symbolizes patriotism, beauty, honor, anger, and blood.

4. Crimson: Symbolizes sincerity, universal love, hatred, struggle, violence, elegance, generosity, and beauty.

5. Dark Red: Symbolizes submission, dignity, monotony, inferiority, poverty, autumn, and monks.

6. Orange and Amber: Symbolizes wild laughter, lightheartedness, vitality, happiness, contentment, richness, autumn, warmth, and fire.

7. Bright Yellow: Symbolizes gold, sunlight, brightness, nobility, gentleness, brilliance, wealth, royalty, harvest, peace, solemnity, indulgence, and jealousy.

8. Brown: Symbolizes submission, rest, concentration, slowness, sorrow, maturity, dullness, fullness, deceit, transience, and clumsiness.

9. Blackish-Yellow: Symbolizes disease, destruction, deceit, cowardice, jealousy, transience, and clumsiness.

10. Yellow-Green: Symbolizes peace, youth, happiness, harvest, sweetness, kisses, vitality, love, and dance.

11. Bright Green: Symbolizes youth, vitality, innocence, faith, young people, immaturity, non-stimulation, hope, peace, plans, victory, eternity, smiles, success, and health.

12. Light Blue: Symbolizes silence, mystery, ideals, poetry, repression, sorrow, submission, distance, aloofness, coldness, faith, holiness, pity, immaturity, loneliness, and comfort.

13. Bright Blue: Symbolizes greatness, calmness, tranquility, mystery, expansiveness, affirmation, truth, stability, solemnity, sorrow, hope, love, loyalty, faithfulness, silence, eternity, calmness, success, winter, and lack of sympathy.

14. Dark Blue: Symbolizes amiability, humility, coldness, sorrow, and profundity.

15. Purple: Symbolizes hope, love, splendor, and sincerity.

16. Bluish-Purple: Symbolizes love, truth, calmness, sorrow, and sadness.

17. Faint Purple: Symbolizes beauty, elegance, old age, and slight sorrow.

18. Reddish-Purple: Symbolizes royalty, warmth, solemnity, composure, stimulation, calmness, submission, richness, joy, and nobility.

19. Black: Symbolizes lowness, devils, evil, magic, death, widows, frustration, monks, despair, faults, sorrow, seriousness, and mystery.

20. White: Symbolizes sacrifice, humility, simplicity, integrity, truth, light, peace, innocence, chastity, beauty, weakness, gods, angels, ghosts, the Holy Mother, female saints, wise men, death, and terror.

21. Gray: Symbolizes storms, cunning, coldness, severity, old age, plainness, faithfulness, secrets, calmness, tranquility, sorrow, worry, stillness, seclusion, gloom, frustration, desolation, poverty, decline, silence, and dullness.

The moods and various special characteristics symbolized by these colors must be determined according to the different occasions when they are selected, in order to determine the different effects they express. In other words, the same hue will have different meanings in different dramatic contexts. For example, if red is used as the color of a living room wall, we feel a passionate mood. In another play, when red light is projected onto the war scenery and characters, we feel hatred and bloodshed. Therefore, we know that light, color, and dyeing alone do not have fixed symbolic meanings. The expression of its symbolic meaning must be combined with a certain plot, characters, and scenery. Conversely, only in this way can the audience accurately grasp its symbolic power. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn (Essays)

### Three Notes on Reading Paintings

— Wen Zhaotong

Yi De arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing via the Northwest. After about a week, today, taking advantage of the opportunity to teach at the Art Academy, I had a long talk with him and asked him to display his works. I was able to view more than fifty sketches he had made over the past four years, traveling through Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and other provinces, and to see the true face of his meticulously crafted masterpieces, following the path of artistic development.

Last October, he said in a letter to me:

"...Artistic inclinations are gradually abandoning the old and pursuing progress. In the past two years, I have made watercolors and sketches in the Southeast, mostly with real life as the subject matter. I once lived for a week on Xihua Mountain in Dayu, Jiangxi, to depict the lives of miners. This summer, I lived with people in a factory for a month, depicting their work. Recently, I have been using these sketches as themes, shutting myself in my room every day to create large-scale oil paintings..."

From these words, I was filled with anticipation for his works full of reality. Unfortunately, this time, due to the arduous journey, he only brought these watercolor and sketch pieces, and the large oil paintings will have to wait until the National Art Academy moves east.

Although they are only some watercolor and sketch pieces, we can know for sure how Yi De wants to express reality. The small landscape paintings make us feel not only tranquility and leisure, but also an epitome of the hard lives of the masses, a duet of stillness and movement. Like "Soldier Picking Up Stones," "Banks of the Jialing River," and "Xihua Mountain," we deeply feel the highly expressive effect of art in which content and form are unified, under the solidity and reality of the modeling sense, and the emphasis and unity of the picture.

Also the sketches, we only feel the strength and density of the lines, and from the composition of these lines, we obtain a perfect and real sense of modeling.

Artists should experience life in the ranks of the masses, otherwise their works will not be true and touching.

I already published an article "Liu Shi's Fish Exhibition" the day before yesterday. Today, after attending the reception tea party hosted by Hai Weng for his book exhibition and rereading his works, I would like to write a few more thoughts below.

Shi Zi is a Western painter, sculptor, and arts and crafts artist. He is a successful writer who has passed through various departments of modeling art with extraordinary talent. It is not surprising that he began studying ink and wash paintings with light colors during the Anti-Japanese War. This is just another aspect of artistic expression.

Shi Zi's works are mainly fish, and these fish are not identical in form. Moreover, he can express the floating and transparent character of water on thin rice paper, which is considered precious by ordinary Chinese painters.

The creation of Chinese art must find a way out on the path of unifying content and form, but the exploration of perfect descriptive techniques is absolutely not negligible. Only content without form will result in propagandistic, record-like, and explanatory works, and the value of art will be completely absent.

It must also be noted that in terms of technique, general Chinese paintings are often拘泥于占人, rigidly adhering to the established methods of past masters, either Song or Yuan. When discussing landscapes, it is Jing Guan Dong Ju, when talking about flowers and birds, it is Qing Teng Bai Yang. These established methods often restrict a writer. Li Cheng said: "Learning from past masters is not as good as learning from nature." This is a major revelation to break through this inherited tradition. Shi Zi's works have already been able to express the acceptance of this major revelation.

During the Anti-Japanese War, many artists shifted the content of their creations to the real lives of the people in the rear, using simple equipment to make faithful depictions. Wu Zuoren, whose painting exhibition will be held from the 16th, is taking such a path.

Zuoren spent almost more than two years walking through Qinghai, Tibet, Xikang, Gansu and other provinces. In that vast and remote place, there are primitive production tools and means of production, primitive dances, primitive decorations, as well as the realistic mood of nomadic life, high mountains, large deserts, camels, ice and snow, cowhide rafts, tents... The realities that cannot be seen in the water towns of Jiangnan are all depicted in Zuoren's works.

Zuoren mostly uses the so-called watercolor painting techniques to depict, although it is only a light and thin layer of color, it produces extremely harmonious contrasts, especially in the costumes of the Kang and Tibetan peoples, with eastern simple, original decorative color tones. Those who have not been to the Northwest may not be able to imagine it.

From his few sketches, we can again feel the depth of his realistic skill. In the light and agile lines, the reality of reality is grasped without omission. If not, then the colored works would never be so real.

The content of artworks should be expanded in scope, and from Zuoren's many paintings, every writer living in a small room will gain an inspiration.

### The Singing Girl by the An'an River (Novel)

— Zhang Luo

On a sultry summer evening, after a thunderstorm, a beautiful rainbow woven of red, blue, green, and purple appeared in the sky above the Xin'an River, arching across the northeast edge of the sky.

White clouds danced in the mountains, lovingly swallowing and spitting out the sun; the clouds moved away, and the sunlight that suddenly revealed itself was so fierce, unnatural, and unable to be looked at directly.

The trees on both banks were like they had been drenched with basin water, the dense and fresh leaves dripping with beads of water, dripping into the tangled grass.

The small fish in the river became even more lively, cluster after cluster, wandering on the water, under the moss, and in the crevices of the rocks.

At the east end, the small apprentices in Yao's teahouse were arguing, and behind the mountain, the bugle call of the troops rang out...

After dinner, the big, round, bright moon had already sat on the treetop. W, H, Mr. and I sat leisurely on the lawn, listening to Liu's boasting about his romantic anecdotes. Suddenly, that clear and melancholy singing voice of a young girl, supported by the fragmented huqin, resounded again on the banks of the Xin'an River.

"Let's take a stroll—" the northerner Liu suggested. So everyone stood up, patted the mud off their pants, and walked towards the riverbank.

Since that day, the old ferryman had been rowing that fair young singing girl with long eyelashes, big eyes, and dark skin, and a middle-aged woman who was also a琴手 (qin player) across the river to us. Since that day, whenever the moon rose, there would be singing on the banks of the Xin'an River—sometimes it lingered suddenly to the west, and sometimes it was parked on the pebble beach on the riverbank.

Ten or so small stools were arranged in a circle on the pebble beach, with the audience sitting around; they sipped tea to quench their thirst, waved their palm-leaf fans to cool off, and squinted their eyes and listened intently. The young girl, with two braids, wearing a bamboo cloth cheongsam, was surrounded in the middle, her face raised to the sky, singing laboriously, the woman's clumsy fingers rising and falling on the strings.

The moonlight caressed the audience, and also caressed the singing girl. In the distance, it seemed that fog was rising in the forest. On the other side of the river, the old ferryman untied the rope and turned the boat's head to row over here.

More than twenty pairs of eyes stared greedily at the singing girl, worry and fear engraved on her face, and her singing voice became hesitant and trembling...

The surroundings were a kind of oppression to her!

The singing voice was buried in the applause, and then escaped from the applause again. Everyone listened with great interest, one song after another.

"Hey! Tell them not to leave after they finish listening, wait for everyone to leave and then we..." Platoon Leader Liu had a sudden idea, twisted my ear and said. After a while, I conveyed this opinion to everyone.

...

In the first month of the new year,

I take my little sister to see the lanterns,

Seeing the lanterns is just an excuse, sister;

Flirting is the real intention...

Platoon Leader Liu was panting beside him...

The moon was in the middle of the sky, and sleepiness quietly came, leaning against the chair, holding the pot, waving the fan weakly, dragging their tired bodies, the audience staggered back, even yawning.

The girl sat down, counted the money again, handed it to the woman, then propped her cheek with one hand, and sighed facing the moon—what a pale complexion!

The woman actually started nodding off...

Only the six of us were left on the banks of the Xin'an River?

"...You on my behalf..." the northerner stammered to everyone, no one was willing to accept this mission, although everyone understood his request.

In the end, he went up by himself.

"Old lady..." the northerner turned back with embarrassment, looking at us shyly. We immediately retreated to the trees in the distance, watching the progress of this "?" play.

The northerner gesticulated and chattered with the woman for a long time. In addition to being surprised, the woman seemed hesitant and embarrassed. Seeing her go over and ask the singing girl in her ear, the singing girl kept shaking her head. The woman spoke again to her ear...

"Advance!" W君 (Mr. W) whispered the order, so the four of us crawled lightly forward like a night raid, stopping under a big tree behind them, holding our breaths.

"Two thousand yuan, right?"

"Sir, things are too expensive, you still care about two thousand yuan..."

"Two thousand yuan is not a small amount!"

"You really can't buy anything..."

"Then forget it!"

"Sir, do a good deed...add a thousand yuan!"

"Two thousand, take it or leave it!"

"Sir..." The woman glanced at the singing girl. "Sir, can't you add any more?..."

"Hmm!"

"Okay—then!..." The woman lowered her face.

The platoon leader scooped a handful from his waist and handed it to the woman. By the moonlight, the woman carefully counted the bills one by one with trembling hands. The newly printed banknotes rustled...

The platoon leader walked over and pulled up the girl sitting on the ground. The woman stopped all her actions and stared blankly.

"Let's go to the field over there..." The platoon leader said draggingly, pulling at her and wanting to leave.

"Mom!" She suddenly turned around as if she was going to pounce on her mother, her hands outstretched toward her mother for help, making a tragic, desperate cry like a criminal making a last struggle before execution.

"...My mother's reply flowed out with tears, and my nose tingled...;

"Mom!"

"Poor...child..." "Mom, you also..."

"Good son, I can't…"

"Mom, I'm scared!"

"It's...okay, sir, is very good..."

The platoon leader carried her forward, the girl was trapped in the platoon leader's strong arms, and followed staggeringly朝西邊曠野里奔去, towards the wilderness in the west, and gradually the two disappeared into the mist...

### A Smile of Empathy

— Song Mengqin

Mr. T and Miss S each occupied a corner of the sofa, flipping through the pages of books. They picked up factory management, put down accounting, picked out commercial psychology, and then put down factory management. Every two or three pages they read, or perhaps two or three articles they flipped through, T would invariably unconsciously peel open a piece of candy, or a lychee, and send it to S's hand, and then he himself would hastily pick up a Camel, after all, his grades still had some authority, and their love talk was temporarily put on hold.

A burst of hurried, staggered footsteps came from the corridor, and they knew that it must be Mr. C and his fiancée Miss G who were coming. So T and S perked up.

"You guys are suffering!" C said with a smile, taking off his light green sunglasses.

"Are you all prepared?" T was prompted by a kind of hope in his heart to ask this question. He would only be satisfied if the other party gave a contrary answer.

"Annoying, I can't go see 'Little Women'!" G's words lightly escaped from her peachy, pouting lips.

"Are you talking about preparing books? Sorry, can books give me any security? We made a mistake by studying business administration. Look, the strange phenomena in the city are just that coffins don't need to be shipped from America. When we actually manage industry and commerce, how many factories and companies will still exist?" C was sighing and complaining, not knowing whether it was for the public or for himself or for tomorrow's exam, forcing himself to be brave.

"It's over, it's over. China is simply over. Hopeless..." T sighed deeply.

"Even the only trace of industrial breath is being suffocated. It's over. What are we talking about revival? Industrial bankruptcy directly affects the economy. Economic bankruptcy is more dangerous than political turmoil. How can we get through this!" C said while swallowing the iced orange juice that the servant of S's mansion had sent, his worries deepened, and some angry enthusiasm was expressed in his eyes. Then he said to S:

"Miss, make two fewer linen dresses, the motherland's crisis is at hand."

"Damn it! You're finding fault with me. Only ghosts use glass braces!" S just said this but stuck out her tongue and looked back at T, and luckily T was wearing Chinese clothes today, so she continued, but her eyes turned to Miss C:

"Miss, buy two fewer pairs of glass leather shoes, the motherland's crisis is at hand." Everyone burst into laughter, and in this continuous laughter, Miss G's sharp and tender tone floated out:

"Okay! Tomorrow we will start gathering comrades to revive China's industry and commerce. We must start working!" T's emotions were very enthusiastic, and he threw the half-smoked cigarette and the book of commercial psychology on the carpet. And he added an old tune that was both true and false:

"We must proceed, with a broad vision and start with small steps!"

"That's right, a broad vision and start with small steps!"

"Of course, a broad vision and start with small steps!"

The four of them shouted loudly, as if industrial and commercial interests had already started to be revived by them.

However, T was a little tired of this issue, and the issue of the Dragon Boat Festival gift for S was secretly stirring in his mind. But this should be forgiven for him. S's gifts always required him to plan with all his heart, yet he could hardly satisfy her.

Suddenly C started singing loudly. And his body was propelled off the sofa by that singing voice. He sang:

"Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth..."

The three of them couldn't help but join in, and the air became more lively.

"Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth, sells cloth to buy rice, there's food for the stomach.

Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth,

The little brother's pants are torn, there's no cloth to mend them.

Sister-in-law weaves cloth, brother sells cloth, who buys cloth, the wealthy man in the next village.

Homespun cloth is sparse, foreign cloth is fine,

Foreign cloth is cheap, the wealthy man is happy.

No one wants homespun cloth, the brother and sister-in-law starve!"

"Ah! The decline of the rural economy, the bankruptcy of family handicraft industry, the capitalists are making trouble with money, the forces of foreign goods are rampant... This song writes about modern China..." C may have been too excited, and therefore could not think of a suitable word to describe China, so he could only sigh for a while to end this speech.

They seemed to have a common feeling that "it's getting late," so the four of them had the intention of going out. Miss S had already arranged to go to Avenue Joffre with T at four o'clock, so she told the servant: "Tell Madam when she returns that Mr. T and I have gone out."

They walked out of the gate at the same time, but two went east and two went west, and they said goodbye to each other.

When T and S passed through Rue Mairesse and entered the Grigorieff Company, they saw C and G selecting colors in the linen display department. When eight eyes met unintentionally, each gave the other a smile of empathy.

### Miscellaneous Writings

— Shu Sun Ruying

In today's society, competence is almost synonymous with being slick and dishonest, while honesty has practically become a disadvantage. If you want to survive, you have to disregard the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, and morality that you've received, even though you still need to pay lip service to those teachings, using them to lecture your children or deceive those with whom you have a vested interest.

In the past, I was young and naive—today, I'm still young, but I'm slowly moving away from naivete. My naive heart once made me believe in the teachings of books, the teachings that elders earnestly imparted; but today, as naivete fades away, I feel bewildered. I don't know how to live—how to earn money to support myself, how to develop myself as a person, this personality, this mind full of thoughts.

Based solely on my meager income as a public school employee, I cannot support myself and my small family. To seek other opportunities for development? I can't, because I'm not competent. I'm already busy enough for eight hours a day in the office, where would I have any remaining energy? Perhaps this incompetence of mine is just that I'm not slick and dishonest? Not being slick and dishonest means being too honest, and being too honest is a disadvantage. With this enormous disadvantage, I've forfeited my right to exist in this stubborn society.

Unable to live on, yet I still live on. Of course, I'm not eating my fill, but I'm not starving to death either. I live like this. Living, besides being busy with life, is also about thinking. My mind still has the capacity to think, which must be considered a blessing. I hope that everything will get better, that the darkness will eventually pass. I think about why we live at all? Why do we allow life to continue? If today's situation never changes, or if it changes but becomes even worse, then we humans should all go on strike. Let my hands go on strike, my mouth go on strike, my circulatory system, my respiratory system go on strike, let our minds go on strike, thinking go on strike. Let life stop, let existence stop. However, that day will not come, life must continue, because we still have hope.

Our hope has existed in the minds of our ancestors. This hope exists in the heart of every person. But you alone cannot reach this ideal state; to reach this ideal state, all of humanity must move in unison. But humanity's pace cannot be unified, at least that is certainly the case today. Thus, some are called competent, while others are called slick and dishonest, some are called honest, while others are called useless. In short, this is a fantastical world, inexplicable and yet needing no explanation.

I resent today, and yet I also praise today. Because tomorrow can only be reached by passing through today. However, on the road, never lose the hope that makes our heads ache.

June 9th, in Hongkou

### Dark Night

— Yang Zhifu

I opened my eyes, and a pitch-black world suddenly appeared before me, and it seemed like I was the only person in this world, and all the darkness's advancements were directed towards me: moreover, besides the faint breathing sound next to me, this world seemed unimaginably deathly silent... Usually, no matter what time it is, as long as you open your ears and wake up, the docks will always emit some miscellaneous human voices or the sound of a wave crashing. I don't know how long the entire long night has passed, but the clock on the wall is striking three, telling me that it is almost dawn.

I often think this way, I need light, I cannot live in a dark environment for even a moment. But now, reality forces me to have this completely different thought, facing this dark world, I have strange feelings, my thoughts are filled with conflicting feelings of seeking light and hating darkness, and all kinds of strange ideas also seem to know my weakness, invading my mind, making my restless heart even more agitated.

Gradually, my thoughts entered a state of confusion, I experienced some of life's pains, and I also heard some cries of life: "Comrades, do not groan,

We must grit our teeth!

Thick and long iron chains,

Bind us into one heart.

We advance through the darkness,

We advance towards dawn!"

I saw, millions of women, children, the old, and the weak ended their wandering lives and returned to their desolate homes, but before they could even find their footing, they fled from their own homes again, resuming their wandering lives, running around in the streets. I also saw countless corpses of the starved lying in deserted streets and alleys, some even still moving their mouths, sustaining their last bit of life, waiting for death... My entire heart was occupied by tragic scenes, I couldn't suppress my burning feelings, and tears crawled itchingly down my face, falling onto the pillow.

A few minutes later, I got up and lit the lamp, drove away the darkness in the room, and opened a not-too-old newspaper, hoping to reduce my uneasy emotions with it, but just as I lowered my head, a similar scene unfolded before my eyes again:

"To ××, we visited the disaster in ×× village, ×× village has 24,000 people, it is said that 20,000 people have no food to eat. The villagers ran over from the rubble, kneeling by the road begging us, "Lord Heaven! Please save us!" Tears rolled down along the eye sockets. They live in thatched sheds built on scorched wasteland, eating tree bark and grass roots – ground ivy, kudzu root, *Elaeocarpus* bark, *Potentilla freyniana*, goosewort, fern root, and also bran and wheat husks..." Below were some blurred and sad words "Selling their own children... After selling the son, the wife jumped into the water..."

I raised my head, unable to bear to read any further, at the same time, my heart also felt a stinging pain, this is the truth, what else can I say! I can only close my eyes and remain silent!

Suddenly, the clock on the wall struck two more times than before, and faint rays of light gradually penetrated through the cracks in the window. So, I knew that the dark night was nearing its end, followed by the fresh dawn! I opened the window sash, welcoming it with a confused mood.

Light is such a noble possession to me! Day has broken, who would still happily stay in this dark and gloomy long night?

Serial Novel

### A Pair of Lovebirds (55)

— Zhao Qingge

Liao Dong believed Bao Ling's words. Bao Ling never imagined that this sentence would claim a life several years later!! Dong was agitated by this matter for a while, and then threw it to the back of his mind! He originally wanted to ask Boss Liao, but he was afraid of provoking the she-devil. It would be another storm, so he could only treat this matter as if it weren't his own business, he indifferently pretended not to know. He just studied hard, he secretly hoped that he would grow up quickly, be able to "stand up" quickly, be able to "walk" quickly!

The proprietress enthusiastically rushed to make two sets of printed cloth shirts and pants to give to the tailor, on the day of "crossing the threshold" (in the north, when a daughter-in-law goes to her in-laws' house, it is called "crossing the threshold"). Xiao Hong wore this new outfit. No ceremony was held, the proprietress combined the Kitchen God Festival and the marrying of the child bride, and invited three or four tables of guests. At the same time, she also took the opportunity to send off the employees of the Huichun Hall who had been fired. The proprietress's calculation was shrewd, killing three birds with one stone!

Having started to work as a "child bride," Xiao Hong dressed up this day, applied some powder to her face, and combed the thin, long braid on her head so smoothly, tied with a red hair tie. The tailor sent her to the Liao family, where she kowtowed to Boss Liao and the proprietress, and also kowtowed to the butcher matchmaker and the elders and relatives. Then, the proprietress called Liao Dong over to meet her. But Liao Dong didn't even raise his head, let alone look at Xiao Hong with his eyes.

Bao Ling watched all this like a play, feeling curious and also very comical. He wanted to laugh, but he also wanted to cry! He pitied little Liao Dong for being innocently manipulated by the proprietress like a monkey show! "Liao Dong is really a sheep!" Bao Ling said in his heart. He thought: if this matter happened to him, he would definitely not be so obedient and let them manipulate him, he would argue with them; resist; and even run away! He would deal with Mrs. Mo that way. But Liao Dong dared not! He is not like Bao Ling, Mrs. Mo is Bao Ling's birth mother! A birth mother can dote on her children, but a stepmother will not. So Liao Dong is sad! Fortunately, Liao Dong was a bit more open-minded than before, he had not been overly troubled by this matter, because he also regarded this matter as a play to watch and act in!

Boss Liao and the proprietress were both very happy, Boss Liao was happy that the family had an extra helper. After three to five years, if they got married, he would be able to hold his grandson. As the saying goes, "When the population is prosperous, wealth can be prosperous"! Thinking of this, he couldn't wait to marry them off earlier. The proprietress didn't think so, she only knew that the completion of this matter was to satisfy her secret desire for revenge against Liao Dong, and later Liao Dong's birth mother! To secretly rejoice, to rejoice for being able to vent her jealousy and cruel nature!

Speaking of Xiao Hong herself, her heart was more complicated than Liao Dong's, perhaps girls mature earlier than boys, moreover, she was ultimately two years older than Liao Dong. Before she came to the Liao family, she was able to realize the relationship of this kind of marriage, she would secretly rejoice for this relationship! Now, after she had met Liao Dong—this future man who would become her husband, she felt joy and also shyness! She was happy that she would have someone to rely on from now on, she quietly paid attention to everything in this family, she saw that everything was better than her own family, she believed that she would no longer starve. She dreamed that one day she would also help her parents! No longer suffer for burdening her parents! She was shy that she had become someone else's child bride now, had parents-in-law; had a little husband; thinking of this, how embarrassing! She felt her cheeks heat up in waves!
