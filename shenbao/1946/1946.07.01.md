### Minister Peng Announces Government Communiqué: Peaceful Policy Will Never Change; Always Enduring for the Sake of the Nation to Spur the CCP's Reflection; Troop Deployment Issues Must Be Resolved First

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] At 3:00 PM on June 30th, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department announced the following: Chairman Chiang, on June 22nd, announced the extension of the deadline for ceasing forward pursuit orders until June 30th. During this period, the government repeatedly exercised restraint, hoping to establish a foundation for peaceful unification. However, up to this day, a complete resolution has not been achieved. Nevertheless, the government's policy toward the Communist Party remains consistently focused on a political solution. Especially considering that after our country's eight years of bloody warfare, the people are suffering immensely. We cannot allow them to be subjected to the scourge of war again. Furthermore, the sincere desire for peace in China and the world shown by U.S. government special envoy General Marshall cannot be disappointed. Therefore, the government continues to request General Marshall to continue mediating, hoping for a peaceful solution. However, the Chinese Communist Party must cease its military offensives and destructive actions against transportation to demonstrate its sincerity. Furthermore, it must openly and sincerely discuss the implementation plan for army reorganization and reach an agreement on designated garrison areas within a limited time. If these conditions are met, the government will continue to exercise tolerance. If this issue is not concretely resolved, other agreements cannot be effectively implemented. In particular, if troop deployment locations are not designated, both sides' troops will remain scattered in place, making separation impossible. This will inevitably lead to conflicts. This is why the January 10th ceasefire agreement was ineffective and why the February 27th agreement on restoring transportation has not been implemented to date, with destruction escalating instead. All of this is due to this reason. This is a fact that has occurred over the past six months and is witnessed by both Chinese and foreign observers. Although the ceasefire order has expired, the government's policy of peaceful unification will never change. Unless the Communist Party attacks the National Army, as in the recent fierce attacks day and night in Weixian and Dawenkou in Shandong Province, and near Datong in Shanxi Province, the National Army, not only for self-defense but also to protect the lives and property of the people and maintain local order, has a duty to resist and expel them. Otherwise, the central government's troops will not take military action against the Communist Army, waiting patiently for the resolution of the outstanding issues. It is deeply hoped that this painstaking effort of enduring for the sake of the nation and striving for a political solution will prompt deep reflection by the CCP, leading to a sincere and honest agreement. This is what the government and the people of the whole country earnestly hope for.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] At 3:00 PM this afternoon, Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department, in the conference room of the National Goods Building, announced to more than fifty Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital that Chairman Chiang of the National Government still adheres to a policy of political solution to the Communist Party issue, urges the CCP to reflect, and cease attacking the National Army and destroying transportation, so that the people suffering from eight years of war will not suffer from war again. Minister Peng first announced this public announcement to domestic reporters for twenty minutes. Afterwards, foreign reporters swarmed in, and Minister Peng announced it in English to foreign reporters in his office. Subsequently, as reporters from various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai arrived one after another, Deputy Minister Xu Xiaoyan re-announced the original public announcement to the later domestic reporters, which lasted until 4:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] This morning at 9:30 AM, Envoy Marshall visited the Chairman's residence and had a long talk with the Chairman for two hours. After the Envoy left, the Chairman immediately convened important government officials such as Wang Shijie and Peng Xuepei to discuss matters. In addition, Envoy Marshall met with Zhou Enlai at approximately 2:00 PM this afternoon and conveyed to Zhou the Chairman's opinion of enduring for the sake of the nation and hoping for reflection from the CCP.

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Although Special Envoy Marshall has not been able to resolve the Chinese civil strife today, he has succeeded in getting the government to maintain the status quo and continue negotiations. According to the government side, Envoy Marshall cannot stay in China indefinitely, which is a key factor in the negotiations.

### Written Statement from the CCP Delegation: Willing to Continue Discussions and Seek a Solution Under the Auspices of Envoy Marshall

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The spokesman for the CCP delegation issued a written statement at 8:00 PM this evening, stating in brief: A long-term ceasefire and a comprehensive ceasefire have always been our consistent position. Unfortunately, it has not been agreed upon by the government authorities, leading to the current abrupt and uncertain situation. During the eight-day extension of the ceasefire, general agreements have been reached on issues such as completely ceasing conflicts in the Northeast, restoring transportation, and resolving certain disputes in the Executive Headquarters and the groups. The revised clauses of the military reorganization plan, through the efforts of General Marshall, the enthusiastic efforts of the third party, and the greatest concessions from the CCP side, could have completed a preliminary agreement. However, due to the government's insistence on "unreasonable demands," the agreement was not reached. We express great regret for this. The public announcement announced today by Mr. Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, is very special in form. On the one hand, it declares that the central government's army will not take military action against the Communist army, but it does not state whether the government has issued this order, especially whether this ceasefire is long-term or short-term. But in any case, the CCP side still insists on striving for peace and opposing civil war, and is still willing to continue discussions under the auspices of General Marshall to seek a political solution.

Zhou Enlai's Remarks

[Central News Agency, 30th Dispatch] The CCP representatives held a press conference at 8:00 PM this afternoon. Zhou Enlai replied to reporters that we agreed that some local troops could be transferred during the military reorganization, but the government was not satisfied with this and wanted the CCP to withdraw its troops and government from northern Jiangsu and Rehe. We really cannot consider or accept this. He continued to mention the compromise proposal put forward by Envoy Marshall, saying that the CCP agreed to the vast majority and the most important parts of it. He also said that in future continued discussions, the two methods of three-person meetings and off-site consultations will be adopted. Zhou denied the rumors that the Communist army would withdraw from northern Jiangsu, and declared that the Communist army had no intention of attacking Datong.

Minister Peng's Response

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] After Zhou Enlai's press conference held at 8:00 PM this evening, our newspaper's reporter specially visited Minister Peng at his residence to inquire about his opinion on the statement issued by the CCP delegation. Peng replied briefly: "If the Communist army does not attack, we will naturally not pursue them. We have no orders, and the army will naturally not attack them." This also explains that the order to cease pursuit has not yet expired, and there is no need for a formal order to pile bed upon bed. Moreover, this public announcement has reached all newspapers and news agencies across the country, which is much faster than an order.

### The Issue of the East River Communist Army in Guangdong Province Withdrawing North

The Government is Determined to Fulfill the Agreement

As for the complaint cases, the people will be given a public response before the Eighth Group leaves Guangdong. Chief Zhang also promised: (1) After the CCP formally obtains instructions from the Eighth Group, it will be allowed to pay another 150 million yuan; (2) After the CCP withdraws from the Dapeng Peninsula, the National Army will take over the defense, which shows the government's leniency towards the Communist army.

### The Situation in Datong is Still Tense; Communist Army Fiercely Attacking Ningwu, Intense Fighting

The current garrison only has the Second Division of Ma Zhanshan's Northeast Advance Army and two regiments of Chu Xichun's troops, with weak forces. The surrounding Communist army is nearly 100,000, and the strength is very different. Once the war breaks out, the status of Datong is very worrying. (2) The situation in Jinzhong has recently eased slightly. The previous report that Yuque was lost was a mistake that a certain place under Jianci County was lost.

### The Past Twenty-Three Days: Progress of Peace Negotiations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The peace negotiations, lasting twenty-three days, have concluded at noon today. This newspaper has provided detailed reports on the negotiation process daily. The results of the negotiations are summarized below:

Northeast Ceasefire Issue

Although an agreement has been reached, the ratio of military reorganization in the Northeast has not been determined, and the issue of the communist army's garrison areas in the Northeast has not been resolved. Although the communist army has expressed its willingness to withdraw from Harbin, it is unwilling to abandon its established administrative authority in Harbin, as well as its unique economic organization and tax system.

Restoration of Transportation Issue

Both parties have reached an agreement on dismantling fortifications and unifying the administrative authority of railways and traffic police. However, due to the unresolved issue of the communist army's garrison areas along the railway lines and inside the passes, the agreement has not been signed. Currently, Colonel Hill, the American representative of the Transportation Management Section of the Peiping Military Mediation Department, is working with transportation representatives from the government and the Communist Party to inspect the situation on various sections of the Jinpu Railway in Shandong Province and conduct research. They are preparing to repair the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways first. According to various investigations, the key obstacle to restoring transportation is the undetermined garrison areas of the communist army. If the communist army does not quickly withdraw from the railway areas, the road restoration project cannot be advanced. The American side is now deeply aware of this and no longer believes that sending two or three transportation executive groups can mediate disputes and restore transportation. The Communist Party also admits that the transportation issue is related to military affairs and no longer pretends and manipulates the road restoration personnel, exacerbating the difficulty of this issue. The government's attitude towards the withdrawal of the communist army along the railway lines is very firm. Whether this matter can be resolved in the shortest possible time is something no one dares to predict at this time.

Reorganization and Unification Issue

Regarding the negotiation process, government representatives have never disclosed a word to the outside world. The news disclosed by various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai in recent days is mostly reliable because none of the parties have publicly denied it. This issue was originally extremely complex, but after long-term discussions and careful research, all parties are aware that whether peace can be achieved and whether conflict can be avoided depends not only on the ratio of military reorganization, but also on the unresolved issue of the communist army's garrison areas. The root cause of all sudden attacks is that the communist army still does not have a fixed garrison area. It is like unruly children without a home, monks without a temple, and wild horses without reins. Therefore, all acts of playing with guns and sticks are inevitable. Therefore, demarcating the communist army's defense zone is actually a crucial plan for the future. If this issue is resolved reasonably, the communist army can take a break, and because supplies are available and food and clothing are not lacking, all problems can be easily solved.

The So-Called Concessions of the Communist Party

According to a certain party's disclosure today, the Communist Party has agreed to withdraw from Harbin in the Northeast, and in the Rehe and Chahar areas, the Communist Party is willing to abandon the area south of Zhangjiakou, indicating a reduction in the threat to Peiping and Tianjin. In northern Jiangsu, northeastern Anhui, and Jiaodong, the Communist Party is willing to reduce the number of troops stationed and withdraw in batches and phases, but must retain the established political, economic, and even social rights and interests of the Communist Party in the above-mentioned areas. In short, even the smallest village head appointed by the central government and the people's organizations guided by the Communist Party, even the smallest barbers' union, must be guaranteed to exist permanently. This is what the Communist Party believes is the most ideal "masterpiece" of the past eight or nine months of negotiations.

### Northern Jiangsu Refugees Appeal to Return Home; Send a Hundred Representatives to Nanjing to Petition

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 30th] The Northern Jiangsu Counties Refugee Relief Promotion Association held an emergency meeting on the 29th and decided to select 8,000 refugees from various counties to walk to Nanjing to earnestly petition Chairman Chiang, Special Envoy Marshall, and Zhou Enlai, implementing four demands: (1) Safe return home immediately, (2) Stop the communist army from controlling and breaching the Yun Canal dikes, (3) The communist army immediately withdraws from Northern Jiangsu, (4) Willing to voluntarily arm and return home. After hearing the news, the local military and political leaders summoned the refugee representatives, personally offered comfort, and encouraged them to respect the spirit of Chairman Chiang's magnanimity and tolerance. They asked them to prioritize national affairs and not expand their actions for the time being. The representatives understood this and then changed their plan to send 100 people to Nanjing, and appointed representatives Dai Tianqiu, Yang Jinren, and Hu Zheng to Zhenjiang to meet with the press to explain the determination of the people of Northern Jiangsu. If the delegation does not achieve its goals within ten days of arriving in Nanjing, they are determined to fight to the death and ask the press for strong support.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 30th] According to Xie Zhigang, director of the Yangzhou office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Conference, according to past investigations, the total number of refugees from various counties in northern Jiangsu who are displaced in Yangzhou is 48,167, all waiting to be fed. They are currently being provided with relief separately. The old, weak, disabled, out-of-school youth, and impoverished children are listed as urgent relief cases. It is stipulated that the 500 tons of flour issued have now arrived in Yangzhou with 200 tons, which will be distributed within days. The various facilities in the 20 reception and reception centers in various counties are being improved.

### 300,000 Refugees in Xuzhou; Urgently Need 5,000 Tons of Flour

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 30th] There are many refugees in the urban and rural areas of Xuzhou and in Yangshan and Huangkou. After investigation, it is necessary to provide relief to more than 230,000 people. More than 15,000 people are gathered in the suburbs of Xuzhou Airport, the old Yellow River embankment, and the Mapaoshan area. There are still many others scattered among relatives and friends. In the past two days, reporters have inspected the refugee areas and seen the miserable conditions of their lack of clothing, food, and medicine, which is even worse than in Yangzhou and Taixian. The Jiangsu Provincial Branch has now transported 2,000 tons of relief flour, but each three people can only be allocated one bag, and each person only has one week's worth of food, which is far too little. Therefore, they all eagerly hope that the government will continue to allocate flour for relief. According to the reporter's observation, if the Executive Yuan does not increase the allocation of 5,000 tons of flour in July and use it exclusively for relief in Xuzhou, then these 300,000 starving people will have to sit and wait for death.

### Minister Gu and Chairman Wang Visit Refugees in Xuzhou

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 30th] Minister Gu Zhenggang and Chairman Wang Maogong attended a symposium with representatives from all sectors in Xuzhou on the morning of the 29th. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, they went to the old airport, Mapaoshan, and other refugee concentration areas to inspect and offer condolences. The refugees in the two areas numbered over 10,000, which is only one-thirtieth of the refugees in the suburbs of Xuzhou. Their living conditions are extremely miserable, and they earnestly hope to return home.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The China Natural Science Society News reported that there are three kinds of medicines for treating malaria: quinine, atabrine and plasmochin, although the curative effect is good, there have been many recurrences, especially malignant malaria.

Until last year, when the 13,276th drug was tested, it was found that it had a particularly strong curative effect on malaria, so the drug was named "SN13276." This drug is one of the compounds of plasmochin, and its effect is stronger than various antimalarial drugs, and the number of doses can be reduced, and it can especially prevent the recurrence of malignant malaria. The only disadvantage is that it is easy to cause hemolysis and produce serious side effects in people of color and mixed-race people, so American scientists are still continuing their research. In addition, a deadline has been set for the invention of a new drug that may be used to treat leukemia.

### Cable Car to Be Built in Guling

Funding Requires Approximately 1.2 Billion Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 30th] Guling is a famous scenic spot in Jiangxi. Every summer, many Chinese and foreigners come here to escape the heat. In order to facilitate tourists, the Jiangxi Provincial Government plans to build a cable car and has agreed with the Chongqing Cable Car Company. The company sent Chief Engineer Yang Yichun to conduct a survey. The plan has now been drafted and will be measured soon. The cost is approximately 1.2 billion yuan, and it will take approximately fifteen months.

The Yuehan Railway Administration will hold a through-traffic ceremony at the same time at 9:00 AM tomorrow in Wuchang, Hengyang, and Guangzhou. At 1:00 PM, direct trains will depart from Guangzhou and Wuchang. After that, direct passenger trains will run between Guangzhou and Wuchang once every Monday and Thursday.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 30th, United Press] The Yuehan Railway is scheduled to officially resume through traffic on July 1. Guangzhou, Hankou, and Hengyang will hold a through-traffic ceremony at the same time. In Guangzhou, the ribbon will be cut by Miss Chen Ce, daughter of former mayor Chen Ce.

### Chongqing Ships to Sail Downstream; Will Accommodate Students

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 30th] The flood in the Yangtze River is still not receding. After small tugboats and ships with insufficient horsepower are prohibited from sailing, it is heard that starting from next month, the transfer of Sichuan grain out of the province will mainly be carried out by landing craft, and it is stipulated that each downstream ship should leave as much cabin space as possible to accommodate students. It is reported that there are still more than 80,000 students in Sichuan who are urgently waiting for official positions. In the future, universities and middle schools will allocate cabin space according to a ratio of two to one.

In addition, after the Shipping Allocation Committee was ordered to end, it officially handed over its main business to the Central Party, Government, and Military Joint Office for takeover today. The office also took over the demobilization and transportation matters at the same time.

### New Provincial Chairman Issues Circular; Respect People's Freedom

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 29th] Zhang Zhizhong issued a circular today, requiring all levels of administrative organs and local garrisons in the province to absolutely respect the people's freedom of body, speech, assembly, association, and publication. In the future, except for acts that endanger the country and the nation, destroy the army's organization, and are approved by the Xingying Provincial Government or the Garrison Headquarters, no emergency measures shall be taken. Everything shall be handled in accordance with judicial procedures.

### Dredging the Pearl River; Executive Yuan Engineering Experts Come to Shanghai to Purchase Machinery

[United News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th] Huang Le, a port engineering expert from the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, went to Shanghai yesterday to purchase heavy machinery in order to dredge the Pearl River. This project requires a cost of 81,657.60 yuan and is one of the four major plans to improve Guangzhou's transportation. The Executive Yuan has allocated 4.5 million yuan to cover the survey costs. In addition to improving the main river channels, the Executive Yuan also announced its hope to bear the labor costs for repairing 36 embankments and the Lubaohu water gate in the Pearl River basin in order to protect 2,776,000 acres of farmland from floods. The total cost of labor and materials requires 2,875,310,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan will allocate 1,946,000 pounds of flour to the workers. The fourth project will be to develop the wasteland in the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which can probably resettle 5,000 refugees from the war zone.

### Editorial: Hoping Everyone Will Deeply Reflect

The extension of the ceasefire order for eight days expired at noon yesterday. The people of the whole country are worried about whether there is hope for peace and feel extremely anxious. Chairman Chiang still adhered to his policy of peaceful unification, endured for the sake of the country, and issued another announcement welcomed by the whole country: as long as the Communist Party stops military offensives, stops destroying transportation, and sincerely negotiates the implementation plan for military reorganization, and establishes an agreement on the areas where troops will be stationed within a time limit, the government will still tolerate it. Chairman Chiang's wise decision fully proves the government's painstaking efforts to seek a political solution, allowing some Chinese and foreign people who suspected that the government would use force to suddenly realize. Whether China can achieve peaceful unification in the future depends on whether the Communist Party can truly deeply reflect.

Leaving aside the situation before and after the Political Consultative Conference, let's just talk about the facts of the past month: for the sake of the future of the nation and the country, the government has always held the spirit of "enduring for the sake of the country" and does not want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build the country. On June 6, it issued a ceasefire order, limiting the negotiations to resolve the three major issues of stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and implementing the military reorganization and unification plan within fifteen days. After fifteen days of negotiations, there was still no result. In order to give the Communist Party one last chance, Chairman Chiang extended the ceasefire order by eight days, hoping that the Communist Party would not miss this last chance again. However, in these last eight days, the Communist Party still played its most brilliant tricks, delaying the negotiations and failing to reach a conclusion. The words were very beautiful, but in reality, they were completely irrelevant. As a result, the situation was uncertain, making our people dizzy, as if they had encountered a riddle of the times. At the last moment when the ceasefire order expired at noon yesterday, everyone was worried and anxious. When they heard Chairman Chiang's announcement, they felt relieved. How could our people not express their joy!

However, after being relieved, let's calm down and think about it. We feel that we cannot be too optimistic about the future of the domestic situation. Why? Because Chairman Chiang's announcement only shows that the government is willing to strive for peaceful unification at any cost and does not want to see the people suffer from war again. However, peaceful unification cannot be achieved by the government's efforts alone, and whether war can be avoided or not depends on the actual actions of the Communist Party. We must pay attention to the word "reciprocal" in "reciprocal tolerance." It can only be considered "reciprocal tolerance" if both sides can make concessions. If the government is tolerant but the Communist Party is not, and continues to attack Weixian and Datong day and night, then the government's willingness to "appease" may not be able to avoid war. Therefore, the key to China's transformation from chaos to governance and from war to peace can be said to be in the hands of the Communist Party. The more the government is generous and retreats, the more we must persuade the Communist Party to realize it as soon as possible. Everyone should "endure for the sake of the country" and, under the continued mediation of Special Envoy Marshall, establish an agreement on the implementation plan for military reorganization. Otherwise, even if Chairman Chiang has this wise and generous announcement, and the Communist Party still acts as it did before, will the people's hopes not be dashed again? Today, I would like to sincerely advise the Communist Party again: every time the government makes a concession, the people will hate the Communist Party's refusal to make concessions even more. Therefore, if the current stalemate continues to drag on, and the Communist Party still does not reflect and change its military offensives, destruction of transportation, and its style of occupying territory and refusing to accept military reorganization, then the Communist Party will be destroying its own future in China.

Combining the recent negotiation issues and the opinions of all parties, we can know that the focus of the dispute between the two sides is one is the issue of military reorganization, and the other is the issue of defense zones. These are the implementation steps for the nationalization of the army. Regarding the former, the plan for the demobilization, reorganization, and unification of the army has long been signed and established by the three parties. It only needs to be implemented. There is no reason for the Communist Party to demand a change in the ratio of the Kuomintang and Communist armies. Regarding the latter, the Communist Party's opinions have been inconsistent, making it difficult for us to understand the Communist Party's true intentions. In fact, the demarcation of defense zones is the most practical way to avoid military conflict at present. Otherwise, if the troops of both sides are scattered in their original locations and cannot be separated from each other, how can conflict be guaranteed to be avoided? If the Communist Party sincerely seeks peace, there is really no reason to refuse to designate defense zones.

Finally, speaking of political democratization, it is of course the future path of Chinese politics. Although we know that the government has long had a great determination to reform politics, and the government has indeed set steps to achieve democratic politics, what is lacking is that we believe that the current government still lacks a spirit of automatically and proactively implementing democratization. In fact, the Communist Party's military offensives and destruction of transportation are one thing, while the government's proactive reorganization of the national government, accommodating various parties and factions (parties willing to cooperate with the government but not possessing troops) and talents without party affiliation, and jointly governing the country to show its sincerity of "the world is for the public," is another thing. For example, the government's merger of the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Ministry of Military Orders is indeed a timely measure to adjust military institutions, but why has the government not yet proactively changed the system of exercising power and transferred the power of the Supreme National Defense Council to the National Government Committee after accommodating various parties and non-party figures? The government should not ask whether the Communist Party is willing to participate, but take the lead in showing that it will automatically and publicly open up power, make a fresh start, and open the first door to political democratization. Secondly, when the government continues to negotiate with the Communist Party, it may as well reflect on why the Communist Party has become so rampant. Do the central and even local political facilities have any gaps that have been called a "hotbed" for cultivating the Communist Party? The government officials must be greatly enlightened and fundamentally and proactively reform their politics so that even if the Communist Party deliberately creates war, it will be spurned by the people, and its strength will not need to be valued. Therefore, instead of merely hoping that the Communist Party will abandon its policies, the government should turn around and first reform its own political power and start afresh with the people.

### Low Stock of Grain in Peiping; Only Enough for Ten Days

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th] According to sources from the Food Office, the current stock of grain in Peiping is only over 17.8 million catties. The population of Peiping is 1.6 million. If each person consumes one catty of grain per day, it will only be enough for ten days. On the other hand, the Communist Party is buying grain in the countryside at high prices. The grain in the countryside does not enter the city, and some grain markets in the city are also attracted by high prices and transported to the countryside.

### Gao Zhongqin Invents Electric Chinese Typewriter

Can Type 45 Characters Per Minute

[United Press, New York, 30th] The International Business Machines Corporation recently announced that it has manufactured an "electric" Chinese typewriter. The machine was invented by Gao Zhongqin, director of the Central News Agency's Telecommunications Department, and was officially exhibited here today. The typewriter is made using electric and mechanical principles. It has 34 keys, divided into four groups. The typewriter is very easy to use. Pressing four keys (one key in each group) can produce a total of 5,400 characters. These 5,400 characters are divided into three categories: the first category has 1,000 characters, which are the most commonly used, accounting for 90% of the number of occurrences in daily communications; the second category has about 3,000 characters, which are the less commonly used; and the rest are the third category. After such classification, the movement of the cylinder can be minimized as much as possible. Gao said that the principle of the electric Chinese typewriter is roughly similar to the principle of automatic telephones, but of course it is ten thousand times more complicated. The machine is controlled by alternating current and can type 40 to 45 characters per minute. The character keys also include English letters, punctuation marks, and Chinese phonetic symbols for use when needed.

### Local Correspondence: Huaiyin Liaison Group, US Representative, Real-World Investigation Foiled by Attack

[Our Nantung Correspondent] Colonel Cumenhan, the US representative of the Huaiyin Executive Headquarters, was recently transferred south for the first time to conduct mediation work. He was eager to go to the Communist area for a field investigation. On the 29th at 9:00 AM, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Belan Kehustuo, he traveled by jeep to Rugao. En route, between Baipu and Linzi, they were suddenly attacked by bandits. The representatives and his party, perceiving the unusual situation, immediately decided to turn back, returning to Tongcheng at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The US representatives are tight-lipped about the details, maintaining silence. County Magistrate Yang and others, upon hearing the news, personally went to express their condolences. The US representatives originally intended to insist that a government representative accompany them, but after repeated consideration by Group Leader Yang Chao, they had not yet departed, thus narrowly escaping misfortune. It can be said they were fortunate.

### Communist Troops Forcibly Collect Public Grain; National Army Retaliates Upon Hearing of It.

[Our Jingjiang Correspondent] On the 27th, Communist troops forcibly collected public grain from the people near Xima Bridge in the Fourth District and held a meeting at Xinguo Dai. Upon receiving this information, the National Army immediately led the Fourth District Self-Defense Force to deploy defenses. The Communist troops then mobilized a hundred armed men, encircling from the east and cutting off the National Army's return route, resulting in a conflict. The sound of gunfire and hand grenades erupted, audible even within the city. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Communist troops finally retreated in defeat. In this battle, more than ten Communist soldiers were killed or wounded. The National Army intended to pursue, but the bridges along the road had been destroyed, preventing them from advancing. They then returned safely.

### Communist Troops Block Transportation, Confiscate Grain for Shipping North

[Another Report] Recently, water and land transportation from Huangqiao to Jingcheng has been blocked by Communist troops. Since the 23rd, no passes have been issued for travel south, and passage north of Gushan is also prohibited. According to people arriving from Huangqiao, the Communist troops have dismantled more than sixty bunkers, and all the bricks and wood, along with the confiscated public grain, have been loaded onto hundreds of boats and shipped north day and night. Furthermore, several hundred young women have been forcibly conscripted, assigned numbers, and sent to the Yanfu area.

Suzhou: Moldy Grain and Forage Cannot be Auctioned

The Third Inspection and Acceptance Committee of the Ministry of War announced that a batch of moldy grain and forage was previously stored in Suzhou warehouses. It was approved to be transferred to the Wuxian County Government for distribution to the poor for relief. Subsequently, the County Government organized a committee to receive the moldy grain and forage and openly invited bids for auction, with the proceeds to be used for local relief projects. The Inspection Committee had no prior knowledge of the bidding and auction, which was not its original intention. The committee telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense for approval. They received a reply from the Chief of Staff stating that the grain must still be donated to the poor and not auctioned. The committee has now notified the County Government to comply.

Wuxi: Requesting the Yuan and Ministries to Relieve Industry

The Southern Jiangsu Branch of the National Industrial Association believes that Southern Jiangsu industry is facing a crisis. Some factories are requesting layoffs and wage reductions. The crux of the problem lies in: 1. Shortage of funds; 2. Heavy interest burdens; 3. Lack of industrial loans; 4. Restriction by cheap foreign goods; 5. Inability to bear heavy donations and taxes; 6. Increased wages and frequent labor unrest, with workers making excessive demands. If these difficulties are not fundamentally eliminated, the future of Chinese industry will be unimaginable. On the 28th, the association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Economy, requesting prompt measures to be taken to provide relief and avert the industrial crisis.

Jiangyin: Cloth Sales Stagnant, Plead for Industrial Loans

Before the war, Jiangyin cloth factories were known to be flourishing. During the period of enemy occupation, they suffered severe damage and were unable to resume operations. After the victory, for the sake of livelihood, the industry gradually resumed production, but their economic strength was based on depleting their savings. Recently, rice prices have soared, wages have increased, and cloth sales have been stagnant. Existing capital is insufficient to meet operational needs. If loans are given at high interest rates, it would be like drinking poison to quench thirst. The industry association, represented by Zhu Yaohang and others, specially submitted a petition to the Provisional Council to telegraph the Ministries of Finance and Economy, and the Joint Office of the Four Banks, requesting low-interest industrial loans to maintain the dying cloth factory industry and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers.

Songjiang: Traitor Yuan Yingjie Arrested in Shanghai

Yuan Yingjie, the former commander of the Independent 5th Regiment of the puppet Second Army stationed in Songcheng, and concurrently the Major General Advisor of the puppet Military Commission, arrived in Songjiang in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic under the guise of the Commander-in-Chief of the 6th Route of the puppet Peace and National Salvation Army. Later, he was reassigned as the Brigade Commander of the 26th Brigade of the puppet 13th Division, designating the area from Dongting Bridge to the Old East Gate in the city as the garrison area for his troops. The puppet soldiers were rampant, and the people glared at them with disdain. Yuan Yingjie himself, when entering or leaving, would always post sentries and enforce martial law, displaying his arrogant power and considering himself invincible. The County Government learned that the traitor was hiding in Shanghai, so it sent a criminal police team to arrest him. On the 28th, he was escorted back to the county for detention and interrogation.

Hangzhou: Completion of the Deqing-Hangzhou Telephone Line

The long-distance telephone line of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, after active construction, has completed the installation of one pair of double-wire lines to Pingwang, Deqing, and Changxing. Recently, the Deqing-Hangzhou section of the double-wire telephone line has also been completed by the 10th Line Construction Engineering Team of the bureau. The line construction project from Deqing through Wukang Mogan Mountain will also begin immediately. In the future, communication between counties should be more convenient.

### Superfortress Dropped Atomic Bomb from 30,000 Feet This Morning; Yesterday, All Preparations Were Completed Awaiting Weather Report; Target Ships Ringed the Lagoon Like a Floating City

[Reuters, From the US Ship Appalachian outside Bikini Atoll, 29th] Approximately 40,000 personnel participating in the Bikini atomic bomb test have completed all preparations. Today there is nothing to do but await the release of the final weather report to determine whether the atomic bomb will be dropped as scheduled. A Navy spokesman said that the weather is expected to be good, but the atomic bomb may be dropped one hour earlier than scheduled to allow for clearer visibility. (6:30 AM Shanghai time Monday morning, originally scheduled for 7:30 AM) The Superfortress that will drop the atomic bomb today underwent a final inspection, and it was discovered that one of its engines was not in perfect condition and was immediately replaced. The originally scheduled three test flights over the target have been canceled, so the official drop can be held earlier. The accuracy of the bomber crews dropping bombs from 30,000 feet has amazed the officials in charge of the test. Major Swenkt, the pilot of the Superfortress, told reporters that he was confident that he could drop the atomic bomb within 300 feet of the target. In addition to the crew, there are also one Army and one Air Force personnel, and one scientist on board, who will assemble the atomic bomb in the air to reduce its danger.

[Associated Press, Bikini, 29th] On the eve of the atomic bomb test, thousands of observers became increasingly nervous, awaiting the hour of the drop. When the hour arrives, the Bikini lagoon will emit the heat and light of a thousand suns. But amidst the excited crowd, only Major Wood remained calm, temporarily leaving his job as a store clerk in New Jersey to serve here as one of the US Army's best bombardiers. He said with confidence, "I will hit it with one shot."

Precise Instruments Measure the Power

The preparations for the July 1st test viewing have been completed, weather permitting. Seventy-seven warships surround the target center ship "Nevada," arranged in the lagoon. Spectroscopic equipment will be used during the test, and scientists will be able to see the entire explosion within the first minute. They can measure heat of millions of degrees and the speed of shrapnel. Various instruments can fully measure the power of the bomb. Judging from the arrangement of the ships, even if the fleet is not destroyed, the people on board will be killed or injured. All the ships are stronger than most houses, and the water covering the bottom of the ships will protect most of them from being shattered. It should be known that the atomic bomb is strictly a land weapon. The aerial explosion method on July 1 is not used to represent the attack of the atomic bomb on the Navy, but strictly used to test the power of the attack on the city, so the parking of each target ship is almost identical to the small city. The ships are densely packed close to the center, like standing [Heaven]'s [Natural] central area with more than 20 military [earning], forming a [formation], with a diameter of more than one mile. The arrangement of the central military [earning] is particularly dense, and from two miles away, the gap between the ships cannot be seen. The layout of this floating city is like an old-fashioned metropolis, with streets branching out from the central building in all directions. The battleship "Nevada" is in the center, but the tallest building in the center is the Japanese battleship "Nagato," which looks like a spire rising in the city.

Nevada: Target Core

[Special Telegram from Central News Agency reporter Song Dehe on the US ship Nevada in Bikini Lagoon, 29th] This old US battleship "Nevada" will be used as the center of the target ships for the atomic bomb test. Various types of military equipment are equipped on board, from tanks and airplanes to uniforms, fabrics, and food. If the atomic bomb is dropped and detonated as expected, all of the above-mentioned equipment and materials will be subjected to the white heat and radiation caused by the atomic bomb. Today, all reporters were allowed to visit the ship, but only the exterior was allowed to be viewed. The exterior looks like a modern military science museum, with tanks, artillery, amphibious vehicles, airplanes, and various types of aircraft made of different materials. One-inch armored steel plates, everything used in modern warfare, and various newly invented items that have never been tested before will be tested under the atomic bomb explosion. Hours before the atomic bomb is dropped, the crew will abandon the ship and replace them with pigs, sheep, and mice. These animals are already on board and will be placed in different locations at that time. The hair of some will be cut short, and some will be completely cut off, with special preparations made on their skin. Around this central target, there are more than 70 other ships, all prepared in the same way as the "Nevada." These target ships are anchored very close together. If the explosion of the atomic bomb is exactly as expected, then one bomb can sink all the target ships completely, or seriously damage them.

Japanese Ship Nagato: Serving as Cannon Fodder

The Japanese battleship "Nagato" and the cruiser "Sakawa" are only a few hundred feet away from the "Nevada." The ships are extremely dilapidated and driven by the US Navy. The German cruiser "Prince Eugen" has a very beautiful appearance. Looking around at these concentrated targets, and recalling the many reports by the US side to reporters on the preparation and planning of this test in the past few weeks, I can't help but feel that why not use this energy and enthusiasm in peacetime production?

[Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 29th] It is reported that the US Navy will engage in long-distance measurement and recording to prove whether the secret test of atomic bomb bombing in other parts of the world can be detected in the United States.

[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] The US scientific community's assurance that the atomic bomb bombing test is harmless to the world has aroused dissatisfaction among European scientists. Swiss physicist Katte, who is now in Paris preparing for next year's deep-water pressure test, said that the atomic bomb explosion may cause a series of uncontrollable atomic explosions. Bee's words are consistent with the fears of former French scientist Berthelot. According to Berthelot, there is also a core explosive force in the water, which is the same as that contained in the uranium nucleus, so an atomic bomb may cause an accidental explosion. Before throwing an atomic bomb into the ocean, a limited test should be held on a small body of water.

Atomic Bomb Can Break Hurricanes

[Special Telegram from Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Tokyo Meteorological Observatory meteorologist Fujiwara Hei said today that atomic bombs may be used to break up hurricanes. Fujiwara's theory is based on the phenomena that occurred in the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He said that half an hour after the first atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima, the blue sky turned dark, and then it started to rain. Within an hour, the drizzle turned into a tropical downpour. The same phenomenon occurred after the second atomic bomb was dropped in Nagasaki. According to theory, atomic energy can indeed change the climate. If an atomic bomb (or another form of atomic energy) is thrown at the appropriate location in a highly destructive hurricane, it can cause the hurricane to shift to a different line that is harmless. The power of an ordinary hurricane is only one percent of the power of an atomic bomb, so the atomic bomb has sufficient power to control hurricanes.

### Anti-Bikini Test: US Anti-War Association Demonstrates

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] An anti-Bikini crowd surrounded the War Department in Washington today, holding signs that read "The Bikini Test is a rehearsal for World War III" and "Test Crossroads is a fork in the road to peace." They marched and protested the historic atomic bomb test. They did not explain their background, only stating that they were a "Special Anti-War Committee," demanding that the United States immediately stop the atomic bomb test.

### Philippine President Holds Review; Philippines Has Nearly 40,000 Troops

[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] Philippine President Roxas held a military review today, where US Lieutenant General Staley presented Roxas with a carbine, indicating that the Philippine Army has been officially handed over to the Philippine government. The troops participating in the review included the US 86th Division and the 12th Division, and a small contingent of Philippine troops equipped with extremely new equipment. The current strength of the Philippine Army is nearly 40,000, and Roxas hopes that its peacetime strength will increase to 50,000.

### White House Warns: Best Way to Prevent Atomic War is to Go Deep Underground

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Experts who studied the remains of Hiroshima and Nagasaki today warned the American people that in future atomic wars, the only way to save the country may be to disperse the entire population and industry and go deep underground. This warning was released by the White House today, in a 10,000-word analysis by the US Strategic Bombing Survey.

### US Ships to Visit Northern Europe

[Associated Press, London, 29th] The US Naval Command in London announced today that six ships of the US 12th Fleet, led by the ship Houston, are scheduled to visit Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden from July 1, lasting about 30 days. In addition to the capitals of the three Nordic countries, the ports of Gothenburg, Ostend, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Amsterdam will also be visited. Since World War II, this is the first time that the United States has made a friendly visit to Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

### Seafarers' Conference Closes; International Convention Passed

[Associated Press, Seattle, 30th] Delegates to the International Seafarers' Conference today passed an international convention at the closing meeting, requiring a minimum wage of $64 for skilled seafarers and improving standard working hours for seafarers worldwide. The proposal passed by a vote of 55 to 21, with 7 abstentions.

### Four Foreign Ministers Discuss Trieste Issue; Seeking New Ways to Resolve; Date of Peace Conference May Also Be Decided Soon; Pro-Italian and Pro-Yugoslav Factions Clash in Trieste

[Our Report] London broadcast on the 30th: There was no meeting of the four foreign ministers today, Sunday. A meeting will be held tomorrow afternoon, and a decision on the peace conference issue may be made.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] Regarding the issue of the sovereignty of the port of Trieste, the compromise plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault has been agreed to by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Byrnes, although requesting further consideration, did not refuse. The most difficult issue in the four foreign ministers' meeting seems to be nearing a solution. Regarding the issue of freedom of navigation on the Danube, the proposal put forward by the French representative has been agreed to by the other three foreign ministers, thus the meeting today has made great progress. Regarding the distribution of the Italian Navy, the four foreign ministers have reached an agreement on the number of warships that Italy should retain. Regarding the convening date of the 21-nation peace conference, after a long period of discussion, US Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov each held their own opinions and refused to budge. Until recently, they still agreed to the compromise plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault. Therefore, it seems that the four foreign ministers' meeting can decide the convening date of the peace conference when they meet on July 1.

[Associated Press, Trieste, 29th] In this accident-prone port of Trieste, political sentiments are high today. Armed conflicts erupted between pro-Italian and pro-Yugoslav crowds, turning into street fighting. As a result, more than twenty people were injured, three of them seriously. The method of disposing of the port is the most fiercely debated point in the post-war peace treaty with Italy. The Paris foreign ministers' meeting found this extremely difficult to deal with.

### US Atomic Bomb Manufacturing Plant Plans to Increase Production of Radioactive Elements for Nationwide Medical and Industrial Use

[United Press, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 29th] The Manhattan Project, responsible for manufacturing atomic bombs, announced today its plan to provide atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Radioactive material produced from the same "uranium pile" used to create atomic bomb components will be distributed to hospitals, universities, and scientific and industrial laboratories for examining substances within the human body, studying their structure and diseases, and potentially for medicinal treatments. Currently, only US institutions can obtain allocations, and full supply is not yet possible until production facilities are increased. Although current production is limited, large-scale manufacturing is expected in the future, and hospitals, schools, industrial and non-industrial laboratories, and clinical research institutions can already apply for small quantities. If production can be increased and widely distributed, it will undoubtedly greatly benefit peacetime research in physics, chemistry, metallurgy, and medicine. According to the Manhattan Project report:

Uranium Pile

produces isotopes far more efficiently than atomic fission reactors. For example, radioactive carbon, which is urgently needed by researchers, can be produced several times more effectively by "uranium piles" than by atomic fission reactors. Before the war, the production of isotopes using atomic fission reactors was insufficient, hindering research progress, and only a few people were able to apply radioactive isotopes. Now that radioactive isotopes can be produced on a large scale, more significant advancements in scientific applications are expected. Although the production cost of isotopes is high, they can now be obtained at reasonable prices. The cost of the research quantities of important isotopes should no longer deter ordinary scientific institutions. Some isotopes can produce 37 million rays per second, with each ray having an energy of up to 2.5 million electron volts, so their handling requires special care. The time required for a radioactive substance to lose half of its radioactivity ranges from a few hours to more than thirty years. Radioactive isotopes have two

Important Uses:

(1) As atomic tracers in chemical biology and technology, (2) As therapeutic agents for specific diseases. Radioactive isotopes can be used as tracers because the radiation they emit can be detected with precision instruments. Therefore, radioactive carbon can be used to detect the action of ordinary carbon in the human body and various organisms. Radioactive carbon does not interfere with ordinary carbon in the human body because its chemical properties are the same. Radioactive carbon-14, different from stable carbon-12 and carbon-13, can greatly benefit the study of the functions of various organisms, including the mechanisms and growth of normal and diseased tissues, and all the functions of animals and plants. In addition, the production of radioactive phosphorus, sulfur, and iodine has also increased compared to the past. Radioactive phosphorus, previously produced in very limited quantities by atomic fission reactors, can now be used to treat leukemia, a cancerous condition of blood cells, because phosphorus tends to concentrate in blood-forming organs, so radioactive phosphorus can be used to attack the disease, like radium needles and phototherapy. Radioactive iodine is used to treat thyroid diseases because iodine concentrates in the thyroid gland, and it can also be used for detection to determine whether the iodine used is indeed in the thyroid gland. Radioactive sulfur is used with sulfa drugs to detect the body's response to these drugs and their

Bacterial Action,

which is extremely important. Radioactive strontium can be used to treat osteosarcoma because scientists know that strontium tends to concentrate in bone tissue. Injecting a radioactive substance at one point in the arteries and veins and calculating the time it takes to pass through can measure blood flow velocity. According to the Army Department's announcement, radioactive isotopes can also be used as tracers in industrial chemistry and metallurgy. This was already known when radioactive materials were produced using atomic fission reactors in the past. Radioactive substances with this property can be used to detect gases flowing through complex pipes and reactors. Petroleum engineers use them to map oil pools. Radioactive hydrogen is used to test oil refining procedures. Atomic scientists say that the radiation emitted by radioactive substances is a cheap and easy-to-use radiation source for

X-Ray Irradiation

of large pieces of metal and opaque materials to detect flaws. The isotopes currently produced can be divided into two main categories: (1) Byproducts of the fission of uranium-235 by neutrons; (2) Non-fissionable materials added to uranium piles and transformed into radioactive materials by atomic bombardment. In the first category, the uranium atom is shattered to form a series of new elements, which is true alchemy. However, in the uranium pile, these newly produced elements are not as stable as naturally occurring ones and are radioactive. No fewer than sixteen elements are produced in this way, including cerium, europium, promethium, and neodymium. In the second category, adding foreign substances to the uranium pile can cause several reactions: (1) Changing non-radioactive elements into radioactive elements of the same type; (2) Changing non-radioactive elements into completely different radioactive elements; (3) First changing non-radioactive elements into radioactive elements of the same type, and then splitting them into completely different radioactive elements. Materials added to the uranium pile are first placed in specially made metal containers, and the procedure is extremely meticulous and requires extreme caution. All groups using radioactive isotopes for basic research or applied science should publish their research findings to promote science. The distribution method is adjusted and supervised by the Isotope Advisory Committee, while the adjustment of its production and development is managed by a technical committee composed of representatives from the Manhattan Project's major laboratories.

### Tense Situation in the Dutch East Indies: Nationwide Martial Law Declared; Rumors of Indonesian Prime Minister and Others Kidnapped; President Sukarno Seizes Power

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir and several other important figures were suddenly kidnapped by armed personnel today, for reasons unknown.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 29th] Indonesian President Sukarno issued a nationwide martial law order and decided to seize power himself. Indonesian newspapers commented that President Sukarno's move to recruit military leaders, the Holy Warriors Party of the Youth Movement, and one representative from the Communist Party to form a military commission proves that the country is facing a crisis. Dutch authorities plan to use air force to overcome resistance in the Dutch East Indies.

[Reuters, Batavia, 29th] According to Yogyakarta radio news, Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir, Minister of Social Affairs Santoso, Major General Sutirjo, and others were taken away from a hotel by armed men. According to an order issued by the cabinet on Friday, temporary emergency measures have been taken, and all political power has been handed over to Indonesian President Sukarno.

### Compromise Amendment on the Trieste Issue

Contains Seven Points

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th Dispatch] This afternoon, Foreign Ministers' Conference Chairman Bidault proposed an amended compromise plan for the Trieste issue, including seven points: (1) The port of Trieste and its surrounding territory should become an autonomous region for a period of ten years, jointly administered by Italy and Yugoslavia in addition to the four major powers, with the territorial integrity guaranteed by the UN Security Council. (2) The governor of the region should be nominated by an agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia. If a candidate cannot be proposed through this method, then the four major powers will appoint one separately. (3) A parliament elected by secret universal suffrage will exercise legislative powers. (4) An administrative council of six people will be formed, with the four major Allied powers and Italy and Yugoslavia appointing a governor who can supervise the administrative council to have governmental and administrative power and must maintain order and guarantee the progress of general public affairs. (5) Legislative and judicial organizations should guarantee respect for the people's right to establish and use schools in the local residents' language and to participate in government work. (6) A supervisory body composed of representatives of the Security Council and the four major powers should be formed. The administrative council should submit a report to it every year. The supervisory body should be responsible for reviewing generally applicable laws and regulations. Any disputes or difficulties can be submitted to this supervisory body. (7) Before the end of the ten-year period, the four powers may conduct a new review of the various laws and regulations to be able to submit UN recommendations at any time. Molotov believes that this plan is still unsatisfactory. He said that this is a temporary nature and may affect the emotions of Yugoslavs, and he believes that it is better to establish permanent rules.

### Post-Bombing Investigation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

A Total of 120,000 Deaths; White House Issues Report

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] President Truman previously appointed a fact-finding committee to investigate the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The committee was composed of 300 civilian experts, 50 military officers, and 500 soldiers. The report has been submitted and was released by the White House. It stated: A total of 80,000 people were killed in Hiroshima, and thousands were seriously injured. The area had a population of 245,000, of which one-third were wiped out. The reason for such severe losses was that all residents were working at the time of the bombing, and because the US aircraft fleet was not large, the Hiroshima local officials failed to detect and issue air raid warnings in time, coupled with unfavorable terrain. Hiroshima was almost completely destroyed. Nagasaki suffered less damage because it was located in a deep valley, with only 40,000 deaths. When the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima, flames flew wildly, causing high-speed hot winds, flowing more than fifty miles per hour. When it fell on Nagasaki, it emitted a strong flash of light, followed by a deafening roar, and then caused a high degree of heat. The atomic bomb can kill 20,000 people and injure 43,000 people in every square mile. As for ordinary bombs, even if hundreds of aircraft drop them at the same time, they can only kill 1,000 people and injure 2,000 people.

### US, UK, and Canada Jointly Announce the Dissolution of the Food Committee

[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King issued a joint communiqué today, stating that the Joint Food Committee run by the three governments will be dissolved on July 1st, and its tasks will be taken over by the International Food Relief Committee. The Joint Food Committee was originally planned to be maintained until the end of this year.

### British Military Police in Palestine Conduct Lightning Search of Jewish Areas, Deploying Aircraft and Tanks as if Facing a Great Enemy; Several Jewish Leaders Arrested

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: As a result of yesterday's search in Palestine, a total of 2,000 Jews were arrested.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 29th]

British military police specifically chose the Jewish Sabbath today, deploying aircraft and tanks on a large scale to arrest 1,000 Jews in various parts of Palestine, opening safes and seizing more than 1,000 documents, conducting lightning inspections, and implementing curfews at night.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th]

British troops and Palestinian police suddenly searched the headquarters of the World Jewish Agency and more than ten Jewish areas in Tel Aviv and Haifa simultaneously in a lightning manner, arresting several Jewish leaders. Shertok, the political director of the Jewish Agency, political advisor Joseph, and Fishman were also among those arrested.

Eradicating Terrorist Activities

The British action is said to be part of an overall plan to prevent the Jewish terrorist movement. A statement issued at noon said that the search was proceeding according to plan and had not encountered any resistance. Tel Aviv was still quiet. British engineers used explosives to blow open the Harbor Bank and the Jewish Women's Association building, searching person by person. There was no serious loss after the explosion. In the North Ofer district south of Tel Aviv, three Jews were injured trying to break through the cordon. In the Hasharon district between Tel Aviv and Haifa, 40 Jews were detained. In Rehovot, where the residence of World Jewish Congress President Weizmann is located, Jewish youths piled obstacles on the road, and some people destroyed the transportation blockade. The military surrounded the World Jewish Congress headquarters in the Rehavia district here at night. The troops entered the headquarters at dawn and began to move various documents to await inspection. At the same time, they searched the residence of Fishman, the acting chairman of the executive committee of the Congress, and took Fishman onto a truck. In total, several well-known Jewish leaders were arrested in a few hours.

All Traffic Cut Off

Sir John Shaw, Chief Secretary of the Palestinian government, also announced that all traffic between Palestine and the outside world would be cut off from 4:00 am to 10:00 am. Palestinian High Commissioner Cunningham also broadcast to Jewish residents, stating that the search of the Jewish Agency was due to its involvement in recent terrorist cases, and said that the British government is determined to eradicate terrorist activities, and any illegal actions in the future will be subject to strong sanctions. Today's large-scale search operation was carried out on the order of General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, and will be stopped as soon as the goal of controlling terrorist activities is achieved. The door to negotiations is not closed. Haifa was quiet under military alert blockade. The Jewish General Labor Union of Tel Aviv and the residences of some Jewish leaders were also searched.

Notification to the United States in Advance

[Reuters, London, 29th] A Foreign Office spokesman said: The British government informed the US government of its decision to arrest the leaders of the Jewish Agency at the beginning of this week, because it is necessary to maintain peace and security within Palestine.

### Another Swindle Due to Failed Speculation: 20 Gold Bars and $10 Million in Promissory Notes Defrauded; Shen Jialin, Manager of Baofeng Gold Firm, Harms Others and Himself; Both People and Stolen Goods Recovered Within a Day and a Night

[Report from This Newspaper] Shen Jialin (22 years old, Ningbo native), the manager of Baofeng Gold Firm at 561 Nanjing Road, suffered huge losses due to failed speculation. He then had a bad idea and colluded with employees of the firm to commit fraud. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday (29th), Shen went to Zhang Zhuju's residence at 14 Lane 520 Ningbo Road, soliciting the sale of five gold bars, stating that the price would be settled according to the market price of 1.978 million yuan. Zhang agreed to deliver the gold bars in the afternoon. Zhang, who had transactions with the same industry in the past, did not suspect him and gave him a promissory note from Yongting Bank (with a face value of 10 million yuan). After Shen obtained the note, he delivered it to Chuanfeng Bank to offset the account. Then, at 2:30 PM, he and his partners Zhou Fuchang and Hong Fei defrauded 20 gold bars from Tongfengyu Gold Firm in Overseas Chinese Building on Central Road in the same way, saying that payment could be made at 5:00 PM. When Zhang Zhuju and Tongfengyu Gold Firm sent personnel to collect the gold bars and cash, they discovered that Baofeng Gold Firm had been emptied. The case was reported to the old Zhabei Branch. With the supervision of Criminal Stock Chief Jiang Shangpei, Police Sergeant Song Shaomei, Police Officer Sha Juemin, and others, they rushed to the gold firm and only arrested apprentice You Fengming. After strict questioning, they arrested Zhou Fuchang and Hong Fei at 8 Xin'erli, North Sichuan Road at 9:00 PM that night. According to the confession, there were three gold bars at Shui Youcai's place at 236 Southern Hotel, Jiujiang Road, and they immediately went to retrieve them. Afterwards, they obtained a clue that Shen had lurked in Luodian. Stock Member Song Shaomei and others rushed to the Luodian Bus Station to wait. At about 6:00 AM the next morning, Shen Jialin was seen arriving, preparing to take a bus back to Shanghai, and was immediately arrested. Two gold bars and 500,000 yuan in cash were found in his pockets. They then went to the home of his uncle Shen Xinkang at 13 North Street, Outer Town of Luodian, and found 11 gold bars, which were transported to Shen Xinkang in Shanghai together. Then they went to the home of Shen You Yao Tingzhou at 8 Qingyuanli, Tangjialong, Suzhou Road, and found two gold bars. It is said that two gold bars have been sold by Zhou Fuchang and others for 4 million yuan, and the 500,000 yuan in cash found on Shen's body is also part of the stolen money. The case, from its occurrence to the arrest of all the criminals, only took a day and a night, which can be said to be rapid.

### Demanding Reduction of Entertainment Tax; Theater Industry in the Whole City Stopped Performances Today; Mayor Persuaded Them to Resume Business Tomorrow; Spoken Drama and Movies Are Still Being Shown Today

[Report from This Newspaper] Because the request to reduce taxes was not approved by the municipal government, the Theater Industry Association of this city unanimously decided to automatically suspend business indefinitely starting today, and movies and spoken drama will also suspend business for one day today to show their response. Mayor Wu believed that such actions not only hindered public image but also caused the public to stand in opposition to the government, which was inappropriate. In order to avoid the expansion of the situation, he specially summoned Zhou Jianxing, the director of the association, to the city government at 9:00 am in the morning and persuaded him on the spot, saying that since he took office, there have been many difficulties, and he has tried his best to solve them. At present, the city government's difficulties are still very serious. I hope the Theater Industry Association will not act rashly and increase the difficulties of the administrative authorities. Mr. Zhou expressed that he was very moved by the mayor's sincere persuasion, but his personal opinion was not enough to represent all members, and he was afraid that he could not fully grasp the development of the situation. Mayor Wu immediately issued a hand-written message, saying: June and July are slow months for tax revenue, and the city government already feels tight even if it collects the entertainment tax at the current rate of 50%. Therefore, it is difficult to approve the reduction of the entertainment tax. I hope you can think about the difficulties of the city government and cooperate. Starting from August, if the tax revenue situation improves, it can be considered first. After Mr. Zhou Jianxing obtained the mayor's hand-written message, he held a general meeting of all members at the Tianchan Stage yesterday afternoon and reported the process of meeting the mayor in detail. At that time, there were many opinions and disputes in the meeting place. As a result, it was unanimously decided that the member theaters would suspend business for one day today and then resume business tomorrow and make a decision later. The spoken drama and film industries no longer needed to suspend business, so they were open as usual today.

### Shanghai General Issues; Mayor Answers Questions from American Reporters

[United Press, This City, 30th] Mayor Wu Guozhen met with reporters from the Associated Press today when he left the city government to discuss matters with Food Minister Xu Kan, briefly discussing various issues in Shanghai, saying: The anti-US demonstrations in Shanghai's anti-civil war movement were instigated by the Communist Party and should be held responsible. Regarding the accumulation of small thefts at the docks, the monthly loss of imported goods reaches hundreds of millions of yuan in legal tender, and he is planning prevention methods. The reporter asked about the economic danger of this city as Shanghai's British, Dutch, Swiss, Norwegian and French leaders recently wrote to the mayor, and the mayor replied that he clearly understood this danger and would do his best to overcome it. The reporter asked whether he intended to limit prices. The mayor replied, no, the situation here is not conducive to price limits. He also said that the issue of housing rent is under study, but the remedy will not be adopted until he is confident. He has appointed Chinese and foreign non-commissioned officers to form a committee to study British issues. Importing mobile homes cannot solve the housing problem because their prices are too expensive. For street vendors, it is planned to concentrate them in designated areas so that no vendors are seen on important thoroughfares. Finally, the mayor also confirmed that the National Government had explicitly prohibited civilians from owning jeeps.

### Scope of Investigation Group of the Housing Allocation Committee Narrowed

Since its establishment, the Housing Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan in Shanghai has been aimed at handling the housing allocation of various institutions in Shanghai, and so far, not many institutions have obtained housing allocated by the committee. According to a voice from the committee yesterday: The investigation work has come to an end, and some of the investigation team's personnel will be laid off today, and further reductions will be made as needed in the future. It is said that the committee strives to complete the allocation work in the shortest possible time so that it can be concluded.

### Mayor Wu Visited Xu Kan Yesterday to Discuss Food Issues

Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Mayor Wu personally visited Food Minister Xu Kan, who came to Shanghai from Nanjing last weekend, at his private residence.

### Registered Smokers in the City to be Randomly Inspected Starting Today; Those Who Fail to Quit Will Be Severely Punished

The government is extremely determined to eradicate opium. Following the Ministry of Interior's order to the Municipal Police Bureau to conduct smoker registration this year, the registration period ended at the end of March. Over six thousand smokers registered. The bureau then designated April 1st to June 30th as the voluntary quitting period, which ended yesterday. According to Mr. Fang Zhichao, the Chief of the Administrative Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, the police bureau will begin randomly inspecting registered smokers starting today (1st). This inspection process will follow the order of registration and be conducted one by one. The most common inspection method will be testing the smoker's feces and urine, followed by observing whether the smoker has an opium addiction. If the investigation results show that they have not quit and still have evidence of opium use, they will be punished severely without leniency, according to wartime regulations.

Miss Robbie, Daughter of the Philippine President (Photo by Our Reporter Yu Chuangshuo)

### Philippine President's Daughter, Miss Robbie, Arrives in Shanghai; Flies Back to Manila This Morning; Accompanied by Two Dogs, One Big and One Small

[Report from Our Newspaper] Miss Robbie Roxas, daughter of the Philippine President, traveled from the United States aboard the "Lin克斯" [Lin克斯 - likely transliteration] to celebrate Philippine Independence Day on July 4th, arriving in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. Those welcoming her at the dock included Luo Changge, Chairman of the Philippine Independence Day Committee in Shanghai; Rosa, the Vice Consul of the American Consulate; Miss Liu Banye of the Municipal Government's Protocol Section, representing Mayor Wu and his wife; Gao Lingbai, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai; and several hundred Filipinos residing here.

Miss Roxas is the only daughter of Philippine President Roxas, whom he loves dearly. She has fine yellow hair, fair skin, is of medium height, and has a slender figure. She wore a white straw hat, a white-based red and green floral silk dress, and coffee-colored open-toed high-heeled leather shoes. Her demeanor was very demure. It is no wonder that Commander 巴生 [Ba Sheng], the US Navy advisor to her father, who came especially from Manila to pick her up, told us in advance that she was a very charming and gentle lady.

Miss Roxas is twenty-four years old. She has a younger brother studying in Manila. Before the war, she went to the United States to study in middle school. After the Pearl Harbor incident, she returned to Manila and then went back to the United States ten months ago. She is currently a junior studying literature at Vassar College. She loves music and has been learning piano since childhood. She started learning the harp in 1937. This is her third time in Shanghai. The first time she came, she was only thirteen years old, and unfortunately, she only stayed for a few days. When asked what she would do after graduation, Miss Roxas said, "I very much hope to help my father do some things."

"Along the way, I was eager to see Shanghai again, but unfortunately, I have to fly to Manila early tomorrow morning. Also, I originally wanted to come to Shanghai to buy some things, but now it's too late." Because Miss Roxas arrived too late, the welcome party planned by the Philippine community at the International Hotel at 3:00 PM had to be canceled. Commander 巴生 hosted a celebratory banquet for her in the evening.

Miss Roxas is returning to Manila specifically to participate in the Independence Day celebrations. After that, she will return to the United States to complete her studies. Accompanying her on the flight to Manila were Philippine Education Minister Mrs. 加利可 [Jia Like] and five others, as well as one large and one small dog. In addition, there were more than two hundred Filipinos returning to the country from the United States aboard the "Lin克斯" [Lin克斯 - likely transliteration].

### Lu Qixin on the Same Ship Arrives Near Shanghai

[Another News Item] Lu Qixin, Special Correspondent for the Central News Agency in the United States, also arrived on the same ship yesterday. Mr. Zeng Yifu, the former Minister of Transportation who was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, is now scheduled to arrive this morning.

### Department Store Employees Respond to the National Products Promotion Movement

Since the Federation of Labor Unions initiated the "National Products Promotion Movement" in the city, all members of the Third District Department Store Workers' Union have responded. They plan to use their advantageous position as sales clerks to promote domestic products to customers as much as possible, in order to save the current crisis of foreign goods dominating the market. It is reported that other district department store workers' unions and other related industry workers' unions in the city will also respond within days, notifying their members to work hard to promote domestic products, and will hold a meeting of department store worker representatives from all over the city within days to study methods for promoting and publicizing national products.

### Hospitals are Full, but the Fight Against the Epidemic Continues; Efforts are Being Made to Eradicate It

The number of cholera cases in the city is increasing daily, and the severity is worrying. We have learned the following information from relevant parties:

Hospital Beds Full

There are currently 590 isolation beds in the city: 250 in the First and Second Municipal Infectious Disease Hospitals, 150 in the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, 100 in Guangci Hospital, and 70 in the Emergency Epidemic Hospital. Except for Guangci Hospital, which still has more than 20 empty beds, all other hospitals and private epidemic hospitals announced yesterday that they were full and unable to accommodate more patients. Therefore, the authorities have notified hospitals that are full not to send any more patients.

Rapid Increase Sought

The Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital admitted more than 40 people who appeared to have cholera yesterday, and three died. Starting today, an epidemic outpatient clinic will be opened. Epidemic patients, regardless of wealth, will be treated free of charge, and medicine will be administered day and night, with treatment available upon arrival. Since the discovery of cholera, the hospital has treated 324 real cholera patients and administered surveillance injections for suspected cholera and acute gastroenteritis to over 2,000 people. Regarding the shortage of hospital beds, the authorities are currently seeking remedies. The Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan has recently donated prefabricated wooden houses, and funds are being requested for their construction. The National Medical College can borrow the Fenglin Qiao Zhongshan Hospital when necessary, and allocate beds, equipment, and medical personnel. It is hoped that 400 more beds can be added in the shortest possible time, but preparations still need to be stepped up and completed quickly.

Epidemic Prevention Symposium

Gu Yuqi, President of Tongde Medical College, convened more than 80 senior students and teachers from the college at 10:00 AM yesterday, and invited Wang Jiansheng, District Head of the Eleventh District, Lian Mingzhong, Deputy District Head, and more than 20 Bao chiefs and Bao officers to hold a district epidemic prevention symposium at the college. First, Director Zhang of the Health Bureau gave a speech, followed by discussions on the implementation of immune injections, banning unsanitary food, and expanding publicity.

The Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Brigade departed today in 25 teams, coordinating with the health inspection teams to crack down on unsanitary food items in the cholera-stricken areas.

The Health Testing Laboratory cultivates and tests bacteria, and although it is a holiday, it does not stop. Yesterday, 63 cases were confirmed as true cholera, and 8 were retested, bringing the total to 843.

### Zhang Tianshi Brings with Him a "Priceless Treasure": An Imperial Jade Seal Handed Down by Emperor Shizu; Dragon Shape on the Left, Tiger Shape on the Right; Said to Have Many Confirmed Facts of Subduing Demons

[Report from Our Newspaper] Two years before the War of Resistance, Zhang Tianshi (Enpu), the 63rd generation of the Zhang Tianshi lineage from Mount Longhu in Jiangxi, preached the Dharma at the Shanghai Great World, causing a sensation. After the War of Resistance, this Zhang Tianshi quietly returned to his hometown.

Time passed quickly, and victory finally came. This Zhang Tianshi, nearly fifty years old, also came to Shanghai again after the victory. This time, it was for the establishment of the Chinese Taoist Association. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, he visited Mayor Wu and the heads of major Buddhist lay associations and friendly religious members.

The reporter met Tianshi yesterday and talked with him for half an hour. From this Tianshi, I learned something about the general situation of Taoism. He said, "Taoism is based on Lao Tzu's teachings. The highest school is the 'Zhengyi' sect. Below there are the 'Longmen' and 'Quanzhen' sects. The only difference between these sects is that 'Zhengyi' can wear casual clothes, and there is no difference between being at home and being a monk, while 'Longmen' and 'Quanzhen' must keep their hair, wear Taoist robes, and eat pure vegetarian food." The reporter also asked about the origin of Tianshi's title, the situation of Mount Longhu, and whether he had the so-called power to catch demons. He said seriously, "Since the beginning when Emperor Shizu Daolinggong was granted the title of Tianshi, it has been more than two thousand two hundred years to this day. But before Emperor Shizu, our earliest ancestor was actually Zhang Liang, who was nine generations away from Emperor Shizu, making a total of seventy-two generations. Mount Longhu is in Guixi County, about fifty li away from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. It is not high, because the mountain on the left is shaped like a dragon, and the mountain on the right is shaped like a tiger, so it is named that way. As for the saying of catching demons, there are indeed many facts of subduing demons on the mountain, but in today's era of scientific advancement, we really don't need to make a sound. In the end, Taoism is a truth and teaching that is righteous and not evil, beneficial and harmless."

Finally, he also told the reporter: Emperor Shizu passed down many Dharma instruments, books, sutras, and the Tao Te Ching, etc. In addition, there are two priceless treasures, one is the jade seal, and the other is the true sword. This time he came to Shanghai, he brought a jade seal, and in the future, he may hold a disaster-relief ceremony in Shanghai.

### US Military Takes Cautious Precautions to Avoid Accidents

The US military authorities in the city are taking strict precautions to prevent accidents from happening. They have strictly ordered US soldiers to act with caution. On days when there are parades, US military personnel are prohibited from going out. Military police have been added to the US military residential areas to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. Yesterday, due to rumors of mass parades, the US military authorities immediately implemented martial law and advised officers and soldiers not to go out unless necessary.

### Zhenru and Longhua Telephone Exchanges Officially Open Mid-Month; Shanghai-Hankou Calls Also to be Officially Available

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is actively rectifying the telephones in Hongkou, Zhabei, and the suburbs of the city. Yesterday, according to a responsible person from the bureau, who tempted and coerced [誘逼 - likely a typo in the original article] a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the sub-bureaus currently being set up by the bureau are: (1) the Longhua Sub-Bureau, equipped with 200 automatic telephone numbers; (2) the Zhenru Sub-Bureau, equipped with 50 manual telephone numbers; and the Nanshi Sub-Bureau, which is expanding its capacity by 1,200 telephones. The installation of these equipment and machines has been completed. It was originally scheduled to be completed yesterday and officially opened today, but because the Zhenru factory is still under repair, the Longhua Sub-Bureau is still unaware of the circuits, and the Nanshi Sub-Bureau's equipment needs to be adjusted, the opening date must be postponed slightly. The most difficult thing at the moment is the lack of talent for wiring. The bureau is currently adding a telecommunications training class, specializing in training telecommunications personnel. The first batch of trainees will officially graduate within days and will be assigned to the Zhenru, Longhua, and Nanshi Sub-Bureaus for formal service. The opening of the above three bureaus will be delayed until the 15th of this month, when they can be officially opened. The routes that the bureau is currently planning to expand also include the Pudong Sub-Bureau, with 180 manual telephone numbers, and the Wusong Sub-Bureau, with 50 manual telephone numbers. However, the transportation of materials to the Pudong Sub-Bureau is difficult, and the factory building of the Wusong Sub-Bureau is occupied by a certain unit. Negotiations are currently underway with the garrison command. If the location goes smoothly, it can also be officially opened in mid-August.

Wireless Telephone Opening Time

In addition, in order to facilitate domestic communications, the Nanjing Telecommunications Bureau previously installed a wireless radio station in Shanghai. Due to route restrictions, only Chongqing, Taipei, Hankou, Beiping, and Guangzhou were opened. Previously, the call times for each location were: (1) Chongqing, 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM; (2) Taipei, 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (3) Hankou, 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM; (4) Beiping, 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM; (5) Guangzhou, 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Recently, the equipment at this station has been malfunctioning and unable to operate smoothly. It is currently being actively repaired and is expected to be completed within days.

Installation of Long-Distance Radio Station in Hankou

Currently, telephone communication between Shanghai and Hankou is highly anticipated, but because telephone communication between Shanghai and Hankou is not sufficient, calls are very difficult to make. In order to remedy this difficulty, the bureau recently installed a wired telephone between Shanghai and Hankou. The installation has now been completed, and a test call has been made, but the voice was not clear. It is currently being modified and is expected to be officially available in mid-month.

### Daily Noon News Stopped Yesterday

It was previously stipulated that a vigilance alert would be issued every Sunday at 9:00 AM, and a time-synchronized alarm would be issued daily at noon. As of June 30th, all of these have been stopped. The municipal government has notified the garrison headquarters.

### The Chinese Musical Theater Troupe Intensifies Rehearsals for New Play; Going to the United States for Performances in the Fall; Raising Funds for Wartime Orphans

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chinese Musical Theater Troupe, established with the support of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, will be going abroad after the autumn coolness. Under the leadership of Mr. Avraham Shlonsky, the troupe members have been intensifying rehearsals in recent days. Before going to the United States, they are preparing to rehearse at least four plays—*Ancient Temple Dream*, *Meng Jiangnu*, *Five Planets*, and *Rippling Hearts*, all written and composed by Mr. Avraham Shlonsky. The first two plays have already been performed, and the latter two are new. Each play is filled with the advantages of Italian opera and full of Chinese affection. It can be said that introducing Chinese ancient customs in such a lofty and clear style is a first in diplomatic relations, and it will surely attract the appreciation of most allied personnel. In order to clearly understand the detailed situation inside the troupe, the reporter specially went to "Yituan," the place where they often rehearse, for an interview.

From 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day, these young troupe members are active on the flat roof of the front running field bleachers. When the reporter visited, he saw them each showing their talents, rehearsing attentively under the leadership of Mr. Avraham Shlonsky. Looking at Mr. Avraham Shlonsky's silvery white hair, fluctuating up and down due to the intense work, the reporter naturally could not step forward to disturb him. Miss Yang Rongji, the secretary and general affairs officer of the troupe, introduced the details of the troupe to the reporter. Miss Yang has been an old friend of Mr. Avraham Shlonsky for more than ten years, and this time, she will also go to the United States with the troupe.

Thirty-Five Troupe Members Nationwide

The purpose of the Chinese Musical Theater Troupe is to promote Chinese music and culture. Their mission to the United States this time is to raise funds for wartime orphans. The number of troupe members has been decided to be thirty-five, of which twenty-six are actors, equally divided between men and women, and the others are staff. The troupe's selection of actors is very strict, and academic ability, appearance, physique, and behavior must be examined in all aspects. The most important thing is to understand Chinese dance. Most of the existing troupe members are amateur actors. You Zhenglan is also one of them. They once publicly recruited, and although the number of applicants was very enthusiastic, there were very few who qualified. Now they are continuing their efforts to find more people. The confirmed members include consultant Shen Zhibai (professor of music at Shanghai University), deputy director Chen Chui, choir conductor Huang Yongkun, art director Chi Ning, and several actors such as Wang Yuan.

The funds for the Chinese Musical Theater Troupe are entirely donated by Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The widespread circulation that the funds were allocated by the government is not actually the case. After the victory, when Madame Chiang first came to Shanghai, due to the introduction of Madame Sun Yat-sen, Madame Chiang personally recognized *Meng Jiangnu* at a reception for the Allied forces held by the Wartime Service Corps. She believed that this play was enough to spread Chinese culture, so she generously supported it. Now, under the nurturing of Madame Chiang, this newborn baby will be ready to take its first steps after three more months of training.

Their destination is New York. They have now begun to contact the Melropolier Musie Bearau (this is the largest organization in the American music industry, specializing in renting theaters on its behalf. When Dr. Mei Lanfang stayed in the United States, it was also responsible for contacting the theaters on his behalf). If the performance is successful and the tickets are selling well, they hope to travel around, and the ideal is to tour all of Europe.

Regarding their passports, Miss Yang said: There is absolutely no problem, because of the help of General Manager Deng Shiping (appointed by Madame Chiang). Miss Yang told the reporter: "Mr. Deng's help to us is very great. He is the general manager, but he is also a musician. He is usually approachable and often jokes..."

Wang Yuan Participates in Liaison Dance

While talking about raising funds, Mr. Zheng walked over. He is indeed a talkative person. After Miss Yang introduced him, he said: "Shanghai people are really fabrication experts, and they often like to say things that are supposed to be good in a negative way. The Chinese Musical Theater Troupe is clearly such a glorious organization, with a positive and brilliant future, but some people insist on saying that it is a scam, saying that it is deceiving children and women and selling them to the United States"? Then he pointed to Wang Yuan, who was practicing dancing, and secretly told me, "Wang Yuan's Chinese dance is the most fundamental, but the newspapers insist on promoting her as a hula dance expert!"

Then Mr. Zheng visited him with the greatest optimism about the future of the troupe. He had lived in the United States for a long time, and he knew what Americans liked. A troupe that is so well-prepared and so strong is only destined for success, not failure.

At this time, the air raid siren went off, and the rehearsal of *Five Planets* could come to an end. The reporter quickly grabbed Mr. Avraham Shlonsky and had a brief conversation. I learned that Mr. Avraham Shlonsky is exactly fifty years old this year. Thirty years ago, he left his home country - the Soviet Union - and came to China to study ancient Chinese music. He is familiar with Chinese customs and likes to eat Chinese food. He said that he would also like to become a Chinese citizen. After this trip to the United States, he will still return to China because he wants to continue this work. He regards this work as his lifelong career.

### Relief for Northern Jiangsu Refugees: Wang Jinshan's Painting Exhibition Opens Today for Seven Days

Professor Wang Jinshan's painting exhibition to benefit the Northern Jiangsu refugees held a preview yesterday afternoon at Nantong College. Having received an invitation in advance, the reporter, eager to "see it first," was guided by Professor Wang and spent a full hour observing the scene:

Professor Wang's artistic style inherits the orthodox brushwork of the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. It seems that his paintings reveal him as a multifaceted artist, including landscapes, figures, birds and animals, and flowers. Among these, the Buddhist images in the figure category are the essence of all his works!

Entering the right corner of the painting exhibition, a painting numbered 50, featuring a bare-chested, handsome man with a beautiful beard in plain clothes, holding a cattail fan, exuded an unrestrained and joyful spirit. His old face was full of smiles—the laughter of victory. Professor Wang said that when the news of the initial victories of the previous year's war spread, he was

reminded of Du Fu's poem: "In broad daylight, we must sing and freely drink wine; in youthful company, we can still return to our villages." The depressed mood of many years suddenly blossomed, and thus this exquisite work was completed.

The reporter also enjoyed many "Luohan" portrait works, each with its own expression and style. When seeing the large portrait of "The Venerable Damo" numbered 88, one saw a powerful and forceful brushwork. The colors were elegant; the vermilion robe subtly set off Damo's robust body, giving one a sense of boundless vigor. However, the adjacent painting of "White Lotus," a white flower, gave one a feeling of purity and serenity!

The painting "Reed Geese" numbered 66 is composed of four screen panels. The goose flock on the painting each have a distinctive appearance. The brushstrokes of the two clumps of sugar cane leaves and the sugar cane stalks appear strong and powerful! After seeing this painting, it seems as if one is in the desolate autumn scene, strolling along the desolate reed bank!

The large painting numbered 13, "Displaced People," was displayed before the reporter. The painting is adorned with two or three ancient-dressed, elderly and weak refugees, supporting the old and leading the young, holding crutches, carrying baggage, wandering around aimlessly. In the distance, a corner of the ancient city wall is faintly visible. However, the refugees face a vast, uncertain future, unable to find a home! Professor Wang inscribed on the painting: "Returning east in May of the thirty-fifth year, the Northern Jiangsu region is unstable, the refugees are displaced, and I, too, have no home to return to. I write this painting to express my sentiments." This painting fully symbolizes the current tragic situation in Northern Jiangsu. Although priced at two million yuan, I believe that those who care about the Northern Jiangsu refugees will not hesitate to spend money to compete for it.

In addition, the painting numbered 25, "Small Island," and the painting numbered 45, "Rural Flavor," although painted with simple brushstrokes, give one a lasting impression. The painting numbered 61, "The Venerable Samantabhadra," is a brushwork in the style of the late Tang Dynasty. The painting numbered 20, "Sounds of Pines and Plum Blossoms," with verdant pines and white plum blossoms complementing each other, is also a rare work.

When the reporter stepped into the painting room, it was extremely hot outside, inevitably causing one to sweat profusely. However, after enjoying an hour of "ice-cold" art, the heat wave had unknowingly disappeared.

Professor Wang is a multifaceted artist. He has been teaching at the Central Political School for five years. In his spare time, in addition to painting, he has also written plays such as "Tuberose," "Willow Lantern Transformation," "Double Swallow Building," "Fisherman, Woodcutter, and Reader," and "Sun and Moon Competing for Glory." In addition, he has also served as a director, written "Mountain and Tang Sketches," and edited publications such as "Literary Monthly" and "Literary Vanguard." The current painting exhibition is just one aspect of his versatile talent.

Professor Wang's paintings will be on public exhibition from today until the 7th, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily, at Nantong College on Chongqing North Road and Weihaiwei Road. During yesterday's preview, the reporter discovered that many exquisite pieces had already been purchased. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who care about the Northern Jiangsu refugees and the arts will go and appreciate them! (Cang Long)

### A Gang Pilfered Valuable Western Medicines; Both People and Goods Were Seized

[Report from this newspaper] Patrol officers from the Xinshi Street Police Station of the City Police Bureau intercepted a Donghua chartered car, number 20002, on Xiangyin Road the night before last.

### Proposed Amendments to the Banking Law Attract Close Attention from the Financial Sector; Zhu Sihuang Expresses Opinions on the Draft

The Ministry of Finance's proposed amendments to the Banking Law, which are currently being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, have attracted close attention from the financial sector. To clarify the contents, the reporter specifically interviewed Zhu Sihuang, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, who revealed the following key points: (1) Article 3 of the draft states that the minimum capital for a bank organized as a limited liability company is 2 million yuan. It is said that this amount is based on the standard after currency stabilization. If so, it is not applicable at present, and the legislation should be realistic. The capital amount is difficult for the public to understand. (2) Regarding the deposit reserve requirement, Zhu believes that according to the draft provisions, the reserve requirement for current deposits can be as high as 20% and the reserve requirement for time deposits can be as high as 15%, to be deposited with the Central Bank. According to this ratio, if it is a truly liquid reserve, there is no problem. However, the so-called reserve is actually a stagnant guarantee. In addition, the bank itself needs to maintain a considerable amount of cash and clearing balances, about 40%. The deposits that the bank can use are only about 30% or 40%. How can the bank's capital position be flexible? (3) The restrictions on business operations seem too strict. For example, loans to the industrial and mining industries are limited to no less than 20%, otherwise, they will be penalized. On this point, the Central Bank has a large amount of deposits on hand, and may not have suitable industrial and mining loan targets for a while. Also, what if there is a large-scale recovery of industrial and mining loans? Wouldn't this be treated the same? (4) Furthermore, restricting banks from being shareholders of other companies and allowing banks to trade in securities seems contradictory in fact. (5) Mortgage loans on immovable property must not exceed 10% of the bank's paid-in capital surplus. Although the amount is small, most factories currently rely on factory buildings and land as collateral for financing. Although this provision is reasonable in principle, does it meet the needs of the superior and inferior in the Chinese industrial and commercial environment? (6) The provision of limited liability for banks and joint liability for shareholders is not only practically impossible, but also does not help to protect depositors' interests. Zhu concluded by saying that although the provisions for foreign banks were not in the old Banking Law, these provisions are of course suitable for the environment. However, foreign banks have a full range of business operations, such as deposits, discounts, and international remittances. Unfortunately, there are many obstacles to the business operations of Chinese banks.

Education and Sports

### Ministry of Education Recently Adjusted the National Water Conservancy Education Institutions; Central Facilities to be Developed Separately in the Southeast, Northwest, and Other Regions

[Special report from Chongqing] Based on the resolution of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang to train a large number of water conservancy talents, the Ministry of Education formulated measures, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, to establish secondary water conservancy departments. It designated the National Yellow River Basin Water Conservancy Engineering Vocational School, which had relatively complete equipment, the Shaanxi Provincial Sanyuan Industrial and Vocational School, the Water Conservancy Department Vocational School attached to the Qijiang Dao Huai Committee, and the private Nanchong Yucai Senior Vocational School as four units to handle the matter, reaching 24 classes. In addition, the Ministry of Education designated the Private Yizhi Agricultural Vocational School in Shaanxi, named after the water conservancy master Li Yizhi, to run three classes in farmland water conservancy. However, these water conservancy education institutions were all concentrated in the rear. Recently, a special adjustment has been made: the Water Conservancy Department Vocational School of the Dao Huai Committee was moved to Jinshan, Jiangnan, Jiangsu; and a branch school was set up in Huaibei, Anhui, which will be the central facility for secondary water conservancy education in eastern China. Nanchong Yucai Vocational School remains in Nanchong, Sichuan, as the central facility for water conservancy education in western China. Sanyuan Industrial and Vocational School remains in Sanyuan, Shaanxi, and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Vocational School returns from Jiji, Shaanxi, to Kaifeng, Henan, together with the farmland water conservancy department of the Private Yizhi Agricultural Vocational School in Shaanxi. These three schools are the central facilities for Yongli education in northern China. The southern region also urgently needs this type of talent, but this department is still lacking. It has been specially designated that the Guangdong Provincial Guangzhou Senior Industrial Vocational School add this department. Two classes will be opened this year. The Ministry of Education will allocate funds for construction and regular expenses, limited to enrollment and classes this summer, and then increase by two classes each year to reach six classes, in order to establish a central facility for secondary water conservancy education in southern China and plan to promote national water conservancy construction. Ningxia Province also urgently needs farmland water conservancy talents, and it has also been decided to add a farmland water conservancy department in the province this year. (An)

### Examination Dates for Studying Abroad

Publicly Funded Exam Starts July 21; Privately Funded Exam Around July 28

[Special report from Yujing] The regulations for publicly and privately funded students studying abroad this year were announced on June 29 by the examination committee office of the Ministry of Education: Those who have passed the higher civil service examination and have served for more than two years are also eligible to participate in the publicly and privately funded study abroad examination. Therefore, those who have passed the higher examination and meet this requirement also registered for the exam. Because the deadline was the end of June, a five-day extension was granted for those from remote areas, with the registration deadline being July 5. Due to the short deadline, the registration office at the Ministry of Education was full every day. It is reported that there are now over 600 registrants. It is heard that the publicly funded exam is scheduled to start on July 21, and the privately funded exam will be held after the 26th, around July 28. It is also heard that the Ministry of Education will re-adjust the study abroad measures for the next year. The publicly funded students will of course be strictly examined. Whether the privately funded students studying abroad will be given more leniency with reference to the situation before the war, or whether they will still be examined in the same way as publicly funded students, will depend on the future needs and construction of talents, and appropriate adaptation will determine the measures. (Yu)

### Yuchang Loans Against Warehouse Receipts from Before the War Are Not Repayments of Recovered Spoils; Three Associations Still Trying to Negotiate

[Our Newspaper] Reports in various newspapers in recent days have mentioned that the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau is returning a portion of enemy-seized cotton cloth. This reporter has inquired with relevant parties and learned that the portion of cotton cloth returned by the Disposal Bureau is actually from warehouse receipts issued by the British Yuchang Factory before the outbreak of the Pacific War, for goods that the holders did not have time to pick up. It is not surplus cotton cloth purchased by the enemy or puppet regimes. As for the surplus cotton cloth that the dyeing and weaving, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn associations have requested to be returned, their previous appeal to the National Business Receiving Committee in the Recovered Areas of the Executive Yuan has been rejected. They have been informed that the committee has been ordered to disband and cannot accept appeals. Therefore, the dyeing and weaving association and others have filed an administrative lawsuit with the Administrative Court. At the same time, they telegraphed the National Political Council to urge the Executive Yuan to promptly return the cloth. A summary of their telegram to the Political Council states that in the case of the forced purchase of cotton cloth, both the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Commerce have upheld justice and made resolutions to request the government to investigate and return it. However, the review committee of the Bureau, first believing that the cotton cloth may have been moved or sold, making it impossible to investigate, and then believing that the enemy and puppet regimes offered favorable terms for the purchase of cotton cloth, so merchants suffered little loss, displayed a biased view that recognized the enemy's benevolence. For over half a year, no progress has been made. Last month, the committee even resolved to treat the seized cotton cloth as government materials and hand it over to the Textile Construction Corporation for bidding. This has caused great indignation and a strike protest. The committee does not consider that all materials owned by merchants were forcibly seized by the enemy and puppet regimes. Although they gave a price, it was essentially robbery. How can there be any thinness to speak of? Victims were angry but dared not speak out under the high pressure of violence at the time. Today, they are crying out in pain and only ask for the pursuit of the thieves. Unexpectedly, the administrator instead takes the thief's actions as benevolent, and puts the thief's loot in the warehouse. This is not reasonable in any way in terms of law or reason. The association bears the responsibility of correcting the enemy's seizure of property and maintaining post-war popular sentiment. The so-called favorable purchase method is indeed difficult to understand, and the so-called transfer of goods is not the merchant's responsibility. These words not only make it difficult for the industry to willingly comply, but also make the people disappointed and disheartened. Recently, the Bureau has been retrieving and auctioning cotton cloth that was ordered to be kept by the victims of the former puppet merchant associations, causing increasing anxiety among the people. In addition to writing to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it is appropriate to telegraph to request that the original resolution of the previous conference be reviewed and that the Executive Yuan be urged to promptly order the return in order to maintain public hope and demonstrate relief.

### Guangdong Merchants Order US Loans; Still Buying Drafts in Hong Kong; Export Loans Relatively Active

[United Press, June 29] The Guangzhou Daily reported today that although foreign exchange can be formally applied for from June 1st, the actual number of applicants is not very large, because most importers are ordering goods from the United States through Hong Kong. These importers send people to the UK to purchase low-priced goods, such as used clothes and other used goods, which, when they arrive here, will be far cheaper than those made domestically. Guangzhou's export trade includes tung oil, leaf vegetables, and banana fans. Although the prices of these goods are high, the sales channels are still smooth.

### After the Collapse of the Daya Bank, Formal Liquidation Announced

Following the collapse of the Daya Bank at 19 Tianjin Road, the bank's board of directors resolved yesterday to request formal liquidation by lawyers and accountants. Senior bank officials such as Du Shiling and Wen Fengxin, who were involved in the fraud, have been detained by the District Prosecutor's Office pending legal resolution. It is reported that Jiang and others gambled with huge sums of money and failed with speculative investments in national bonds and stocks. Only a portion of the overdrafts involved a small number of re-mortgaged items, leading to other disputes.

### 4/6 Size Galvanized Pipe Is Scarce; Iron Wire Cloth Arrives in Large Quantities

Galvanized pipe of one and a half inches or more has arrived, but the 4/6 size is notably scarce. The arrival of iron wire cloth from Tianjin in large quantities has caused prices to fall slightly. Locks and products from other factories are also prospering due to increased labor costs and corresponding increases in production costs.

### Cotton Cloth Sales in Guangdong Are Strong

[Our Newspaper] The market price of cotton cloth in Guangdong Province has improved. Last week, the Taikoo Company's Niuzhuang ship transported a large quantity of cotton cloth to Guangzhou, as reported previously. It is now known that today the China Merchants Bureau's Haihan ship sailed directly to Shantou, carrying 940 pieces of cotton yarn, over 120 bolts of cloth, over 21,300 blocks of bean curd, over 3,880 bags of soybeans, and 2,000 bags of wheat. In addition, the Yankai ship is scheduled to sail to Guangdong on the 3rd, also carrying a large quantity of cotton cloth. There are bookings for over 3,200 pieces of cotton yarn and over 3,810 bolts of cloth, of which over 450 pieces are being shipped by the China Textile Corporation.

### Guangzhou Rice Prices Fall; Other Daily Necessities Also Decrease

[United Press, Guangzhou, June 29] Guangzhou rice prices have fallen sharply in recent days, and the food crisis has passed. The cost of living has also generally fallen by 20 percent as a result. The current rice price is close to what it was two months ago, with the best rice selling for about 45,000 yuan per shi. It is understood that rice transported from Jiangxi and Fujian is about to arrive, and the supply of rice is expected to be sufficient. The prices of firewood, sugar, and flour have also decreased significantly. Canned meat from Australia will also be arriving.

### National Commercial Banks' Deposits Reach 200 Billion; This City Accounts for Slightly Less Than Half

According to news from the Central Bank's Examiners Office, the amount of deposits in commercial banks and money houses in various places across the country in June has increased compared to May. Statistics show that the national total is about 200 billion yuan, an increase of about 20 billion yuan compared to May. In Shanghai, the total is 90 billion yuan, an increase of about 10 billion yuan compared to May. Based on the above figures, deposits in Shanghai's banking and money industry account for 45 percent of the national total.

The end-of-June settlement period for Shanghai's banking and money industry has passed safely. Today, the bankers' holiday, is a traditional holiday. According to news from financial circles yesterday, the business of commercial banks and money houses in June was quite developed, with deposits reaching 90 billion yuan, an increase of about 10 billion yuan compared to May, accounting for 45 percent of the national total of bank and money house deposits (according to June's total national deposits being 200 billion yuan). It is expected that the second half of the year will be even more normal. The relevant information is recorded as follows:

In order to stabilize finance, the Central Bank's deposit reserve ratio paid by various commercial banks and money houses reached over 18 billion yuan in June due to the sharp increase in deposits, an increase of approximately 2 billion yuan compared to May.

Regarding the business of commercial banks and money houses, in addition to deposit transactions, remittances are an important part. However, at present, because transportation has not been restored in some areas and there are very few branches set up by various banks, which has resulted in the inability to transfer funds, the obligations of various banks have been significantly affected. In addition, interbank lending is difficult to develop due to high interest rates.

### Hong Kong and Tianjin Import and Export Statistics

[United Press, Hong Kong, June 29] According to official statistics, the total value of Hong Kong's imports in the first five months of this year was 273,000,000 yuan, compared to 241,000,000 yuan in the same period in 1929. The total value of exports in the first five months was 188,000,000 yuan, compared to 219,000,000 yuan in the same period in 1939. In May of this year, imports were 77,000,000 yuan, compared to 59,000,000 yuan in the same month in 1939.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, June 30] According to the Tianjin Customs, the import and export situation from January to May of this year is far inferior to that before the war in terms of total figures.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Assistant Manager Talks About Sugar Corporation's Marketing and Production Situation

(Report from this newspaper) Recently, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has often been involved in sugar issues. The public is largely unaware of the company's sales organization, supply information, and other details. Yesterday, this reporter specifically visited Song Yixin, the assistant manager and business manager of the company, who provided a detailed account. According to him, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation was officially established on May 1st of this year, jointly organized by the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Chief Executive's Office. Claims of a joint public-private venture are inaccurate. The takeover process occurred around October of last year, when the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs took over 42 sugar factories in Taiwan and four companies organized by the Japanese, including 50,000 tons of stored sugar and other farms. Later, the Resources Committee was placed under the Executive Yuan, so the Taiwan sugar factories were also transferred to the Executive Yuan. After discussions between the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Chief Executive's Office, it was decided that the two institutions would jointly form the company.

Regarding the high sugar prices, Mr. Song stated that this was due to transportation difficulties, as although there were ships available, they could not transport large quantities of Taiwan sugar. However, the reason for the transportation difficulties was due to other government measures, which the company could not investigate. In reality, the company did not have much inventory. It is estimated that Shanghai currently needs about 10,000 tons of sugar per month (70% of which is sold to other locations). If transportation becomes smoother in the future, the demand will likely exceed this amount.

Regarding sugar production in Taiwan, Mr. Song stated that during the Japanese occupation, Taiwanese farmers were forced to grow sugarcane, and annual sugar production could reach 1.4 million tons. However, the current situation is very different. Most farmers have abandoned sugarcane because they can make more profit from growing rice. From planting to harvesting, sugarcane requires 18 months. From the takeover to April of this year, a total of 90,000 tons of sugar were produced. The company plans to produce 300,000 to 500,000 tons of sugar annually in the future, but this will only be achievable in two or three years. Currently, the 42 factories have only 12,000 workers and over 1,000 staff members.

The company's general manager, Shen Zhennan, went to Taiwan to encourage farmers to grow sugarcane, inspect factory operations, and oversee the affairs of the four companies. He will return to Shanghai soon to discuss and decide on plans for the development of the sugar industry. If transportation issues are resolved in the future, it is planned to establish branches in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong. The Taipei office has already been established. The company's capital has not yet been calculated, and expenses are temporarily covered by overdrafts from the Central Bank and the Bank of Taiwan.

### Xinhe Yarn Factory Adjusts Capital and Issues Dividends Two New Shares for Each Old Share

The Xinhe Yarn Factory held a shareholder meeting yesterday. The original capital of 150 million yuan in puppet currency was converted to legal tender. A dividend of 26 yuan was paid from the profits of the 35th year, with 20 yuan used to increase the capital of old shares. An interest of 4 yuan was also issued for the 34th year. (The capital was increased to 450 million yuan in legal tender, with two new shares issued for each old share, and an additional 10 yuan in interest.)

### Summary of Market Conditions

Dried Shrimp Tails: A large shipment of Hong Kong Golden Hook tails, about 200 boxes, is expected to arrive soon and be available immediately, which has negatively impacted other dried shrimp tail vendors. Most vendors in this area are taking a wait-and-see approach.

Longkou Vermicelli: Since the Cantonese brokers started operating, the momentum has been unstoppable. Xianggu starch is also strong, followed by wood ear and lotus seeds. Other goods are also rising steadily.

Bricks and Tiles: The supply of tiles and lime was scarce yesterday due to several days of strong tides, which prevented shipping. Sales in Shanghai have increased sharply, and market prices have risen. However, cement prices remain stable.

### Economic Briefs

According to sources at the Minsheng Industrial Company, after General Manager Lu Zuofu returned to China, he plans to implement a partial restructuring of the company and will seek to expand the scope of operations of various departments.

The Highway Transportation Team of the Good Rescue Headquarters previously rented out trucks ranging from two to ten tons at lower prices than other transportation companies. As the trucks were newly arrived and traveled quickly, many people rented them. However, due to multiple intermediaries, there was a "black market." After learning of this, the General Headquarters ordered the team to stop renting and to reorganize personnel, resulting in the suspension of five people.

A large number of enemy and puppet ships and cars seized by the Enemy Property Bureau, except for those belonging to Allied personnel and legitimate Chinese owners, have been returned. The remaining confiscated enemy and puppet cars have been auctioned off twice, and the ships have been auctioned off once in cooperation with the China Merchants Bureau. Recently, more auctions will be announced publicly in newspapers.

### Match Raw Materials and the Electrochemical Industry

—Zhang Bo'an

The main raw materials for matches are "potassium chlorate" and "red phosphorus." The production of both "potassium chlorate" and "red phosphorus" requires electrolysis, so match raw materials and the electrochemical industry are inseparable.

Before the war, all of China's match raw materials were imported, such as English "white medicine" (i.e., potassium chlorate) and German "Iliadton" "red phosphorus." In the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, match factories competed to import raw materials, making match raw materials and pigments hot commodities for a time. Later, due to the European war, the supply was cut off. Inland matches not only became a target for speculators, but also became scarce at times. Even now, inland areas still use paper match heads because of this.

Around the 30th year of the Republic (1941), many electrochemical plants were established in the inland areas. First, the Southeast Chemical Plant produced white medicine, followed by a large-scale manufacturing operation by a major electrical and chemical plant in Quanzhou. In Min Province and Nanping, factories were also built. Later, phosphorus manufacturing factories appeared, but they were on a much smaller scale and were not as widespread as potassium chlorate.

Although the engineering of potassium chlorate (K+Cl) is complex, the extreme shortage of special materials during the war, coupled with a lack of work experience, made initial difficulties unavoidable. The Yongjia Southeast Chemical Plant used 60 K.Q. of DC to electrolyze salt, with the goal of balancing the main and by-products. Initially, the Danzeng Deshi electrolytic cell was used for electrolysis, resulting in very little chlorine gas. The carbon rods in the battery were thick and few, which was the same problem encountered by the Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant in its early electrolysis operations. Later, honeycomb-shaped anode carbon rods were used, which increased the output of chlorine gas. The operations of the Quanzhou Electrochemical Plant are not well understood, but the electrolysis of salt in Min Province was quite innovative. The Electrochemical Plant of the Nanping Fujian Enterprise Company used an 18KW DC motor, using goldfish glass tanks as batteries. The total current was supplied to more than 200 goldfish tank electrolysis cells, producing 18 batches of potassium chlorate per month (each batch weighing 100 market pounds). Its operating procedure was as follows:

First, the Tong alkali potassium solution is mixed with salt and placed in an open electrolytic cell for electrolysis. In theory, salt and potassium, after electrolysis with water, produce potassium hypochlorite. At this time, sodium carbonate and potassium hypochlorite are converted to potassium chlorate after oxidation, and carbonic acid can also be sold as an industrial raw material. If it is converted to caustic soda, it can be obtained by boiling it with lime. This is a simple and highly efficient operating method in industry.

There is also a clever method of combining Tong alkali and salt, using large water tanks as electrochemical cells. After the salt is mixed with water, it is placed in the tank, and a 220W AC current is passed between the interconnected copper diagrams between the tanks. After four hours of electrolysis, the liquid caustic soda is generated, which can be directly used for soap making. There is also 20% potassium chloride, which can be made into potassium chlorate after further electrolysis.

The manufacturing of chlorine-substituted sodium in the inland areas can also be solved by electrochemistry, but the electrical power in large cities in the inland areas is generally very limited, and there is little spare capacity to supply industrial electricity. Therefore, inland phosphorus factories use sulfuric acid to decompose bones to make phosphorus.

Animal bones are dry-distilled in the absence of oxygen to produce bone charcoal powder. The bones are decomposed with hydrochloric acid to form calcium phosphate, which is then reduced with charcoal and distilled to obtain red phosphorus. Redistillation yields "red phosphorus."

China has abundant coastal salt fields. In the future, the electrochemical industry in China is bound to use local salt for electrolysis, so that match raw materials will no longer need to be imported. Animal bones are also a waste product. If used to make phosphorus, their value will be greatly increased.

### The Melancholy of a Peaceful Prime Minister

—Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

New York, 10th (via airmail to this newspaper)

The Democratic government has been in power in the United States for fourteen consecutive years. The first five years can be described as Roosevelt's "economic revival period." At that time, the global economy was in recession, and American capitalism was on the verge of total collapse. Many American friends still "turn pale at the mention of" the economic panic of 1929. It is said that banks on Wall Street closed, and Broadway in New York was full of "beggars." Many people had no place to eat or sleep, and at night they would stay in the subway cars. The subway trains would run from one end to the other, and then back again. Many people would doze off and spend the night there. In winter, the subway trains had heating, which was much more comfortable than being an "inspector on the cold streets."

### Workers' Arrogance and Laziness Are a Product of War

I heard an old Chinese student in New York talk about the story of 1929. He said, "It was interesting to be a student at that time. Although we were not rich at the time, our lives seemed like a paradise in the dreams of those unemployed workers. At that time, I could hire workers to clean my house for the lowest wages. Later, I hired a servant who didn't want any wages at all. His condition was just that he be allowed to roll up a blanket and sleep outside my door at night."

He said that at that time, an American worker who delivered food to him didn't want any wages either. Every night, he would come to collect a nickel (five cents). He would take the nickel and jump on the subway, and that's how he would "spend" the night.

But times have changed. Today's American workers not only no longer care about that nickel, but they also don't want to do normal work. The endless stream of strikes is certainly due to local economic imbalances, but the war has spoiled their arrogance and laziness. Their remaining salaries are still enough for them to live a carefree life for a considerable period of time.

In New York, the most difficult thing now is to find housing. Many veterans have returned. They were originally workers in steel mills and cement factories. After serving in the military for a few years, they want to retire to New York. Many G.I.s have now started families in New York, so the housing shortage is naturally getting worse and worse, and the productivity of factories cannot be balanced.

### Government Uses Pressure as a Last Resort

According to the highest principles of American political thought, the less power the government has, the better, and the fewer things the government manages, the better. In the United States, the term "state-owned enterprises" is rarely heard. All industrial and commercial enterprises are privately owned. However, when privately owned enterprises have problems or affect national interests, the government has a responsibility to step in and take over. For example, when President Roosevelt was in office, due to the war, many automobile factories were converted to making airplanes, and many light and heavy industries were converted to military and armaments industries. Some were subsidized by the government to increase production, and some were taken over entirely by the government. However, as soon as the war ended, Congress passed the so-called "Industrial Restoration Act" and returned them to private entrepreneurs. President Truman's principle for dealing with labor unrest was still "the less government power, the better," until he had no choice but to order the government to temporarily take over. On the day Truman ordered the takeover of the railroads, because he was in a hurry to go to William Jewell College in Missouri to receive an honorary doctorate, he asked the workers to postpone the strike for five days and hinted to Witt, the leader of the drivers' union, that he could accept the workers' demands. This eased the labor unrest that was about to erupt. However, after President Truman, wearing his doctoral cap, returned to the White House, he did not fulfill his "hint." Therefore, Witt called him "the most shameless liar."

Time magazine described the inside story of the White House talks in a very relaxed way. It said that on the first day Truman returned to Washington from Missouri, he summoned Johnston, the leader of the railroad workers, and Witt, the leader of the drivers' union. President Truman first gave a long speech, very humble and polite. Johnston always said, "Yes, Mr. President," "Yes, Mr. President." But this Mr. Witt had no expression at all, looking at the ceiling with his face tilted, looking nonchalant and contemptuous. The magazine's reporter commented that Witt had only received two years of primary school education and was a "rank-and-file" member of the railroad workers.

### The President Handles Affairs With Calm and Objectivity

Truman has had decades of experience in Congress in American politics. His cultivation and integrity are, as described by a New York Daily News reporter, a typical American new-style gentleman. He handles many chaotic public affairs with a calm and objective manner, without being impatient or disorganized. However, in any case, he is a typical "peaceful prime minister," unable to be as "ambitious" as Roosevelt. Roosevelt sometimes used swift and decisive measures, such as ordering Wall Street banks to close in 1934. Sometimes, he could be very circuitous and indirect, making people sincerely convinced. Roosevelt's struggle with the isolationists was like this. Secondly, Roosevelt was much stronger than Truman in controlling the Democratic Party internally. Truman's recent "Anti-Strike Act" is an example.

The "Anti-Strike Act" was proposed to Congress by President Truman. It was after the railroad labor unrest had subsided and before the coal mine labor unrest had been resolved. According to Truman himself, he saw that the workers' frantic strikes would harm American social welfare and damage the economic lifeline of the United States. Therefore, while amending the labor law, he also proposed this "Anti-Strike Act" in parallel. It stated that "any enterprise that has been declared taken over by the government, workers must not unreasonably demand a strike, otherwise, the government can force the striking workers to serve in the military."

The day after this bill was announced and discussed, I paid attention to the public opinion in Washington and New York, and most of it was severely critical. The left-leaning New York Post published a huge cartoon saying that Truman was the incarnation of a fascist warlord. Its editorial said that Truman's bill would strangle the lives of American workers and was tantamount to being an enemy of all labor. The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune also said that the president's bill was excessive. Only the New York Daily News, which was considered yellow journalism but was actually right-leaning and had very subtle propaganda techniques, wrote an editorial called "Harry, Keep Going!" (Note: Harry is President Truman's nickname.)

### Quick Eyes and Hands Also Require the Use of魄力

The day after the Anti-Strike Act was voted on, President Truman held a press conference at the White House. Someone talked about this matter, and the president's expression was very sincere. He started from the democratic foundation of the United States and then talked about the incompatibility of individual freedom and social welfare. He said, "I am the chief executive of the United States. Which path should I choose? Of course, social welfare is more important." Therefore, "I am determined to continue to fight a death struggle with unlimited personal freedom."

Some Americans ridiculed him behind his back, saying, "Where is social welfare? It's just to benefit the capitalists!"

This is one point of view. Another view, I think, is very unique. It was a congressional staffer who said to me! "The president would never be so stupid as to propose such an emergency bill that is bound to fail. The reason why the president did this is entirely a threat to the striking workers, indicating that he has a magic weapon in case of last resort."

At that time, the coal mine labor unrest was still being negotiated between Krug (Secretary of the Interior and Director of Government Takeover of Coal Mines) and Lewis. Shortly after the bill was announced, the labor unrest was resolved. I remembered that the resolution of the railroad labor unrest was entirely due to the threat of the army driving the trains. I remember when I was in London, someone said to me, "Don't look at Truman's mediocre appearance. He used the atomic bomb to bomb Japan and the "Lend-Lease Act" to bomb Britain. He's not mediocre at all!"

Any politician, especially the chief executive of a large country, must use a little "魄力" (Po-Li, boldness and resoluteness). A person with 魄力 must be "eye-sharp and hand-fast." If the hand is not fast and the eye is not sharp, one cannot be a chief executive for long. Therefore, the poet Li Houzhu wanted to destroy the country when he became emperor, and the romantic King Edward VIII would rather abdicate and become the Duke of Windsor. Scholar-President Wilson was about to vomit blood and die.

### Economic Imbalances Is the System Undergoing Change?

Regarding the current American economic imbalances, the problem is not the ability and means of President Truman, but whether there will be any changes in the American economic system?

The left wing of the Democratic Party advocates "national socialism." Wallace is one such view. He believes that today's American domestic and foreign problems have not grasped this major policy. If capitalism continues to exist, the domestic economic crisis cannot be fundamentally resolved, and diplomacy with the Soviet Union will inevitably go further and further. However, I have never seen or heard about Wallace's specific proposals and implementation methods for "national socialism."

The New York Post has published several special articles on the resolution of labor unrest. It argues that in order to completely resolve the ups and downs of labor unrest, the government should not take over, but should buy out the entire industry. The Post advocates taking advantage of the fact that capital is unwilling to continue operating to make a national, once-and-for-all plan, first buying out coal mines and even railroads.

### Union Movements Affect Presidential Elections

In China, talking about state-owned coal mines or state-owned railroads does not seem strange. In the United States, such arguments are indeed "ear-piercing." Many Americans believe that state-owned enterprises will destroy the enterprises themselves, and at the same time, state ownership will increase the power of the government and destroy the constitutional order and individual freedom. An American railroad union leader told me that union organizations can remedy the shortcomings of private enterprises, because as soon as a union is strong, it can balance and limit the psychology of unlimited profit seeking. He broke down many principles of balance, which is very similar to the "cooperative system" that is widely promoted in China.

He cited the example of the United Railroad Workers and Road Workers Union, which led the strike this time. Their union was founded in the 19th century. In 1877, when the United States was still in the early stages of capitalism, there was a major railroad workers' strike. These "desperate" workers set fire to the military station in the steel city of Pittsburgh. After the labor unrest subsided, the union was strengthened. After seventy years, the union includes members throughout the country's railroad workers. The union's funds and property are calculated in units of "billions." The movements of the union can affect the elections of each president. The union can even allocate a portion of the funds to support the election activities of a certain party or person. He said, "Although capitalists have money, unions also have money." He said, "American workers and capitalists are equal, and they are not afraid of each other." After listening to his words and thinking about Witt's "Declaration Against Du," I can't help but construct a vision of the 1948 election.

### Trip to Kaifeng and Zhengzhou

—Special Correspondent Fan Hong

Luoyang, 20th (via this newspaper)

Walking in hot weather is the most painful thing, especially in the north, where there are few trees and barren land. There is simply no way to escape the shackles of heat.

In order to visit the American tractor farms in the Yellow River Flood Area, the reporter especially came to Kaifeng from Luoyang. Although it was only more than 400 li on the road, it took a day and a half on the train. Fortunately, it did not derail, and there was no waiting for the train. It arrived on time, which is considered a rare event. But the suffering on the road still requires you to endure more than a dozen hours yourself, which may be unimaginable to other stations. It definitely doesn't exist on the Beijing-Shanghai line.

### Difficulty in Waiting for the Train - Forming a Long Snake Line

First, let me note the difficulty of waiting for the train. The express train heading east departs at 8:00 AM every day, and tickets for third-class passengers are sold at 7:00 AM. Ticket sales require forming a long snake line, divided into two major lines for military personnel and civilians. Because there are too many passengers, often before dawn, the line for buying tickets is already formed in front of the ticket office, fearing that they will not be able to buy a ticket and board the train, or be fined double the fare for the entire journey. The most feared thing is having to wait another day at the station and stay another night or two in a hotel, with that unsettling feeling in their hearts. Those who have traveled long distances will understand this feeling.

After purchasing a ticket, passengers can freely board the train and find a seat. Third-class cars are not managed by anyone. They are old, stuffy freight cars with a few long benches with backrests added. Apart from the two large doors exchanging air flow, there are no air vents or windows to regulate the air inside. The chaotic and crowded situation can be imagined.

First and second-class tickets are bought the afternoon before, with assigned seating each time. However, sometimes due to train scheduling issues, the ticket sales and seating arrangements differ greatly. This inevitably leads to disorder in the car, with the strong preying on the weak. Those who bought tickets often become standing passengers in first and second-class cars.

"United Relief" Transports Tractors to Kaifeng to Improve Farming (Our Reporter Xu Shoulian Photo)

### Gansu Province Launches Five-Year Plan - Formulates Four Core Tasks for the First Phase

— Special Correspondent Bingzi

Our Newspaper Lanzhou, 22nd by airmail

Chairman Chiang recently telegraphed orders to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces to particularly strengthen the suppression of opium and other narcotics. Opium offenders will still be handed over to military courts to be dealt with in accordance with the regulations on suppressing opium and narcotics, with a deadline of one year.

The first phase of core tasks in Gansu Province's five-year construction plan is divided into four areas: (1) Establishing a national construction ethos, (2) Laying the foundation for economic construction, (3) Actively eliminating illiteracy, (4) Promoting local autonomy. The provincial government committee has approved its implementation.

In order to prevent corruption in disaster relief, the provincial government has specially sent Yang Jiying, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, to Dingxi, Lintao, and other twelve counties to supervise the distribution of drought relief funds. Mr. Yang departed on the 17th.

The provincial government previously requested US$300,000 in foreign exchange from the central government to carry out the Lanzhou City tap water project. The Executive Yuan has issued an order to the province, instructing them to submit the project plan for review before the funds are allocated.

Anxi and Yumen counties outside Jiayuguan have suffered frequent droughts over the years, often leading to disputes over water distribution. In order to eliminate water disputes between the two counties, the provincial government has decided to build the Changma Dam (with Anxi and Yumen splitting the water 40/60). The Water Conservancy and Forestry Company has been ordered to send personnel to survey the area. After the completion of this project, a total of 72,900 mu of land can be irrigated.

The source of Gansu Province's newspapers and other printing paper was purely from Sichuan and Shaanxi during the Anti-Japanese War, resulting in very high costs. Mr. Zhu Zunyi from Hubei, recognizing the importance of the papermaking industry in the northwest, came to Lanzhou from Sichuan to establish the Longyuan Paper Mill. Preparations have been underway for over three years, and it has now been decided to start operations in August or September. The factory will be fully machine-produced, with a daily output of two tons of paper, including newspaper and printing paper. In addition to supplying all newspapers, government agencies, and private organizations in Gansu Province, it will also be able to supply Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces.

Tianshui News: The roadbed along the Tianshui-Tianshui Railway was washed away in several places by rain. Train service was suspended from late May. After emergency repairs by the railway bureau, the entire line was repaired and reopened on the 13th of this month.

The Lanzhou Municipal Police Bureau, upon receiving orders to strengthen public security in the city, has implemented the following measures since the 19th: (1) Thoroughly investigate the population at any time, (2) All city gates will be closed at 12:00 midnight, (3) Theaters and cinemas are required to start performances at 9:00 PM and stop at 11:30 PM, with penalties for overtime, (4) Pedestrians out late at night may be questioned at any time.

Very little gasoline from the Yumen Oil Mine arrives in Lanzhou, and the price of gasoline in Lanzhou has recently skyrocketed again, reaching 5,000 yuan per gallon on the black market.

### The Scene on the Platform - Like a Beggar's Shelter

Once, the train derailed mid-journey, and the roadbed was damaged. There were no trains for a day, and notices were posted several times, but the content was always just about when the train would arrive and when it would depart, but the reality was that it was never on time. The train was always far away on the road. The lack of arrival news resulted in more and more passengers waiting at the station, waiting all day, from 5:00 AM to 9:00 PM, without leaving the platform. They were too tired to rest, and dared not leave their seats to eat, and had to exhaust all their energy to resist the scorching sun. The passengers were hungry, hot, and exhausted, complaining endlessly, but it was still a disappointment. The train engine broke down on the road and had to wait for a replacement engine to be sent. Only then did the passengers breathe a sigh of relief. Some got sick, some went back, some fainted! Some cried, some...fell asleep. At this time, the platform was just like a training ground for patients, madmen, and beggars.

### Fresh Realm - Absorbing Rich Fragrances

The reporter did not encounter such a bitter waiting experience, nor did they join the line to squeeze for tickets. They boarded the train as soon as they arrived at the station, and the train departed as soon as they got on. However, they were only allowed to stand on the first-class standing car, and were not allowed freedom of movement, let alone dream of a seat. This was the most crowded train without assigned seating. The car was packed with people, full of chaotic shouts, and the train departed regardless.

The sun was shining in from the southeast, turning the faces of those near the window red. The train chugged forward, gradually entering an old road with trees providing shade. Passengers stretched their heads out to play with the locust trees, caressing each one as if to bid farewell to the old and welcome the new. Breathing in the fragrant air from the trees, they felt a bit refreshed. If it weren't for a puff of black smoke sweeping over the trees, they would have almost forgotten they were on the train.

### Reddish-Yellow Fields - Waiting for Rain to Sow

Further ahead, they encountered a farmer driving his cattle home. People on the train started chatting with him, discussing rural economy, rural side jobs, farmers' lives, and crop yields for more than twenty minutes. Later, after encountering a fork in the road and the farmer said goodbye, everyone realized they were sitting on a train traveling a thousand miles a day, and couldn't help but look at each other and laugh in surprise! In the distance, they saw patches of reddish-yellow farmland, waiting for rain to sow!

The train did not stop this time, and did not stop for more than thirty minutes at any major or minor station. It can be considered a special express train on the Zhengzhou-Luoyang section! Because of this, many people were hungry and had nothing to eat, and thirsty and had nothing to drink. Often, as soon as the train stopped, they either couldn't get off the train or had just picked up their bowl when the whistle blew and the train departed. All the way to Zhengzhou, many people had empty stomachs, and many only casually filled themselves with some boiled water, cucumbers, steamed buns, or peanuts.

### Sishui and Xingyang - Experiencing a Dangerous Journey

From Sishui to Xingyang, the track is narrow, making it the most dangerous part of the journey. The train moved very slowly. Once, going downhill and then uphill, the engine couldn't manage, resulting in the train stopping to add pressure. Passengers thought something had happened. The car was so hot and stuffy that people were anxious and getting angry. They saw the overturned train car in the ditch beside the road, which had happened a few days ago, killing more than ten people, injuring more than thirty, and damaging several railway tracks. They wondered if there were still lingering souls under the train car! Many people were warning each other.

Sishui's specialty is persimmon cakes and persimmon frost, making it a persimmon specialty station. Xingyang's specialty is straw braid, with many straw hats and straw bags, making it a straw braid station. The train was filled with shouts from all directions. Many people rely on this for a living, and the annual output is very large. However, if the quality, technology, packaging, and promotion do not improve, they will soon go bankrupt.

The train arrived in Zhengzhou at four o'clock. This part of the train journey had come to an end. Whether heading south to Hankou, north to Anyang, east to Kaifeng, or Shanghai, passengers had to change trains in Zhengzhou. The reason for changing trains is that there are too few trains to be distributed.

Thus, Zhengzhou has become an overnight stop, and commercial transit is particularly developed. Outside the station, both sides are lined with tea vendors pushing carts, shouting and soliciting business. People dispersed into the various neighborhoods in the midst of the chaos.

### Rushing to Catch the Train Late at Night - Extremely Anxious and Uneasy

The next morning at 6:00 AM, there was an express train to Xuzhou. Tickets were sold at 5:00 AM, and passengers had to arrive at the station as early as 3:00 or 4:00 AM to prepare. The anxiety and unease can be imagined. Although this express train was flat, it was particularly crowded because there was no sun in the morning, making it ideal weather for traveling.

There was only one first-class car on this train. There were more second-class cars than third-class cars, so there were the most second-class passengers. I got up at 5:50 AM and rushed to the station. The cars of all classes were already full, and the platform was piled with luggage. Many passengers were sitting and standing at the car doors. The first and second-class cars still did not have assigned seating. I went up from a less crowded area, but still barely became a standing passenger at the car door. It was even more crowded than when I came from Luoyang. Before the sun rose, the air was suffocating, and I was already sweating. People were all rushing to catch the train on an empty stomach. After getting on, they couldn't help but feel panicked and almost unable to support themselves. The standing people slowly tried to sit down, regardless of what was to the left, right, or below! I sat next to the tea stove by the door, with my soles in the water, leaning my body against the muddy door, because this hot and dirty doorway had not yet been occupied. One had to find a way to sit, as long as they were not affected by passersby, they could settle down.

### Sons of Heaven - Drinking Tea Water on Hot Days

The train started as soon as I got on. The small operators on the train, wearing blue armbands, began selling tea to passengers, busy with the work of delivering water, sending kettles, and collecting money. All the way to Zhongmu, they collected the teapots and water money, and after checking, they found that twenty or so teapots and twenty or so teacups were missing. They tried very hard to find them, but to no avail. Therefore, east of Zhongmu, their tea selling business was suspended. They said: There are too many people on the train, so it's impossible to sell tea. If the tea drips on someone, they will scold you, and if you don't deliver the water in time, those who want to drink tea are unwilling and throw the teapots out of the train. A rough pot that is only worth four or five hundred yuan, the railway bureau wants us to compensate one or two thousand yuan for each pot. The money we earn from selling tea is not enough to compensate for the pots, so what's the point of selling tea! No matter how thirsty the passengers are, they will no longer deliver water on this section to Kaifeng. Only those who stay by the tea stove can drink freely. I am fortunate to have water to drink, and I am considered a son of heaven on a hot day.

### Crossing the Yellow River - The Train Speeds Up

East of Zhengzhou, the rice seedlings have already grown a foot tall. It can be seen that the climate in central Henan is different from that in western Henan. Farmers are sleeping under the shade of big trees to cool off. Children aged twelve or thirteen are standing naked by the village. Crossing the Middle Bridge, passengers by the window are sticking their heads out to sightsee. It is a temporary wooden bridge built by Japanese soldiers and our workers, very sturdy, and everyone is praising it. However, they don't feel so great and astonished by the turbulent Yellow River below the bridge. The water is not high, and the waves are small, flowing and turning back and forth. It is indeed not as magnificent and澎湃 as when viewed from Tongguan Xiguan!

Crossing the Yellow River and entering the Yi Road, the train speeds up. Under the high pressure of hunger and heat, people are hoping to arrive in Kaifeng soon. Stopping at stations two or three times, the train arrived at Kaifeng Station at 11:10 AM. I took a car and entered Kaifeng City!

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Editor's Note

After the war, the politics of all countries have entered a new era of democracy and peace. Undoubtedly, China's post-war politics will also embark on the path of democratization. However, the evolution of democratic politics has its own processes and rules, and it cannot reach the ideal state overnight. Flipping through the political history of democratic advanced countries, you can see that the politics of today's countries are the result of natural development.

The backbone of democratic politics is the spirit of the rule of law. Although China's history of political philosophy has long been filled with democratic ideas, it is undeniable that traditional concepts emphasize rule by rites and despise rule by law. Therefore, the spirit of the rule of law still needs to be promoted and cultivated. And all rule of law must start from the lower levels of local government.

Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, said early on that the foundation of the Republic of China lies in local autonomy, and that the county is the unit of autonomy, which is even more clearly stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. Therefore, if China wants to implement democratic politics today, it must first earnestly promote local autonomy. The politics of democratic countries all have their grassroots organizations, and local autonomy is the grassroots political organization. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Rights is to use this grassroots organization to allow the people to exercise the four powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum in various places, in order to fully express public opinion. The main spirit of the new county system advocated by Chairman Chiang is also to "strengthen local organizations, promote autonomous undertakings, and lay the foundation for revolutionary nation-building." It can be seen that if our country really wants to transform from official governance to people's governance, it must first completely let the people govern the grassroots organizations of the locality, and then from bottom to top, the spirit of people's governance can be promoted.

It has been ten months since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and we should have embarked on the road of national construction and revival. Unfortunately, the state of the country is still not stable, and everything has not been fully restored to the right track, which is difficult to be satisfactory. However, the so-called "good government" in the eyes of the people is very simple: first, it must be honest, second, it must be efficient, and third, it must be able to earnestly handle affairs for the people. How can this ideal be realized? Only by starting with local autonomy, improving the grassroots political organization, and letting the people elect trustworthy people to be responsible for handling all local issues, instead of relying on official governance. Instead of chanting democracy in vain, it is better to work hard on local autonomy in a down-to-earth manner.

In order to assist in civil administration and promote local autonomy, our newspaper will, starting today, add a special column called "Civil Affairs Briefs." On the one hand, it will awaken the people to pay attention to public affairs and gradually cultivate the atmosphere and habits of democratic politics, and not give up the responsibility that the people should bear for local politics; on the other hand, it will awaken the government to pay attention to people's autonomy and change their past mentality of only knowing official governance. There is an old saying in our country: "Politics is not about much talk." We hope that on the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, the local authorities must use facts to show that they are promoting the people's autonomy every day, so that each county and city can become a fully autonomous county and city as soon as possible.

At the beginning of this column, we hope that the sages of the country and the citizens of this city will not hesitate to contribute to broaden the content, which is not only the honor of this newspaper, but also a help to the work of national construction.

### The Work of Filling and Issuing National Identity Cards is Mostly Completed - The Department of Civil Affairs Compiles Population Cards

The work of filling and issuing national identity cards in this city is mostly completed. It is learned that, except for the entire eleventh district (Xincheng District), and the third and fourth baos of the first district, the ninth bao of the tenth district, the forty-first bao of the twelfth district, and the twelfth bao of the twenty-sixth district, which have not yet been sent to the Department of Civil Affairs for stamping, the rest have been stamped and returned to the districts and baos for residents to use. Residents who have not yet received their identity cards can go directly to the bao office to apply for them.

It is also learned that, after the completion of the work of filling and issuing national identity cards, the internal staff of the Department of Civil Affairs will concentrate their efforts on compiling population cards. It is said that these cards will use the joint application form for national identity cards, and compile numbers according to names, and assign numbers to the card cabinets for easy reference at any time. As for the district, bao, and household administration work, in addition to regularly urging the handling of the four types of registration: moving out, moving in, birth, and death, they are also preparing to implement household registration in accordance with the Household Registration Law, with the remaining household registration books. It is also learned that it has been decided to use the method of centralized lectures in sub-districts to provide short-term training to district, bao, and household administration personnel.

### Heads of the Twenty-Fifth District Change

The municipal government recently changed the district heads and deputy district heads of this city. Details are as follows: (1) Jin Dehuan, the head of the twenty-fifth district, was transferred to the head of the tenth district, and the vacancy was filled by Chen Zhijing, the deputy head of the twentieth district. Chen Zhongxin, the deputy head of the twenty-fifth district, was approved to resign, and the vacancy was filled by Long Luoyuan, the chief executive of the ninth district. (2) Wang Guoping was appointed as the deputy head of the twentieth district. (3) Zhu Liangcai, the deputy head of the fourth district, was approved to resign, and the vacancy was filled by Fan Peiyuan. (4) Zhu Xiande, the deputy head of the twenty-ninth district, was approved to resign, and the vacancy was filled by Zhu Yougu. The above personnel appointment and dismissal orders have been forwarded by the Department of Civil Affairs, and they have been instructed to properly handle the handover procedures.

### Election of City Councilors in the Thirty-Second District - Registration Scheduled to Begin on the 10th

The election of city councilors in this city, except for the thirty-second district, which was postponed by the municipal government because the district was just established during the previous election and all legal procedures were not carried out in accordance with the law, all districts have been successfully completed. It is learned that the authorities of the Department of Civil Affairs, in view of the fact that the preparatory work related to the election in the district has been prepared, and the councilors of the district should be elected as soon as possible, have scheduled July 10 as the registration date for voters and candidates in the district, and have ordered the district to handle it seriously on schedule and encourage voters to participate enthusiastically.

### Answering Questions about Household Administration

Question: How do I apply for registration for a household moving to this city from another county?

Answer: A household or individual moving to this city with the intention of residing here for a long time can request a household registration application form from the bao head or district office in the new place of residence and apply for household registration. If there is no intention to reside here for a long time, you only need to report to the bao head for registration as a floating population.

Question: Why not report the move-in registration?

Answer: According to Article 28 of the revised Household Registration Law: "Those who move in from the jurisdiction of another household registration for more than one month without changing their registered residence shall be registered for moving in." According to this article, there are three conditions for move-in registration: First, it must be moved in from the "jurisdiction of another household registration"; second, it must be for more than one month; third, the original registered residence must not be changed. The new household that moves in does not intend to reside in this city for a long time, and naturally does not want to change its original registered residence, so it cannot apply for household registration, but it has not lived for more than one month, which does not meet the conditions for move-in registration, so it can only be registered as a floating population.

Question: What is the registration of floating population?

Answer: The so-called registration of floating population, according to Article 29 of the new Household Registration Law: "Those who move out of the jurisdiction of the original household registration for less than one month without changing their registered residence shall be registered as floating population." But if you have lived for more than one month, you have met the conditions for move-in registration, and you can re-apply for election-in registration. Request an election-in registration application form from the district office or bao office in the jurisdiction, fill it out clearly item by item, and submit it to the bao office for transfer to the district office for registration.

Question: What is the jurisdiction of household registration?

Answer: The so-called jurisdiction of household registration, according to Article 6 of the new Household Registration Law, is: "Household registration is registered in the township as the jurisdiction area, and the township chief兼住 as the head of household registration..." As for the cities directly under the central government and the provincial-level cities, it is also stipulated that the provisions of the province and the county shall be applied respectively, so this city takes the district as the jurisdiction area, and the district chief兼住 as the head of household registration.

Question: Who should apply for registration when the whole household elects in? How to apply for individual election? Migration registration (including selection in and out and floating population) takes the person or the head of the household as the applicant, so the whole household elects in, the head of the household applies, and the individual elects in, the person himself applies.

Spring and Autumn

### Homecoming (Fiction)

— Yang Mou

The train slowly pulled into the platform, the sharp whistle stirring up a wave of motion in the carriages.

After a long journey, Jing Sheng had already trained himself to be calm and alert. But today, his heart was especially out of control, constantly restless and uneasy. He glanced at the passenger sitting beside him, it was exactly 3:30, he stood up, straightened the long hair hanging down on his forehead, and took his suitcase from the luggage rack.

This was a man in his twenties, with a dark face and long hair covering his forehead, wearing an old black Zhongshan suit. Judging from his face, half of it seemed to be the erosion of wind and sand from a long journey, and the other half seemed to be severe depression.

His heart was pounding fiercely—when he was in the remote desert, he would fantasize about home, about his lonely mother, but he would quietly control his emotions. Now, his feet had touched the familiar land again, he knew that in an hour, the people in his fantasy would all appear before him. But he became uneasy again.

The train had stopped, and Jing Sheng followed the stream of people, carrying the worn-out suitcase in one hand, and squeezed out of the carriage.

In the station square, he saw a sea of people, tall buildings, and chaotic vehicles. Looking up at the leisurely sky, Jing Sheng saw his own loneliness. After a long separation, he tried his best to ignite his passion and anticipation.

Sitting on the rickshaw, he moved closer and closer to his home.

Jing Sheng had been separated from this bustling city for a full six years. At that time, a surge of enthusiasm moved him, causing him to abandon his home and rush to the vast future. One summer evening, he quietly boarded the ship to Haiphong. By the time his mother received his news, he was already in a university in Kunming.

He peered at the streets, and nothing seemed to have changed. Happiness, prosperity, people filled everything. He thought of the famine and poverty he had seen in the rural areas along the way, truly heaven and hell.

However, there is also hell in heaven, and there are also unhappy people. For example, Jing Sheng, even though he had arrived in heaven, still had a heavy, hellish heart.

The rickshaw had turned into the upper section of Huxi Road, and at a gloomy alleyway, he hurriedly told the rickshaw driver to stop.

Familiar, he arrived at his home, entered through the back door, turned onto the dark and narrow staircase, and at the door of the pavilion room on the second floor, he pushed the door open and went in.

His mother was sewing soles with a huge needle, with a head full of gray hair, a pair of glasses, and wrinkles all over her forehead. She seemed startled by the sound of the door opening, and raised her head to remove her glasses.

"Mom, I'm back." His voice trembled slightly, breaking the solemn atmosphere.

The old woman stood up tremblingly, as if happy, as if recalling a beautiful painting, her eyes seemed to be full of tears.

"Jing, is that you—you, you've grown taller and fatter."

The old woman rushed over and hugged him tightly.

For years, what had made Jing Sheng uneasy in his dreams was his mother. Now, what made him abandon his career and return to Shanghai at all costs was also his mother.

He wanted to repent, he wanted to ask his mother to forgive him, but the old woman was simply overjoyed by the reality, as if she had long forgotten all of her son's past recklessness.

"Jing Sheng, it's good, it's good, I've been waiting for you to come back every day—it's good, my suffering has come to an end."

"Jing Sheng, you haven't eaten yet, I'll go..."

Jing Sheng quickly calmed her down, asked her to sit on the edge of the bed, and not to rush around.

His uncle from upstairs also came down.

Jing Sheng's departure from Shanghai was also partly due to his skin’s discomfort. Since his father's death and the decline of the family, he had been relying on his mother, almost begging for support from his uncle. His uncle was a speculator, and although he was willing to take in Jing Sheng and his mother, he always made cold and sarcastic remarks that made them uncomfortable.

"Uncle, hello, aunt, hello," Jing Sheng quickly stood up.

"Ah, Jing Sheng, after a few years, you've grown up too—these past few years, your old mother has really suffered to death, thinking of you every day, now her suffering is over, her son has returned with a fortune."

"Not at all," Jing Sheng said shyly.

"Don't be polite, those of you who come back, which one hasn't made a fortune, I'm getting old too, and in the future I'll have to rely more on my nephew!"

His uncle's words were partly sincere praise and partly sharp scolding, he could only smile bitterly.

After a brief exchange of greetings, his uncle went upstairs.

His mother's words poured out like an endless torrent, her old face full of tears, starting from the death of Jing Sheng's father, to the raising of Jing Sheng, his schooling, going to the inland, his uncle's contempt, how she had spent the past few years sewing shoes for others, how his uncle was now making a fortune, and then to Jing Sheng, since he had returned with a fortune, he should immediately get a wife, fulfill her wish, and find another house, so as not to be bullied anymore.

Jing Sheng couldn't help but cry too. His mother was crying about the narration of history, he was crying about the prospects for the future.

What could he say to comfort his mother!

In the six years he had been away, he had finally completed his university life in four years, and the remaining two years were spent working as a small clerk in the highway department of a certain province.

The news of victory made him excited, but he quickly calmed down. He missed his mother, but he couldn't return.

Finally, he disregarded everything, sold his luggage, and barely managed to scrape together enough money for the trip home. But he had no certainty about his own future career, and how could he possibly fulfill even one-ten-thousandth of what his family expected of him?

He understood that his return could not warm his home.

Countless social parasites, sucking the blood of others during the war, and still enjoying themselves there after the war; he, a broken heart, accompanied by his mother's broken heart.

He knew that when his uncle realized that he was still a pauper, he would treat him differently, and his mother would also be extremely disappointed.

Homecoming, he truly regretted homecoming.

He really wanted to leave here immediately. He wanted to love this society, but this society only loves those who have wealth and power. He knew that his mother loved him deeply, but he hated himself for not having the talent to please his mother.

"Mom, I'm going to leave tomorrow on this trip." He thought of leaving.

"What?" His mother was shocked.

"It's like this, it's an order from my superiors, they want to send me to Taiwan to take over a factory, so I have to leave tomorrow, anyway, transportation is convenient, I can always come back."

He made up a lie, and his mother somehow believed it.

"Orders, well, that's good too, but you have to be proper when you take over, you should be honest."

Jing Sheng was silent and did not answer, his head hung down heavily again.

The next morning, Jing Sheng raised his suitcase again and went to explore his fate in an uncertain future.

### Dawn

— Xi Shou

The dawn ignited,

The dense and thick black shadows gradually thinned,

Dreams and thick fog went away with the night.

Eyelids half-open and half-closed,

Various sounds can be heard in the ears.

The wind greets the maple tree,

The water wishes the fountain well;

Smoke and green algae,

Nests and bees,

Everything is happening at the same time,

Every breath is turning into a sound.

### A Chapter of Melancholy (3)

— Hu Shanyuan

The Melancholy of an Editor

Someone who doesn't know the difference between a good manuscript and a bad one is simply not fit to be an editor. When an editor sees a good manuscript, they are often happier than if they had written a good manuscript themselves. Therefore, how can an editor not know which manuscript is appropriate and which is not? Appropriate ones are published, and inappropriate ones are either returned or discarded. However, does an editor have such freedom? No!

An editor must consider the interests of the publisher. An editor cannot think only of running things independently. He believes that this is a legitimate opinion, and publishing it will definitely gain the approval or support of the majority. But when the boss looks at it, he says, "This kind of argument is very dangerous. Publishing it will immediately cause trouble. Be cautious, be cautious!" Under ten thousand cautions, you have no choice but to sacrifice your argument and not publish it. You believe that this is a legitimate creation, and publishing it can enhance the status of your publication. But the boss says again, "Status isn't money. Do fewer things that don't make money; businesses that lose money are absolutely not to be done!" At the same time, the boss hands you promotional materials and entertainment pieces, asking you to publish them. You don't want to? There's no reason for that, unless you don't want to eat his rice under his rule. You have no choice but to obey!

What you want to publish, you can't; what you don't want to publish, you are forced to. This is the melancholy of you, the editor! How will you break it? You can't break it, hence the melancholy!

Of course, you all think of starting your own publication. But the first obstacle is that you don't have capital. You can't build a house with bare hands, and your plan ultimately cannot be realized. You are melancholy! Even if the capital is raised, you are not good at managing it, working from dawn to dusk but still having no clue. It still can't be done. You are melancholy! You succeed in starting it, and you publish the manuscripts you have selected, but one side says you are not tough enough, the other side says you are not stimulating enough, and another side even says you have ulterior motives and are being used. The public remains ignorant and unaware, not understanding your good intentions at all, as if nothing has happened. You are even more melancholy, greatly melancholy! For the sake of life, for the sake of the things you are used to doing, you cannot change your profession, so you have no choice but to give up your ambition to create and turn back to cultural merchants to seek a livelihood. Melancholy, melancholy, a hundred and twenty times melancholy!

If the boss is only concerned with publicity and not with making money, then your melancholy will only increase!

You are sorry for the writers; when writers question you, you will definitely have unspeakable suffering and unspeakable melancholy.

Your melancholy resentment will be concentrated on the boss and the publisher!

### On Writing

— Qi Fan

——Don't ask what it is, say what you want to say, because only your own words can be said intimately, and people feel intimately. If you are a poet, whether the object you are singing about is beauty, ugliness, heaven, or humanity, you must have true feelings for it. You cannot force it, you cannot perfunctorily do it, you cannot just follow the trend, you must write your own things without any pretense.——

For any author, the most important aspect of their work is honesty. Honesty. The importance of honesty lies above the novelty of the subject matter, the completeness of the structure, and the fluency of the writing. That is, the work must be honest about the life that is clearly understood objectively and experienced subjectively by you. Honesty does not mean that the author must have actually experienced the life mentioned in the work, but that all the lives mentioned in the work are indeed the feelings and human nature that the author clearly understands intellectually and is able to experience emotionally. Many people, because they feel that their own lifestyle is not fresh, deliberately choose some special and romantic lives that they are not familiar with as the subject matter, and then use their limited imagination to exaggerate the emotions that they do not have, in order to gain the sympathy of the readers. This kind of creation not only wastes words to exaggerate false scenes and emotions, but also makes those serious readers who want to enrich their lives and understand life from the work feel very impatient and disappointed.

The richness of life experience does not lie in the number of different ways of life; such as having been an apprentice, and also pushed a wheelbarrow; traveled through Gansu, and also traveled through Yunnan. What matters is the sharpness and agility of both the objective observation and the subjective feeling, the ability to understand and taste what is seen, heard, and experienced in many ways; to understand the relationships and connections between people in life; the dramatic changes that occur between the fixed and the accidental; and finally, to have one's own special views, thoughts, beliefs, and philosophy.

A person with rich life experience does not lie in having seen many things objectively, but in being able to subjectively evoke very complex and different emotions, and in being able to sympathize with many aspects of human nature.

Therefore, an author, in addition to the technical knowledge of using words, must be able to stand on any living earth, be able to move freely between the subjective and the objective, between emotion and understanding, and rationally and emotionally run wild, with memory and imagination complementing each other, to the point where the true is the false and the false is the true. Only then can his pen appear lively and sincere. His works will be substantial and great, unaffected by subject matter and words, and will be able to move people lastingly and universally.

An author must truly gain experience, so that he can have his own convictions. Similarly, the evaluation of the work will always be in the hands of serious readers.

### The Cup of Life

— Zhongyuan

When anyone leaves the mother's womb and makes their first cry, a strange cup of life is held in their hand.

At first, this cup is extremely light, as light as a silk thread in the clear sky, almost imperceptible. Gradually, the silk thread transforms into a pure white lily, full of sweet nectar, blooming in the warm sunlight, emitting a faint fragrance and a subtle sweetness—an unparalleled liquid of joy overflows in the lily cup of childhood—

But soon, this beautiful cup changed. First, the gentle wind and drizzle added a little weight to the cup, and then the thin frost and snow reduced a little fragrance from the cup. Gradually, it became smooth and bright, and gradually, it became a layer of fragile glass, able to see through the clouds and mist, and through the thunder and lightning; able to illuminate the wind and rain, and illuminate the dark night. And unknowingly, a cup of incomparably sweet nectar completely changed its taste—, the happy childhood had forever passed away.

The first sip of bitter liquid in adolescence is not difficult to taste but carries a stimulation, like a dilution of Coptis chinensis mixed with strong alcohol, making people feel dry, restless, chaotic, and confused. It also makes people like a group of hungry and thirsty bees, some in the moonlight, some in front of flowers, frantically and desperately chasing the sweet juice of life. As a result, they found it, but they were also disappointed: Often when they just poured a few drops of the sweet juice that they had chased with all their life's strength into one end of the cup, at the other end of the cup, the bitter liquid of life endlessly surged and submerged everything. So they shouted painfully: "Is the essence of life so bitter?"—This is the beginning of middle age.

As the years flew by, this cup became heavier and more complicated day by day. It was as heavy as a thousand-pound hammer, pressing tightly on people's shoulders, making it impossible to bear or let go. It was as complex as a vast ocean, storing countless and ever-changing strange tastes, bitter, astringent, sour, and spicy juices. Until the old age of silver hair arrives, it is like the scorching sun absorbing the sea water, and the last drop of life, the liquid of life, dries up, and this cup drifts away and obtains eternal rest——death!

Long Novel Serial

### Double Flight, Double Nest (17)

— Zhao Qingge

Thirteen

Half a year later, Hua was already receiving 100 silver dollars a month. She no longer needed to continue learning opera. There was nothing more to teach about stringed instruments. Madam Mo stopped teaching opera with stringed accompaniment and only let him be Hua's qin player. The remuneration for teaching opera was changed to the remuneration for being a qin player. Lihua even considered not letting Zhang Xian play the huqin anymore. But strangely enough, Lihua had tested it. When others played the huqin for her, her singing felt unnatural, and she even said "board" in a deep voice. (Meaning the musical beat.) Perhaps it was out of habit. But it wasn't Zhang Xian's huqin, yet she didn't feel any discomfort because of it. This was a painful contradiction. Lihua disliked Zhang Xian from the bottom of her heart, but for the sake of "opera," she couldn't do without Zhang Xian!

A year later, two years later, three years later; Lihua's position in this theater rose from a third-class actor to a second-class actor; now she has leaped from a second-class actor to a first-class actor; completely as Zhang Xian had predicted. Indeed, she has now snatched Shi Yulou's "top billing." Now she and Shi Yulou take turns singing the final act. In these three years, she had almost helped Madam Mo earn back all the invested capital. But this still couldn't satisfy Madam Mo, who was far from her budget. It was as if Lihua was building a golden house for her, and now it was just laying the foundation. At the same time, Lihua herself still didn't feel happy because of her progress, learning was so depressing, so silent! As if all her gains were not hers, and had nothing to do with her. And this kind of thought matured more and more with her age, she saw everything more and more lightly, more and more empty!

The "top billing" was taken down, and now he was indeed "getting worse and worse"! His voice was getting worse day by day, and sometimes he simply couldn't sing. One day, it was his turn to perform the opera "Jin Dian Zhuang Feng" (Feigning Madness in the Golden Palace). When he sang about feigning madness, his throat suddenly went completely hoarse, and he couldn't sing a single sentence! The audience below kept "jeering" and calling for refunds! He was anxious on stage, but there was nothing he could do. Later, the audience shouted for refunds, and he was angry and ashamed; a rush of blood surged, his nerves fell into chaos, and he really went mad. He hit the people under the stage; he laughed; he cursed; he finally burst into tears! The order was in chaos for a while, and everyone hurriedly pulled him backstage and sent him home. From then on, his mind lost its normal state.

Lihua witnessed this tragedy and suffered a serious shock. She grieved for Shi Yulou, and also grieved for herself! Although she didn't quite understand why an actor would end up like this? But she intuitively felt that singing opera was a path of self-destruction! If you sing well, someone will support you; if you don't sing well, someone will smash you. But can you always sing well? No! You will not sing well because of illness, because of old age, and for all kinds of reasons that Lihua wouldn't yet be aware of! At that time, you can only fall down! "Fall down" like Shi Yulou! Thinking of this, she was heartbroken! She was terrified! She only knew that as long as she sang, she fulfilled her "obligation" as a human being; but now she knew even more: not only sing, but also sing well; sing well forever; only then can she fulfill her "obligation" as a human being. But this was simply impossible, Shi Yulou was an example! If she had such a day - such a day like Shi Yulou, what would she do? What would Madam Mo do? Madam Mo would force her to sing again; still sing well; sing well for a long time! Just like when she took her to learn opera before... Heavens! She was going crazy too! She was about to go crazy!

Production and Construction Special

### Chinese Agricultural Implements and Machinery (1)

— Translated by Zhong Deqi

The author of this article, Professor J. Lossing Buck, is the founder of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Jinling University. He has been in China for more than 20 years and has extensive research on China's agricultural problems. Mr. Buck has conducted a lot of practical surveys of rural China. The editor has books such as "Chinese Farm Economy," "Chinese Land Utilization," and "Chinese Farm Management," and is China's most loyal friend. He returned to the United States the year before last. In the special issue commemorating the department in January, although there was much discussion by Chinese scholars on the issue of agricultural mechanization in China in the future, there was little research on actual mechanical agricultural implements in China. As for international experts who have researched Chinese agriculture, especially those who express opinions on this issue, we are now translating this manuscript as a reference for those who are interested in this issue, and also to welcome this old professor who will soon return to China to continue teaching. Respectfully attached. May 27th.

Farm implements and mechanical equipment are used to make farm work more perfect, economical, easy, fast, and to do work that humans cannot do. The scope of their utilization is mostly based on whether they can increase profits, that is, to increase the area of cultivated land per person and the production volume per unit of capital.

Farm equipment can be divided into the following categories:

(1) Cultivation, fertilization, and seeding equipment

(2) Harvesting equipment

(3) Processing equipment: (shelling, peeling, collecting, threshing, packaging, removing seeds, cleaning, harvesting, milling, etc.)

(4) Power equipment; including electricity

(5) Transportation equipment

(6) Water source control equipment

(7) Horticultural equipment

(8) Spraying equipment

(9) Livestock and poultry equipment

(10) Farm buildings

(11) Agricultural product manufacturing equipment

(12) Household equipment

(13) Other equipment

Cultivation, fertilization, and seeding equipment are classified into one category because some tools perform all three functions. Water source control equipment includes various pumps, soil removal, and land fertility maintenance equipment.

The total amount of work completed by each tool or machine in a unit of time (usually ten hours per day) is called the "Rate of Work," and the total amount of work completed by each cubic foot of tool or each horsepower of a threshing machine is called the "Duty of Implement and of machinevy." It varies depending on the size and style of the tool, the nature of the work completed, the type and condition of the soil, the power, the obstacles in the field, and the distance between the farmhouse and the field.

In the United States, each foot of width of the tool or machine can work one to three acres per day (that is, six to eighteen Chinese mu). The higher rate of work is three acres or ten gongshi mu per day, which is usually only achieved with a tractor. The lower rate of work is one acre or less per day.

In the United States, most agricultural implements have more than one foot of working width, while in China, except for the handle, they have less than one foot of working width. Most Chinese agricultural implements are of the one-horse type. In southern China, most draught animals are water buffalo, and in northern China, they are yellow cattle. Regarding the "Duty," there are no records in China so far. In the comparison of "Rates of Work," the amount of work completed by each person in the United States using one agricultural implement and one or more draught animals in each operation is higher than that completed by each person in China under the same conditions. In China, the "Rate of Work" for the same operation varies depending on the style of the agricultural implement. For example, one person using a Chinese sickle that can cut eight to ten rows of rice at a time can cut 1.7 English acres or 10.2 Chinese mu per day, but if using a sickle, they can only cut 0.46 acres or 2.8 Chinese mu per day. The area cultivated by a cultivator pulled by one draught animal is much larger than that cultivated by a hoe. The former can cultivate 1.7 acres or 11.4 Chinese mu per day, while the latter can only cultivate 0.4 acres or 2.5 Chinese mu.

The comparison between a sickle and a scythe is the same as the comparison between a cultivator and a hoe, which are more labor-saving agricultural implements. Labor-saving agricultural implements, machinery, and equipment have the benefit of working at the right time and reducing costs, which can enable work to be completed when it should be completed; such as when the soil conditions are suitable, when crops should be planted, when weeds should be removed (before they grow too large), and when they should be harvested (before the grains are overly ripe or damaged by adverse weather). However, labor-saving agricultural implements sometimes also have disadvantages, such as scythes cannot cut crops that have been blown down by the wind, and Chinese scythes are too light to harvest heavy crops, easily wasting grains and messing up straw.

Chinese farmers have tried their best to choose agricultural implements that are suitable for their environment, but it is possible and urgently needed to improve them.

The average number of equipment on each Chinese farm is 28 pieces. With at least 60,000,000 farm households, the total number of major agricultural implements is approximately 1,680,000,000 pieces. The average value of agricultural implements per acre is 2.5 yuan (translator's note: this is the value before the Sino-Japanese War, and the following estimated numbers are also the same), which is about one-third of the value of farm machinery per acre in the United States.

The materials used to manufacture Chinese agricultural implements are mainly wood and iron. The ploughshare and mouldboard of the plough are made of iron. More than two thousand years before the American Newbold invented the cast iron plow, when the cast iron plow was invented in the United States 150 years ago, the farmers there were afraid to use it because they feared that iron would harm the soil and help the growth of weeds.

Although China has had refined agricultural implements for centuries, it has not made any improvements to date. For example, according to estimates, if better metal could be used to maintain the sharpness of the hoe edge and reduce the necessary degree of wear, 15% to 20% less labor could be used when hoeing. (But China generally does not pay attention to this.)

Currently, the manufacture of agricultural implements is mostly carried out on a small scale in workers' homes. Blacksmiths cast the iron parts, and carpenters make the wooden parts. In the context of rapid advances in modern technology, regardless of whether the cost remains the same or increases, more efficient agricultural implements should be produced. Although farmers pay a higher price, the labor savings and increased production will be more than what they pay.

Number of Agricultural Implements per Farm

The number of implements per farm is based on the area of cultivation and the number of days required to complete the cultivation. For example: if the field must be plowed within ten days after the wheat harvest in order to insert rice seedlings, and each plow can plow three mu per day, then thirty mu can be plowed in ten days. But if the farmer has forty mu to plant rice, then one plow feels insufficient, and two plows feel too many. So farmers have several solutions: they can rent a plow to plow the extra ten mu, but this is often not easy to do, because other farmers also need to plow their fields at this time, and rents rise. Another solution is to risk reducing yields by plowing early or late at the appropriate time, or to expand the farm area, that is, to rent (or buy) twenty more mu to match the efficiency of agricultural implements. If the local area is particularly suitable for growing rice, it does not seem wise to cleverly use part of the land to grow other crops in order to allocate labor. Another method, which may be the best, is to use a larger plow and a larger draught animal or a stronger draught animal, which can plow four mu per day, and can also plow the field in ten days. On a farm, a good combination of various agricultural implements, draught animals, labor, and crop types can make the most effective use of agricultural implements, labor, and livestock.

The cost of using an efficient tool varies depending on the number of days it is used each year. The cost of agricultural implements includes investment interest, depreciation, storage, repair, and usage costs (such as lubricating oil for machinery and fuel for engines). In China in 1935, the average cost of various agricultural implements per Chinese mu of crop was 0.365 yuan (or US$0.60 per English acre), and the total cost accounted for 41% of the value of the agricultural implements (calculated at market prices at the time).

### The Importance of Construction

— Wang Ying

I have explained the importance of a positive attitude in difficult environments. But having a positive attitude still requires continuous construction work, because construction work cannot wait for the passage of time. Many construction projects cannot be successful overnight, so it is even more necessary to do them step by step, day by day, and accumulate over time to create a good foundation.

China's industry was originally backward. At this difficult and important time, if we do not engage in construction, we will never be able to compare with the production capacity of advanced countries. Therefore, for survival, to overcome future difficulties, active construction can also be said to be the key plan of the current industry.

### Introduction to Industrial and Commercial Management

— Xu Baiyi

E. Lighting: Lighting is very important in manufacturing plants, especially in places where delicate work is done. Many goods that do not meet standards and accidents that occur in manufacturing plants can be said to be due to insufficient lighting. Before the war, the Shanghai Electric Power Company often published advertisements urging manufacturers to pay attention to the lighting problems in their factories. At the same time, they could also send personnel to inspect the lighting problems in various factories for free. They had a table that could measure whether the lighting was appropriate.

Equipment in Factories

After building a factory, a single factory building cannot carry out production. It is necessary to put in the necessary equipment. This equipment includes various machines, parts, and necessities for rotating parts such as cabinets and shelves.

In smaller factories, the equipment purchased is as simple as possible, because it can be done at a lower cost. But sometimes, a business develops rapidly, then it is necessary to increase equipment immediately.

When purchasing equipment, one point should be considered, that is, many machines are constantly changing with each passing day. After a period of time, new types of machines are manufactured. Then, when purchasing, you should consider this point. You should have a budget to prepare to purchase newer machines within a few years, and in terms of productivity, strive for speed, so that the depreciation of these machines can be used up within a few years. When there are new machines, you can have the strength to purchase them.

Principles of Factory Layout

The work inside the factory should of course be as convenient as possible, so when laying out, it should be arranged according to the order of the work to make the work proceed very smoothly. For example, for the completion of a single product, it is necessary to go through ten steps. Then, if you link these ten steps directly, it can proceed smoothly. If the first step is done on the first floor, the second step is done on the fourth floor, and the third step is done on the second floor, then the raw materials and products in the process have to be taken up and down. The work cannot proceed smoothly, and the waste of time and manpower becomes a huge loss. In many old factories, this phenomenon often occurs because the buildings are gradually added.

The factory of the Ewo Brewery Company has a total of five floors. First, the raw materials such as barley and yeast are sent from the bottom floor to the top floor by electricity, and then, through fermentation and other work, they come down layer by layer. At the end, the bottling part is in the bottom room. The bottling and boxing areas are very close, and the boxing area is connected to the landowner of the rotary transport vehicle. This kind of factory is of course designed by experts, so the progress of the work is very smooth.

The life of the genius mathematician Hua Luogeng is a moving story. He was only a junior high school graduate. He worked as a shop assistant in the cotton shop opened by his father for five years. He also served as a clerk and accountant in the Jintan Junior High School. He was always attacked and left. It was not until he was twenty-one years old that he was introduced to Tsinghua as an assistant in the Department of Mathematics. (See the Kunming communication on the Education edition of the Twenty-ninth Sanbao.)

Two people had a decisive effect on his current achievements. One was Wang Weike, a teacher at Yutan Junior High School, and the other was Kang Xueyu, a fellow villager. The former constantly encouraged and helped him before and after he graduated from junior high school, and the latter introduced him to Tsinghua, allowing him to have the opportunity to develop and perform.

In the world academic community, Hua Luogeng's achievements have been recognized as first-class standards. The Soviet Academy of Sciences specially invited him to give lectures. His "Theory of Sum of Least Primes" is world-renowned.

The world has Bole, but it must also have a thousand-mile horse; if there is no Wang Weike or Kang Peiyu, how can there be the current Hua Luogeng.

A person's life, opportunities often determine success or failure, there are many talented but unrecognized people in history, making future generations infinitely regret their obscurity!

Historical mistakes, if they are to be avoided from being repeated, must have these two principles: hope that others will recognize and promote you, but also help others at any time, so that everyone can use their talents to the fullest.

### Monkey King Temple

— Fang Jun

Monkey King Temple is just a temple that is neither big nor small, but like Song Wang Tai, it is known as one of Hong Kong's scenic spots, and it is not far from Song Wang Tai, both on a small hill outside Kowloon City. What is particularly attractive about Monkey King Temple is the "Chicken" character drawn in one stroke on a black rock mountain behind the temple. Someone claims that it is the handwriting of Wang Xizhi, which is of course a rumor and an attachment. But its flowing brushstrokes have also given the business of a popular restaurant in Central a wall painting. It is following behind people and working for its own daily blessings. So every time I go, I always order this dish, and then wait aside for my five internal organs temple (stomach) to be sacrificed to.

Traveling Medicine Man

According to the temple stele, Hou Wang has a real name, he was a dead traveling medicine man. Emperor Song led the defeated army to flee here. Most of the soldiers were infected with diseases and could not find medicine. Hou Wang showed a good prescription in a dream. After the emperor woke up, he ordered people to collect raw medicine according to the prescription, and the medicine cured the disease. The whole army was unharmed. The emperor felt that he had meritorious service in his dreams, so he recognized him as Hou Wang, and ordered the construction of temples so that he could receive incense for generations to come. The incense is still flourishing today. Especially it can be immortal with the legends of Song Wang Tai.

Restaurants Around the Hill

Song Wang Tai and Hou Wang Temple form an oblique line; no one who goes to Song Wang Tai does not go to Hou Wang Temple, but those who go to Hou Wang Temple do not necessarily go to Mi Wang Tai. The reason is that Hou Wang is a god, and he has spiritual power, which can attract many devout men and women; Song Wang Tai is just a vegetable garden, slightly embellished with artificial decorations. Except for those who cherish the past to climb and lament, or sightseeing, it is not enough to compare with Hou Wang Temple. In addition to idols for people to worship, Hou Wang Temple has many places to eat around the hill. And the furnishings in those places: bamboo children and thatched huts, are very interesting, plus everything is ready-made. Almost like Rong Kui, with high hopes, familiar customers can choose themselves. Especially the cooking is proper, and it is very delicious, which is invisibly a great help to the liveliness there.

Middle-Aged Beggar

There is also a miracle at Monkey King Temple, a middle-aged beggar squatting under a big tree every day. He is supported by someone, and he has never been seen begging for a penny from tourists, and he is always so solemn and does not talk much. He especially has cold eyes, watching those filial pieties, respecting wooden puppets and actually respecting the superstitious people of the temple priest. But his cold eyes do not have much intention, they are just a pair of cold eyes. I have been to Hou Wang Temple no less than ten times in a few years, and every time I see him, he is in this image. I feel strange, and I also feel puzzled, because I cannot find out his origin.

Hou Wang Chao Temple is a rather lively place, and after the loneliness arises, it will be like the wind and clouds dispersing.

### U.S. Population

— Gang

Increased by Eight Million in Five Years

According to official reports from the United States, the US population increased by approximately eight million between April 1, 1940, and July 1, 1945, including troops abroad.

On July 1, 1940, the total population of the United States was approximately 139,621,431. The last U.S. population survey counted a total of 131,669,275 people. Since last July, the US population has continued to increase. As of October 1, 1945, the U.S. population had already exceeded 140 million.

Since 1940, the increase in the US population has been approximately nine-tenths of that between 1930 and 1940. The main reason for the increase in the US population rate is the increase in the wartime fertility rate, while the mortality rate remains relatively low.

Low mortality rate, high fertility rate, plus more people migrating in than migrating out, the U.S. population cannot but increase.

### Artificial Rubber

In the past three years, the University of Illinois in the United States has invented 50 types of artificial rubber.

Professor Marvel predicts that within two years, artificial rubber will surpass natural rubber.

Of the 50 new types of artificial rubber, the most exciting is sodium rubber. In the past, the biggest disadvantage of making rubber was its poor heat resistance and it was easier to manufacture. Sodium rubber has greatly improved in both of these areas.

Professor Marvel said that current artificial rubber tires are already as good as natural rubber tires.

In 1942, artificial rubber tires could travel 3,000 miles at 30 miles per hour. Now, they can travel 55,000 miles at 50 miles per hour.

### A Country Fly's Letter

— John

City Flies: I hope all is well. We have arrived in the countryside and all aspects of our life are more comfortable than in the towns and cities. Now, I will briefly tell you about it.

In the city, every day you must find your own food, running around busily. Even if you find something, it is nothing more than sour rice and bitter vegetables. Sometimes you even suffer at the hands of health inspectors. We often inquire and hear that many of our city brothers have perished under "DDT". How dangerous! How terrifying! But in the countryside, you don't have to work hard for food. You could say that everywhere is like a silver plate or golden tray. Cow sheds! Pig pens! Dung pits! All are our dining halls and our lodges, and they are permanent and stable. Therefore, our brothers generally enjoy the blessings of a past life. In the countryside, not only is the food more plentiful and easier to obtain than in the city, but the most interesting thing is that when we eat, the country folk don't issue eviction orders like the city people do, and they let us eat our fill as much as possible. We often hear them say, "Anyway, flies will come back even if you chase them away, and you can't get rid of them all, so just let them be! Besides, they won't necessarily cause any trouble!" They also can't afford "DDT", and even if they could, they wouldn't know how to use it. Therefore, they blame the city health inspectors for being too strict, often uttering curses against the investigators. Naturally, we like to hear this the most, and we obey it the most, often finding ourselves in a situation where we have no choice but to grab whatever is in front of us. Don't you think it's interesting and fun? Do you have such an environment there?

When dishes are placed on the table, we smell the fragrance and fly out in groups from our lodges to taste the fresh and delicious flavors that people haven't eaten yet. Some brothers are so happy that they get drunk and fall into the dishes, never to wake up. Those country people can't tell right from wrong at all. They swallow the corpses that have fallen into the dishes along with the dishes. Even if they find corpses in the dishes, they are not angry and don't throw away the dishes together. They just gently pick out the corpses with chopsticks. City flies: If you encountered this situation in your place, I'm afraid you would die without a burial place, right? City flies: In the countryside! These few points are the most common, and there are many other comfortable places. In short, our life is so free, happy, comfortable, and interesting. Our environment is as different from that of the city as heaven and earth. It's too stable, too carefree.

We are of the same kind and should help each other and cooperate. In the spirit of "sharing good fortune and weathering misfortune together," the city is a dangerous area and should not be inhabited for long. When you have time, we hope that you will also come to the countryside. At that time, we can lead you to enjoy the unique delicacies, comfortable environment, and sweet life. What is written here is only a small part. You must come to the countryside yourself to appreciate it. I won't talk much. Goodbye! I wish you good health! Country flies send their regards.

### Spinach is Harmful

— Oriental Thorn

Most people think that spinach is a nutritious food, but recently, Dr. Wittle and Dr. Abbott of the University of Missouri announced that spinach may damage human health.

From a nutritional point of view, leafy green vegetables have both advantages and disadvantages.

The oxalic acid content in spinach is quite high. Oxalic acid combines with the calcium in the vegetables, which may damage human health.

Moreover, the oxalic acid in spinach may combine with the calcium in other foods, which would be an even greater loss. Scientific evidence shows that eating too much spinach can cause bone decalcification.

Perhaps you will ask, then what about the iron in spinach? Spinach contains a lot of iron. This is always beneficial, right? Nutritionists also have an answer to this: only 20% of the trace elements in spinach can be absorbed by the body.

Therefore, spinach is not as beneficial as people propagate, but blind humans are blowing spinach up. In the past decade, spinach consumption has increased eightfold. How ridiculous and lamentable!

### Roads, Roads - Not Even a Face

— Feng Yi

The Communists captured Qu-Fu, and the metal ritual vessels in Kong Guangnei were all looted. This can let people who don't understand "all cleared" policies, understand "all cleared".

When we are sitting in a car driving on the road, if it weren't for the tall buildings on both sides, I would really suspect that I was back on the Qian-Gui Road. This makes people think that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has no choice but to suspend even the surface work due to financial difficulties, and of course they have unspeakable grievances. Especially since Chinese people have always been particular about "face," imagine how painful it must be in their hearts when a person can't even take care of their "face." Roads represent the face of a city, and Shanghai's roads, which once maintained a clean and charming appearance before the war, have become riddled with holes after eight years of war and one year of chaos, plus the occurrence of diseases, resulting in a skeletal and ugly appearance.

The representatives who were beaten claimed to be "people's representatives." All the expenses for their stay in the hospital after being "injured" should, in principle, be borne by the "people," but it was not the "people" who paid the money. I wonder where those "people" went.

Zhang Naiqi's younger sister recently fought with Huang Yanpei's daughter over the relocation of housing, and the case is about to be taken to court. A newspaper said, "The two are so unpeaceful that heaven will not become democratic." From small to large, housing disputes in Shanghai are a lawsuit that will never be cleared.

After square publications were banned, we considered the printing houses, with a loss of 40,000,000 yuan per month. The indirect impact includes screenwriters, writers, newspaper vendors, and distributors in other provinces, totaling more than 100,000 people. The honor of "Miss Hong Kong" was seized by Guan Tuantuan. In fact, Ping Nan's father's surname is Liang, so her real surname is Liang. According to Guan Tuantuan, the first condition for a son-in-law is health. At the same time, she reported that horseback riding is a student's hobby and that she has seven years of experience. If we combine equestrian skills and experience in taming horses into one topic, I think Miss Guan must have the art of taming her husband.

"Keeping the husband's 'root' clean is the wife's 'duties'.” The mayor's wife made this view in a speech at the Women's Youth Association. It can be said that she is scratching the itch of Miss Shanghai.

### No Limit on Transfer Fees or Deposits - Two Years of Rent in Advance

— Wuling Man

Some people advocate reforming the clothing of monks in order to cultivate a lively atmosphere in Buddhism. I agree, and at the same time, I would like to suggest that the French priests and nuns should also reform their similar clothing in order to cultivate a "lively atmosphere" in Catholicism.

A small advertisement for [Couple's Tiny House] was published in the newspaper, which reads; "Young couple without children, a clean and quiet room with minimal sanitary facilities; those who intend to sublet, please submit a letter to a certain place, if suitable, we will come to treat, if not suitable, we will keep it secret." It can be seen that there are many unmentionable "secrets" in renting out houses. The authorities hope to stop the charging of gold bars as transfer fees, while those who are seeking a house are willing to keep the "secrets", no wonder the advertisements for transfer fees are still eye-catching.

The authorities have already noticed the advertisements for transfer fees in the newspapers and are strictly cracking down on the act of transferring houses. However, is it also in the scope of crackdown if no transfer fee is charged, no deposit is collected, the monthly rent is 100,000 yuan, but two years of rent must be paid in advance at once?

French Democracy Day, in the past, on July 14th, there must have been a celebration in the French Concession. In addition to holding military parades and banquets, the authorities decorated Xiafei Road with red, blue and white tricolor lanterns, stretching as far as the eye could see. Visitors to Gujiazhai Park were like clouds, and as a result, many citizens were often arrested for violating prohibitions. The French's arrogance often made thoughtful people sigh secretly. After the recovery of the concession, such a grand occasion will no longer appear. But at this moment, perhaps some residents in the former concession are still yearning for everything in the past.

Jing Gengqiu, the female pirate leader who ran rampant in the Dapeng Bay area fifteen years ago, is now 37 years old and was recently arrested in Guangdong. Fifteen years ago, the female bandit was only about twenty years old. Chinese newspapers once called her the Pirate Queen. The three characters "Jing Gengqiu" are elegant. The fact that she is called the Queen of Pirates and is also young and beautiful with talent, cannot help but make people imagine.

### Replies to Readers - Medicine and Health

(1) Shen Mintong asks: I am seventeen years old this year, female, and have always been very fat, especially in the face. Recently, I have become even fatter and always growing taller. I am currently four feet six and a half inches tall in the Chinese system. I don't know if I will continue to grow taller. What is the standard height for women now? What medicine can I take to thin down, or what kind of substance have I been eating too much of? Will reducing this substance help me lose weight? What kind of consumption method or exercise can make me grow taller? I hope the doctor will reply soon.

[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, Doctor of Medicine] You need to do more exercises and eat less meat and fatty foods. Special physical exercises may help you grow taller. You need to seek guidance from experts.

(2) Wu Zhicheng asks: Editor, I have several questions. Please give me your advice so that patients can follow the treatment and get rid of the pain as soon as possible. I would be very grateful. (1) I heard that penicillin can cure gonorrhea, but is there any hope of a radical cure for chronic turbidity? How many tablets or units should I take? (2) Are there any truly reliable and famous doctors in Shanghai who can treat this disease? (3) I heard that penicillin is not very effective in treating lung disease, but is there any harm in taking it? (4) Is testing for gonorrhea just a urine test? Do ordinary hospitals test for it? (5) Is "hormone" used to treat kidney disease? Is there a tablet, and how many should I take?

[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, Doctor of Medicine] (1) Penicillin is effective in curing gonorrhea or leucorrhea, and the number of units depends on the condition of each patient. (2) Except for quack doctors, everyone else is fine. (3) It is ineffective, so there is no need to take it. (4) All hospitals can do it. In addition to urine tests, you can also test blood and prostatic fluid. (5) Please ask the doctor to decide whether it is necessary.

(3) Mei Moxi asks: I suddenly suffered from a skin disease this year. The symptoms are as follows: There are pimples on the pores of the epidermis, which are neither painful nor itchy, but the pimples are as hard as rough sandpaper and feel quite prickly when touched by hand. Within a small circle of this pimple, the skin also seems to be hardened. I am uneasy because of the illness, and I dare not see a doctor because of my poor financial situation. I hope that the doctor will tell me the cause of my illness and the most effective treatment method.

[Answer from Dr. Yu Xin'en, Doctor of Medicine] It is a type of vitamin A deficiency. You need to ingest a large amount of vitamin A-containing cod liver oil. Foods that are high in vitamin A include carrots, red amaranth leaves, spinach, fresh milk, tomatoes, green peppers, eggs, and black sesame seeds.

### Traffic Police Officers Save Food to Help Disaster Relief - How Can Wealthy Families Turn a Blind Eye and Not Help?

The Disaster is Serious, Everyone Should Help According to Their Ability to Create Blessings for Future Generations
