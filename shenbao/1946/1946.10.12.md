This reporter visited Chief Civil Affairs Officer Wu Dingchang and Minister Zhang Lisheng in the evening to inquire whether the failure of various parties to submit their lists would hinder the scheduled convening of the National Assembly. Wu and Zhang's replies were similar, stating that the convening of the National Assembly was in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and that people from various parties could attend and participate at any time. The National Assembly would reserve seats for them. As for the issue of alternates attending, it was difficult to implement due to the lack of clear legal provisions and many practical difficulties.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] According to Hong Lanyou, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly, the National Assembly is scheduled to convene on November 12th, and this has been confirmed and will not be changed.

Currently, there is still a month before the meeting, and representatives from various regions can arrive in time. The government still hopes that various parties can submit their lists as soon as possible. Transportation will not be a problem. The preparatory work for the assembly is being stepped up and is generally in order.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The National Government issued an order on the 12th, stating that the National Assembly has been rescheduled to convene on November 12th of the 35th year of the Republic of China. A clear order had been previously issued. Now that the meeting is imminent, all elected and appointed representatives should, in accordance with Article 89 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, personally come to Nanjing to register at the National Assembly Representative Registration Office within ten days before the meeting, i.e., starting from November 2nd of this year, and submit their certificates of election.

### Sun Ke Postpones Return to the Capital; The Third Party Continues to Mediate for Peace; The CCP Believes Negotiations Require a Comprehensive Ceasefire

[Report from Our Newspaper] After several contacts between President Sun and the Third Party, he was originally scheduled to go to Nanjing today, but according to inquiries made by this reporter at Sun's residence last night, the date of Sun's departure has not yet been determined.

[Another Dispatch] After Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, arrived in Shanghai, the League's leaders in Shanghai met at the China Vocational Education Society. After the meeting, Liang visited Zhou Enlai. However, it is not known whether any new proposals were put forward during the conversation.

The leaders of the Third Party remaining in Shanghai gathered again at the Bank of Communications yesterday. The three proposals they suggested were: (1) The National Army should stop attacking Zhangjiakou indefinitely; (2) Everything should be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (3) Reopen the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference. It is reported that Ambassador Stuart was notified in advance.

Chen Jiakang, spokesperson for the CCP in this city, announced yesterday: When Zhou Enlai heard of these two proposals, he expressed great sympathy and said that this was the CCP's consistent position, and that he himself "is willing to follow the gentlemen and work for peace." However, the CCP's doubts about the government's determination to cease fire have not yet been completely dispelled. Therefore, Chen still said: Since the Third Party is willing to mediate for peace, the government's troops attacking Zhangjiakou should be withdrawn to their original defense. If this can be implemented, the CCP is also willing to participate in the three-to-five-person, two-meeting proposal put forward by President Chiang in his National Day address, and jointly discuss the method of a permanent and comprehensive cessation of conflict pointed out in the address. Chen did not insist on convening the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference, but emphasized that negotiations cannot be conducted while Zhangjiakou is being bombed, and that the method of a comprehensive ceasefire must be discussed first during the negotiations.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The peace talks remained in a standstill state on the 11th. Government officials stated that the memorandum published by the Communist Party yesterday contained many contradictions in its eleven listed points. The compromise opinion that the Democratic League intends to propose has not yet been published. After Liang Shuming went to Shanghai, it was rumored that he would meet with Zhou Enlai to discuss the matter and urge him to return to Nanjing. At the same time, it was rumored in Nanjing that the Democratic League representatives remaining in Shanghai would return to Nanjing with Liang on the 12th, and that Zhou Enlai would also return to Nanjing tomorrow night. Li Huang of the Youth Party met with Wang Shijie after attending the Resident Committee of the Political Participation Council on the morning of the 11th and discussed the issue of peace talks. At 4:30, he visited Wu Dingchang and Zhang Lisheng. Dong Biwu of the Communist Party had no activities all day and did not confirm the rumors circulating in various newspapers that Zhou Enlai would return to Nanjing that day.

[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Beiping Pacification Headquarters informed reporters on the evening of the 11th that the National Army completely recovered Zhangjiakou at 12:50 PM on the 11th. According to news from the headquarters of the 11th War Zone, after recovering Zhangbei, the National Army of Fu Zuoyi's troops recovered Huanggangwa, 18 kilometers north of Zhangjiakou, on the evening of the 10th. At 12:50 PM on the 11th, they entered the northern suburbs of Zhangjiakou, and street fighting broke out.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] According to relevant sources, the Lu Ying'ao Army, Dong Qiwu Army, and Liu Chunfang Cavalry Division of our 12th War Zone, under the personal command of Commander Fu Zuoyi, pressed towards Zhangjiakou with thunderous force from the northwest and west gates, entering the city at 2:00 PM on the 11th.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th Dispatch] The National Army entered Zhangjiakou from Huanghuaping on the afternoon of the 11th, capturing many prisoners. The city suffered heavy damage, and the Communist troops fled in the direction of the east and west of the city. It is reported that after entering the city, the National Army of Fu Zuoyi's troops immediately launched a pacification campaign. Also, major fires broke out in Xuanhua, Xiahuayuan, and other places on the morning of the 11th. It is reported that the fires were caused by the Communist troops burning down major buildings.

### The War in Chahar Province is About to End

[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] After the news of the National Army's recovery of Zhangjiakou came, all parties were shocked. This reporter visited a certain military authority, who stated that the war in Chahar Province is about to end. Because of this decisive war, the entire North China situation has changed. From now on, the Communist Army's actions will be limited to disturbances, and the political situation can be expected to become easier to resolve. It was also stated that Zhangjiakou is an important military town outside the Great Wall. In terms of military strategy, it is the key to Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe. To ensure the safety of the Great Wall line, it is necessary to control Zhangjiakou. If Zhangjiakou is occupied by the enemy, then Beiping and Tianjin will feel threatened. The Communist Party, after being defeated in Rehe and then in Jining, completely concentrated its heavy troops around Zhangjiakou. It is estimated that the Communist Army within the large encirclement of the National Army in Chahar Province is no less than 60,000 people. The inability of Zhangjiakou to hold out shows the weakness of the Communist Army's fighting power, and the main force of the Communist Army in eastern Chahar, which is resisting the 11th War Zone troops, may also collapse as a result. Looking back at the war in Chahar Province, its prelude began on September 26, when Chief of Staff Chen inspected Nankou and Zhangyuan from the air. On the 29th, the National Army officially advanced. In particular, Fu Zuoyi's troops took advantage of the void and quickly launched an offensive straight to northern Chahar, capturing Shangdu on the 6th and reaching Zhangbei on the 8th. Zhangyuan was captured on the 2nd day. Its impact on the overall domestic situation is great.

### Ambassador Stuart's Double Tenth Anniversary Speech: Deeply Hopes That Pure Patriots in China Will Strive for Unified, Peaceful, and Democratic Politics

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart issued a Double Tenth Anniversary speech, saying: "When the Xinhai Revolution established the Republic of China, I happened to be in Nanjing. Therefore, I had the opportunity to meet the great leaders of the movement and many other people around them. I wholeheartedly sympathized with the goals and ideals of the patriotic men under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and never lost confidence in the ultimate success of their heroic revolutionary cause. Their revolutionary spirit of constantly fighting against domestic selfish or reactionary forces and defeating the brutal and resolute foreign aggression to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty is still actively playing its effect. This is especially evident in the students during the Anti-Japanese War. With regard to the national resistance, I have long experienced the extraordinary potential of the patriotism of the Chinese people. Therefore, I deeply hope that under the leadership of the appropriate successors of Mr. Sun Yat-sen at present, all political parties and non-political parties of liberalism, farsightedness and pure patriotism will be concentrated to launch another revolution, to eliminate the national enemies among their nationals who hold narrow partisan views, or are selfish and unscrupulous, or are ignorant reactionary forces. These domestic people are currently hindering the progress of the unified, peaceful and constitutional democratic politics advocated by the martyrs who created this anniversary."

### The Executive Yuan Refutes LaGuardia: There Are No Goods Piled Up in Shanghai Port; The Performance of Materials Shipped to Other Ports Has Been Excellent in Recent Weeks

[United Press, This City, 11th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan issued a statement today, refuting the statement made by LaGuardia, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), at a press conference in Washington yesterday that "Chinese ports are still congested," and listing the details of the work in the past few weeks and a letter from Egerton, Director of the China Branch of UNRRA, as proof. According to the letter from the Shanghai Transportation and Housing Administration Bureau to UNRRA cited by the Executive Yuan, the relief materials transported by the Executive Yuan to other ports in September totaled 96,000 tons, and those distributed in this city totaled 24,000 tons. At present, due to improvements in various facilities and procedures, the monthly distribution of relief materials to this city and other ports can reach 150,000 tons. Egerton also sent a letter to the Executive Yuan last week, praising its work. It is said that the materials shipped to other ports have created a brilliant record. The excellent performance of the relief supplies distributed by the Executive Yuan in the past five weeks is worthy of glory. If this achievement can be maintained, the unrestricted transportation of materials to Shanghai can be realized earlier. According to this branch, only 16,610 tons of relief materials were unloaded in Shanghai in the week ending October 4, but in the same week, 28,788 tons were shipped from Shanghai to other ports, and 19,936 tons were distributed in this city. LaGuardia's statement that 245,000 tons of relief materials were piled up in Shanghai docks is actually only 200,000 tons, half of which are surplus materials purchased from the US military in the South Pacific. Before they are inventoried and repaired, it is not convenient to dispose of them immediately.

### LaGuardia's One-Sided Report

[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] LaGuardia, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), told reporters today that the ports in China are still congested, and there is no hope of lifting the ban on UNRRA materials shipped to China in the near future. General Rocks will personally investigate the congestion of goods in China, saying that there are currently 245,000 tons of UNRRA goods piled up in Shanghai docks, which is part of the 1 million tons of goods, food, and medicine shipped to China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Associated Press] A member of the Central Committee of UNRRA recently accused LaGuardia of using the UNRRA mechanism to achieve his "personal political ambitions," saying that if the US Congress continues to conduct investigations, it will find LaGuardia's incompetence and numerous errors. LaGuardia attempted to allocate 2% of the UNRRA budget as a reserve fund, but refused to disclose its use.

### Mrs. Cripps Reports on Mission to China: In Her Heart She Has a Motherland and Also China

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 10th] Mrs. Cripps, President of the British United Aid to China Fund, held a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 11th to report on her mission and the work of the organization. It is said that her main task in coming to China is to learn about the current situation in China and its post-war plans, as every British person concerned about China is extremely concerned about the above two issues. In addition to Mrs. Cripps, those who attended today's press conference also included her beloved daughter, Peggy, and the organization's secretary, Mrs. Le. Reporters asked many questions. Mrs. Cripps first expressed her feelings about her visit, saying: "For the past four years, I have been working in Britain to aid China, and I have the greatest interest in everything about China. This field visit to the China I have been longing for is extremely pleasant." In reply to reporters' inquiries, she briefly stated: "The plan for this visit to China is still difficult to determine. I plan to go to various places for inspection first and report back to the people in Britain. The Aid China Fund is a very large organization with more than 80,000 staff. Those who voluntarily participate in the work are not included. Only those who participate in the 'One Office Worker a Week Movement' have reached 780,000. Over time, the number is considerable. Those who are willing to donate money voluntarily, even young schoolchildren, will help with all their money, which is very touching." She continued to describe the nature of the Aid China Fund, explaining that participants in this organization include people from the extreme right and the extreme left. Businessmen and industrialists in cities and towns are enthusiastic about donating money. Some donations amount to thousands of pounds, but most of them regularly donate one shilling or one office worker. In fact, it is an organization representing all the people of Britain and is completely independent politically.

### The British government never interferes with the use of donations. The organization also does not make any designations to the Chinese side when allocating funds, except for those specifically designated by the donors. A reporter asked whether she planned to visit the Communist areas for inspection. Mrs. Cripps replied: "This matter depends on time and circumstances, and no concrete decision has been made yet." She also said that some people are propagating that China does not need relief. The Aid China Fund will explain the situation in China and its urgent need for relief to the British people. British workers are very concerned about the situation in China, and aid work can increase their understanding and knowledge of China.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 11th] Mrs. Cripps told Chinese and foreign reporters this morning that the staff of 5,000 British commercial firms and factories, totaling 780,000 people, generously donate several shillings and pounds every week to the British United Aid to China Fund. She also said: "In my heart, I have my motherland, and I also have China."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] After holding a press conference on the 11th, Mrs. Cripps visited National Central University at 11:00 AM, attended a banquet hosted by President Wu Yifang of Ginling Women's College at 12:00 PM, and visited the school. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, she attended a tea party of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee. In the evening, she attended a dinner party of the China-British Association. She is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 14th and then go to Lanzhou, Beiping and other places for inspection before going to Shanghai.

She then entered the tea hall, which was filled with Chinese and foreign women leaders and social celebrities. Director Song first stated the significance of the welcome, dividing it into three points: (1) Mrs. Cripps' enthusiasm, (2) Enthusiasm for donating money to China, (3) Mrs. Cripps has donated 1.8 million pounds to the British Aid China Fund in the past four years, which has been used for 300 units of our schools, hospitals and charitable organizations. Directly and indirectly, except for the four provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Jehol, the benefited areas are almost all over China. Finally, she expressed her deep gratitude. Mrs. Cripps replied briefly, stating that since leaving England via Marseille, Cairo, Calcutta, Yangon, and Bangkok to Hong Kong, it seemed that she had come with the enthusiastic welcome from China. She was especially grateful for the arrangements made for her in Nanjing. The funds she donated came from all parts of the UK and she hopes to use them in all parts of China. She has come to understand China's needs so that she can plan for continued donations.

At this time, the responsible cadres of various local units are convened to review the business, which is of great importance to the future of financial rectification and economic revival. It must be known that our country has entered the ranks of the five powers in international financial institutions, while the phenomenon of industrial depression and social unrest in our country is extremely serious. How should future financial measures be coordinated internationally and meet the needs of the economy? This is the greatest responsibility of our Central Bank and the most arduous task at present. It is especially necessary for all internal and external colleagues to work together to achieve it. Therefore, internal and external will must be integrated, and then the implementation of policies can be universally implemented without deviation. The personnel structure must be rectified, and then the efficiency of operations can be actively improved and progress made every day. I hope that this business conference will explore the conclusions, without any embellishment, properly formulate methods, and implement them carefully, so that all future operations of the Central Bank can accurately conform to the government's decisions and take on the great responsibility of leadership, creating the grand plan of the bank of banks, spreading its reputation abroad and benefiting the people. I hope and encourage you to do your best. Zhongzheng, October 10th, Fu, Wen.]

### Food Panic and Fuel Shortage: Dalian Becomes a City of Death: The Soviet Union is Busy Moving Supplies and Watching Residents Freeze and Starve

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 11th] According to those who recently came here from Dalian, Dalian is under Soviet control, with food panic and fuel shortage, and this winter will become a city of death. The city has a population of about one million, with little food reserves, and the winter is extremely cold, and all fuel is insufficient to keep warm. Japanese expatriates are particularly distressed, with more than a dozen people starving to death and committing suicide every day. The railway transporting coal, firewood, and agricultural products from the producing areas to Dalian has been interrupted due to the war. Although five or six Soviet ships arrive every week, they are only busy transporting supplies back home and do not know how to relieve the suffering of the people. Although Dalian is nominally ruled by naturalized people, it is actually under the command of the Soviet military authorities. There are still many Soviet troops in the city, but they seem to be in the rear. The population of the residents was only 650,000 before the war, but it has now increased to nearly one million. More than 250,000 Japanese people have come here from Lushun and other places, most of whom are unemployed and lack food and fuel. Other residents also feel the same suffering, and many sell their clothes at low prices to buy expensive food and coal. The major hotels, pier warehouses, and department stores in the city are operated by starving people. Since the beginning of the year, only six foreign ships have arrived in Dalian. In the past, during the winter, there were sometimes as many as 15 ships docked in the port, but now only five or six arrive every week. The Soviet Union has no navy in Dalian, only one patrol boat performing seaport quarantine tasks, but the army seems to be quite numerous and has artillery. A "Police Training School" established by Chinese people in Dalian sends graduates to Antung under the control of the Communist army in batches, about 300 people each time.

Editorial

### Complete Passage of the Italian Peace Treaty

The Italian Peace Treaty, which has been debated and argued for many months, was completely passed by the plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference on the 9th. According to a dispatch from the United Press, the passage of this treaty "represents the final victory of the Western countries after eleven weeks of verbal battles in the face of fierce opposition from the Soviet Union"; and also said, "The Soviet Union attempted to withdraw the British and American troops stationed in Trieste from the Paris Peace Conference as soon as possible, but the conference rejected it. Therefore, the three major disputes of the Italian Peace Treaty were finally voted on the 8th. The Eastern Group fought again with the Western Group, and the Eastern Group was defeated." According to news reports, the main parts of the Italian Peace Treaty include: (1) the establishment of the Free Port of Trieste under the United Nations organization, (2) the determination of the amount of reparations to Italy, (3) the restrictions on Italy's possession of armaments and the stipulation that Italy give up its special rights in China, etc. Thirty-six articles. From the news transmitted by various news agencies, we can find that even at the last moment, the Soviet Union would not abandon its original position, but rather the laboratory's position did not receive majority support, and was therefore rejected by the conference.

The passage of the Italian Peace Treaty still needs to be ratified by the respective governments before it can take effect. This is the first peace treaty established after World War II. Although Italy participated in the Axis, General Badoglio and King Umberto III of Italy also led their troops to surrender, and some Italian people even participated in the Allied forces against Germany, so Italy's defeat could not be equated with Germany and Japan. However, because of this, Germany and Japan are currently under the occupation of the Allied forces, but the Italian Peace Treaty has been completely passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Since the beginning of the discussion on the treaty, several issues have revolved around the Italian Peace Treaty, such as the reparations issue, the disposition of Italy's former colonies, and the arms limitation issue. Among them, the issue of the Port of Trieste is complex and has been contested for the longest time. Although the various clauses passed by the Paris Peace Conference are not necessarily all the original proposals of Britain and the United States, and most of them are compromise solutions, they are not far from Britain and the United States, which shows the trend of international politics and the trend of international opinion.

In general, the peace treaty concluded with Italy this time does not contain strong revenge emotions, and the provisions are not too strict. Compared with the Treaty of Versailles concluded with Germany after World War I, it is not the same. When the Italian Peace Treaty began to be drafted, the Soviet Union originally demanded the division of Italy's African territories, demanded reparations from Italy, supported Yugoslavia's annexation of Trieste, and opposed the annexation of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece. After several mediations and debates, the Italian Peace Treaty now only stipulates that Italy will pay the Soviet Union US$100 million in reparations, Yugoslavia and Greece US$100 million each, and Abyssinia US$25 million, payable in seven years. The amount of reparations may not be able to satisfy the Soviet Union's desires, but this provision is nothing more than respecting the Soviet Union's opinion. Regarding the disposal of Italy's former colonies, the treaty did not make a clear provision. Article 7 of the Italian Peace Treaty states: "Regarding the fate of Italy's former colonies, the provisions regarding the final legal status of Italy's former colonies will be resolved by the four powers within one year after the signing of the Italian Peace Treaty." Therefore, this issue was not resolved by the Paris Peace Conference, but only postponed the issue to a longer period of time for careful consideration. As for the Trieste issue, the Soviet Union's proposal to support Yugoslavia was not adopted, but the one passed was somewhat close to the original intentions of Britain and the United States, the French compromise plan. Therefore, from these perspectives, the Soviet Union's participation in this Paris Peace Conference must be considered a diplomatic failure.

In the conclusion of this Italian Peace Treaty, France, as the host country, also made the greatest efforts. French Foreign Minister Bidault is a brand new figure who emerged after the war, and with his wisdom and talent, he mediated between the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. If the Soviet Union's participation in this Paris Peace Conference is a failure, then what succeeded at this Paris Peace Conference was the Fourth Republic of France, which emerged after the war. The Trieste issue was certainly passed based on the French amendment, and in many other issues, it was also passed based on the compromise plan proposed by France, such as the issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border, which was passed by the conference in accordance with the so-called "French Line" division. Reborn France, under the leadership of the "Popular Republican Movement" with Catholic believers as its backbone, is now fulfilling its historical mission.

As for the光明正大 attitude taken by our country in this Italian Peace Treaty, it should be respected by all countries. Our Foreign Minister Wang and Representative Guo Taiqi expressed our concern for the defeated countries from the standpoint of international justice, and did not advocate demanding excessive reparations from the defeated countries that exceeded their ability to bear. As for Italy, we did not harbor revenge because Italy had demanded a large amount of compensation from us during the Boxer Rebellion, and we automatically abandoned the demand for compensation. This solemn stance is enough to add glory to our nation. On the issue of the disposition of Italy's former African colonies, our representative also advocated that Libya, Italy's former North African colony, should be granted independence. The North African region was originally an ancient cultural country, and the intelligence and training level of the local residents is relatively high and cannot be compared with the residents of central Africa. It should be granted independence as soon as possible to satisfy the wishes of its people. This move is another noble manifestation of our national spirit. Although the issue of the disposition of Italy's former African colonies has not yet been resolved, our country's position of supporting the ruled nations so that they can independently build their countries should be respected and may not be a way to solve the North African issue.

The Italian Peace Treaty has been completely passed, but the treaty itself is not necessarily a guarantee of peace. How to ensure lasting peace should be the goal of the great powers' efforts in the future. To ensure lasting peace in the world in the future, it will not lose the meaning of revising the Italian Peace Treaty.

### How Should National Schools Implement the Two-Shift System?

— Hu Chaolun

During the war of resistance, various places suffered greatly from military disasters, and cultural institutions were almost completely destroyed. The schools run by the enemy and puppets, being crude and simple, were also reduced to a precarious state. After the victory, all the refugees with rear areas returned one after another. At the beginning of educational rehabilitation, due to the insufficient number of school buildings and equipment, many students were unable to attend school. At the present time of high prices and difficult educational expenses, it is indeed difficult to add a large number of school buildings and purchase a large amount of equipment in a short period of time. To solve the urgent problem of students not being able to attend school, the most simple and easy way is to implement the two-shift system.

The first to propose this two-shift system was the editorial of the "Shen Bao" on August 18, followed by the trial implementation by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and most recently, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to all provinces and cities to promote it. It can be seen that this is indeed an emergency measure for national education. In fact, the two-shift system did not start today. In June of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Ministry of Education promulgated a method for implementing the two-shift system, which stated that the two-shift system has the following types:

1.  Full-day, Two Classrooms, Two-Shift System - Two classrooms simultaneously accommodate two classes of children of the same or different levels, taught back and forth by one teacher. The classrooms are best connected, or in the shape of a "日" (sun) character, with a door in the middle for the teacher to move between.

2.  Full-day, One Classroom, Alternating Two-Shift System - One classroom and one other place (such as the playground, enclosure, library, auditorium, etc.) simultaneously accommodate two classes of children, who take turns entering the classroom, taught by one teacher. Children not directly being taught are either self-studying under the guidance of a student leader or engaged in other activities.

3.  Half-day, Two-Shift System - One classroom accommodates two classes of children, with teaching in the morning and afternoon, taught by one teacher. This two-shift system is divided into the following two forms:

    A.  Children are in school all day, practicing in the classroom for half a day, and engaging in free work or activities in other places under the leadership of a student leader for half a day.

    B.  Children are in school for half a day, and for the other half of the day away from school, the teacher assigns extracurricular work, instructing the children to study on their own.

4.  Full-day and Half-day Mixed Two-Shift System - Two classrooms accommodate two or three classes of children, one class in school all day, and the other two classes in school alternately in the morning and afternoon. The teaching time for the full-day class and the half-day class must be arranged alternately. When the half-day class is being taught, the full-day class should be assigned to self-study or extracurricular work.

5.  Alternating-day, Two-Shift System - One classroom accommodates two classes of children, who are taught in turn on alternating days; the class not being directly taught should be assigned to self-study or extracurricular work.

The difference between the two-shift system and the ordinary class system has been described above. The issues that should be paid attention to during implementation can be explained in the following three aspects.

A. Education Administration Authorities

1.  Whether or not the two-shift system should be implemented in a particular elementary school district should be determined by the competent education administration authority. The basis for the decision should be a survey of school-age children. Determine how many children are not attending school in the district. In addition to the need to increase the number of schools and grades, determine how many can be taught using the two-shift system, and then allocate them to the existing schools, using the two-shift system.

2.  If there is no significant shortage of teachers in the school district, the two-shift system should be assigned two qualified teachers. At the very least, there should be one qualified teacher and one substitute teacher. Otherwise, with too few people, difficulties will arise, and it will be easy to fail.

3.  When implementing the two-shift system, self-study or extracurricular work should be assigned to the class not being directly taught. Self-study and extracurricular work require books, instruments, labor tools, games, etc. Therefore, the education administration authority should provide the necessary equipment expenses for application.

4.  The number of students per grade in the two-shift system is doubled compared to ordinary classes. All office expenses should be increased by at least 70%, so the education administration authority should also increase office expenses based on actual needs.

5.  Teachers who implement the two-shift system have heavier responsibilities and are busier than teachers who teach ordinary classes. They must be selected for their strong abilities, high skills, and service spirit in order to be competent and happy. These good teachers are not easy to recruit. Their treatment must be appropriately improved, and they must be given all kinds of spiritual encouragement.

6.  The two-shift system reduces the amount of direct teaching time due to the doubling of the number of students. This shortcoming must be compensated for by guiding self-study or extracurricular work. Therefore, the allocation of curriculum, teaching materials, and daily schedules is very important. Solving this problem is not only a matter for the teachers themselves. Research and training institutions and supervisors should also be responsible for working together to achieve success. The overall success depends on the education administration authority.

B. Schools

1.  The methods of the two-shift system have been described above. When implementing it in schools, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and decide which method to use. For example, if the number of elementary school children exceeds one grade but the school buildings and equipment are sufficient, the full-day, two-shift system should be used. If the number of children exceeds one grade but they cannot attend school all day, and the school buildings and equipment are insufficient, the alternating-day, two-shift system should be used. If children cannot attend school every day due to transportation or family reasons, the alternating-day, two-shift system should be used. If there are special needs in teaching for teachers and learning for children, the full-day and half-day mixed two-shift system can be used.

2.  Teachers who are responsible for the two-shift system should be fully prepared before class. It is best for teachers to consider and allocate the parts of the teaching materials that must be taught directly and the parts that can be self-studied, and compile simple lesson plans for teaching. At the same time, they must provide effective guidance to students' self-study to prevent them from going down the wrong path, and they must also strictly assess and verify the results of their self-study.

3.  All teachers and staff of the school should work together, regardless of boundaries, and help the two-shift system classes as much as possible. This kind of help is not limited to material help, distributing the places and equipment that the school can use as much as possible to the two-shift system for application. It also involves helping to solve the difficult problems encountered by the two-shift system and providing assistance in work and spiritual encouragement.

C. Students' Parents

1.  As parents, the most painful thing is the problem of their children not being able to attend school. After this great war, school buildings are a big problem, and schools lack material equipment to an extreme degree. Only by implementing the two-shift system can we temporarily deal with the emergency and solve the current problem of students not being able to attend school. It should also be clear that the effectiveness of the two-shift system, if implemented properly, is no less than that of the ordinary system. Students' parents should not have a skeptical attitude.

2.  The quality of teaching techniques depends on whether they are used properly. If they are not used properly, teachers and students can face each other all day and still gain nothing. The teaching situation of the two-shift system is slightly different from that of ordinary classes. Students' parents should understand that the wonderful use of the two-shift system lies in its ability to guide self-study and extracurricular work. It must not be regarded as laissez-faire, as a waste of time, or to criticize the school for its shortcomings.

3.  After students' parents understand the two points mentioned above, when two-shift system students are at home, parents should pay attention, supervise their self-study, and provide sufficient guidance to supplement the teacher's shortcomings.

The two-shift system was originally implemented to promote compulsory education, and the Ministry of Education has issued an order for its implementation. Over the past decade, its effectiveness has not been great due to the impact of the war. Now that we have returned victorious, the two-shift system can be used to supplement compulsory education, not only to relieve the current situation of children not being able to attend school. Now that it is being promoted, this article is written to seek advice from experts.

### Mao Sen Discusses the Suppression of Bandits in Jiangnan; Bandit Troubles Can Be Completely Eliminated by the End of this Month

[Report from Wuxi by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters in early September, it has been actively carrying out the suppression of remnant bandits in the Jiangnan area, and it is scheduled to be fully completed by the end of this month. General Mao Sen, Chief of Staff of the Command Post, gave a speech to reporters on the eve of National Day, reviewing the current security situation in each suppression zone and joint defense zone, saying that after the establishment of the Command Post at the beginning of last month, the command headquarters of the suppression zone and joint defense zone were successively established, launching a large-scale comprehensive suppression. In the past month, there have been no more bandit gangs in the Chongming and Pudong areas. The bandit gang of Liao Bingnan and others in the Taihu suppression zone has also been officially incorporated. There are still dozens of bandits, such as Xue Yonghui, roaming in the area. The main force of the bandit gang of Li Defu in the Yangcheng Lake suppression zone, more than 200 people, has been defeated. The bandit gangs in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, such as Zhang Ziyi and Xu Daojin, have unknown strength. Since the launch of the suppression, the bandit gangs have adopted a strategy of breaking up into smaller groups and hiding among the people. We are now strengthening the Baoshengjia system and searching for the bandits. The bandit gang of Xue Bin in the Maoshan suppression zone has been wiped out. The Changdanyang area is under siege. In the Xicheng area, only scattered bandits such as Zhao Jianping and Zhang Wenlong remain. Before the Jiangnan area began to be suppressed, there were a total of more than 5,000 bandits roaming in various counties, harassing the local area. Since the suppression, there are now no more than 800 people at most, and it will be possible to complete all of them by the end of this month in accordance with the planned plan. Finally, Mao talked about the suppression work of the past forty days. Generally speaking, the local administrative authorities in Zhejiang Province were able to comply with the orders and implement them. The strict Baoshengjia system and the strengthening of self-defense forces were all completed as scheduled. In Jiangsu Province, some county magistrates were perfunctory and failed to thoroughly implement them, which is a pity. In the future, it is hoped that all sectors of the community can unite from top to bottom and cooperate in the suppression so that the planned plan can be completed as soon as possible.

### Li Defu's Bandit Gang Suffers a Major Defeat; Entire Group Falls into Encirclement

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 11th] On the border of Wutai Island and Jia, a bandit gang of Li Defu, who claimed to be the "New Fourth Army," has been found to be constantly moving around and plundering Yang Zhou and Xiema Bridge, which are located at the junction of Su and Kun. The suppression troops have launched a major sweep, and they have now advanced to the Jinzhuang area of Ducheng, which belongs to Kun. Ma Shigong, the commander of the suppression zone of Yangcheng District, has telegraphed the Qingpu County Security Team to advance to Shangta. It is reported that our army contacted Li's troops near Jinjialou in Kun on the evening of the 9th for two hours. The bandits could not hold out and retreated to Luoxia Pu, Shangming Dian, and Zaze. During the retreat, they set fire to civilian houses in an attempt to divert the close pursuit. The attempt failed. At the moment, the entire bandit gang is encircled by our army, and it is expected to be resolved within days.

[Report from Qingpu by this newspaper] Li Defu, the leader of the guerrilla force that used Dianshan Lake as its base during the occupation, has now degenerated into a bandit gang, calling himself the "New Fourth Army." He robs and harasses in the triangular area of Su, Kun, and Qing. On the 27th of last month, he sneaked into the territory of the 2nd and 8th districts of this county. After being encircled and suppressed, he fled to Kunshan Yang Zhou Jing, where he confiscated all the guns of the town's self-defense team. At about 3:00 a.m. on the 7th, a group of more than 30 men from Li's gang, riding two foot-powered boats, sneaked into the territory of the 8th district of this county, attempting to confiscate the guns of the Baihe Town self-defense team and loot the town. Fortunately, it was detected early. After receiving the report, the county government, County Chief Liu immediately led a team to intercept them. The bandits fled back to the mountains and lakes to hide. They are now being searched and suppressed.

[Report from Kunshan by this newspaper] The bandit Li Defu's gang has actually plundered and kidnapped people in Yangxiang and Xiema Bridge in this county. The other day, County Chief Shen personally led his troops to the countryside to encircle and suppress them, and established close contact with the Qingpu Security Team to intercept them in the Shangta area. At the same time, Liao, the district chief of Chenmu in Wu County, also led his troops to suppress them.

[Another report] Shao Qingeng, the head of Baimi Township in Yangzhou District of this county, was found to be in collusion with bandits. The authorities have executed him on the spot to rectify public sentiment.

### Housing Shortage in Hangzhou Leads to Frequent Disputes

[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper] The housing shortage in Hangzhou is quite serious, and disputes arise from time to time. The Hangzhou Housing Dispute Mediation Committee was organized. Since its establishment in April of this year, until the 9th of this month, the committee has received a total of 275 cases requesting mediation. 235 cases have been scheduled for mediation, of which 55 cases have been successfully mediated, 93 cases have not been successfully mediated, and mediation will continue. 40 cases have been received recently and have not yet been scheduled for mediation.

### Chief of Changshu Police Bureau Sells Guns Without Authorization

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 11th] The Suzhou Provincial District Commissioner's Office recently received a joint accusation from people from all walks of life in Changshu County against Yang Chuntong, the chief of the county police bureau, for corruption and dereliction of duty. The accusation listed seven major crimes, including: (1) extorting bribes from subordinates and shielding subordinates, exercising illegal powers; (2) a police officer in Dongsi City caught gambling and illegally collected fines, and Yang knew about it but did not severely punish him; (3) selling one hundred short guns that had not been pre-paid, etc. The Commissioner's Office has now sent personnel to Yu to investigate thoroughly.

### Chief of Mudu District in Suzhou Accused of Soliciting Bribes and Dereliction of Duty

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper] The First Pacification District Headquarters recently received a secret accusation that Qin Xigui, the chief of the Second District (Mudu) of this county, had committed bad deeds such as soliciting bribes, and telegraphed the Suzhou County Government on the 9th to investigate and report thoroughly. The details are as follows: (1) Li Genlin, a gangster from Xukou Township in the second district of the county, relied on his power during the war to forcibly occupy the farmland of Li Peifu, a villager in the township, and forced him to sign a deed of absolute sale without compensation. After the victory, Li Peifu reported Li Genlin's crime to the Second District Office and demanded the return of the farmland. The defendant, fearing punishment, bribed Yuan Hao, the head of Jiaoshan Township, to settle the matter, ordering Li Genlin to return the occupied farmland to the plaintiff, and not to deal with the rest. After recovering the lost farmland, Li Peifu prepared gifts of local products and presented them to Qin. However, Qin rejected them, saying they were too light, and instructed Li Peifu to repay the cloth store's debt of 150,000 yuan (equivalent to 30 million yuan in puppet currency last September). Li had no choice but to borrow money to repay it. A year later, he was reported. (2) Cao Songping, the head of Hengtang Town in the second district, was accused of being a traitor. District Chief Qin repeatedly received orders from the county magistrate to detain him, but he did not comply with the arrest, so Cao was able to flee. (3) The position of town head of Fengqiao Town in the second district has been vacant for two months. The citizens have repeatedly requested a legal election to produce a replacement, but he has ignored them and finally appointed a private person to take over. The citizens of the town are now jointly submitting a petition to the county to stop the appointment. A reporter from this newspaper talked to County Chief Yuan about the above problems in passing. Yuan said that at this time of clarifying officialdom and establishing a sound grassroots politics, the existence of empty ink officials must not be allowed. Moreover, the relief of rural suffering after the war depends on the integrity of grassroots self-governance personnel. Therefore, he has decided to investigate this case impartially.

### Qianjiang Bridge to Build a Motor Vehicle Lane

[Report from Hangzhou on the 11th by this newspaper] The bidding for the construction of the Qianjiang Bridge's motor vehicle lane has been won by the Shanghai Southeast Construction Company. The Bridge Engineering Office has now commissioned Engineer Yuan Zhigang of the China Bridge Company to come to Hangzhou to preside over the project. He has already surveyed the site and is building a workshop today. However, this time, due to the limitation of funds, only wooden boards will be used, with the aim of opening to traffic in the shortest possible time.

### Hulong Street in Suzhou Renamed Zhongzheng Street to Celebrate Chairman's Birthday

[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper] The County Provisional Assembly held its 23rd Resident Committee Meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th. The meeting was chaired by Speaker Dong Sheng. Three important resolutions were made, which are listed below: (1) Gambling and opium are prevalent in various townships and districts of this county, and the ban is difficult to enforce effectively. Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, the rural economy is showing some recovery. It is urgently necessary to actively eliminate gambling and opium in order to preserve a fraction of the vitality of the rural economy. The County Government should be immediately informed to reiterate the ban and set a deadline for the ban, and to send personnel to supervise at any time. If any are found, the administrative heads at all levels shall be jointly and severally liable. At the same time, all district offices should be notified to work with local party and government agencies to organize the New Life Movement in order to promote thrift and create a good social atmosphere. (2) Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday is approaching. To honor the principle of thrift, all extravagant celebrations will be abolished. However, in order to express respect, it has been decided to rename Hulong Street in this county as Zhongzheng Street, and to present a signed birthday book and a birthday banner to show permanent celebration. (3) The operation of public buses by the Jinshan Company in the urban area does not comply with the regulations of the provincial government. The county should truthfully report this to the Provincial Department of Construction for verification.

### Wuxing Dredges Rivers

[Report from Wuxing by this newspaper] All sectors of Wuxing have organized a water conservancy association to dredge rivers in the urban and rural areas, using work as a form of relief. The heads of various agencies and the directors of groups serve as members. The following resolutions have been made: (1) Dredging the Xiangshi River requires 343,216 catties of noodles. A continued application will be made to increase the allocation. (2) The work-relief materials for dredging the Taichao, Xuanjia, Yangdu, and Zhangpo three ports have been allocated 300 bags of rice (100 pounds per bag). Shen Zhongsheng and Shi Jianmin have been publicly recommended to negotiate for collection and store them in the Beiqian Changhao for issuance. (3) Regarding the implementation of the project, the association will notify the Dredging Port Association to implement it in accordance with the plan. (4) In the case of the Deng Shezhen Zhen Zhang's request to survey and repair the Tang, it is estimated that the two members, Pan Xixia and Yu Lin, will invite Captain Yan of the 12th Engineering Team to conduct a preliminary survey before making a comprehensive plan for construction. (5) The dredging of the urban Xiangshi River will commence on October 16. The noodles that have already been collected will be used to dredge the river selectively, and the City River Office will be notified to actively prepare for the construction. (6) In response to the requests from Hongcheng, Tainan, and Ge Fu three townships to send personnel to survey and repair agricultural water conservancy projects, small-scale water conservancy projects that can be handled by voluntary labor within the possible scope should be handled by the township Bao in the project location. If the project is indeed large and a request is made for relief, it should be handled in accordance with the work-relief implementation measures.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Understands the Difficulties of County-level Governments; Approves Counties to Increase Tax Items Appropriately, but Must Not Violate the Central Government's Tax Laws

[Report from Hangzhou on the 11th by this newspaper] Since the central government promulgated new regulations on the financial revenue and expenditure system, Zhejiang Province has felt increasingly difficult financially. Although Chairman Shen has repeatedly advocated a financial policy of living within its means, revenue and expenditure are still not balanced. The provincial budget deficit is over 9 billion yuan, and local expenses below the county level are even more insufficient. Chen Baolin, the Director of Finance, has repeatedly requested the central government to allow local governments to increase tax revenues tailored to local conditions in order to facilitate the development of local government affairs. At the same time, he went to Beijing today to discuss solutions with the central government. The former has already been approved by today's provincial government meeting. A specific example is the autonomy undertaking donation in Yuhuan County, which targets merchants who purchase and sell the county's specialty fish and seafood, with tax amounts ranging from 2,000 to 12,000 yuan. The fundamental policy is not to violate the central government's tax laws. The results of the consultation with the central government are still awaiting Chen's efforts.

### Hangzhou-Huzhou Liner Robbed by Bandits

[Report from Wuxing by this newspaper] The Datong steamship of the Hangzhou Gongchen Bridge Ningshao Xiangan Company was sailing to Huzhou from the Xiejiacun area on the morning of October 7. Six men in military uniforms, each carrying a rifle, ordered the ship to stop. They fired three shots as a warning. At this time, five bandits, who had been pre-arranged on the ship, also took out pistols and wooden cases. They ordered the captain to stop the ship and prohibited the passengers from making noise. Because the Hangzhou-Huzhou bus service was interrupted, the passengers were extremely crowded. After the bandits on the shore and the ship coordinated, they searched the passengers and robbed them of more than 6 million yuan in cash, as well as gold rings, watches, woolen shirts, and other light items. The total loss was no less than 10 million yuan. A revolver carried by a military officer in uniform was confiscated, but all the paper money on him was returned. At this time, the Hangzhou Zhen steamship passed by and was also intercepted. The amount of the losses was substantial. After the robbery, the bandits told the passengers that they were the Eighth Route Army, passing through this place to borrow some funds. They were quite humble when they spoke. Soon after, they went south. After the ship arrived at Lake Guo, it reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Inland Water Police Bureau, which sent a team to pursue them, hoping to solve the case.

[Report from Hangzhou on the 11th by this newspaper] Zhejiang Province's 35th year grain reserve is set at three liters per mu, levied along with the tax. However, the Provincial Assembly has resolved to postpone the grain reserve, so it still needs to be discussed with the Assembly. As for the method of prepaying the land tax in kind by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Government believes that it is both convenient for the people and can eliminate malpractices, and has decided to comply with it and hand it over to the Department of Finance for the Grain Office to draft implementation measures.

Supplementary Five-Year Ferry Plan

Dear Editor,

Having read the Shanghai Ferry Company's five-year plan, I feel that there are some areas that could be improved. I am writing with two suggestions for the company to consider.

(1) Please add a ferry line from Dadaozhan in Pudong to Gongping Road across the river. There are many male and female workers and vegetable vendors from Pudong Avenue crossing the river to the Hongkou area. Before the war, there were ferry lines from Fenshan Wharf and Xiaonanyang Wharf. Now, both of these lines no longer exist. This important ferry line should be restored as soon as possible to benefit the public.

(2) The company only plans to open a line for trucks to cross the river. This may have limited impact on the prosperity of Pudong's market. It is necessary to plan and build special ferries to transport trucks for unloading goods and buses carrying passengers across the river. In this way, goods in warehouses in Pudong or Puxi can be transported without obstruction as long as they are loaded onto trucks, and passengers can get off at their destination after taking a bus (for example, from Yangjing Town in Pudong to the Great World on Zhongzheng Road, and from the Great World to Zhoupu). This would eliminate the trouble of getting on and off boats and crossing the river on one's own. The prosperity of Pudong's market would be unlimited. (Lu Longlong)

### Substitute Mail

Reply to Small Tenants and a Shanghai Citizen: Regarding the issue of who should bear the housing tax and the increased summer housing tax, we have received a reply from the Municipal Finance Bureau stating: "According to the lease agreement between the housing and the landlord, 'all taxes and levies shall be paid by the tenant and shall not be the responsibility of the landlord.' Before the contract is revised, both parties should be bound by it, but it is not fair in terms of the actual situation. The Bureau has already requested the Municipal Government Council to review this issue. As for the landlord collecting the housing tax when collecting rent, it is inappropriate. The tenant can request the landlord to repay it. If the tax is not returned, they can pursue legal action. The summer housing tax collection standard has been changed to 180 times, and an additional one-time payment for the defense corps uniform fee and epidemic prevention expenses, have all been submitted to and approved by the Provisional Council and the Municipal Council. The Bureau is following orders and has no authority to increase the levy without authorization." We are responding specifically.

Reply to Mr. Someone

Regarding the case of ticket scalping on long-distance buses in Jiangdu, we have received a reply from the Jiangdu County Government stating: "According to the original document, the additional collection of 200 yuan per ticket is because the transportation in this county has been severely damaged. Therefore, with the order from military, party, government, and local figures, a Water and Land Transportation Management Committee was established, and an additional 200 yuan public welfare donation was added to each ticket to cover the cost of improving transportation, etc. There is no overcharge. In addition to forwarding the letter to the committee to thoroughly rectify ticket sales and inspections to prevent the above situation from happening again, we are responding accordingly." On the same day, we also received a reply from the Jiangdu County Water and Land Transportation Management Committee stating: "The prices for tickets from Yangzhou to Liuyi and from Liuyi to Xiannvmiao are all stipulated. Although the routes traveled may vary among different bus companies, the prices are all subject to supervision by our committee," and so on. We are responding together.

Reply to Xu Songsheng & Co.: Regarding your company's request for a refund of the overpaid spring business tax, we have received a reply from the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance stating: "According to the report from the relevant department: When the case occurred, the Bureau's business tax had been transferred under orders. Due to the urgency of time, we did not have time to review it. The original document has been transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau for processing. The Finance Bureau is actively clearing such cases, and whether or not a refund should be issued will soon be determined." We are responding specifically.

### The Fate of the Communist Army's Failure Was Already Sealed Su Bei (Northern Jiangsu) Regeneration Records Farmers Who Were Coerced Have Received Assistance to Return to Farming Financial Management Awaits, Transportation is Being Actively Restored

[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] Since the National Army recovered Suqian and Siyang in the past month, captured Huaian, the Communist Army's base in northern Jiangsu, and cleared the remaining Communist forces near Huaian, the entire situation in northern Jiangsu has completely changed.

After the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu repeatedly suffered losses in Huaiyin and Sisui, they held an important military conference in Huaian, still planning to secure the Grand Canal and control supplies in southern Huai to make a final struggle. Ultimately, the situation was shaken, and it was difficult to secure even a corner, and they still failed.

According to those familiar with the internal situation of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu transferred fifteen regiments of elite troops to southern and western Shandong between July and August to assist Chen Yi's Communist Army in Shandong, threatening Xuzhou and Kaifeng. The strength of the Communist Army along the Grand Canal and Xiangxia River was already insufficient, which is why the situation is as it is today. At the beginning of last month, the National Army cleared the Communist Army in eastern Henan, Kaifeng, and western Shandong, Caozhou, and Jining, gaining control of the Limhai East Road intersection. The connection between the Communist Army in southern Shandong and the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu was cut off. Therefore, since mid-September, the food and cotton that the Communist Army in Shandong relied on from northern Jiangsu could not be obtained, and the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu also experienced extreme panic due to a shortage of weapons and ammunition. The fate of failure was thus sealed.

After the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu suffered successive defeats, the morale of the army was shaken, and they were surrounded by enemies on all sides, presenting a declining trend. In late September, when their high-level command hurriedly retreated to Yancheng and Funing, their external communication was interrupted because the radio personnel changed clothes and fled along the way, and no one was responsible. Therefore, when the National Army entered Baoying County on the afternoon of October 6, the Communist leaders and political workers in the city were still slowly holding a meeting to discuss how to defend Baoying and support the Communist Army in Gaoyou. Unexpectedly, before the meeting was over, the bugle calls of the National Army on the southeast sides of the city could already be faintly heard, and the Communist troops defending the city fled like rats.

The most ridiculous thing is that the Communist political workers, who were known for selling fake medicines, changed into peasant clothes before their troops and quietly fled. It is said that among the Communist soldiers encountered and captured by the National Army outside Baoying, some of the so-called "militia" who were captured cried out to the heavens and earth, shouting injustice, and crying pitifully, saying, "We are not militia, we are all law-abiding people who farm the land. We were deceived and arrested by the Communist Party to be cannon fodder. Now, this group of harmful Communist Party members fled when they heard the sound of the Central Army's artillery this morning." It is said that these good people who were coerced by the Communist Army were immediately released after being questioned by the National Army, and they were given clothes and travel expenses to help them return to their hometowns to farm.

Baoying County Chief Shen Naigeng entered the city with the National Army on the afternoon of the 6th and is now comforting the refugees and rushing to handle the aftermath. There is a severe shortage of food in Baoying City, and there are still scattered bandits in the countryside. The first batch of righteous people returning to their hometowns from Yangzhou and Taizhou arrived in Baoying the day before yesterday, and the second batch of righteous people returning to their hometowns set off from Yangzhou and Taizhou today.

The first National Army to enter Gaoyou was Chen's Brigade of the *** Division. This National Army had undergone rigorous training in the recent February, their uniforms were neat, and their discipline was strict. Soldiers used legal tender to buy goods from merchants, and the shops exchanged goods at the copper coin rate. There was no separation between the army and the people.

The currency system in Gaoyou, Baoying, and Shaobo is very chaotic. Some use silver dollars to discount, some use copper coins to replace value, and some use legal tender to replace "resistance currency" and slightly increase its ratio. The military and civilians are feeling inconvenienced. It is hoped that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications will quickly dispose of the "resistance currency," urgently transport large amounts of small-denomination legal tender to the recovered areas, unify the currency system in northern Jiangsu, and quickly restore postal and remittance services to reduce the suffering of the people. This is the only urgent matter in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu today. It must be done quickly and effectively. The people of northern Jiangsu have suffered enough and cannot be made to feel sad and heartbroken again.

Navigation from Yangzhou to Gaoyou was opened in September, and water transportation from Gaoyou to Baoying was restored yesterday. It is heard that Zhenjiang Fourth Company plans to send ships to test the route to Qingjiangpu (i.e., Huaiyin), and it is expected that transportation between Qingjiangpu and Zhenjiang will be smooth in a week. The highway is currently being planned for repair by the Construction Department.

### Washington Sends Second Note to the Soviet Union The US Insists on its Stance on the Dardanelles The US Has the Right to Participate in Revising the Montreux Convention Turkey Should Still Bear the Sole Responsibility for Defense

[Our newspaper] San Francisco 11th Broadcast: Today, the United States notified the Soviet Union for the second time to stop interfering in the Dardanelles Strait. The new note warned that if the Soviet Union attacks this strategically important waterway or threatens to attack, the United Nations Security Council will be asked to take action. In this polite but firm note, the US State Department fully supported Turkey's opposition to the Soviet Union's request for joint Soviet-Turkish control of the strait. The State Department seemed to want to carefully state its firm stance, so it almost completely repeated every section of the previous note. Official sources said that the new note was approved after President Truman consulted with the Secretary of the Army and Navy. It clearly pointed out that the important interests of the United States not only extend to the Mediterranean but also to the whole world.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith delivered a note from his government to the Soviet government yesterday, explaining the United States' reaction to the Soviet Union's memorandum to Turkey on the 24th of last month. The note reiterated that the United States is a country concerned with the status of the Turkish Straits, and the United States should participate in any revision of the Montreux Convention (i.e., the treaty maintaining Turkey's neutral status in the straits). The US note was also sent to the signatory countries of the treaty, namely Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia (excluding Japan and Bulgaria). The note pointed out that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed at the Potsdam Conference that the status of the straits needed to be adjusted, and the method of adjustment was to revise the Montreux Convention. The conference recognized that all three countries were concerned about the status of the straits and its possible changes. Therefore, the United States could not agree with the Soviet memorandum's statement that the status of the straits was only related to Turkey and the countries bordering the Black Sea. According to the Potsdam Resolution, the negotiations that the Soviet Union and Turkey could hold were only preliminary exchanges of views in preparation for a future meeting of all countries. The United States dared to frankly state in the spirit of friendship: Turkey should still bear the sole responsibility for defending the straits. If the straits are threatened directly or imminently in the future, they can appeal to the United Nations Security Council.

### Peace Conference Discusses Treaty with Bulgaria Four-Fifths of the Seats in the Venue are Vacant Vishinsky Fiercely Criticizes Britain and the United States His Excited Speech Causes Him to Spill a Glass of Water

[Our newspaper] Paris 11th Broadcast: In the plenary session of the Peace Conference this afternoon, a general discussion was held on the treaty with Bulgaria. In the semi-circular representative seats, four-fifths of the seats were vacant. The representatives of Poland, Australia, Canada, and Abyssinia were all absent. The US representative, Caffery, agreed with the various criticisms of Bulgaria adopted by the Balkan Committee, saying that the fixed compensation amount of 125 million yuan was quite reasonable. Soviet representative Vishinsky then spoke. His speech was passionate, his tone trembling, and he waved his hands, accidentally spilling the water in his glass on the interpreter's head, causing a burst of laughter.

Another message: Vishinsky first launched fierce criticism of the positions held by Britain and the United States on Bulgaria, believing that Bulgaria should not be regarded as an Allied warring country, but he praised the democratic new Bulgaria. Regarding the Greek government, he believed that it was politically quite backward and its foreign policy was also questionable. Regarding the first article of the treaty with Bulgaria, which stipulates that territory should be ceded to Greece, Vishinsky strongly opposed it, saying that if Greece submits this proposal to the plenary session of the Peace Conference, it should be rejected because it contains aggressive implications. He also expressed opposition to the Greek compensation clause, saying that it should be handed over to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for resolution.

### US Decides to Help Defend Greece

[Our newspaper] Paris 11th Broadcast: The US representative expressed his opinion at the Peace Conference today, stating that the United States will participate in any United Nations measures to protect Greece to prevent Greece's security from being threatened by aggressor nations.

[Our newspaper] Paris 11th Broadcast: Yugoslavia demanded at the plenary session of the Peace Conference today that US warships leave the eastern Mediterranean and British troops immediately withdraw from Greece.

### Dispute Erupts Between Polish and Greek Representatives

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The plenary session of the Peace Conference began at 9:40 this morning, chaired by Chairman Byrnes, to discuss the treaty with Bulgaria. The entire book is the third treaty discussed at the Peace Conference. At the beginning of the meeting, Poland, a member of the Slavic group, reiterated its request that the narrow strip of land on the Aegean coast of Greece be ceded to Bulgaria. Wei made this request in his speech and protested against the Peace Conference Committee's proposal to dismantle Bulgaria's armed forces on the border with Greece, and Bulgaria's compensation to Greece and South Korea of $62.5 million each, and said: "Poles sympathize with Bulgaria, because we are Slavic countries, but the imagined Slavic group does not exist. Some people do not like this democratic republic, and Bulgaria is one of them. They are prepared to use any means to undermine it, such as overstepping their authority to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries and discriminating against them internationally." Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris immediately replied, urging the Peace Conference to cede a narrow area of the Bulgarian border to Greece to protect the Thrace region from possible aggression, and criticized Western countries for making concessions on border issues, unaware of Greece's war merits. He also said that according to the terms of the treaty, Bulgaria is now stronger than before, after fighting the United Nations for the second time.

### Treaty with Romania Passed by Vote

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Peace Conference today passed the US-British proposal by a vote of fifteen to six, stipulating free navigation on the Danube River, and all the terms of the Romanian treaty were completed. The countries of the Slavic group voted against it.

[United Press, Paris, 10th] During the discussion of the Romanian treaty at the Peace Conference tonight, conflicts arose between the Slavic group and the British and American countries over the issue of free navigation on the Danube River and trade in the Balkans. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov spoke after Bevin, attacking the so-called "money democracy," accusing Britain and the United States of seeking "most-favored-nation" treatment in trade with the former enemy countries in the Balkans, and attempting to implement their "imperialist agenda" in the Balkans.

### Security Council Advances Work British Proposal Includes Five Points Gromyko Speaks at the New York State Chamber of Commerce He Vigorously Defends the Veto Power of the Five Powers

[United Press, New York, 11th] British representative to the United Nations Security Council Cadogan published an article in "Free World" magazine, expressing regret over the various appeals submitted by "the Soviet Union and its allies" to the Security Council. It is said that the major powers accuse each other, which is tantamount to placing the greatest pressure on the walls of this peace organization before they are dry. It is worth noting that none of the eleven representatives of the Security Council has expressed satisfaction with the progress of the General Assembly. Cadogan specifically proposed the following five points to make the work of the Security Council effective: (1) Countries should consult and mediate before the meeting to reach a consensus. (2) The veto power should not be used frequently. (3) Military and economic plans should be completed quickly to support the resolutions of the Security Council. (4) Constructive efforts should be made on matters that the Security Council may carry out. (5) The Security Council should not be used as a propaganda machine.

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Soviet representative to the Security Council Gromyko addressed 500 New York business tycoons at a special meeting of the New York State Chamber of Commerce today, and defended the veto power of the five powers. Gromyko's remarks were an implicit response to those who criticized the veto power of the five powers. He reiterated that the foundation of the United Nations lies in the "unanimity" of the opinions of the five powers. He also warned that any effort to change the veto power of the five powers would make this world organization "weak and incompetent." Gromyko also said at the United Nations today that the Soviet delegation opposes any attempt to amend the UN Charter, and pointed out that the charter provisions are the backbone of the UN organization, and the entire organization is supported by it, so it must be an immutable law. Gromyko expressed optimism about the future of the United Nations, explaining that the fact that the Soviet Union is not only a member of the United Nations but also a founder of the United Nations is enough to explain the reason for optimism. The Soviet Union firmly believes that if member countries establish and strengthen the UN organization, develop international cooperation, and strengthen good-neighborly relations between countries around the world, the United Nations can become a valuable tool for striving for peace.

### Smuts Speaks in the Netherlands He Advocates Organizing a European Union British Prime Minister Banquets Eisenhower to Discuss Important Matters

[Our newspaper] London 11th Broadcast: South African Prime Minister Smuts delivered a speech in the Dutch Parliament today, saying that the European problem must be resolved, otherwise the small countries will become vassals of the great powers one after another. Smuts advocated that Britain lead the establishment of a European Union.

### The Palestine Problem The US Response to British Protest Will Not Be Publicized for the Time Being

Truman Denies Providing Britain with Atomic Bombs

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] President Truman revealed at a press conference today that Prime Minister Attlee had submitted a protest regarding Palestine to him last weekend, and he had replied to it. The President is currently unwilling to publish the content of the protest or state when the reply was sent. The President also told reporters that Britain does not have atomic bombs. This remark was in response to a claim by a US reporter that US planes had carried atomic bombs to a certain place in northern Britain for use in the event of an international emergency.

### Requests for Sentence Reduction for German War Criminals Rejected by the Control Commission The Soviet Union Declares that Papen and Two Others Should Not Be Released France Demands the Trial of Four Guilty Nazi Groups

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 10th] The Allied Control Commission held a meeting yesterday and today to review requests for sentence reduction for German war criminals. The representatives of the four countries present were General Koenig, commander of the French occupation forces, Air Marshal Douglas, commander of the British occupation forces, Lieutenant General McNarny, commander of the US occupation forces, and General Sokolovsky, commander of the Soviet occupation forces, chaired by Koenig. The application for sentence reduction of 16 German war criminals was reviewed one by one, and it was believed that each crime was deserved and there was no possibility of mitigation. Finally, it was decided that all applications would be rejected. Sokolovsky declared at the end of the meeting, "It is my duty to state that my views are the same as those of General Nikitchenko, the Soviet judge of the Nuremberg International Tribunal. I believe that the German war criminals Schacht, Papen, and Frick should not be released but should be convicted. Hess should not be sentenced to life imprisonment but should be sentenced to death. At the same time, the German General Staff of the Hitler government and the various agencies of the German Supreme Command should be convicted. During the International Tribunal's trial, it was proven that Schacht helped Hitler carry out financial and economic aggression during his tenure as Minister of Economy; Frick colluded with the late Minister of Propaganda Goebbels to poison the Germans with Nazi propaganda for many years; and former ambassador Papen was an accomplice, and the evidence was solid. How can these three people be said to be innocent? As for the former Hess, who was Hitler's party representative and the third most important figure in the Nazi regime, he is responsible for all the evils of the Nazis. How can he be treated leniently? The world's sentiment regarding this person's decision and the Soviet representative's reserved attitude prove that the court's judgment against this person was inappropriate." The Control Commission also decided that the sentences of the convicted criminals would be carried out by hanging in Nuremberg on the 16th of this month.

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] France has asked Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to organize an international committee of experts to establish a judicial mechanism to deal with members of the four Nazi organizations that were declared criminal organizations by the Nuremberg Tribunal. The French government said in a note to the three governments that Nazi groups such as the SS have been declared guilty and their leaders have been sentenced, and it is expected that other personnel must also be related to war crimes. It also hopes that the authorities in the four occupied zones of Germany can cooperate in arresting war criminals.

### War Criminal Mourns War Criminal Tojo Has No Such Interest

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] After German war criminals Goering and others were hanged, it was rumored that Japanese war criminal Tojo had sent a telegram expressing sympathy. When asked about this by someone during the break of the Far East Tribunal today, Tojo denied it, saying that he had not yet met any reporters. Past remarks were all made by the defense attorney Kiyose and attributed to himself. Tojo paced back and forth in the lounge today, smoking an American cigarette, as if lost in thought. This lounge was his former office. The former Minister of the Army, who once dominated the world, is now a prisoner. What else is there to say?

### Military Rebellion in Portugal Lisbon Once Fell into Chaos The Government Adopted Emergency Measures to Quickly Quell the Rebellion

[Our newspaper] London 11th Broadcast: Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar issued a communiqué today stating that the rebellion of the 71st Army that occurred yesterday has been resolved by the Portuguese government. The rebels surrendered as soon as they encountered government troops.

[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 11th] A revolutionary movement broke out in the Porto region of northern Portugal yesterday. Prime Minister Salazar was spending his holiday in his hometown of São Comba Dão when he heard the news and immediately rushed back to the capital. The situation in the capital was once very chaotic, and telephone communication between the capital and Porto and between the capital and Spain was cut off. After Prime Minister Salazar returned to the capital, he immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting. A communiqué was issued afterwards explaining the course of events. It stated: A number of reserve officers, all of whom had been dismissed or removed from their posts for violating military discipline, colluded with a certain unit of the 6th Cavalry Regiment in the Porto region to plot wrongdoing. The rebels gathered about 70 people and began to advance south from the barracks. The military authorities were informed and immediately took necessary measures to capture the rebels. The rebels finally surrendered without a fight. It has not yet been ascertained what the goals of these rebels were. The troops stationed in various places responded quickly to the incident and participated in suppressing the riots, which is commendable. The situation in the capital has returned to normal today, but special police teams are still stationed at key traffic routes throughout the city, especially at the intersections leading to the north. The army, navy, and the public are still taking precautions.

[United Press, London, 10th] According to a report from Madrid, telephone communication between Madrid and Lisbon has been interrupted. Those close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here said that even if Portugal does not truly experience civil war, there must be deep-seated unrest among the people. Salazar is old and weak, and even if his achievements are still good, it will be difficult for him to stay in office for long.

### Lifting of Ban on US Aircraft Overflight Over Czechoslovakia and Hungary

[United Press International, Frankfurt, Germany, 10th] The US occupation authorities today suddenly lifted the ban on US aircraft flying over Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but military and civilian aircraft are still prohibited from flying over Romania. Military sources in Washington believe the ban was due to Soviet military exercises or other military operations. A Pan American Airlines plane turned back to London yesterday from the Czech capital. According to its pilot, this was probably due to Soviet military exercises scheduled for the 9th to 14th of this month.

### US Army's New Rocket to Debut Soon; Forrest P. Sherman Discusses New Pacific Policy; Twelfth Test Firing of German V-2 Rocket

[United Press International, Pearl Harbor, 10th] After meetings with President Truman and senior naval officers in Washington, Pacific Fleet Commander Forrest P. Sherman announced here today a new US naval policy for the Pacific, stating that the US Navy should establish strong bases from the Aleutians to Guam. The importance of the Guam outpost is no less than that of the Hawaiian naval base, and it has long been a symbol of US naval power in the Pacific. The US Navy should henceforth concentrate permanent naval facilities, such as warships and naval air bases, in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, and the Mariana Islands. Forrest P. Sherman also said: "The mobility and range of warships and aircraft are very great, so our outposts must extend beyond Pearl Harbor and deep into the Pacific to be effective." He discussed this matter with Chief of Naval Operations Chester Nimitz in Washington, and Nimitz expressed his strong agreement. Forrest P. Sherman declined to announce when construction of the new Aleutian base would begin.

[United Press International, Chicago, 10th] Secretary of the Army Kenneth Royall today declared that the United States may be able to create a rocket within months that has a range far exceeding that of the German V-2 rocket. Royall denied that the United States is fully armed. It is reported that the United States currently has an army of about one million men, most of whom are scattered in occupied territories overseas. In comparison, the Soviet Union has an army of five million men, leaving the United States far behind.

[Central News Agency, White Sands, New Mexico, 10th, via Associated Press] The twelfth firing of the German (V-2) rocket reached an altitude of about 102 miles, two miles lower than the record set on July 30. US Army officials said the rocket's speed today was 3,600 miles per hour.

### Soviets Deliberately Kill Witnesses, Accused by American Lawyer; Soviet View on the Japanese Emperor Unchanged

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] American defense lawyer Blakeney today accused the Soviet Union of deliberately executing important witnesses to prevent them from personally testifying for Japanese war criminals at the Tokyo International Tribunal. Soviet prosecutors had presented the testimony of Rodzaevsky, leader of the anti-Soviet White Russian group, and announced that Rodzaevsky had been interrogated and executed in Moscow.

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 11th] Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the Far East International Tribunal issued a statement today saying that recent news reports had stated that Soviet prosecutors had made statements at the International Tribunal requesting the indictment of the Japanese Emperor. However, after review, the statement did not contain any request to indict the Japanese Emperor, and the news reports were in error.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] Responsible parties here announced today that American intelligence officers obtained a top-secret document of the Japanese Army and Navy at the beginning of the occupation of Japan, detailing the entire plan for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and Singapore. A Soviet prosecutor, Koronsky, will present it to the International Tribunal here after completing his presentation of the case.

### Hu Shih-tse Tells Reporters that Trusteeship Council Will Be Established Soon

[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] Regarding the plan to place all former mandated territories under United Nations trusteeship, UN Under-Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse explained to the press here that Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, consistently advocated justice for small and weak nations, which coincides with the fundamental principles stipulated in the UN Charter. He believes that the UN Trusteeship Council will be established at the next session of the UN General Assembly. The trusteeship system can be realized once the administering countries and their trust territories have established agreements and they have been approved by the UN organization. To date, the United Kingdom has prepared agreements for its African trust territories of Togoland, Cameroon, and Tanganyika, and France has also prepared agreements for its trust territories of Cameroon and Togoland. Belgium and the United States are also preparing agreements for their trust territories of Ruanda-Urundi and New Guinea.

### MacArthur is a Living God, a Reincarnation of the Divine Martial Emperor; Japanese Newspaper Publishes Article to Refute the Myth

[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] As the worship of MacArthur by millions of Japanese people intensifies, the liberal Tokyo newspaper Jiji Shinpo published an editorial today warning the Japanese people not to transfer the supreme respect they once held for the Emperor to MacArthur. MacArthur should not be regarded as a "living god" but only as a representative and symbol of democracy. The book "MacArthur's Biography" has sold 800,000 copies in Japan, making it the best-selling book since Japan's surrender, and its influence may not be entirely positive. The Japanese people believe that everything that has happened to the new Japan, down to every grain of food shipped from overseas, is in MacArthur's hands. The Japanese people frankly admit that without MacArthur, they would have endless worries about the future. Some Japanese people are so moved by reading MacArthur's biography that they inquire whether he is a "living god" or believe he is the reincarnation of Emperor Jimmu, the founding ancestor of Japan. Breaking the Japanese people's two-thousand-year-old hero worship and moving towards democracy must begin psychologically.

### The US Government and People Distrust the Communist Party

— Special Correspondent Chen Yi

[Airmail from this Newspaper's New York Office, September 22nd] What attitude does the United States take towards China's current political and military disputes and economic disorder?

In a democratic country like the United States, public opinion often plays an important role in government policy. Strong leaders like the late President Roosevelt can lead public opinion, but they would never dare to violate it. As for President Truman, he makes his policies based on general trends in public opinion.

Americans have always considered themselves friends of the Chinese people. No country, no nation has received as much sympathy and goodwill from Americans as China. In terms of actual material assistance, the aid China received during the war was only a very small portion of the Lend-Lease program compared to that given to Britain and the Soviet Union. A year after the end of the war, the long-rumored $500 million postwar construction loan to China remains unresolved, although it is still very small in comparison to the US loans of $3.75 billion to Britain and $1.75 billion to France.

The United States is Very Interested in China

However, the United States has always had a very strong interest in China. The dispatch of General Marshall, a major US military and political figure, to China as a mediator, the attention American newspapers and radio stations pay to China's internal strife, and the enthusiasm of participants in debates across the country about the merits of the Kuomintang and the Communist parties all illustrate this point.

However, the situation is not so simple. For Americans, China remains the most difficult foreign country to understand. They feel extremely confused about China's current situation and do not understand the policies of the US government.

One of the prices that must be paid for democratic politics is the existence of groups representing various ideologies. Due to the importance of public opinion, each group must find ways to shift public opinion to its own advantage. The American Communist Party and leftists have always used it to shape a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union and the Communist Party.

Generally speaking, the American people do not like the Communist Party. They tolerate the Communist Party based on their democratic philosophy, believing that everyone has the right to choose their own political ideology. However, due to the Communist Party's constant incitement of strikes at home and the constant diplomatic difficulties encountered with the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, Americans have become increasingly angry. American law already has provisions to prevent the Communist Party from holding positions in the government, and the US Army also refuses to appoint Communist Party members as officers.

However, despite the various restrictions and antipathy towards the Communist Party within the United States, many Americans sympathize with the Chinese Communist Party. This may seem perplexing, but there are reasons for it.

The American Communist Party Actually Speaks Up for the Chinese Communist Party

The American Communist Party and its supporters have conducted a most successful political struggle in favor of the Chinese Communist Party. They promote the efficiency and loyalty of the Chinese Communist regime, call it democratic, and praise its land reform. They have convinced many Americans that the Chinese Communist Party is the only democratic and progressive element in China and has the support of the Chinese people.

On the other hand, this leftist ideological group has also succeeded in undermining the efforts of the Chinese National Government. They accuse our government and leaders of being incompetent, inefficient, corrupt, and undemocratic. They use all kinds of facts and events unfavorable to the Chinese government to consolidate their position. The assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo are attributed to the Kuomintang secret police, and the expansion of the Communist Party's power is attributed to the government's weakness and lack of popular support. They say that if the United States no longer provides support, the collapse of the Chinese National Government is a matter of weeks.

The American people also do not understand the policies their government is pursuing in China. They do not understand why US troops are still stationed in China, and they do not like being drawn into the vortex of China's internal strife. They do not understand why a coalition government cannot be formed, and like their President Truman, they naively believe that a Chinese coalition government will bring peace and unity.

Realistic Americans say that the Chinese government today must demonstrate its strength, work to restore domestic order, and improve the people's economic conditions. China will receive full support from the American people in implementing Sun Yat-sen's Principle of the People's Livelihood and improving the people's lives, because the American people do not want China to become another totalitarian communist state.

### Air Force Transport Plane Crashes During Test Flight; Four American Pilots Killed; Wreckage Found in Baoshan County

[Report from this Newspaper] An Air Force C-46 transport plane crashed on Tuesday, and the wreckage was only found yesterday in Yuepu, west of Baoshan County. All four American pilots were killed.

The plane was piloted by American pilots McCasey, Ken Beck, Rockheed, and White Lee Nan. Because the plane was originally surplus material and slightly damaged, it had been repaired. This flight was a test flight after the repairs were completed. According to witnesses, the plane fell at a very high speed, falling straight down from a high altitude like an arrow, sinking into the ground by more than ten feet, and the engine was buried in the mud. The accident occurred between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM on Tuesday, and the wreckage was only discovered on Wednesday afternoon. The cause of the accident is still unknown. Besides the four pilots, there were no other passengers on board. The bodies will be embalmed at the International Funeral Parlor this morning at 10:00 AM, and the funeral will be presided over by Pastor O'Donnell of Jiangwan Airport.

### Engineering Planning Team; Hou Jiayuan Talks; Shanghai-Chongqing Direct Highway Must Be Actively Built; Super Highway to Be Built Between Nanjing and Shanghai; Expand Original Roadbed Between Chongqing and Wuhan

According to Hou Jiayuan, head of the Engineering Planning Team of the Executive Yuan, the reconstruction of highways is urgently needed during the period when domestic railways and air and water transport have not been universally developed. According to the team's investigation, the Shanghai-Chongqing direct highway must be actively built to facilitate the import of materials from various places into the interior. If it can be completed, the transportation difficulties during the Yangtze River's low-water season can be easily resolved. The original highway between Chongqing and Wuhan has too much damage to bridges along the way. Not only is most of the roadbed broken, but the road surface is also very narrow, and two vehicles cannot pass each other. Therefore, it has been decided to plan for reconstruction, expanding the original roadbed so that four trucks can travel at the same time. The team is currently drafting the engineering plan for this project. The next step is the restoration of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou highways. The Nanjing-Shanghai highway is now planned to be built as a super highway, with the road surface to be paved with asphalt. The Shanghai-Hangzhou highway can barely be used now, and the bridges and road surface must be replaced. As for the highways in the southwest, they can be connected once the Nanjing-Chongqing direct highway is completed. The Nanjing-Hangzhou national highway has also been restored, and the completion of the national highway network is expected soon. It will be connected to seaports, railway stations, and airports, and its transportation capacity can be universally developed.

### Two American Passenger Ships Affected by Strike; Will Not Arrive in Shanghai This Month

[Report from this Newspaper] The American President Lines has three passenger ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month in addition to cargo ships. However, due to the second strike by American sailors, the USS General Meigs and USS Gordon have been affected and have not been able to depart.

According to the company's news yesterday, it is expected to arrive around the 15th. The Java Mail Line's Tjisaroea arrived in Shanghai this afternoon with 220 passengers and is scheduled to dock at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai around the 15th, and more than 200 passenger seats have already been booked. The Jebsen & Co.'s Laurits Swenson, coming from New York, sailed directly to Shanghai via Los Angeles and Panama without passing through San Francisco, so it was not affected by the strike and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 24th of this month.

### Haihang Joins the Shanghai-Taiwan Line

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has recently increased the number of its ships. To strengthen shipping on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, the company will soon allocate the "Haihang" to join the Shanghai-Taiwan line. Before this, there were a total of five ships operating on the line. However, the schedule is uncertain. All ships operating on this line are cargo ships, and passengers are limited to government officials. Ordinary passengers are not carried. The company previously ordered seven new types of cargo ships from Canada. Four have already arrived, and three have not yet arrived. After these ships are all delivered, the Shanghai-Taiwan line may be strengthened again. As for regular scheduled ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, it is feared that they will be difficult to implement in the short term.

Then the prosperity of the city center will be just around the corner. However, due to the rush to install vehicles, the date of opening may be postponed to the beginning of next month.

### Japanese Soldiers Remaining in Shanghai Are So Bold as to Impersonate Our Soldiers and Forcibly Occupy Houses; District Court Concludes Trial and Announces Sentencing on the 18th

[Report from this Newspaper] Hattori Masato, from Tokyo, 24 years old, was drafted to Shanghai in May 1945 and belonged to the Akatsuki unit as a private first class. After the Japanese army surrendered, he was requisitioned by the First Supply Area of our Rear Services Supply Command as a truck driver. He only left in May of this year. To avoid being sent back to his home country, he tried to get a job as a technician at the City Party Headquarters' Dredging Company, but he had no salary or work. During this period, Hattori had wanted to join the Third Front Army, but he was unsuccessful. Hattori has a wife, one son and two daughters. After the victory, his residence at 88 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road, was taken over by the court. Later, Hattori obtained a badge of our army from a Chinese friend surnamed Zhou and impersonated our soldiers, forcibly occupying a house in the concentration area for Japanese residents in Dongxingli. He was subsequently arrested by the police station and sent to the District Procuratorate for prosecution on charges of disturbing public order.

It requested that the municipal authorities be requested to negotiate with the American Shanghai Power Company to make overall plans to evenly distribute all electricity in the city. After sending personnel to the American Power Company and the China Merchants Electrical Company to investigate everything, it was decided that restricting factory electricity use was related to the future of industry. It was then joined by the district offices of the three districts (Yimiao), fourteen districts (Zhabei), and thirty districts (Pudong) in jointly petitioning the municipal government and the Bureau of Public Utilities to provide prompt relief and order the companies to first exempt them from power outages to maintain production.

[Our Newspaper Report] In recent months, the number of overseas ships arriving at this port has been far greater than before the war, while the number of customs field personnel is fewer than before the war. Therefore, anti-smuggling work is particularly arduous. Currently, the main sources of smuggled goods are foreign warships and airplanes, making investigation and seizure particularly difficult. The most common smuggled goods are cigarettes and wool fabrics. Some come directly from abroad, and some from Hong Kong. Customs anti-smuggling work is carried out by customs officers on one hand and based on external tips on the other. In the past two months, the seized smuggled goods have amounted to approximately sixty to seventy million yuan.

### Chen Jiufeng's Face Changed Upon Hearing a Sentence of Two Years and Six Months; His Wife Wept

[Our Newspaper Report] Chen Jiufeng, who once served as the secretary of the "Shanghai Citizens Joint Preparatory Committee" and the general director of the "Shanghai Municipal Baojia Self-Government Preparatory Committee," was sentenced yesterday by the High Court to two years and six months in prison for colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist the country, with two years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property was confiscated, except for a reasonable amount retained for the necessary living expenses of his family. Chen is currently forty years old, from Shangyu, Zhejiang, and a graduate of the Law Department of Great China University. He previously engaged in business in Shanghai. During the previous trial, he claimed that he absolutely did not consider himself guilty of holding the puppet positions he held, and listed many current city councilors and well-known figures in the business community who had also participated in the baojia organization, questioning why he alone was being convicted, expressing his dissatisfaction. Yesterday, upon hearing the sentence, his face suddenly changed. As the bailiffs escorted him away, his wife wept and followed behind, wanting to talk to him. Chen angrily said, "What is there to talk about?" and said he would appeal to the Supreme Court.

### Puppet Police Abduct and Extort; Mud Plasterers Accuse Each Other of Being Traitors

Several other cases were heard on the same day: (1) Gong Zongyi was accused of serving as the captain of the Zhongdui of the puppet Shanghai Pudong Self-Defense Corps and the adjutant of the puppet police brigade, using the power of the enemy and puppet forces to abduct villagers and extort large sums of money, and of persecuting eighteen of our patriotic compatriots. The defendant admitted to holding the puppet positions but claimed that he was "ordered to eliminate traitors." (2) Xue Asi and Wang Jinsheng, two mud plasterers, were accused of working for the enemy army and were suspected of being traitors. The reason for their arrest was that Xue owed Wang 3,900 yuan in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), which he had not repaid for a long time. After the victory, Wang, together with two armed comrades, went to Xue's place to demand payment, but still to no avail. He angrily reported Xue for being suspected of being a traitor. Unexpectedly, after Xue was arrested, he pointed out that Wang was a fellow worker, so Wang was also arrested, and the High Prosecutor's Office jointly prosecuted them. Yesterday, when the presiding judge asked about Xue's property, he replied, "A bed board, a stove, and a chamber pot." (3) Cai Fusheng, who once served as a policeman at the puppet Jiangning Police Branch, had a conflict with Hu Li in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) on March 26 due to evicting vendors setting up stalls on Gordon Road. Later, Hu was charged with assault and sentenced to five months by the then puppet court. After the victory, Hu Li filed another complaint with the High Prosecutor's Office, accusing Cai of abusing his power to illegally extort five yuan from each vendor every day. Cai was then prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. Yesterday, the defendant denied the extortion in court, claiming that it was retaliation. All of the above cases were adjourned for further hearing.

### Shen Shiyuan et al. Indicted

[Another Report] The High Prosecutor's Office indicted Shen Shiyuan, Yu Bailu, Zhu Yuzhen, Wang Wenfeng, and others on suspicion of being traitors. Tan Xingbo, Li Shengbo, Chen Zhilian, and others were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.

### U.S. Military Tribunal Continues Trial of Nazi War Criminals; Former Japanese Reporting Minister Mori Hei Five Times Testifies

Answering 15,000 Questions; All Records Total 200 Pages

The U.S. military tribunal continued the trial of German Nazi war criminals Ockto et al. of 27 people yesterday. Japanese witness and former Reporting Minister Mori Hei continued to be questioned by both sides’ lawyers yesterday. (Note: The U.S. military specially brought Mori Hei from Tokyo to this place for testimony in order to obtain definite evidence). He reported in detail on the work of German-Japanese spies after Germany surrendered. Mori Hei also personally wrote to the U.S. military prosecutor in English, expressing his personal opinions. He stated that he had cooperated before Germany surrendered and provided many reports to the Japanese army.

### Rebuilding Hengfeng Bridge to Facilitate Transportation in the Western Part of Zhabei; Shanxi Road Bridge Will Also Be Repaired

[Our Newspaper Report] The Hengfeng Bridge (i.e., McKenzie Road Bridge) in the city was completely demolished by the enemy during the occupation. Residents in the western part of Zhabei must detour to travel to and from the north and south of the Suzhou Creek, which is extremely inconvenient.

The Bureau of Public Works estimates that the total cost of labor and materials will be approximately 800 million yuan. The Bureau, because of the large scale of the project and whether the city treasury's budget for the second half of the year can be listed, has submitted a request to the previous municipal meeting for a decision.

### Legal Inquiries

(1) Selling Stolen Inheritance

Chen Lei asks: My late father had four sons, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding. In 1934, my father passed away, and the inheritance has not yet been divided. During the war against Japan, Jia took refuge in Yixing, Zhejiang, Yi joined the army, and Ding entered the Fourth Branch of the Central Military Academy in Dushan, Guizhou. As a result, the family was scattered. Unexpectedly, during the war, Jia sold all the inheritance. Bing was unaware of this. After the victory, Yi and Ding returned home successively and learned the whole story. They intend to negotiate with Jia. There are several legal questions to answer.

(1) During the war, is there a basis in current law to recover the sale of real estate at the original price? (2) If four brothers have not divided the property, and one of them sells it, is the contract valid? (3) During Yi and Ding's military service, does the government have legal provisions to protect their property? (4) Is it possible to use the fact that the field mountain properties were still registered under the old owner's name for grain payments in 1942 as a basis for recovery? (5) Since the counterparty to this transaction cannot be found now, can we apply for registration procedures or ask a lawyer to publish a statement of invalidity in the local newspaper?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) No. (2) No. The disposition of jointly owned property requires the consent of all joint owners. If there is no consent from all joint owners and a contract for the sale of property is concluded with others, the contract cannot be considered valid. (3) The government has regulations regarding "Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers Going to War Against the Enemy." You can apply accordingly. (4) It can be used as proof that the property was owned by the old owner before 1942. (5) In addition to applying to the land administration agency and publishing an advertisement stating the previous situation, you should file a lawsuit with the court to confirm the invalidity of the sales contract.

(2) Husband Having an Affair

Lu Guiliang asks: I have been married to my husband for more than a year and have a daughter. After that, he had an affair with a widow, cohabited with her, and had a child each. They live comfortably, while treating my daughter and me like a thorn in their side. I am currently living with my widowed in-laws, but all the expenses for clothing, etc., are earned through my hard work. If I ask him for some pocket money, he will repay me with contempt and abuse. I have heard that your newspaper is a loyal provider of services to the community, so I have legal questions that I would like to ask: (1) My husband has been cohabiting with his mistress for about four years and has had a child each. Last year (1945), the widow and others openly entered the house during my father-in-law's birthday celebration, and all the relatives knew about it. Can this be used as evidence of marriage? (2) If the household registration form is used as a reference, can it be used as written evidence in law? (3) If I file a lawsuit with the court, requesting a divorce, can I claim compensation for damage to my reputation? (4) Where should the children born from the affair be raised? If I adopt them, can I ask for subsidies for living and education expenses? (5) If the divorce is based on a written agreement by relatives, is it legally valid?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) If the open entry into the house and the knowledge of all relatives are true, and there is a proper ceremony for the open marriage, it can only be used as evidence of bigamy in law. (2) It can only be used as evidence of adultery with a person while being married, but this crime cannot be prosecuted if it is condoned or forgiven. (3) Yes. If you request a divorce from the court based on the other party's bigamy or adultery, but this case cannot be sued according to the law, because in the above circumstances, if you agree in advance, or forgive afterwards, or know about it and it has been more than six months, or if more than two years have passed since the facts occurred, you cannot request a divorce from the court. (4) It should be authenticated by the father, and if there is another agreement, follow the agreement. (5) Valid. According to the above, there should be the signatures of two or more witnesses.

Request for Mushroom Seeds

To the respected editor: I have always admired your wide-ranging knowledge and enthusiasm for public service. I would like to inquire about something. European and American agriculturalists are quite advanced in cultivating foreign mushrooms (i.e., Western mushrooms). I have a great understanding of this and would like to engage in cultivation to increase production, but I have no mushroom seeds yet. I heard before that a farm in Shanghai produces foreign mushrooms, but I don't know the location. I dare to ask your newspaper to investigate and see if there are any ready-made mushroom seeds for sale in the Shanghai market? This is respectfully submitted by An Wenren.

(Note) If any readers know of agriculturalists who have mushroom seeds for sale, please send a letter so that we can inform them.

Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, stating that in the past, the soaring prices of grain had been suppressed through the joint efforts of the government and industry associations, while also dredging up sources and replenishing reserves. Since the implementation of these measures, significant results have been achieved. Yarn and cloth are also daily necessities, and the recent rise in yarn and cloth prices has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, he has specially invited everyone to discuss ways to suppress prices, hoping that a proper decision can be made within the principle of considering costs and obtaining legitimate profits. He also stated that the chairman of the Textile Management Committee was originally Mr. Shu Yunzhang, but now that Shu has resigned, he will be taking on the role concurrently. Next, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau reported on the current electricity allocation situation:

Director Zhao

He stated that the city's power plant has a generating capacity of only 130,000 kilowatts, and the allocated amounts are: 42,000 kilowatts for yarn factories, 42,000 kilowatts for factories in the dyeing, weaving, wool weaving, knitting, machinery manufacturing, spinning, rubber, and flour industries, and 40,000 kilowatts for other users. Therefore, the power plant has made its utmost efforts to supply electricity to factories. Based on the estimated kilowatt allocations above, yarn factories can produce 60,000 bales of yarn and 500,000 bolts of cloth per month, and flour mills can produce 600,000 bags of flour.

Shu Yunzhang

Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, said that based on the existing spindles of the Textile Construction Company, 1,300 bales of yarn and 2,000 bolts of cloth can be produced per day, but production is limited by electricity, and currently only 800 bales of yarn are being produced. He requested that electricity consumption by users be reduced as much as possible to increase production and reduce costs. Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for this and instructed Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau to draft and implement a plan to reduce electricity consumption by users. As for factory downtime, electricity can be used in rotation to avoid waste.

Wang Qiyu

Wang Qiyu of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association reported on the details of the joint yarn allocation by private yarn factories in the past month, saying that yarn is allocated to factories that actually sell the yarn first, followed by yarn shops, but only to those with existing business relationships. The origin of the black market for cotton yarn is actually due to strong sales and limited production, resulting in demand exceeding supply. There are currently 2.4 million spindles operating in yarn factories across the country, producing 6,000 bales of yarn per day, which is less than half of the number of spindles before the war. The allocated prices are in accordance with the principle of fair prices. For example, 20-count yarn has gradually decreased from 1.4 million yuan to 1.3 million yuan, and the second adjustment was to 1.55 million yuan, but the black market price has exceeded 2 million yuan. To suppress yarn prices, production must be increased to balance supply and demand. Private yarn factories are working hard on this.

Pan Shihao

Pan Shihao of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry said that there are many reasons for the high market prices of yarn and cloth and the occurrence of the black market. The method of suppressing yarn and cloth prices, as the mayor said, must take into account the costs of manufacturers and the legitimate profits of trading houses, while also increasing production as much as possible to balance supply and demand. However, balancing supply and demand cannot be achieved quickly under the current circumstances, and this point deserves attention. Currently, joint cotton yarn allocation is limited to yarn factories in the urban area, and yarn factories may not feel it is fair. Attention should be paid to the fact that dyeing and weaving, yarn, and cloth businesses have been forced to purchase yarn and cloth from factories, and their assets have been depleted. Furthermore, interest rates are currently high, and they are indeed unable to hoard goods and raise prices. The fact that the cloth opened by Textile Construction Company last Saturday was sold at a reduced price on Monday this week can serve as proof. I also serve as a representative of the Cotton Cloth Industry and know more details. As for the yarn allocation by Textile Construction Company and yarn factories, there are indeed rumors on the outside. If the industry association could be allowed to participate, the abuses could be reduced, but unfortunately, the authorities have not adopted this suggestion earlier.

Zhou Jiasheng

Zhou Jiasheng of the Yarn Business said that since the exchange rate fluctuations, Textile Construction Company has not made any allocations, and private yarn businesses have also rarely received allocations through joint allocation, but the black market for yarn in the market continues to exist, which is deeply puzzling.

Li Daofa

Li Daofa of the Towel Blanket Industry said that Textile Construction Company said it would specifically allocate 16-count yarn to their industry, but the quantity is very small, and he requested a significant increase in the allocation. General Manager Shu of Textile Construction Company explained that because Textile Construction Company has very few machines that can spin 16-count yarn, and most of them spin 16-count coarse yarn, the costs are also higher, so the production is not high, and the allocation is naturally small.

Xu Zhaohou of the Knitting Industry said that yarn is allocated equally to all factories, but the amount is very small. Many factories are currently suspending operations, and products cannot meet demand. He hoped that an appropriate supply would be made according to the production capacity of each factory. Later, General Manager Shu of Textile Construction Company and Mr. Wang Qiyu of the Sixth District provided corrections to the statements made by various industries.

Mayor Wu

Finally, Mayor Wu said that past events can be left unexamined. The current decision is as follows:

(1) Yarn factories should promptly report their production equipment, production quantity, market inventory quantity, and actual sales situation for the previous month in a register.

(2) Cotton product manufacturers should promptly report their production equipment, actual yarn purchases for the previous month, and future needs in a register.

(3) Yarn and cotton cloth businesses should promptly report their sales volume and account names for the previous month, as well as the amount of legitimate profits, in a register.

Regarding electricity for factories, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau said that he has recently requested the Relief Administration to allocate three generators. The power company's original "1,500-pound generator, a 24,000-kilowatt generator tendered by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the power company's generator being repaired in the United States" will solve the electricity problem once they are all shipped to Shanghai.

Minister Wang In view of the repeated surges in cotton cloth prices in this city, which has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods, Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, while in Shanghai the other day, not only instructed Mayor Wu to take definite responsibility for suppressing prices, but also summoned the textile industry magnates Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, and Rong Hongyuan of the private textile industry to earnestly discuss assisting the government in stabilizing cloth prices. When Song left Beijing for Qingdao, he instructed Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu to assist Mayor Wu in stabilizing cloth prices. Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and personally inspected the Textile Construction Company at around 3 p.m. It is said that at 12:30 p.m. today, he will accept Mayor Wu's invitation for lunch at Mayor Wu's residence, and Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, will also participate. Furthermore, Minister Wang will personally attend and preside over the board meeting of the Textile Construction Company at 3 p.m. today.

### Distribution of Rayon; Textile Construction Company Makes Final Distribution Yesterday; Future Responsibility to be Borne by the Central Trust Bureau

[Report from our newspaper] Textile Construction Company, acting as an agent for the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to distribute rayon, made its last distribution last Thursday. However, the rayon market situation was again agitated yesterday. Textile Construction Company, at the request of the Management Bureau, acted as an agent for distribution once more. The distribution price remained the same, but the quantity has increased to more than 500 cases, totaling more than 1,600 bales. It is reported that silk weaving factories have priority. Generally, each factory with two looms can be allocated one case. According to Jiang Dixian, Director of the Business Department of Textile Construction Company, this is the last distribution. Textile Construction Company is too busy with its own business to take care of it. Starting next week, rayon distribution matters will be handled entirely by the Central Trust Bureau.

It is understood that after the Central Trust Bureau shipped more than 4,000 cases of rayon from Japan, it is currently drafting distribution methods. It may distribute twice a week according to the actual needs of each silk weaving factory. Currently, it is handling the registration of silk weaving factories. The Central Trust Bureau will conduct on-site verification based on the registration forms filled out by each factory to determine the reasonable needs of all. As for the rumors that the Central Trust Bureau will exclusively allocate to producers and Textile Construction Company will exclusively allocate to merchants, neither the Central Trust Bureau nor Textile Construction Company could confirm this.

Rayon No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang opened at 4.3 million yuan yesterday morning, which was 200,000 yuan higher than Wednesday. The timing of Textile Construction Company's distribution yesterday caused speculators to blindly drive up the price, with the highest bid reaching 500,000 yuan. It was not until the afternoon that it was learned that the listed price of Textile Construction Company was the same as the previous period, with No. 100 and No. 120 Youguang at 2.8 million yuan, semi-gloss at 2.56 million yuan, and 75 semi-gloss at 2.35 million yuan. As a result, the mood gradually softened, and the final bid was 350,000 yuan, but very few transactions were made. Factory-run transactions were also rare, and the price floor felt solid. The morning was slightly softer, and the prices of various grades of goods were 50,000 to 100,000 yuan higher than on Wednesday. Silk goods were firm, but there were more transactions for quilt covers, and the price was 100,000 yuan higher. HUA brand opened at 3.4 million yuan for the best quality and 3.2 million yuan for the second best in the morning. In the afternoon, rayon prices weakened, and bids were also slightly smaller.

### Bearish Sentiment in the Bond Market

Government bonds were subject to heavy selling in the counter market yesterday, and even with financial buyers absorbing miscellaneous bonds, prices fell across the board. Unified Class C opened at 2,230 yuan, and was immediately surrounded by sellers, falling from 2,250 yuan, approaching the 2,000 yuan mark at one point. It finally hovered around 2,050, down 290 yuan from the close before the holiday. Class A, B, and D each fell 220 yuan, and Unified Class E fell 240 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 5 million yuan.

### Good News for the Common People: Beans, Rice, and Oil All Decline

Xian rice continued to fall sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and medium and low-grade Jing rice also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, high-grade white rice was scarce and remained firm, and Yin rice was firm. Crude oil from Qingdao was connected, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil were balanced between arrival and sales. The factory supply was slightly available, and the market was stable. Northeastern soybeans were still available, and miscellaneous grains from Hankou continued to arrive, but could not be digested outside the port, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Mung beans arrived from all directions. The medium and low grades had no buyers, and sporadic transactions were made for high-grade goods, with prices high and the low grades sluggish. Red sorghum weakened by 300 to 500 yuan, and yellow sorghum fell by another 1,000 yuan at Customs, but raw peanut shops took the opportunity to purchase them. High-grade goods weakened and then rebounded, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, medium-grade goods rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and low-grade goods were sluggish.

### Central Bank Provides as Much as Possible; Gold Price Pressed Down to 70,000 Yuan

Fresh gold continued to weaken, and customer sales were unusually strong. The Central Bank was once again mired in a hard fight. The opening price in the morning was 2.24 million, with buyers from Fujian and Shantou absorbing it constantly. In addition, retail investors were confused by rumors and the buying sentiment was strong. Thereafter, it rose, but there was quite a struggle outside 2.27 million. The high price once reached 2.285 million. After 10:00, the situation fluctuated again. The Central Bank continued to supply gold and allocated 50 taels at a price of 2.27 million. Later, customer sales stagnated, and many longs were worried and actively closed positions. The Central Bank took the opportunity to enter the market and broke through the 2.2 million mark, falling to 2.18 million. The selling sentiment only stabilized after this. At noon, it rebounded to around 2.22 million. In the afternoon, insiders sold urgently, and the spot price fell again. At the same time, it was announced that allocations would continue at a price of 2.15 million, falling to 2.14 million. Over-the-counter trading stabilized slightly, rising to 2.16 million. As a result, it fell 78,000 yuan from the close before the holiday. Jewelry was lowered to 230,000, silver taels were 3,600, and silver dollars rose slightly to 2,040 yuan for sale.

### De-stocking of Old Tea Still Good

English firms have quite a demand for high-grade old tea, especially the 1945 Chen Qimen tea. Although Zhenhe Tea Shop is selling a considerable amount, it is still not enough to allocate. As for other varieties, the transaction volume is not as active as before because the inventory is not sufficient. As for the domestic sales of red-edged tea, the shops and customers in this street are still sluggish, but the Qimen floral fragrance from the local tea factories is selling exceptionally well, and the price has repeatedly hit new highs.

### Applications for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Southern China Commence; Textile Management Committee to Dispatch Personnel to Fujian, Guangdong, Shantou, and Xiamen

[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the announcement of the Provisional Management Regulations for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Southern China and the Detailed Rules for Application and Review by the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the committee began accepting registration applications from yarn and cloth manufacturers yesterday. Yesterday morning, a large number of manufacturers went to collect registration forms, with 97 trading companies and 58 production companies. Afternoon figures were not yet available. According to Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the committee, the committee will strictly review the registration applications of manufacturers and the quantity of fabric each company applies to transport to the south. Even the Unified Construction Company must register and apply without exception. The amount of cotton yarn to be transported south has already been allocated and finalized, so the process is simple and will be reviewed as applications are received. The issue of transporting cotton cloth to the south is more complex and may be reviewed centrally once every half month. During the review, the total amount of 75,000 bolts to be transported south will be used, with reference to the quantity of cloth transported to the four ports of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou in 1936 and 1937, to determine the percentage to be transported to each port. If the quantity of cloth applied for transport to the south is within this percentage, it will be approved as much as possible. If it exceeds the percentage, it will be reduced. The allocation of quantities among manufacturers will be based on their capital and sales volume. Mr. Liu strongly urged weaving factories to register as soon as possible to determine the allocated quantity. It was also reported that the Textile Management Committee will soon dispatch four specialists to be stationed in Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou to supervise the yarn and cloth transported to the south. Each specialist will discuss with the local Chamber of Commerce and relevant trade associations to determine a reasonable price for the yarn and cloth transported to the south. They will also supervise local manufacturers and users to ensure they have the priority right to purchase. After the yarn and cloth transported to the south arrives at its destination, the local consignee must fill out a form detailing the sales of the yarn and cloth transported to the south and submit it to the specialist of the Textile Management Committee for verification to prevent malpractices.

### Foreign Stocks Decline Slightly

Foreign stocks also weakened yesterday, following the general trend, with no new buying activity. Ewo Cotton Mill fell from 10,000 yuan to around 9,200 yuan before stabilizing, finally hovering around 9,600 yuan. The final rates for Ewo Cotton Mill, Union Insurance, and Wheelock all fell by about half a percent compared to before the market closure. Other stocks also experienced slight declines.

### Popular Stocks All Decline; Trading Volume of Chinese Stocks Decreases

Yesterday, major players in Chinese stocks remained inactive, and the enthusiastic retail investors were once again plunged into misery. Prices initially rose but then fell. Credit conditions initially eased, and the market opened higher, but this was short-lived. Prices soon turned from firm to flat, but retail investors still bought on the cheap, leading to a tortuous decline. The market was calm, and after 11:00 am, it became sluggish. However, there was a brief recovery at 11:30 am with some buying from northern interests. Wing On Company briefly rose from within the 800 yuan level to outside it, showing a short period of stability, but buying interest did not last, and it fell back within the level. As a result, the overall trend was downwards, and retail investors panicked. Off-market supply continued to appear, and without support, prices fell to low levels near noon. Compared to before the market closure, Wing On Company, Mayar Silk, Jingfu Weaving, Xinguang Company, Qin Xing Company, and Xin Xin Company each fell by 0.2 to 0.3. Among the less popular stocks, China Silk Corporation alone rose by slightly less than half a percent. Datong and Lian An rose slightly, Rong Feng rose by 0.6, Five Harmony Cement and Jing Lun were flat, and the rest all declined slightly. The total trading volume was 9.19 million shares, and off-market stocks also mostly declined.

### Cotton Yarn Rises by More Than 100,000 Yuan; Allotment Prices Unchanged, Cotton Cloth Shows a Consolidating Trend

[Report from Our Newspaper] The situation for yarn and cloth is firm. Although sales from Guangdong merchants are small, purchases from the Yangtze River region and northern areas continue. Local factories also make small additions from time to time, and prices are rising. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was trading at 3.48 million yuan, and 20-count Double Horse yarn was trading at 2.21 million yuan. Some were buying unweighed yarn, trading at 2.32 million yuan. The former rose by more than 100,000 yuan, and the latter also rose slightly.

The allotment price of yarn by the Unified Construction Company remains the same. The allottees for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn are dyeing and weaving canvas associations, 32-count Blue Phoenix yarn is for knitted handmade underwear, 32-count Silver Moon yarn is for dyeing and weaving underwear, and 42-count Sunlight yarn is for knitting, etc., with a total of 898.5 pieces sold. The allotment price for 20-count yarn remains 1.55 million yuan, and other counts are proportionally increased.

The cloth market remained consolidating yesterday. Prices were initially reported to be firm across the board, with Dragon Head Fine Cloth trading at 90,000 yuan, Five Happiness Blue Phoenix Brand at around 84,000 yuan, 3A Colorful Ball at 87,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge at 95,000 yuan. Later, due to weak trading, prices showed a slight pullback.

### Tax on Raw Materials and Finished Products; Hat Industry Expresses Dissatisfaction

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chamber of Commerce has reported four difficulties presented by the local grass and felt hat industry associations and requested the authorities to exempt the hat industry from commodity tax. A telegram has been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Commodity tax is based on the previous consolidated tax. Traditionally, after one tax is paid, no further taxes are levied. For example, after commodity tax is paid on cotton yarn, the cloth woven from the yarn and the shoes, hats, and clothing made from the cloth are not subject to further commodity tax. Now that commodity tax has been paid on the wool yarn produced by wool spinning mills, the felt hats made from wool raw materials are still subject to double taxation. According to the yarn tax ratio, this is clearly unfair. Since fur and leather are both within the scope of the commodity tax law, there should not be unique and trivial differences in the measures. We request the esteemed Yuan and Ministry to review and exempt the tax."

### Securities Exchange to Add After-Hours Trading, Starting from the 16th

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Securities Exchange has decided to add after-hours trading starting from the 16th of this month.

Clearing will be done at 4:00 pm on the same day, and settlement will be done the next day. The collateral deposit of 30 million yuan for each broker must be paid in full before the 16th, otherwise their participation in trading will be temporarily suspended. It is heard that the Securities Exchange will temporarily allow those who have already paid a cash collateral deposit of 20 million yuan for the public bond market to transfer it.

Regarding the listing of foreign stocks, seven or eight foreign companies went to the Securities Exchange a week ago to collect application forms for listing securities. However, due to the time required for translation, they have not yet been completed and submitted. The second batch of stocks to be listed by foreign companies is currently being reviewed by a specially established committee. The review of the second batch of more than 30 brokers has been completed and is about to be submitted for approval.

### Ministry of Education Requests Additional Reconstruction Funds; Executive Yuan Allocates 10 Billion First, Less Than One-Tenth of the Requested Amount; Plans to Borrow from the Four Joint Banks

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Since the prices of train, ship, and plane tickets have risen sharply, and the prices of various commodities have soared, the original budget for the complete reconstruction of schools and educational institutions in the rear area is insufficient to cover actual expenses. The difference is very large. The directly subordinate schools have repeatedly requested additional budget allocations. After careful review and overall planning, and in accordance with the central government's regulations that local general administrative expenses should not exceed two to four times the original amount, the lowest standard of two times was used to compile the request for an additional 120 billion yuan in education reconstruction funds from the central government (the original reconstruction funds approved by the central government were 60 billion yuan, and this request is for double that amount, totaling 120 billion). This is still under review by the Executive Yuan. Initially, the schools and educational institutions in the rear area were unable to allocate a large number of travel berths due to transportation difficulties. Due to the circumstances, they had to reconstruct as early as possible, enroll students during the summer vacation, and start classes after the summer. Some chartered ships or traveled by land, taking detours. In addition, various ticket prices increased sharply, and travel accommodation expenses increased with commodity prices. Transferring ships at major stations, waiting for trains, and delaying days exceeded the initial ideal cost significantly. In addition to the higher travel expenses, the expenses for school office and teaching, student accommodation equipment, and construction also increased many times over, requiring additional funding to supplement actual expenses. Now, commodity prices are constantly fluctuating, and the later reconstruction travel, school equipment, and construction are carried out, the greater the expenses will be. The adjustments to the salaries of civil servants and teachers are clear evidence of this. The schools that are already undergoing reconstruction or urgently need to reconstruct have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education to allocate additional funds to avoid delays and further impacts from commodity price fluctuations. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly petitioned the central government based on the situation. Recently, it was heard that the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate 10 billion yuan first to meet current urgent needs. The entire request of 120 billion yuan is still under review. The Ministry of Education plans to receive the 10 billion yuan from the central government next week and then comprehensively review the urgent financial needs of each school (to date, the total amount of temporary borrowing requested by the schools due to urgent needs, before the central government approved the 120 billion, has reached 30 billion yuan. The Ministry of Education is overwhelmed with the requests from various schools for borrowing funds and finds it difficult to cope. It can only try to make do with what is available, feeling the pain of too many monks and too little gruel). It will first allocate a portion of the funds to meet the urgent needs of each school. Before the central government decides to temporarily allocate 10 billion yuan, the Ministry of Education had been in contact with the Four Joint Banks for borrowing funds for the schools. The banks agreed to lend 3 billion yuan. The Ministry of Education stated that according to the original request from the schools, the Ministry of Education would provide a guarantee, and the schools would borrow from the Four Banks. The Four Banks suggested that the Ministry of Education borrow directly and repay it when the additional reconstruction funds are allocated. Therefore, the procedures have not yet been finalized. Now, although the central government has allocated 10 billion yuan first, which is less than one-tenth of the requested amount (the requested amount is 120 billion), borrowing is still necessary. However, the borrowing procedures from the Four Banks are more complicated, and the time to cash out is longer.

### New Look of the Shanghai Book Industry; Commercial Press and Others Show Vigorous Atmosphere; Zhengzhong is Relatively Planned and Hopeful

The Shanghai book industry is the hub of the national publishing industry and is closely related to cultural construction. Recently, it has shown a vigorous atmosphere. For example, the position of General Manager of the Commercial Press has been taken over by Zhu Jingnong, Vice Minister of Education. Zhu has resigned from the position of Vice Minister of Education and come to Shanghai to take office, which is bound to bring about a boost.

Personnel Renewal, Optimistic Prospects

Gu Shusen, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, has also resigned from the Ministry and come to Shanghai to take up the position of Deputy General Manager of the Zhonghua Book Company, assisting General Manager Li Shuming in managing everything. The prospects are naturally more optimistic. Chen Heqin, a famous children's educator, has recently been hired by the Children's Book Bureau as the chief editor of the bureau and the chief editor of the "Children's Knowledge" Pictorial and the "Children's Story" Monthly. There will be a new performance of children's books. The World Book Bureau has also been actively promoting its business recently. Li Shihui, the chairman of the bureau, is doing his best to preside over the editing work. During his trip to Peiping, he gave oral introductions to the "World Encyclopedia" published by the bureau from time to time, which was well received by all walks of life. Since Tao Baichuan took over as General Manager of the Datong Book Company, internal reforms have been carried out, and the business has been booming. The future is unlimited.

Far-Sighted and Unique

Since Zhang Xichen left Shanghai and Xia Qiaozun passed away, the Kaiming Bookstore has been managed by General Manager Fan Xiren, maintaining its inherent reputation and publishing famous new and old books. Although there are few personnel changes in the Zhengzhong Book Company, the person in charge, Ye Suzhong, is far-sighted and able to carefully handle the headquarters and branch offices, and the business is developing on average. It is the most planned and hopeful among its peers. The Life Bookstore has formed a new literary center, and General Manager Xu Boxin constantly exerts new strength in this area. The Guangming Bookstore, which is operated exclusively by Wang Zhicheng, has always been famous for its new literature and has recently compiled and printed children's books, creating a unique style.

A Different Army Rises, Adding Color

The Longmen Bookstore, which has always been known for printing Western books, has recently recruited famous university professors to start compiling new English books. The Yongxiang Printing House, which has been dedicated to literary periodicals in recent years, has recently recruited famous writers to strengthen its lineup. Other examples include the China Cultural Service Agency, the Wentong Bookstore, the Independent Publishing House, the Writer's Bookstore, the Victory Publishing House, and the Great China Book Bureau, which have moved from Chongqing to Shanghai since the victory. These are all rising as a different army, adding a lot of color to the book industry.

### First Allocation of Education Loan Funds; Each Student Receives Only 20,000

After the list of students approved for education loans was successively announced by the Municipal Education Loan Fund Committee, there were already 4,383 people. The last batch of lists of service students and martyrs' comrades will also be announced today and tomorrow. It is heard that the service standard this time, in addition to being based on the provisions of the committee's second notice, will also include students who have participated in the National Goods Market service and have performed well. It is estimated that 112 people have been approved for full tuition fees (including 51 children of martyrs' comrades from poor families), and 298 people have been approved for half tuition fees. However, the total income from loan funds this time is far from ideal. As of the end of September, it is estimated to be over 130 million yuan. Over 33% of this will be allocated to the children of anti-Japanese martyrs and comrades and to students who have performed well in service. The remaining amount will be distributed equally among all approved students. Therefore, the first allocation will only be 20,000 yuan per student. In addition, the review work of Aurora University will be the responsibility of the university president and student organizations. According to the service reward measures of the Education Loan Fund Committee, the university may separately receive over 10 million yuan. After the list is transferred from the university to the Education Loan Fund Committee, it will be announced at the same time as the list of Ta Kung Pao sales students.

### Physical Education Representatives from Colleges and Universities in the City to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Various Sports Competitions This Year

The Shanghai College and University Federation, in order to promote inter-school sports competitions, resolved at the fourth representative meeting of various schools last month to establish a standing committee for this year's sports competitions. The committee publicly elected five schools as members: Jiaotong University, Jinan University, St. John's University, Aurora University, and the Municipal Sports College. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 10:00 am today (the 12th) in the East Hall on the 9th floor of the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA to discuss the progress of the competition. At 12:00 pm on the same day, a meeting of physical education representatives from all colleges and universities in the city (37 schools) will be held, followed by a dinner, to discuss the progress of the event and strive for satisfactory results. It is hoped that representatives from all schools will attend on time, and sports reporters from various newspapers are welcome to attend.

### Screening of Students Promoted from Puppet Schools; Jiangsu Province Extends Deadline for Another Month

[Report from Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang] In order to facilitate students promoted from puppet schools in Jiangsu Province to obtain academic records, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education specially formulated screening remedial measures, originally limited to the end of September. The department has now agreed to extend the deadline for another month at the request of students from various schools. All students who have been promoted to colleges and universities can still apply for screening from the department before the end of October in accordance with the original regulations.

### Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Organize a Private School Registration Review Committee

There are more than 800 private primary and secondary schools in this city, with primary schools accounting for 615. Only one-tenth of them have been registered. For the remaining unregistered schools, the Education Bureau ordered them to register last month, but stipulated that the school fund should be 10 million yuan for primary schools, 20 million yuan for junior high schools, and 30 million yuan for senior high schools. This fund is used to expand the school. In fact, most private schools are currently short of funds and have no plan to prepare 10 million yuan. Therefore, they have all requested the Education Bureau to reduce the amount appropriately. The Education Bureau is now organizing a private school registration review committee. Each school can first apply for registration and declare the amount of funds that can be raised. The committee will then base its decision on whether the primary school has not reached six classes or the secondary school has not fully opened each grade, and will also consider the school's performance, history, and other circumstances to determine the amount to be eliminated appropriately.

### Municipal Middle School Friendship Association Advocates Continued Collection of Teacher Respect Money This Term

The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association, regarding the matter of teacher respect money, the board of directors decided to advocate that the collection should continue as originally planned this semester, and seek remedies for the next semester. Regarding the resolution to improve teachers' treatment, it is advocated to request the government to make practical expressions when re-compiling the budget.

### Football League Opening Postponed; Rescheduled to Start on the 26th; Italian Overseas Chinese Team Allowed to Restore Membership; Farewell Match Against Mixed Team on the 20th

The Sports Association Football Committee held its third committee meeting yesterday afternoon at the association's headquarters to discuss association affairs. More than ten committee members attended, with Jiang Xiangqing as chairman and Zhou Jiaqi as recorder. Many important cases were decided on the spot, and the details are recorded below:

(1) To review 52 new member teams initially selected, including the Railway Youyou team, and make a final decision after the staff registration procedures are completed. (2) Since most of the new and old member teams have not submitted the list of players, it is impossible to arrange the groups. All registered teams should be notified through the newspapers to submit the correct list of players and photos (Group B and C teams) by October 17 for review and reference. Those who fail to do so will be regarded as not participating and will not be accommodated. (3) The league has been postponed to start on October 26 due to insufficient preparation. (4) To accept the Italian Overseas Chinese team's request to restore membership. (5) To approve the Italian Overseas Chinese team's request to hold a friendly match to mark the occasion of their departure from Shanghai, and to select the match to be held on October 20. The opposing team will be a Chinese mixed team, and the three committee members Wang Xinheng, E Sen, and Zhou Jiaqi will be responsible for organizing it.

The new members include Railway, Youyou, and other teams. The list is omitted.

### Setback for the Expeditionary Wheel: An Unfavorable Start, Defeated at Renyu

The Luoyang Army Transport Sixth Regiment's expeditionary wheel basketball team has been in Shanghai for several days. Last night at 7:00 PM, they had their first match against the Renyu team at the city gymnasium. The audience was quite enthusiastic and the atmosphere was lively. Unfortunately, due to unfamiliarity with the venue, the expeditionary wheel team had an unfavorable start and was defeated by Renyu with a score of 33 to 37. In the first half, Renyu took the lead with a score of 24 to 17.

Unfamiliarity with the Venue Hinders Combat

Overall, the expeditionary wheel team has excellent physique and strength. Their tactics have certainly been guided. As for an inland team, it is already quite commendable. However, their coordination is still lacking in proficiency and their methods could be improved. Given time, they will surely be impressive. According to the team leader, Wu Zhuoming, who told reporters that this was the team's first time playing indoors under electric lights, and they had never used fan-shaped standard backboards, so their shooting would naturally be affected.

Renyu Takes an Early Lead

The referees were Liu Hesheng and Wu Zibin. The expeditionary wheel team consisted of Wei Lingxiao, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Yu Ruizhang, and Wang Binghuan. Renyu fielded Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, Wu Xinshu, and Sun Guozheng. The expeditionary wheel team showed their strength early on, with Yu Ruizhang scoring three points in a row. Renyu's Shen Pengju scored a point from a free throw. After that, Renyu sailed smoothly, with Wang Huaiting and Shen Pengju scoring repeatedly. After a score of 9 to 4, the expeditionary wheel's Gong Binghuan and Yu Ruizhang each scored a basket, reducing the score to 8 to 9, and then 15 to 11. Renyu's Liang Yongjia replaced Sun Guozheng. The expeditionary wheel team called a timeout, which proved to be a turning point, bringing the score to 17 to 19, only two points behind. However, Renyu scored again, ending the first half with Renyu leading 24 to 17.

Expeditionary Wheel Exceeds for the Second Time

After the break, the armies engaged in battle. The expeditionary wheel's Tu Wenlong scored first, followed by Yu Ruitong's contribution, gaining momentum. Renyu replaced Wang Zhisheng with Chen WeiYuan, but the expeditionary wheel's Tu scored again, putting the expeditionary wheel team ahead 25 to 24. The audience applauded. Renyu's Yao Wenyi scored a free throw, tying the score at 25 each. Tu scored again with a miraculous shot, putting the expeditionary wheel team ahead again, but they failed to maintain their advantage, and Renyu scored ten points in one go. Renyu then led by a large margin of 35 to 27. The expeditionary wheel's Cai, Yu, and Tu each scored a basket, bringing the score closer again, to 33 to 35. Renyu called five timeouts. Shen Pengju hit the target. At this time, Zhang Lingxiao was disqualified for his fifth foul. When Liu Zhengjun came on the field, the expeditionary wheel team missed two certain shots, otherwise they could have tied the score. Before long, the game ended, with a final score of 33 to 37.

### Qunsheng Wins Again Against the Jingzhong Troupe

The Whole Game Was Wonderful, and the Audience Praised Constantly

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 11th] In the second battle of Qunsheng in Beijing on the 11th, they defeated the Central Corps with a score of 55 to 31. The game was held at the Lizhi Society Stadium at 4:30 PM. Qu Honglu and Xu Shaowu served as referees. Qunsheng still fielded the five tiger generals: the two Chens, the two Cais, and A Yang. The Central Corps fought with five veteran generals: Zhang Xiuxian, Xu Quanrui, Bai Juhua, Cao Qingpeng, and Qi Jianhong. Before the game, Secretary-General Zhang of Lizhi Society, on behalf of Huang Renzhen, presented the "Flower of the Nation" banner to Qunsheng and the Beijing teams. Then Deputy Secretary-General Yuan Shouqian of the Central Corps presented a banner, which was accepted by Lin Zhuguang and Chen Jinde on behalf of Qunsheng. After the photo session, Yuan opened the ball. Zhang Xiuxian of the Central Corps took the lead, scoring instantly. Qingpeng then scored. A Yang of Qunsheng committed a foul, and Xiuxian scored another penalty shot, creating a record of 5 to 0 after three minutes of fierce attack. Qunsheng then called a timeout to suppress the enemy's momentum. Soon A Yang and Jinde scored successively, and the performance became more exciting. The first quarter still led with 16 to 10. In the second quarter, the Central Corps slumped, scoring only one shot by Xiu, and one penalty shot by Quanrui. However, Qunsheng was very active, and the applause kept adding points. They also took the lead with 12 to 3, making the score 28 to 13 in the first half. In the third quarter, Qunsheng replaced A Yang and Jin Zhi with Lian Ke, Yu Yi, and Qinghua, and the Central Corps replaced Jianhong with Cheng Chunrong.

In the fourth quarter, Qunsheng replaced Lian Ke with Tianxiang, and Jin Zhi replaced the article, winning again with 14 to 5. In summary, the score was 55 to 31.

### Straight to San Francisco: Aboard the "Meiqi General" Ship on the 10th

— San Francisco Airmail, September 16th, Zhu Haitao

Thinking back to the efforts made in the past two months to go abroad, and thinking of the turbulent life of the past nine years, the War of Resistance delayed my trip abroad by eight years. I feel that today's departure is almost like a long dream. However, fortunately, my ten-year wish has finally come true, and I am counting myself so happily.

### Procedures for Studying in the United States: Passing Eight Barriers and Breaking Through the Encirclement

Speaking of studying abroad, it is truly diverse and full of surprises. Because there was a period when the government's regulations were very strict, and people were not allowed to go out without passing the Ministry of Education's examination. However, the Ministry of Education did not hold examinations for several years. As a result, a group of people close to the water tower each showed their magical powers to cross the sea like immortals. Some followed important figures going abroad as nominal attendants, some requested a special referral from the Chairman, some impersonated the wives of diplomats, and some served as attendants to patients going abroad for treatment. There was a period when anyone invited by foreign countries to lecture could go out, so all the petitioners became internationally renowned scholars for a while. There was a period when newspapers could send foreign correspondents, so those who went abroad were all uncrowned kings of the press. Even today, many students on board still hold passports for business, missionary work, overseas Chinese... some inexplicable purposes. I can tell you: every student on this ship has experienced struggles lasting from several months to several years, passing five passes and slaying six generals, breaking through the encirclement.

According to the current regulations of the Ministry of Education: (referring to the summer of 1946) As long as one graduates from a national or registered school, has worked for five years, and has obtained a scholarship from a foreign university, one can apply for a study abroad certificate. Or, one can obtain a study abroad certificate by passing the study abroad examination. These are two legitimate paths. However, it is not easy to obtain a foreign scholarship, and the study abroad examination is not held frequently. Therefore, various alternative methods arise. The above is only a part of it. Because of these alternative methods, both public and private sectors have increased a lot of trouble. The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education suffers from this every day, and even the Chairman cannot avoid paying attention to it. This is very uneconomical in terms of administrative efficiency. However, in any case, if you really want to study abroad, you must obtain a letter of admission from a foreign university. This is the first hurdle. This hurdle can take up to a year, and as little as a month.

After obtaining the letter of admission, submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval to study abroad. On average, this takes about two to three months. This is the second hurdle.

With the Ministry of Education's approval to study abroad (or the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval to do business), apply for a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You need to submit three photos and a passport fee of 5,005 yuan. You also need a local reliable shop to guarantee the source of income for the person going abroad and guarantee that the person going abroad will not harm national interests. (Those dispatched by the government can be guaranteed by the dispatching agency.) After going through the guarantee procedures, if all goes well, you can expect results in about a week after submitting it to the passport section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The passport is a very exquisite thick booklet with a blue cloth cover, stating the name, age, occupation, etc. The validity period for ordinary study abroad is three years. This is the third hurdle.

At the same time, you have to go to the Central Hospital or obtain a physical examination certificate from the American Consulate (C119 form), and go to the doctor designated by the American side for a physical examination, including X-ray fluoroscopy, etc., to ensure that there is no trachoma, tuberculosis, or other diseases. This examination is quite troublesome and often cannot be completed in one day. If the urine and stool samples are readily available, you can see the results the next day. This is the fourth hurdle. This hurdle also requires a photo to prove that it is you.

Taking advantage of the physical examination time, start getting vaccinated, including one vaccination for smallpox, three injections each for cholera and typhoid fever, and one injection each for epidemic typhus and plague. Fill in each item on the "Vaccination Certificate" from the port quarantine office. This book also looks like a booklet, called the "Yellow Book," and is submitted to the customs quarantine office for inspection along with the physical examination certificate. This is the fifth hurdle, which usually takes two to three weeks.

After obtaining the passport, use the passport to apply for foreign exchange from the foreign exchange department of the Bank of China. You need to fill out two application forms. Ordinary students can only apply for $500 in travel expenses and $900 for half a year's expenses, totaling $1,400, but it is often possible to find ways to apply for more. The application form is transferred by the Bank of China to the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank for approval, which is expected to take about four or five days to complete. In addition to the official price, the exchange also requires a handling fee based on the market price of the day, which is 30 to 50 yuan in legal tender per US dollar. This is the sixth hurdle.

Passport, letter of admission, physical examination certificate (filled out by the doctor, sealed, specifically for the US Consulate), Yellow Book, foreign exchange check or money order in your name (the amount varies depending on the nature of the trip; $1,400 is enough for study abroad), and the shipping company's ship reservation, once these are all complete, you can go to the American Consulate at 408 Fuzhou Road, Construction Building, Shanghai to request a visa. This is also a major hurdle. Every day, the house is crowded with countless Chinese and foreigners. After registering, wait for a letter to schedule a time to meet with a Chinese man, Mr. Peter Loh, and then you are likely to be successful. Mr. Loh is a man with a serious face and is extremely busy. He will check all the documents and ask you many questions, from birth to the present, and from the present to the future. It is best to tell the truth, even if you are a young lady, there is no need to hide your age. He will take out a large pile of forms and type your words one by one. He will have an employee hold your left and right hands and print thirty or forty fingerprints and handprints one by one. The one that is printed the most is the right index finger, because it is the one that is most likely to commit a crime. After everything is filled out, you have to sign more than a dozen words to acknowledge responsibility. Pay four photos and ten US dollars (note that it must be US dollars, not legal tender. Fortunately, there are many black market stalls selling change near Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, and you can easily buy ten dollars, but be careful not to buy fakes). Then take this pile of forms into the inner room to see a female vice consul. She will ask you, are all the things filled in on these forms true? If it is true, please raise your right hand. When you raise your right hand, you have taken an oath, and she will sign your documents, and you take them out to see Mr. Loh again. He will pick out what you need to bring and tell you to go back, and then this hurdle is over. This hurdle can be passed very quickly, or it may never be passed. This is the seventh hurdle.

The last hurdle, but not necessarily the simplest one, is buying tickets from the shipping company. Usually it is at the Grand Line Company (The Preiat Line) near the Bund on Guangdong Road. Due to the crowded ship positions during the war, it is best to book the ship position a few months in advance, regardless of how the other hurdles are progressing. By the time you have passed each hurdle, this hurdle will have almost arrived. Otherwise, it is not worth waiting for two or three months just for the ticket. This is the eighth hurdle.

The shipping company has detailed regulations regarding everything on board, so there is no need to mention them in detail here. However, a few points are worth noting: (1) Before boarding, it is best to buy a foldable canvas deck chair, because the ships equipped during the war do not provide chairs, and it is much more comfortable to have this chair. (2) Bring enough clothes, because it is quite cold on the northern route. (3) Guard against thieves, because if you lose your passport, all previous efforts will be wasted.

### The Shipboard Talent Is Extremely Flourishing For a Time

The "General M. C. Meigs" (S.S. General M.C. Meigs) weighs 22,000 tons, is 622 feet long, has a draft of 30 feet, and six decks. It was launched on March 12, 1944. The ship is operated by the American Dollar Steamship Company. It was originally a wartime transport ship. The new ship had its cannons removed, but the internal structure has not been greatly changed. There are two types of cabins: one is called Officer's Cabin, each room accommodating from six to twenty-four people. The other is called Emergency Closs, each room accommodating from one to two hundred people. Officer's cabins have two or three-tier beds, with tables and chairs, a lounge, a large dining room, and a private deck. Emergency cabins have no tables or chairs, with beds stacked four tiers high, each tier about a foot apart. One can lie down sideways but cannot sit up. It was originally used for transporting soldiers during the war. All utensils on the ship are stamped with "Property of the U.S. Government," and some are carved or woven with the letters U.S.A. (United States Navy). On the day of boarding, a notice is posted: all items on the ship are the property of the U.S. government, and anyone who steals will be fined up to 10,000 yuan or imprisoned for up to one year. Officers eat in two shifts; emergency cabin passengers line up and wait their turn to enter the dining hall. The hall has several large pots. The queue proceeds in order, and each person takes a knife, fork, spoon, and alloy plate. The plate is divided into six sections, and one dish is placed in each section after passing a pot. The dishes are generally the same for each meal, mostly oatmeal porridge or tapioca porridge, eggs, bread, desserts, and coffee for breakfast. Lunch and dinner are beef, potatoes, rice or noodles, beans, bread, cabbage, pumpkin, fruit, desserts, and coffee. After quickly finishing the meal, one takes the plate to another place and throws the uneaten and leftover food into the trash can. The plate, knife, fork, spoon, and cup are returned to the staff inside the counter. Withdrawing, the meal is over. For drinking, there are six large buckets in the dining hall filled with hot water, but most people drink cold water from the fountains in each cabin.

Inside the "Emergency Cabin," each bed has a thick mattress, white sheets, pillowcases, and large towels, all of which are very clean. They are changed once or twice a week. Next to the cabin is the washroom, which also serves as a shower room. The room has salt water and unfiltered fresh water for washing. One must also wash one's own clothes. The adjacent room is the toilet, with an unlimited supply of toilet paper.

The ship provides free matches, stationery, and envelopes. There is also a retail store selling chocolate, biscuits, peanuts, cigarettes, face powder... and so on. The entire ship is kept clean, except for the cabins, which are dirtier and more cluttered due to too many passengers. On the ship, I only found one fly and never saw lice, mosquitoes, fleas, or bedbugs. It is said that someone found a rat, but it could not be confirmed. Large iron buckets are placed throughout the ship, and waste paper and fruit peels are placed inside and thrown into the sea on time.

It is said that since a passenger ship sailed on July 4th, the "General M. C. Meigs" is the first to sail to the United States, and after this ship sailed, there was no ship again until October 12th. (Note: that is Marine Lynx, I saw this ship docked in San Francisco yesterday, frozen by the American sailors' strike. If so, then there must have been a ship on October 12th). So all the students rushing to school tried their best to catch this ship. Coupled with the inspection members sent by the government and the well-known professors invited by the United States, the people on this ship were extremely flourishing for a time. Therefore, some people say that there has never been a ship in history that has carried so many Chinese people to San Francisco. This may be an exaggeration.

Dai Ailian Performs Dance, Her Whole Body Shows Rhythm The ship left Shanghai's Gonghexing Wharf at 4 PM on September 3rd, 1946. Although the wartime was difficult, and there were no colorful streamers connecting the ship and the shore, thousands of people on the shore braved the hot sun, waving handkerchiefs, fans, and straw hats. Their enthusiasm was very palpable. Especially because there were a large number of Jewish refugees on board, hundreds of Jewish compatriots lined up on the pier, singing songs, and walking forward with the ship, until they reached the end of the pier, still waving their scarves and throwing their hats. Until the figures became small and the singing gradually faded, the eyes of the people on the ship were red, and several ladies could not help crying out loud. This made me, who is used to going out, can't help but smile secretly, but I can't help but sympathize.

After the ship sailed for two days, it passed Japan and gradually headed north. The wind and waves gradually increased, and the weather gradually became colder. The number of people on the deck also decreased. By the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were only a few people left. This situation changed in the days near San Francisco, because the voyage turned south, the weather was better, and it became lively again. It was so lively that even folk dances were performed. Dai Aiyun demonstrated a dance with rhythm throughout her body.

Originally, this ship was sailing directly from Shanghai to San Francisco, without stopping at even a small island along the way. People were bored enough for more than ten consecutive days without landing. I, ashamed, besides lying in bed sleeping all day and all night, often went to the deck to watch the sea when I got up.

General Feng's Heroic Demeanor Is As Before, Talking! "Altruism"

Many people bought photos of the "General M. C. Meigs" and asked others to sign them, probably cherishing the abundance of talent on this ship. Of course, when mentioning people, we cannot fail to mention General Feng Yuxiang, who recently retired and was sent abroad to inspect water conservancy, preparing to harness the Yellow River for China. General Feng's tall stature and loud voice are familiar to everyone. Now, at the age of sixty-plus, he inevitably has white hair. Sometimes he also gets seasick. Occasionally, he can be seen wrapped in a heavy coat and lying on a deck chair, with his wife sitting beside him, seeming a little old. But at other times, he can be seen striding vigorously on the deck in the cold wind, his heroic demeanor as before. At the founding meeting of the Chinese Friendship Association, he loudly said: "Many old friends asked me, when we arrive in a foreign country, how should we answer when people ask about our domestic affairs? I said: The biggest thing in China is resisting Japan. Now that such a big problem has been solved, what other problems cannot be solved? The War of Resistance is the credit of the people of the whole country, but the leadership of Chairman Chiang and the Kuomintang is also an iron fact. A dragon cannot move without a head. The contributions of Chairman Chiang and the Kuomintang cannot be denied. Naturally, we cannot be satisfied with the current situation. Many people say: How can there be so much corruption? But how can we say that everyone in a government, from top to bottom, is good? Chairman Chiang sent people to take over, but he didn't say: You can take whatever you think is good! We read the newspapers every day, and there are officials who are shot. China is so big, and the population is so large. It is because there are too many problems."

General Feng told me: His inspection period will be more than a year. He will not only see the United States but also Europe. He is currently writing inspection diaries for the Ta Kung Pao and the Peace Daily, so he and the reporter are in the same profession.

Regarding the opinions on water conservancy, Mr. Zhang Yuanxi, a water conservancy expert who accompanied him, advocates that after he returns, he should not do large projects that take ten or twenty years (like Y.V.A.). He can first do a small-scale water conservancy project that can be completed in two or three years, using a small amount of power to promote a small amount of industry, and using a small amount of industry to cultivate a larger water conservancy project, and then to promote a larger amount of industry. Proceeding step by step can be practical and effective. Otherwise, being fond of grandiose achievements will lead to nothing. I think General Feng, who is committed to practice, will agree with this opinion. At least, Mrs. Feng has already agreed.

Old Professor with Flowing Beard Goes Abroad to Lecture and Seek Information

Another Mr. Feng is Professor Feng Youlan, a great contemporary philosopher. In plain clothes, sandwiched in the student crowd, sleeping in "sandwiched bread beds," eating "standing in line for food," except for a cluster of fluttering beards, there is nothing different from us. He told me that he was invited by the University of Pennsylvania to lecture for a period of one year. He hopes to find some Chinese philosophy materials in the United States that China does not have.

Mr. Hua Luogeng is unfortunately a cripple, but his achievements in mathematics have already made him famous all over the world. This time, the United States was famous and hired him, so he went to the United States on the same ship as us after his trip to the Soviet Union, not hesitating to work hard. Mr. Feng Youlan wished him to have his leg cured in the United States. It is said that it is possible, and we also wish him the same.

Mr. Li Dongfang modestly calls himself a storyteller. He said that his purpose is to realize the task of popularizing history. He often chats with foreigners and explains China's weaknesses to foreigners. He believes that the current Kuomintang is suffering for the government that does not implement the Kuomintang's resolutions, so he advocates convening the National Assembly as soon as possible to return power to the people. When talking about the factional divisions in the Chinese history circle, he was very happy to talk about the achievements of the Chinese Historical Society. He advocated eliminating factions and working together.

Mr. Zhu Maozheng is a Sichuanese who is very good at rhetoric. He is good at both Chinese and English. He is now doing his best to promote the "World Citizen Movement," trying to eliminate the occurrence of the Third World War. This trip is his eighth around the world.

There are too many other well-known people to introduce one by one, and among them, the unknown next generation also has unlimited prospects.

### Bian Zheng Line News from Kaifeng on the 2nd

On the Longhai Railway, if you want to be a passenger, you really need to have good patience. First of all, it is not easy to find out if there is a train. The trains on the Longhai Railway are "fishing for three days and drying nets for five days." There are news about the Longhai Railway in the newspaper every day, either there is no coal or there is a breakdown. If you want to take the train, you must first inquire about the news. It is not easy to hear real news. The people in the office, inquiry office, and station do not look good, and their voices are not pleasant, and they are very impatient. Even if there is a train, it is even more difficult for you to buy a ticket and get on the train. I admire your ability and luck very much. But, all in all, it's always better to have money.

The Longhai Railway is crying about coal every day, as if it can push away all responsibility. However, the most basic condition for a railway is to "have trains." What has the Longhai Railway achieved since it was fully taken over? Express trains, slow trains, mixed trains, it's always the same train. It's considered good if there are military trains. A person who loves the railway to the point of sacrificing his life told me that when the Eighth Bridge was bombed, he cried! He said that the Eighth Bridge would never be repaired as well as it used to be, and in the current situation, this bridge would not be repaired! Moreover, even if the wooden bridge is repaired, it will soon be damaged. In the rainy season, the Longhai Railway will be fragmented and get worse and worse, until it is no longer "through"! These words have all come true.

Fishing for Three Days and Drying Nets for Five Days Such is the Longhai Railway

### Old Cow and Broken Car Can Only Crawl, Can't Go Fast

On the Longhai Railway, many passengers have already sacrificed their lives for it, which is inevitable. This time, at Jiaokou, four to five hundred travelers gave their lives as gifts again. Who can say that there are no geniuses and no cadres needed by the country among those who sacrificed here? A division commander's whole family died. He should have died for the country, but he died for the Longhai Railway! The Jiaokou tragedy only made the powerful railway police rich, and the coffin shops in the east and west of Jiaokou also became rich. Four to five hundred lives are now buried in the ground. The person in charge of the railway bureau said in the newspaper that he would ask the central government for punishment. Even the most incompetent child can calculate this account. How can one life be worth four to five hundred lives? Let us look at the result of this tragedy calmly! The government has come with the greatest determination to rectify discipline and benefit the people, and I don't think it will let this matter go lightly. It will not let the dead be wronged in the ground of Jiaokou!

From Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, there are only one hundred and forty miles. Do you know how many hours the Longhai Railway train takes? Twelve hours! The train does not go very fast. It "crawls." If you drop something under the train, you can jump down to pick it up and then climb back up without hurrying. The soldiers are all in airtight iron-skinned cars and boxcars. The ticket inspectors jump off the train and run to another train, and that's how they work safely.

The Longhai Railway has reached the point where it must be rectified! This train crawls like an ox cart. The "car" is a broken car, and the "ox" is an "old cow." This is the most accurate depiction of the Longhai Railway. How can a "broken car" be good? How can an "old cow" pull fast?

Spring and Autumn

### National Art and National Spirit

— Xu Shiqi

The origins of the cultures of various countries in the world can be divided into two major systems. In the East, it originated from China and India, influenced Korea and Japan, and spread throughout the Asian continent. Western culture originated from Egypt and Greece, flowed into the Italian Peninsula, and influenced the whole of Europe and the United States. Due to differences in time, space, and natural environment, the national arts formed have their own special spirit and contributions.

A beautiful autumn begonia leaf has floated up and down in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea since ancient times. The middle pole of the petiole constitutes the Shandong Peninsula. The veins are divided into the three major basins of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River. The Altai Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, and the Himalayas are its natural edges and barriers in the southwest and north. The climate combines the errors of temperate, tropical, and frigid zones. The humanistic qualities are fortitude and strength, and sincere and peaceful demeanor. It is a pity that this beautiful autumn begonia leaf has been favored by our neighbor Miss Fusang for a century. She considers it to be a fertile mulberry leaf. She colludes with invading partners to implement piecemeal annexation, spitting out a large pile of messy silk of "repaying grievances with kindness." At the same time, she forgets that the owner of this leaf has given her immense cultural grace and magnificent artistic contributions. The times are constantly advancing. Now, the autumn begonia leaf is not a mulberry leaf after all, but the neighbor who made a cocoon for herself has become a pitiful worm!

The inherent art of the Chinese nation has its own transcendent and independent spirit. The bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the palace artifacts and stone carvings of the Han dynasty, the murals and sculptures, poems, music, and dances of the Tang and Five Dynasties, the realistic flower-and-bird paintings of the Song people, as well as landscapes and figures, are exquisite and magnificent. There is also a unique abstract art that transcends realization, which is not found in any other country in the world, and is a unique national art of China: calligraphy. The script can represent the changes of the times and the revelation of the writer's thoughts and personality. It is truly the treasure of the oriental art garden.

The azure sky of the East sets off the towering snow peaks of the Himalayas, making people feel infinite about this ancient country in the southern end of Asia with a 4,000-year cultural history. As early as the time of King Ling of Zhou, Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Kapilavastu in northern India. With his superhuman wisdom and thought, and his compassionate heart, he created doctrines that influenced the broad, peaceful, and lofty philosophical thoughts of the entire Eastern nation. Therefore, solemn and magnificent architecture, sculptures, and paintings were produced in art. The grandeur of the temples has the structure of modern three-dimensional architecture. The composition and colors of the murals are simple and unadorned, containing the meaning of primitive art, and have a brand-new modern form. During the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties of China, the exotic flowers and plants of Indian art that were imported opened up the southeast, northwest, and north of an autumn begonia leaf. The Datong Yungang, Luoyang Longmen, and Gansu Dunhuang remain great wonders of Buddhist art that are immortal.

What is the oldest building left to date in human history? I'm afraid it is the Egyptian Pyramid. This ancient civilization, which was 4,000 years before the era, is bordered by the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, it has broken the Cape of Good Hope route in the Middle Ages and has become the throat of European and Asian transportation. The Nile River basin is to the east, and the Libyan Desert is to the west. The land is in the tropics, and all things are fertile. Natural phenomena are deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary people. Because of the belief in polytheism and the idea that natural life exists forever, the expressions in art are used to decorate tombs and temples. Egyptians regard their homes as inns, and tombs as the permanent resting place for their souls. In addition to the pyramids, the great buildings also include the Sphinx, whose meaning cannot be speculated. It is believed to be the statue of the sun god, because the sun and the universe are eternal.

The splendid flowers of ancient European culture flourished in Egypt on the banks of the Nile and in Babylon, which rose in Mesopotamia. The Greek nation, endowed with artistic talent, inherited its heritage and carried it forward. In the history of art, it established a tendency to naturalism and gave full play to the spirit of realism. This point is very different from Egypt's symbolic religion, flaunting of imperial power, and inherited style. Greece is located on a peninsula, facing Egypt across the sea. It already had culture in the Bronze Age. The nation admired nature, loved sports, and was very interested in the concept of human beauty. The Olympia Games were the first sports meet promoted by the Greeks. They took the mood of appreciating the beauty of the human body and created it on the path of art, making Greek culture reach the realm of perfection. The surviving masterpieces of statues, such as "Doryphorous" and "Discobolus," broke the Egyptian rigid frontal style, fully demonstrated free posture, and became the pioneer of the art world of the entire European continent.

Chinese artists worship nature, praise nature, and depict nature. They can go deep into the core of nature, express its sublime magnificence, and depict layers of overlapping mountains. Therefore, painters take the depiction of landscapes as their only object, and extend to insects, fish, birds, and beasts. The poet's indifferent feelings of "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains," is why Tao Yuanming loves "the chrysanthemum that still has frost-resistant branches." Why does Lin Hejing love plum blossoms? Because it can contain fragrance in the severe winter and lead the spring. Why does Zhou Dunyi love lotus flowers? Because it emerges from the mud without being stained, peeping into the virtues of a gentleman. In my personal studio, I often like to hang a small couplet written by Si Zizhen: "Listening to ancient music when washing water, admiring great sages when encountering towering mountains." I get infinite life hints and spiritual comfort between my daily ups and downs.

Indians are worshippers of religion, love all things, and take compassion as a precept, rejecting worldly desires and entering the world of great harmony and bliss as the highest ideal of life. The expression in his art is spotless, quiet, and solemn. I thought of a poem by Zhu Xi: "A half-acre square pond opens like a mirror, the light of the sky and the shadows of the clouds linger together; ask how it can be so clear, because there is a source of living water." The so-called source of living water is the state of mind of Indian philosophers, otherwise how could it produce great modern poets such as Tagore, philosophers such as Gandhi, and Nietzsche's philosophical thoughts, which formed a strong contrast.

One

I gallop wildly on a steed,
Rushing from an unknown sphere,
Towards another yet unseen;
I cry hoarsely: stop indeed!

Stop! I see meteors streak the sky,
Their brilliant gleam's front and rear,
Boundless darkness; I see clear
Emperors entombed, in silence lie.

Stop! Who neglects the reins they hold,
Letting them run so wild and free?
Watching the plunge, a precipice steep,
Does slumber's tale yet unfold?

Hoarse cries lost in a lengthening breeze;
I still hear hooves' pounding decrees.

Two

Ask why flowers bloom, then wither away?
Ask why spring comes, then soon takes its leave?
Ask why indulgence, drunk then sober again?
Asking these questions, hard to retrieve.

Yet much or little, I know not where
To ask; who holds wisdom to impart?
Or in some erudite book deep and vast:
Is a full answer recorded with care?

Now I understand: answers are plenty;
Just before I was foolish, with fate
Imposing comprehension where none may rest,
Forcing impossibilities, headstrong, bent.

Thus I wasted time, without effect;
Far from life's alternating elect.

### Nietzsche Was a Doctor

— Hua Lin

Compared to Tolstoy, Nietzsche came from a poor background and suffered from the cold mockery of society. He discovered the heartless and harsh nature of life and pitied himself with compassion. Tolstoy's situation was the opposite; he was born into nobility, indulged in unrestrained behavior, discovered his own misconduct, and punished himself with cruelty, while showing compassion and pity for others!

A similar analogy can be drawn between Nietzsche and a close friend. When we care for a sick family member, we fully express compassionate sympathy and receive comforting consideration from relatives. However, the doctor who treats the illness maintains a stern and calm demeanor, performing surgery without regard for the patient's pain. He wants the patient to be strong, to heal the illness, and does not speak of emotions!

A close friend's thinking is based on normal social life, while Nietzsche's is about treating the pain of life. He said that before the greatest pain, one can experience the highest new hope!

Life is like an ancient pine on a mountaintop, its branches growing upward, reaching for sunlight; but its roots must delve deep into the soil, into the crevices of rocks, even into the abyss of darkness. The wise philosopher plays his solitude, savors his pain, leaves his crowd, abandons his morality: first, he is a camel carrying a heavy load in the desert; then, he becomes a lion in the wilderness; and finally, he becomes an innocent and forgetful child, constantly creating his new life, cycling endlessly, what is called the "eternal recurrence"!

This coronation of laughter is a crown of roses. Such laughter is also sacred. Great figures should always learn to laugh! Laugh! Dance! Use the wings of laughing dance to fly over your own world! Nietzsche moved from pessimistic philosophy to the path of happiness, affirming everything and striving forward actively!

In this cruel and heartless society, crying out is useless and receives no sympathy. Nietzsche, both in life and after death, suffered the cold mockery of society. Therefore, I believe that Nietzsche, Tolstoy, and a close friend, these three creators, have made very great contributions to life. Nietzsche is simply a doctor who treats the illness, not a relative who comforts the patient! We, as scholars, should observe them separately and take the best from each!

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 60

— Ye Jingfeng

A fellow comrade stepped forward to explain our identities. The sentry at the guard post called the temporary action headquarters in the city and, upon receiving permission, allowed us to pass. However, the road was broken, and the car could not pass. We had to leave the car outside the blockade, entrusting it to the sentry, and proceed on foot.

It was dark all around, even the streetlights were off, perhaps for defense against unexpected attacks. Fortunately, there was only one main road, so even though we were exploring step by step, it was not difficult. After walking less than a hundred meters, we suddenly saw a beam of yellow light approaching us, it was a car heading in our direction. We hurriedly moved to the side of the road, but the car screeched to a halt beside us. This was thanks to Mr. W's thoroughness. He had already received news of our departure. He had received the phone call from the sentry and rushed to meet us.

(As I record this, I can't help but suspect that some people will say these records of mine are a novel because there are indeed many "coincidences" in it. I am too lazy to argue about this. Just take our twenty-four-hour day, isn't there also a lot of "coincidence" in it? For example, you dress up neatly, ready to visit a friend, and that friend happens to come to your house at that time. If this were written in a book, wouldn't people suspect that the author was playing tricks, turning it into "no coincidence, no story"?)

Before we arrived at the temporary action headquarters, under the dim streetlights, we only saw one thing that filled my heart with a mixture of sadness and emotion: along both sides of the road, the shops were all hung with the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. Although some were old, the fold lines from years of storage were deeply pressed in, and some were not properly stored, and the colors were faded, yet it was still a national flag!

The temporary action commander was a shrewd and capable middle-aged man. As soon as we met, he handed me a telegram that had just arrived from Mr. W:

"Ping, 04 received and forwarded, Chief Zhi, Yue, Liu box structure complicated and tricky, needs a lot of Sunrise brand, if can send at previously agreed price, very welcome, can guarantee brisk sales. Zhi Branch must move to Jin to open first, miss Qun, Hu, two partners; must try best to find, will definitely be first-class helpers in the future. Liao He, Jing kowtow."

"Liu Box" is a subtle metaphor for the location of the "Seven Sealed Secret Documents". "Sunrise Brand" was a nickname He Jian gave me. He always joked with me, calling me Sunrise Brand cigarettes, meaning that I could supplement his thoughts or help him with work he temporarily forgot. "Zhi Branch" is the secret radio station in Changxindian. "Qun Hu Two Partners" clearly refers to Yao Qun and Little Tiger. I and Mr. W had conveyed the news of their disappearance to him because he was extremely concerned about their work and whereabouts. "Jing" is Tokyo. The telegram did not need to add many hidden words, but for me and him, these team words were just ordinary words and not secret.

The detailed explanation of the telegram is that the exploration of the "Seven Sealed Secret Documents" is tricky and he wants me to go and help. The 29th Army Headquarters is moving south, presumably Matsui is going to work in Shanxi, so he told me to order 04 to track him. The rest is about caring for Yao Qun and Little Tiger and that we must do our best to find them.

I was concentrating on the telegram when suddenly I heard someone shout from the side:

### Mutual Trust

— Shao Fu

Recently, there have been many petitions to the capital from Shanxi and Beijing. Regardless of what kind of organization the petitioners are or what kind of nature they have, we hope that there will be fewer of these actions.

Beijing and Shanghai are close at hand. Telegrams and telephones can transmit messages in less than an hour. Why bother with such exhausting travel? Some people say that it is precisely because they are so close that airplanes take only two or three hours and sleeper cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line allow one to sleep until Xixia, so it doesn't hurt to go. If the capital were as far away as Beijing in the past, with treacherous mountains and obstacles and a journey of three and a half months, there would not be such enthusiastic eagerness as there is now.

If this statement holds true, then the petitioners' determination is highly questionable.

In fact, it is still a matter of mutual trust.

What is prevalent in the current society is "reporting everything in person." This shows that the trust in written documents has been discounted. Everyone does not treat written documents as a serious matter, and the result is naturally the trouble of personal contact between people. However, under the complex social relations of today, it is inevitably close to a waste.

How to establish mutual trust? Start with being responsible for everyone's words and deeds. Knowingly ineffective perfunctory documents, or suggestions and plans that you might as well try, should be written less. In this way, the value of written documents will not be taken lightly.

### Terrible Washington

— Yu Qiang Translated from "Magazine Digest," Original by Sidney Kalz

Undemocratic

Washington is the capital of the United States. In terms of local administrative regions, it transcends the forty-eight states and is specifically designated as the "District of Columbia," and its residents are also "transcendent": they have no voting rights, no autonomy, and no right to sue or be sued in federal courts! This is truly a "strange thing" in the democratic world. A Washington resident said angrily: "This is a contradiction. In this democratic country, nearly a million citizens are denied the most basic rights of a free society."

Very Chaotic

The municipal administration of the District of Columbia is managed by three commissioners appointed by the president. Below them are about sixty departments, bureaus, offices, committees, and other organizations, but some of these organizations are "redundant," and some have unclear responsibilities. But citizens have no right to supervise these secret policies.

What really governs Washington's municipal administration are two "District of Columbia Committees" set up in the Senate and House of Representatives. Washington citizens put it well: "But all senators and representatives are representatives of citizens from other states!" The spirit of the committee is: "Everyone's business is no one's business." The staff are already busy enough with their own voters, so they have no extra energy to take care of the District of Columbia. Therefore, it is often difficult to find a few talented members to serve on the District of Columbia Committee. Take the current chairman of the committee, Senator Bilbo, for example. He is the one who promised voters in his hometown of Missouri that he would not give Washington citizens the right to vote.

The House of Representatives and the Senate promulgate national legislation, but when they are asked to promulgate a city's municipal council's bill, the result is heartbreaking. Almost every proposal is lost in the parliamentary agenda. When there is an urgent need for funds for schools, hospitals, or prisons, the result is often tragic.

Unfair

What's more, the financial distribution between the local government and the federal government is also unfairly decided. A famous Washington lawyer said: Although the government occupies 20% of the city's land, we are forced to pay 90% of the municipal expenses. In addition, we also provide the government with 100,000 yuan of free tap water every year, as well as some police, fire protection, and other services.

Due to lack of funds and a government without civic autonomy, Washington's municipal administration is simply terrible. Let me give a few examples!

Galinnger Hospital has 146 infant deaths each year, accounting for 66 per thousand births. This rate is three times higher than the largest municipal hospital in the United States. From 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., there is only one trained nurse, assisted by a few untrained maids, taking care of 100 newborns. In the following eight hours, there is no trained nurse on duty, and the helpless babies are hungry, waiting for the bottles to be placed in their mouths.

What about education? Mrs. Wallace once wrote an article and published it in the newspaper, portraying the fears of thousands of Washington mothers: "As the mother of a school-age child, I am horrified to think of what my child's education will lead him to if the current situation is allowed to continue."

What is the current situation? Let's look at Assistant Superintendent Wilkinson's report: "More than 100 primary classes and two junior high schools are reducing teaching hours" - the result of a shortage of school buildings and teachers. Seven thousand students only attend classes for three and a half hours a day. Mrs. Lunke, of the Home and School Association, warned: "Our society will pay a heavy price for part-time education. If our children are not in school, they may lead themselves astray."

Another dispute between Washington citizens and the government is the deployment of the capital police. Washington currently has 1,685 police officers, but according to the Chamber of Commerce, at least 2,500 are needed. If Police Chief Coraghan could fully deploy these more than one thousand police officers to protect citizens, it would be somewhat passable, but in reality, it is not the case at all. When a VIP comes to Beijing and stays at the Blair Hotel, a team of police officers must be sent to guard the post. Or, if an important person has an appointment with the president, then the motorcycle patrol team will be dispatched to escort him.

### A Major Problem in Shanghai: Unemployed: More Than 250,000 People Unemployed: More Than 1.35 Million People

— Jin Xia

The results of the "Occupational Census" in this city have been completely compiled and the following figures were released in the middle of last month: the total population of this city is 3.96 million, with more than 1.549 million employed, more than 250,000 unemployed, and more than 1.353 million unemployed. This has formed a serious social problem. (Note: unemployed refers to vagrants who have never been employed.)

The phenomenon of unemployment is unavoidable in all countries, especially in cities. Due to overstaffing, the result of competition is the survival of the fittest, resulting in a group of unemployed people. According to a 1915 survey, there were more than 400,000 workers in major cities in the United States, of which 15% were unemployed. According to a survey in New York City, in 1930, the total population of New York City was more than 7 million, and the total number of unemployed citizens was about 444,000. In 1900, a survey by the US Census Bureau showed that there were 6.47 million unemployed people in the United States.

The United States is the most developed and wealthy industrial country, and there are so many unemployed people. The number of unemployed people in other countries can be imagined.

In the past, there was an "Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center" in this city. According to the registration figures from 1935 to 1937, the center stated that an average of more than 50 citizens went to the center every day to fill out "job application registrations." At most, there were more than 90 people a day, while there were no more than three or four people a day who filled out "job search registrations," resulting in a disparity of ten to one. Most of the job seekers are ordinary talents, while most of the job searchers need specialized talents, so the actual number of people who find jobs is even less. Among these job seekers are children under the age of fifteen and elderly people over the age of fifty. The pressure of food and clothing is a sigh.

The following is a statistic of the number of unemployed people in Shanghai each year, which will serve as the end of this article: 1935 - 500,000 people; 1936 - 520,000 people, 1937 - 700,000 people, 1939 - about 600,000 people (only statistics from the two "concessions").

### Goodbye, Neon Lights

— Zheng

Pushing open the window, the night sky outside seemed particularly lonely, as if something was missing. After thinking carefully, I realized that the familiar neon sign advertising the Wing On Company on the roof was gone, the towering roof disappearing into the darkness.

Opening the newspaper: "In order to solve the current electricity shortage, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau has banned the use of outdoor neon lights in all stores." The ban was actually implemented on the first of this month! But a few nights ago, the neon lights were still dazzlingly beautiful, and merchants were unwilling to stop using them; now, however, the neon lights have been extinguished, and the night in Shanghai seems to have lost its luster.

Regarding neon lights, in my stubborn mind, I have always considered them the "waves of sin," symbolizing the atmosphere of Shanghai at the end of the century. Every night, looking down from the window, the red and green "sea of light" always made me feel uncomfortable. Now that the lights are all off, although I don't feel lonely, my heart is indeed much clearer.

These are all empty words. Let's be more realistic! The ban on neon lights has undoubtedly been a major blow to merchants in general, and the business at night has been somewhat affected. The first to bear the brunt are the twenty-odd neon sign advertising companies, which have no way out from now on and are bound to complain. However, the ban on neon lights is only a temporary measure, and once the electricity supply is slightly more abundant, the original situation should be restored immediately. The Public Utility Bureau is assisting Chinese businessmen and the Pudong Electric Company in purchasing small generators, and has ordered the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to rush to repair the generators for use. It can be seen that the authorities have also put in a lot of effort.

I think that the prosperity of Shanghai at night does not necessarily depend entirely on the dazzling red and green lights. The rouge on a lady's face is not real blood!

### Duality

— Yang Ren

After reading the article "Unit Names" in this publication the other day, I was reminded of the many "dualistic" things in our society today, which make people lack a unified concept of them, and they are chaotic and confusing. No wonder the country cannot be unified! Here are a few examples:

First, let's talk about the calendar. Although the government has long stipulated the use of the solar calendar, the actual situation in society is still based on the lunar calendar, but there are a few more names, forms, and holidays: the solar New Year is celebrated first, then the lunar New Year; the New Year holiday is followed by the winter holiday; the year-end settlement is followed by a final settlement, and so on.

There are civilized and old-fashioned ways of getting married; civilized ones are more free, and it is not surprising to get married today and divorced tomorrow, while old-fashioned ones are more stubborn, with transactions completed, following the chicken and the dog.

There is the quintessence of Chinese medicine, and there is also Western medicine, which has been Westernized. You say I am not good, and I say you are not good; only the patients suffer. Which one should they consult?

Due to space constraints, I will not list any more, but in short, this inconsistent phenomenon makes people feel funny and bewildered! And in this society where "everything has a pair," people with "dual personalities" are of course the most common and the most suitable for the environment!

### Advertising Miscellany

— Gang Wu

The Double Axe Cigarette advertisement is quite subtle: "Made by domestic technicians, made with American tobacco leaves, 'taken over' by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, 'China'… product, 'always' satisfied, 'lasting' popular."

The slogan of Fumin Trachoma Eye Drops: "The latest American raw materials, China's 'first' 'creation'." I wonder if foreign arms factories can imitate Xi Shi, writing "Chinese raw materials, American creation" on their tungsten products.

The Queen's Theater presents Ruan Lingyu: "New glass coffin shipped from the United States," is indeed a "first look," no need to "respectfully request."

The Grand Theater: "Ticket sales are 'like a tide,' seat reservations are 'rebellious'." And: "Solemnly introduce Bai Yuyan, if anyone recognizes that it is not her, we are willing to pay 5 million yuan." I never thought that for the sake of "5 million," it would actually lead to "rebellion"!

"'The best' opportunity to 'benefit your children and grandchildren'!" People with good intentions quickly look down to see: "The Moral Bookstore has more than 100 kinds of Buddhist scriptures, Taoist scriptures, and various good books in stock, various Dharma items, Dharma instruments…" The more they read, the more confused they become, only remembering the opening words "morality," which are indeed important.

### Weekend Tea Talk

— Mo Yu

New Outlook on Life

Recently, there has been an interesting incident in the Chengdu city streets: a maid in a certain family gave birth to an illegitimate child in the toilet. That night was full of thunder and lightning, and torrential rain. The next morning, the neighbors heard the news and said that the child was driven out by the God of Thunder, and that the master would be very wealthy. They competed to buy him for 100,000 legal tender, regretting that they had missed this good opportunity. An illegitimate child was eagerly snapped up, and thunder and lightning really helped this little life. Those who arrived later stamped their feet and sighed. This is because they watched helplessly as someone took away a "wealthy and noble" money tree; their intentions were the same, not to nurture the child, but to get a "Supreme Emperor" to do nothing and enjoy a peaceful old age. If this child later drinks, gambles, prostitutes, and has no "noble" signs, then his fate will probably be completely different from the scene when he was still alive in the wind and rain. The world is tumultuous, and everyone is planning for themselves. No wonder even if there have been figures like Mozi and Roosevelt in a few centuries, it has not helped to eliminate the psychology of everyone gritting their teeth and rubbing their fists, which is exactly the same. "Where the benefit lies, it is like water flowing downwards." This is what it means!

Rats and Foxes

A few days ago, goods stored in warehouses along the Bund were often reported to have disappeared. Some cargo ships were anchored in the river and had not yet been unloaded; but the fresh goods loaded inside had already been sold in the market. This situation was also "popular" in Hong Kong for a while. It is said that the most strange thing is that no trace of opening can be found on the stolen wooden boxes. This is of course a masterpiece of cooperation between some "high-class Chinese" and "foreign experts." In Hong Kong, they are respectfully called "warehouse rats." When there are many such rats, the associated "smuggling foxes" are produced; the rats squeak and squeak and take things out of the warehouses and ships, and the foxes sneak around and move things from east to west. The result? Naturally, business is booming, and wealth is flourishing. The rats and foxes secretly change their appearances, which are no longer those of "lice on drums" with outstretched tails. Dressed in suits, with cigars in hand, they use ill-gotten gains, singing and drinking, socializing with foreign merchants, still the true colors of high-class Chinese. Do you think that the gentlemen who boss you around in front of you during the day are noble? Have you ever noticed their behavior behind people's backs? Have you ever touched the tail they drag behind them? Hasn't the neon sign of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" on top of the International Hotel been dim these past few nights?

Laughable

It is said that many strange Taoists have recently appeared on the streets of Chongqing, claiming to be from Mount Emei. Because the Third World War is about to break out, they have come to save all living beings; each talisman costs 500 yuan, and its effect can avoid atomic bombs. Quite a few people buy the talismans, and even the police on duty listen with great interest and encourage passers-by to buy them. It is rare that they actually "cherish each other." This Taoist must have cultivated to a considerable level; it is a pity that he did not make a special trip to Shanghai, otherwise those who watch "selling tricks" at the entrance of the New City God Temple and those who watch "flying sword taking heads" at the Grand Theater would have new comfort; let the atomic bomb explode quickly! When the earth is full of holes and wounds, we can have talismans on our bodies and be free from any taboos!

"Metabolism"

It is said that the Personnel Office of the Taiwan Provincial Government announced that from the 12th to the 18th of September, in just one week, 493 people were appointed, and 213 people were dismissed. Taiwan has returned to the motherland for a year, but because it has been deeply poisoned by the enemy in the past, we naturally have nothing to criticize about this drastic style of promoting metabolism among political officials; however, in some friends' scattered letters, I heard that Taiwanese generally still call people from other provinces who go to Taiwan "Chinese people," call Zhongshan suits and cheongsams "Chinese clothes," and call the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag the "Chinese flag"; the Daming Daily also often has sentences like: "During the Japanese rule, no matter by ship or car, there was always an intention to load the province's fruits that could be exported smoothly? ... If you want to smoothly export green fruits to your country, it is temporarily impossible to expect it unless the operators themselves purchase and prepare their own ships." (Original) and other sentences that always seem to have some flavor; I don't know if this time, among those large numbers of appointed and dismissed personnel, anyone was drawn to first correct this sprawling matter to be more presentable?
