### Chairman Reiterates Belief in Peace, Proposes Ceasefire Implementation Measures; Communist Party Agreement Will Prompt Issuance of Ceasefire Order

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Chairman Chiang on the 16th issued the following full text of a statement regarding the handling of the current situation: In my Double Tenth National Day Commemoration Broadcast, I stated that the government has always adhered to resolving domestic political issues through political means and will not abandon the principle of peaceful resolution due to any circumstances. I also explained that the cessation of military conflict has always been the consistent aim of our government. The Communist Party rejected the measures proposed by the government on October 2nd, as well as the ceasefire proposals of General Marshall and Dr. Stuart. However, the government will not abandon its policy of peaceful resolution and will continue mediation and negotiation methods to seek a solution. The current domestic political and military situation must not be allowed to continue to develop, further deepening the suffering of the people. However, what we face today is an armed political party that seeks to implement its policies through force. As the person responsible for the government, I must take necessary measures to ensure the peace of the nation and the safety of the people. In light of recent developments and the urgent desire for peace among the people nationwide, and further moved by the earnest expectations expressed by various parties and factions to end the conflict as soon as possible, I hereby reiterate the government's sincerity in seeking a peaceful resolution and propose the following concrete implementation measures: Once the Communist Party agrees, the government can issue a ceasefire order immediately; the informal five-person meeting centered on Dr. Stuart should be convened immediately to discuss the reorganization of the National Government, and the three-person group meeting chaired by General Marshall should also be convened simultaneously.

Communist Party Should Participate in the National Assembly When Ceasefire Order is Issued

These meetings will proceed under the following understandings:

(1) Restore transportation immediately in accordance with the restoration of transportation measures drafted by the three-person group in June of this year;

(2) Disputes within the Military Mediation Execution Group and the Execution Department in Beiping on which both sides cannot agree shall be handled in accordance with the methods drafted by the three-person group in June of this year;

(3) The stationing of Northeast troops as drafted in June of this year should be implemented on a scheduled basis;

(4) The National Army and the Communist Army in North China and Central China shall temporarily remain in their current locations, pending consultation and resolution by the three-person group regarding the allocation of stationing areas for the National Army and the Communist Army, as well as matters concerning the reorganization and consolidation of the army, and to achieve the goal of unifying the national army;

(5) The agreements reached by the five-person group should be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference's comprehensive group for their agreement;

(6) The issue of local political power within the cabinet shall be resolved by the reorganized National Government Committee;

After getting off the train, he visited PCC representative Wang Shijie. After leaving at 8:30 a.m., he took a letter from the China Democratic League's Zhang Junmai and others to Sun Ke, delivering it to Sun in person. He reported his trip to Shanghai to Wang, Sun, and others, stating that the various parties generally had no objection to President Sun's proposed new ideas but hoped that the government would first make a clear statement. The Chairman immediately pointed out that the government has always insisted on resolving domestic political issues through political means and will not abandon the policy of peaceful resolution under any circumstances. The cessation of military conflict has always been the consistent aim of the government, and the government can issue a public statement to clarify the government's tolerant and sincere determination to seek peace. However, various prerequisites for a ceasefire and political resolution must be discussed quickly. Representatives of the PCC present at the time, after hearing the Chairman's clear statement, decided to gather for lunch to discuss the matter. Wu Dingchang, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, and others gathered for lunch at the Lishi Society and discussed solutions. At 5:00 p.m., the Chairman summoned the representatives to his residence to discuss and meticulously study the maximum extent to which the government could make concessions. It was also decided to issue a public statement and dispatch PCC representatives from the government to Shanghai to urge representatives of various parties to return to Nanjing to hold meetings to resolve all issues. The government representatives to Shanghai were determined to be Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen will also accompany them. The public statement was issued by Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department at 9:30 p.m.

### Government Sincerely Seeks Peace and Adopts Opinions from All Parties

President Sun's Interview with Reporters

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After the government decided to issue a public statement, reporters specially visited PCC representative Sun Ke and requested a statement. Sun said that the government sincerely seeks peace and adopts opinions from all parties. (Note: The content of Zhang Junmai's letter to Sun was to hope that the government would make a statement regarding a ceasefire.) For issues that were previously disputed and unresolved, concessions have been made. Currently, all depends on when the representatives of the various parties return to Nanjing. If they can arrive quickly, various group meetings can be convened immediately, and various issues can be resolved in the meetings. The reporter then visited Zhang Lisheng, who stated that the government's issuance of a public statement is precisely an expression of the government's sincerity in seeking peace, but after the public statement is issued, all hopes are pinned on the return of the representatives of various parties to Nanjing.

### Minister Peng's Speech

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:30 p.m. today, hosted by Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The following is an excerpt of Minister Peng's answers to various reporters' questions:

Q: How is the current political situation?

A: Recently, President Sun suggested simultaneously convening the informal five-person group, the three-person group, and the Constitution Draft Review Committee to resolve issues such as avoiding military conflict, reorganizing the army, reorganizing the National Government, and completing the revision of the constitution draft, as well as opening the PCC's comprehensive group to reach an agreement. As for avoiding military conflict, the three-person group must be opened to frank discussions. It is definitely not a one-sided, empty order that can be effective. We still hope that representatives of the Communist Party and other parties will come to Nanjing as soon as possible to continue discussions.

Q: Does the government plan to take military action against the Communist-occupied areas in the Northeast? Will it...

A: The gain or loss of some cities is not important. The entire national territory should be under the jurisdiction of the central government, and the central government has been invited to participate in the central government of the entire country, so the return of some cities to the central government is not a gain for the central government or a loss for the Communist Party.

### People from Various Parties in Shanghai Meet with Zhou Enlai

Zhou Claims Not to Oppose a Ceasefire

[This Newspaper] The representatives of the Third Force remaining in Shanghai continued to make final efforts for peace yesterday. Around 2:40 p.m., Zhang Junmai, Hu Lin, and Li Huang visited Zhou Enlai for talks. Chen Jiakang of the Communist Party was also present. Laughter could be heard from the courtyard during the talks, indicating a harmonious atmosphere. Regarding the content of the talks, all those present followed Hu Lin's suggestion of "publishing as little as possible" and remained secretive. Zhang and others left around 4:00 p.m., and Zhou Enlai and Chen Jiakang both saw them to the door. Yesterday, there were rumors that Zhou had left Shanghai, which were not accurate. Hu Lin told the surrounding reporters: "There is no news to report, but because I did not participate in the talks before, I have learned about the past talks today." It can be seen that Zhang and others must have relayed the progress of the talks after Secretary-General Lei's arrival in Shanghai the day before to Zhou Enlai.

The Communist Party remains conservative and silent.

After returning to his residence, Zhang Junmai had discussions with Tang Yiming, Jiang Yuntian, Sun Baoyi, and other important figures from the Democratic Socialist Party around 5:00 p.m. Sun Baoyi told reporters that Zhang was waiting for a long-distance call from Secretary-General Lei from Nanjing, hoping to learn the government's views on the Third Force representatives' suggestions on a ceasefire and convening the PCC.

The Third Force had previously suggested designating Zhangjiakou and Baoding as buffer zones, but the majority of representatives urgently wanted to know the government's attitude towards the ceasefire order and the manner in which it would be issued.

After leaving Zhou Enlai's residence, Li Huang went to Difeng Road to meet with leaders of the China Youth Party. Around 7:00 p.m., they went to Zhang Junmai's residence together to discuss matters. Everyone expected the government's response to arrive, and the discussions were still ongoing at the time of submission.

[This Newspaper] According to the Third Force representatives who visited Zhou Enlai yesterday afternoon, Zhou stated that he did not oppose a ceasefire or peace talks, but he was not confident about the prospects for peace talks. Therefore, the impression gained by the representatives was that Zhou's attitude had softened somewhat and that he might still be waiting for instructions from Yan'an.

### Communist Party Personnel Fly to Yan'an

[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] Although two planes carrying Communist Party personnel flew back to Yan'an today, these Communist Party headquarters personnel still said: "This trip is not important."

### US Ambassador Stuart Will Fly to Hangzhou

[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 16th] US Ambassador Stuart has decided to fly directly to Hangzhou from Nanjing on the 18th and does not intend to detour through Shanghai. Qu Yingguang, Liu Baimin, and Shen Yinmo arrived in Hangzhou this afternoon to attend the Fusheng Board of Directors.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Discusses the Current Situation, The Most Pressing Issue Now Is Peace and Stability, Using Violence Will Make the Situation Worse

[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who has rarely expressed her opinions on domestic affairs in recent months, recently told the Nanjing correspondent of the Indian Free Press that now is the time for patience and tolerance, allowing the other party to have the opportunity to show its sincerity for peaceful unification. China has suffered greatly from eight years of war and famine, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. Therefore, the most pressing issue now is to provide food to the people. This is not only a problem of food shortages after the war and enemy occupation, but also a problem of rational and effective transportation, which often depends on domestic peace. Without domestic peace, transportation cannot be smooth, and the economy will inevitably deteriorate. The Kuomintang, in the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, recognizes the need to end the one-party rule system and return power to the people as soon as possible so that they can have a government they like. The government made this attempt once after the Pan-Yang Incident in 1931, and then made efforts again in 1936 and 1937. This is the fourth time. The government's decision to convene the National Assembly on November 12 is to end one-party rule and return power to the people. Madame Chiang Kai-shek continued, people have freedom of thought, and it is inevitable that they will have different political opinions. However, it is another matter for a political party to use troops to resist the government. Bitter accusations will not help. We hope to reach an agreement and hope that the Communist Party can recognize that we should work together for the common welfare of the Chinese people. During the conversation, Madame Chiang Kai-shek expressed great concern about the political situation in India and expressed her trust in Nehru. When asked about India's unification, Madame Chiang Kai-shek said that the opinions of various political parties are inevitably different. Two heads cannot have the same thoughts. However, differences of opinion only in terms of thought or discussion are a healthy phenomenon, but the use of violence will make the situation worse and more dangerous. It is understood that "The Britannica Book of the Year" has invited President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife to write about the Chinese War of Resistance. The full text is about 6,000 words and will be completed soon.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] The war in northern Jiangsu has been in a stalemate for the past week. The National Army advancing towards Xinghua from Baoying and Gaoyou has made slow progress due to entering lake and swamp areas, advancing only five li per day. Communist-occupied villages are fiercely resisting, resulting in heavy casualties among innocent civilians. Villages passed through were burned down by the Communist army in advance, a tragic sight to behold.

It is reported that after the returning home defense units on both the east and west banks of the canal in Gaoyou County returned to their villages, they were able to abide by government orders, protect the local area, and no incidents of revenge or retaliation occurred.

It is reported that the Communist army has stockpiled a large amount of public grain along the canal, which they have not been able to completely transport away. Local people are now hoping that the government will quickly find a way to investigate and prevent cunning individuals from concealing and selling it. It is said that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is aware of this and will send a senior official to supervise the handling of the matter.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] It has been ten days since Baoying County City was recovered. Order in the urban area is gradually being restored, and shops are busy resuming business.

### British Foreign Office Also Denies Existence of Potsdam Secret Agreement; No Reason to Sign Secret Agreement After Yalta Conference

[Reuters, London, 15th] Following the US State Department, the British Foreign Office spokesman today solemnly denied the existence of a secret agreement attached to the Potsdam Agreement concerning China. Reliable sources believe that this rumor is a speculation caused by the subsequent publication of the Yalta Conference secret agreement. The Yalta secret agreement was a special situation, intended to respond to the environment created by the Soviet Union's decision to declare war on Japan. There was no reason to sign another secret agreement at the Potsdam Conference. Well-informed Chinese sources here also do not believe in the Potsdam secret agreement theory, but at the same time solemnly stated that if this is true, it will undoubtedly be strongly opposed by the Chinese government. Furthermore, diplomatic observers here pointed out: The content of the rumored secret agreement is also difficult to believe. For example, the secret agreement stipulates that Outer Mongolia should separate from China. In the Yalta secret agreement, it was stipulated that the status of Outer Mongolia should not be changed. At that time, Outer Mongolia was still under Chinese sovereignty. The independence of Outer Mongolia was the result of free Sino-Soviet negotiations and the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, which stipulated that the decision should be made by a referendum of Outer Mongolian citizens. Another example is the Potsdam secret agreement deciding to divide Korea. In fact, the future status of Korea was discussed by the three powers in Moscow in December 1945, and a communique was issued. The three powers agreed at the time to establish a provisional government for all of Korea, governed under the four-power trusteeship for five years. Although the United States and the Soviet Union have not yet been able to agree on the organization of the provisional government, it is also clear that there is no intention to divide it. Another example is the secret agreement suggesting that the Chinese government should accommodate the Communist Party, which also does not conform to the facts. Although General Marshall tried to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, a ceasefire was still impossible, let alone a coalition government. As for the claim that the United States and Britain agreed to allow the Soviet Union to act freely in China after the Soviet Union failed to organize a coalition government in China, it is even more absurd. Facts have proved that the United States and the Soviet Union have very different opinions on the Chinese situation. How can there be any agreement? Observers also believe that before deciding to act freely according to its own responsibility, the Soviet Union must first seek the opinions of Western countries.

### Li Dijun Arrives in Batavia

[Reuters, Batavia, 16th] The Dutch government information office announced: The Chinese government comfort mission led by Dr. Li Dijun may arrive here by plane today. They will visit the Allied headquarters and the Marino area.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 15th Special Dispatch] The Dutch government information office announced today: The Chinese government comfort mission led by Special Envoy Li Dijun will hold talks with the Dutch government and the Allied commander. The comfort mission does not have a political mission but only aims to improve the welfare of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. In addition to traveling to major cities in Sumatra and Java, the mission will also visit the outer islands at the invitation of the Dutch government, possibly including Bangka, Belitung, Kundian, and Makassar, and will go to areas under the control of the Indonesian government in Java and Sumatra to offer condolences.

### Huo Baoshu Gives Instructions in Nanjing

Hopes that the CNRRA Will Become a Social Organization

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After arriving in Nanjing, Huo Baoshu, the new Director-General of the CNRRA, has been visiting the heads of various ministries and commissions in recent days. Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs also returned the visit to the agency on the afternoon of the 16th. Mr. Huo will stay in Nanjing for one more day and will return to Shanghai on the 18th. At 8:30 this morning, Mr. Huo summoned all the staff of the CNRRA here and gave instructions, saying: "Relief is like fighting a fire, and no delay is allowed. I hope that the CNRRA can become a social organization. I (Huo refers to himself) am the general manager of this social undertaking, and other agencies are shareholders of the CNRRA. Anyone who can help should continue to be asked to help, and even monks and nuns should be found to contribute to us." He also said: "I started as a small employee, and I can do everyone's job, but I can't handle the affairs of foreign experts." Mr. Huo believes that the agency's past work has its shortcomings and hopes to quickly promote the work to avoid being ridiculed by foreigners.

### Ten Million People in Northeast China Lack Winter Clothing; CNRRA Branch Discusses Winter Relief

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Liu Guangpei, Director of the CNRRA Northeast Branch, told reporters: "The severe winter in the Northeast is approaching. It is estimated that 20 million people will lack complete winter clothing this winter, and 10 million people will have no winter clothing at all. Countless people will freeze to death. Secondly, there is the issue of the plague. Although it was discovered last winter, it was not allowed to spread. This winter, the disaster is worrisome. If unfortunately it becomes a disaster, the interior will also be affected." Last summer, the plague in the Northeast was not reported truthfully in many places. It is estimated afterwards that 50,000 people died, which is chilling. Director Liu also invited the chairmen and mayors of the provinces and cities in the Northeast on the 15th to discuss this year's winter relief and the joint middle school of the five provinces in Songbei. The joint middle school has been established in Changchun, and the school site is in the damaged imperial palace. Director Liu especially hired workers to repair the school building with flour. The funding is planned by the five provinces and cities. 7,000 packages of cotton clothing and blankets have been transported to the refugees in the five provinces to protect them from the cold.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Recently, many people who fled from the Northeast to the interior have been sent back. After a long separation from their homeland, they are all happy to return, but because they have no property, no jobs, and no homes to return to, or their homes are in the Communist-controlled areas, they have no homes to return to and are living in shelters. According to Liu Guangpei of the CNRRA Northeast Branch: "All parties have welcomed the return of the repatriated people, and the branch is also willing to do its best to help, but the severe winter is approaching and freezing and starvation are worrisome, so it seems that the repatriation should be postponed. There are many people waiting to be transported north in Shanhaiguan, and there are also many in shelters outside the pass. If they continue to pour in, it will become a serious problem. If it is until next spring, the problems of clothing, food, housing, and work will be smaller."

### CNRRA Decides to Allocate Flour to Relieve Xuzhou Area

### Grain Prices Soar in Changchun

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] Grain prices have soared in Changchun and Jilin. Sorghum is over 20 yuan per catty.

The authorities have agreed on countermeasures to solve this phenomenon.

### Council's Resident Committee Debates He Dequi Case

Decides to Recommend Yin Shuxian and Others for Review

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding the case of He Dequi's suspicion of being a traitor, the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council debated fiercely on the 11th. Finally, it was decided to recommend Yin Shuxian, Wu Zhaohong, and Zheng Kuiyi to first review the report of the National Defense Supreme Committee. Now Yin and others have completed the review and submitted the results to the Secretariat. It can be submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting. The review opinions are divided into three points: (1) The report of the National Defense Committee only forwarded the investigation report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and did not make any decision on whether He Dequi was guilty; (2) All traitor cases should be handled by the judicial organs, and the National Defense Committee should not interfere; (3) The He case should be handed over to the court for handling according to law. The Ministry of Judicial Administration should not investigate beyond its authority, let alone conclude the case without any legal procedure.

### Tianjin Dongya Woolen Company Actively Plans to Increase Production; Orders Raw Materials from the United States and Australia

[This City News] The Tianjin press visited the Dongya Woolen Company here on the 15th. The company is one of the largest woolen factories in the country. It owns eight combing machines, which even Japanese woolen factories cannot compare with. Unfortunately, due to the lack of raw materials, it is currently shut down and cannot be used. The factory's monthly yarn production was about 800,000 pounds before. At the moment, it only reached half of the pre-war production, and pre-war products were sold throughout the country and even as far as Southeast Asia. Now, the distribution radius is restricted to just Tianjin and nearby localities. When the reporter asked the person in charge whether it was possible to find a way to transport and sell the goods to coastal ports, they replied with a sigh, "At present, not only are transportation tools difficult to find and freight rates are high, but the losses during loading and unloading are even more serious. It would be fortunate if the goods that are transported out do not suffer theft of more than one-third. The Northeast is an ideal market. The factory has now placed large orders for raw materials in Australia and South America to prepare for increasing production. The hemp factory and chemical factory are two existing affiliated factories of the Dongya Company. The hemp factory has an annual output of 5 million hemp bags, and the current monthly output is 78,000 bags, which is 930,000 bags per year. The cost is more than 3,000 yuan, while orders from India are only 900 yuan. This is enough to expose the seriousness of the crisis. The work of the chemical factory includes six systems: medicine, pharmaceutical chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, serum, vaccine, and applied chemistry. There are 14 kinds of products in total, and penicillin has recently been produced on a trial basis.

### Xinjiang Reclamation Farmers and Refugee Children Relief Measures Agreed Upon

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding the issue of relief for Xinjiang reclamation farmers and refugee children, the Central Standing Committee raised the discussion again today. The case was convened by the Secretariat and relevant agencies for consultation, and it was deemed that the situation of Xinjiang reclamation farmers and refugee children today is very pitiful. The government advocated resettlement in the past and must not ignore it. The weather is getting colder now, and soon it will be severe winter. Emergency relief should be provided. The Xinjiang Provincial Government should immediately determine resettlement measures. Two opinions were agreed upon: (1) A total of 2,500 Xinjiang reclamation farmers and refugee children will be issued complete sets of winter necessities, including inner and outer clothing, boots, hats, etc., and three months of food. The estimated cost is 200 million yuan in new currency. The funds will be allocated by the Executive Yuan to Chairman Zhang of the Xinjiang Provincial Government for overall management. The funds will be listed as emergency relief funds; (2) The Xinjiang Provincial Government should properly determine resettlement measures for the Xinjiang migrants and refugee children to ensure that all immigrants have a livelihood and are useful, and the central competent authorities should provide as much assistance as possible. This measure has been approved by the Central Standing Committee today.

### Yang Huimin Case

Interrogated Again Yesterday

Sentencing Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense interrogated Yang Huimin on the 16th on suspicion of communicating with the enemy. Yang wore a red cheongsam, a short black velvet coat, yellow leather shoes, flesh-colored stockings, and no makeup on her face. She looked quite haggard. Since the interrogation at 9:00 AM lasting approximately three hours, she was still giving an impassioned account. When the judge asked her to rest for an hour and then continue, she said, "I want to speak, I want to speak!" At the same time, she kept making gestures, wanting the judge to thoroughly understand her. She also repeatedly patted her chest, recounting her past heroic deeds. Then, she wiped away tears with a handkerchief. When the judge asked her, "Where did you hear the news about the American planes transporting supplies to China?" She said, "I heard it from outside!" Then, when asked again, "When did you hear it?" She replied, "I don't remember clearly!" The judge then said to her, "Hong Kong has already fallen. Why didn't you go to Chongqing? You didn't receive an order from the government. What were you doing in Hong Kong?" Yang replied, "I was sent by the Relief Committee to work, and some people thought I was as passionate and brave as before. I didn't pay attention to these details." Finally, the judge said, "In court, you should answer one sentence after the judge asks you one sentence. You don't have to rush. Everything will be handled according to the law." Yang immediately exited the courtroom. It is heard that the case will be sentenced soon.

### Heighten Vigilance Against Japan!

The draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland have been passed by the 21-nation peace conference. As long as the four foreign ministers make the final decision, they can be signed and established. This is an initial success of the 21 nations' efforts toward peace; in the future, they will engage in even more arduous and heavy work to conclude peace treaties with Germany and Japan. According to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, the four foreign ministers will begin discussing the German problem while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. After the UN General Assembly closes, they will return to Europe to conduct a comprehensive study of the German problem so that a peace treaty with Germany can be reached. Although the issue of the Japanese peace treaty will only be addressed after the German problem, it is estimated that the date of the opening of the Japanese peace conference is not far off. The U.S. State Department has already been studying and drafting the Japanese peace treaty. On the Japanese side, they are very keenly aware of the achievements of the Paris Peace Conference and believe that the date of the opening of the Japanese peace conference is imminent.

According to a Tokyo dispatch on the 12th from Agence France-Presse, Japanese political figures are secretly passing around a sensational secret document, the content of which explains the goals that Japan has for the Japanese peace conference and reveals certain guiding principles to serve as a reference for the Japanese delegation participating in the conference. At the same time, Japanese diplomatic figures are studying the previous Treaty of Versailles and the five draft treaties just passed by the Paris Peace Conference. They expressed their satisfaction with the fact that the Allied countries everywhere took Italy into consideration, and they believe that in the future, the Allied countries will give consideration to Japan's territorial and economic demands based on racial, historical, and economic reasons. Therefore, in recent months, the Japanese have been smiling again and dreaming beautiful dreams again, which makes us unable to avoid increasing our vigilance against Japan and shattering the beautiful dreams that the Japanese are making at any time.

First, the Japanese believe that Japan's position in the Far East is the same as Italy's position in Europe. This is completely a misperception on the part of the Japanese, and it can also be said to be wishful thinking on their part. Italy was an accomplice in World War II, merely following Nazi Germany in cheering and shouting; moreover, in the late stages of the war, the anti-fascist struggle of the Italian military and civilians made a great contribution to the Allied victory. Therefore, countries around the world believe that it is okay to be gentle and lenient when concluding a peace treaty with Italy. However, Japan was the main culprit of World War II. Not only did it first break the peace and engage in a war of aggression against China, but it also preemptively declared war on Britain and the United States. Even after Germany surrendered, Japan continued to resist stubbornly until it reached the end of its rope and surrendered unconditionally. Therefore, although the Allied countries do not want to adopt a policy of revenge against Japan, they must not be overly lenient and treat Japan the same as Italy.

Second, the Japanese firmly believe that war will inevitably break out between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future and believe that a war between the United States and the Soviet Union is Japan's only way out. Every time the Japanese hear news of the confrontation between the two major blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union, they naturally reveal a happy expression. Therefore, we must solemnly tell the Japanese government and people not to observe the international situation with colored glasses but to face reality. The Japanese have always been known to the world for their "narrow vision" and often have an unclear understanding of the international situation. Even in terms of the current world situation, it is impossible for the United States and the Soviet Union to have the same opinions everywhere due to differences in ideology and conflicts of interest; however, to say that war between the United States and the Soviet Union will ultimately be unavoidable seems to be a superficial view. At least today, both the United States and the Soviet Union need peace and cooperation. No country wants to see the recurrence of war. In Europe, although there is an invisible division between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, former British Prime Minister Churchill's advocacy of the United States of Europe has never been welcomed by the majority of European people. In the Far East, the United States and the Soviet Union may have different views on how to control Japan, but there is absolutely no situation of bloc confrontation. In particular, China wants to see the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate and does not want the United States and the Soviet Union to go their separate ways. Therefore, China will do its best to serve as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, mediate between them, and promote mutual understanding and cooperation. Therefore, although there are often disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union, they are still working together towards the goal of world peace.

Third, when Japanese people heard that our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie announced China's policy toward Japan in Paris, in essence: (1) Although China suffered major losses during the war, it will not make demands for reparations exceeding Japan's ability to pay; (2) When drafting the peace treaty with Japan, China will not adopt a policy of revenge; (3) China's policy toward Japan is generally the same as the United States' policy toward Japan; (4) Peacemaking should be based on justice. As a result, the Japanese have many erroneous illusions and believe that the demands that Japan will make in the future will be considered by the Allied countries, and they feel that Japan's future is very promising. In addition, the policy of General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Pacific, to control Japan has recently changed from strict to moderate, which has further increased the optimistic factors for the Japanese. However, we must make it clear to the Japanese people that "leniency" is by no means "connivance," and "moderation" is by no means "appeasement." The reason why China does not adopt a policy of revenge against Japan and the reason why General MacArthur's control of Japan does not adopt strict measures are all for the sake of peace in the Far East, that is, for the sake of world peace, and not to allow Japan to secretly rearm and cultivate its aggressive forces. Japan's attempt to retain the Ryukyu Islands is even more of an absurd dream.

In a message issued on September 3, the anniversary of Japan's signing of the surrender, General MacArthur said: "Will Japan's future position in the world be a bastion of peace or a springboard for war?" This warning is worth contemplating by the world. Especially today, when Japan is immersed in dreams, even General MacArthur, who is responsible for controlling Japan, must be vigilant against Japan's conspiracies and prevent them at any time.

### The Internal Conflict in India is Resolved!

The Indian problem was caused by the fact that Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, refused to join the interim government organized by Nehru, which led to many bloody incidents between the Indian and Muslim communities. The riots in Calcutta and Mumbai, with corpses lying in the streets and vultures pecking at them, were particularly tragic. According to recent news, Jinnah has met with British Governor-General of India Wavell and consulted with Congress leader Nehru before deciding to join the interim government. The list of five ministers allied with it was also announced by Governor Wavell the day before yesterday. This is a major success for Nehru in achieving Indian-Muslim cooperation through a spirit of tolerance. The relationship between China and India has always been friendly. We have always hoped that India can achieve internal unity as soon as possible and work together to achieve true independence in the near future.

In the past, the most important reason why the leaders of the Muslim League insisted on building an independent Muslim Pakistan was not the difference in religious customs. Many nations with different religions in the world can coexist in one country. China and the United States are clear examples. Although there are sometimes frictions between Indians and Muslims in India, they have also lived together for many years. Even in the six provinces with the largest number of Muslims today, there are more than 30 million Indians. Jinnah, who first announced the Pakistan plan in March 1940, also advocated Indian-Muslim cooperation during the last European war and translated it as only Indian-Muslim unity can make India truly independent.

The reason for the change in Jinnah's political views was still due to the overwhelming victory of the Congress Party in the provincial elections from 1936 to 1937. This made Jinnah feel that if Indians and Muslims cooperated, Indians would definitely use their majority to oppress the minority, and Muslims would not be able to have the power to protect their rights in the government. He thought that it would be better to be independent and free than to be united and oppressed. In terms of reason, Jinnah's Pakistan plan is not entirely unreasonable.

However, Jinnah's view is wrong. First, in terms of economics, Indians and Muslims must cooperate. Most of the places where Muslims live are very poor, and industry and commerce are not developed at all. Only by unimpeded communication with large cities and mutual assistance with the more Westernized India can the current economic oppression be resolved and the foundation for the future gradually built. Second, in terms of politics, India's large population, vast land, and abundant resources are bound to be coveted by ambitious countries. Although Britain has allowed India to be independent, it has not withdrawn its troops. How the relationship between Britain and India will evolve in the future still depends on the efforts of the Indians themselves. Under this dangerous international environment, the Indian and Muslim communities must not split up. Only a united front can resist foreign aggression and achieve true freedom. As for military affairs, Muslims have always occupied an important position. If India's national defense no longer relies on foreign countries in the future and is gradually built by itself, then the Muslim community can still make a great contribution to a truly independent India. However, this contribution can only be achieved through Indian-Muslim cooperation.

As for the issue of the majority and the minority, it is just a matter of political technique. For example, the regulations on the number of government cabinet members and the changes in election methods can enable Muslim leaders to fully represent the interests of 80 million Muslims in the new government, which is not an unsolvable problem. Congress leader Nehru does not discriminate against Muslims, and there are also four Muslims among the important representatives of the Congress Party. The seats in the interim government cabinet also indicate a willingness to give more. As long as Jinnah does not insist on the separation of India and Muslims, Muslims will not suffer any oppression in the political, economic, military, social, and other aspects in the future.

As for what Jinnah once implied to reporters on September 3 that Muslims might embrace the Soviet Union, we believed at the time that Jinnah was not sincere and was just making a political gesture to threaten Wavell and Nehru. As a Chinese proverb says, "Brothers fight at home, but they unite against external insults." The Indian and Muslim communities were originally brothers. For the past sixty years, they have been working together to resist British rule and want to build what Jinnah called a "free and united India." Today, for the sake of internal strife, they are recruiting another powerful country, creating new disputes and new controls. This is not a blessing for India, nor is it a blessing for the world.

Now that Jinnah has awakened and Nehru has also made concessions, the dispute between India and Muslims can be eliminated invisibly, and the future of India will show light. As long as it can be unified internally, the struggle for independence will eventually succeed. Therefore, we wish them success as soon as possible in building a new, independent, and free country. As for their breaking away from external forces, abandoning prejudices, and finally achieving the goal of unity, this good example is really worth referring to in today's China.

### Three Bandits, Including Li Defu, Executed in Jiangsu; Traces of Bandits Discovered Outside Qimen; Self-Defense Force Pursues Them to Outside Kuatang

[This Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 16th] At around 8:00 PM on the 16th, traces of bandits were discovered outside Qimen in our county, seemingly attempting to attack the self-defense force. The third detachment of the local self-defense force discovered and engaged them. The bandits were unable to resist and fled in disarray. They were pursued to the vicinity of Outside Kuatang, where one bandit was killed, one was captured, and the rest fled in all directions.

[This Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 16th] The notorious bandit Li Defu, who had been causing disturbances in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and his subordinates Luo Ying, Hou Mingqing, and three others, were executed by shooting outside the Changmen of Suzhou at 11:30 AM on the 16th.

At around 10:00 AM, County Chief Sui himself took the seat and approved the order to bring the three bandits, including Li, to the court. He informed them that they were being sentenced to death in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 1, sections 1, 3, 6, and 9 of the "Measures for Punishing Serious Bandits in the Joint Defense Zone" applied to the "Regulations for Punishing Bandits." When asked if they had any last words, Bandit Li only said, "Having ended up like this, there is nothing to say." He requested to have his shackles removed and drink wine, but the request was not fulfilled due to the sudden time constraint. When they were being tied up, Bandit Luo looked around and said, "I will still be a good man in eighteen years," showing a complete bandit nature. They departed at 10:30 AM. During the journey, the three bandits looked around, appearing quite calm. After arriving at the execution ground, they knelt down facing south. After the supervising officer Liu Ren issued the execution order, they were shot and killed one after another.

### Income Tax for Public Education Personnel: Various Institutions in Suzhou Launch Petition to Reduce the Levying Standard

[This Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 16th] Personnel from the central and provincial-level institutions stationed in Suzhou believe that the current levying standard for income tax for public education personnel not only includes salary premiums but also extends to subsidies such as living allowances. At a time when prices are soaring and salaries have not been adjusted according to the price index, levying such a heavy tax is not reasonable. It has recently been heard that members of the Central Supervisory and Legislative Branches have jointly suggested to the Supreme National Defense Council that the original salary be used as the basis for taxation. It is still under review. In order to implement it as soon as possible, the Suzhou Central and Provincial-Level Institutions Employees Welfare Committee is used to contact colleagues in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places to jointly petition the central government to approve the suggestion to show consideration. If necessary, representatives will be sent to petition.

### Zhejiang Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference Opens; Various Districts Report on Urgent Projects; Shen Honglie Instructs on Making Drylands Independent of Rainfall

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 16th] The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference was held this morning at the Provincial Government. Chairman Shen attended and presided over the meeting. Those present included Pi Zuoqiong, Director of the Department of Construction; Shen Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Secretary-General Lei; Yang, Director of the Department of Transportation; Sun, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau; Mao, Director of the Tanggong Bureau; Fang, Director of the Department of Social Affairs; and commissioners from the eleven administrative districts.

Seize the Agricultural Off-Season

Chairman Shen delivered the opening address, elaborating on the significance of the Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference, stating that it could solve the four major needs of the people: food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. All projects would be launched at the beginning of next month to seize the agricultural off-season in winter and implement them according to their urgency. Everything should be made concrete. Then, the commissioners from various districts reported separately, mostly emphasizing the importance of water conservancy and transportation and urgently seeking to eliminate disasters and seek blessings. The first district urgently needs to dredge Nanhu Lake. The second district's Xishan and Dongshan areas have been flooded three or four times and urgently need prevention measures. The third district's priority is to manage the Puyang River, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, and rebuild the wharf on the south bank of the Qiantang River. The fourth district's Jinhua River, the north and south branches of the Dongyang River, are like two rotten guts. Not only is it urgent to manage the river, but afforestation should also be carried out as soon as possible. The fifth district needs to build water gates in the Qujiang River basin. The sixth district needs to repair and dredge the Cao'e River and the water conservancy and transportation in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area. The mountainous areas and coastal regions of southern Zhejiang focus on farmland water conservancy.

Source of Funds

According to Director Pi of the Department of Construction's report, managing water conservancy and transportation is a current urgent task for Zhejiang Province and will not be suspended due to economic difficulties. Therefore, construction projects should establish close contact with administrative organs in their work. As for the source of funds, there are four: (1) Based on the approved plan, request the central government to allocate funds again. The central government still needs to allocate more than 4 billion yuan. (2) The province will allocate 300 million yuan for water conservancy and 250 million yuan for transportation. (3) The Gongzhen Committee will request the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Executive Yuan to allocate flour for work relief, 13,000 tons for water conservancy and 12,600 tons for transportation. (4) Launch national compulsory labor, without using people's money, but needing to utilize people's power. Before the Construction Department collects water conservancy project funds, it will first request a loan of 110 million yuan from the Agricultural Bank.

Compulsory Labor

Before the preparatory meeting in the afternoon, Chairman Shen made another statement, saying that all projects would be completed from November 1st to the end of next year, with the end of March next year as the main period. He hoped to use the agricultural off-season to launch more compulsory labor. In terms of water conservancy, large-scale projects should pay special attention to flood prevention, surveying, and planning. In addition to Ningbo, Shaoxing, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, large-scale projects should be carried out in mountainous counties, expected to be completed in three years, so that drylands can be independent of rainfall. The specific plan has been formulated but needs to be studied. It is planned to start with Sanmen County, establish a reclamation area, and re-reclaim Lan. It is planned to send Gong Peicheng to conduct on-site investigations along the coast.

Principles of Road Construction

In terms of transportation, the national highway has been repaired by the engineering team sent by the Highway Administration. The reorganization of provincial highways should first repair (1) sections with existing road traces that are easy to repair, (2) coastal areas or those with economic value connected to national highways, and (3) mountainous border areas that can be used for security and bandit suppression. County access roads should focus on (1) connecting counties that can access provincial highways, and (2) developing local specialties with economic value, and pay attention to the widespread layout of rural telephone networks. As for personnel institutions, a water conservancy advisory council will be established in the province, composed of several counties based on rivers, and coordinated with the water conservancy engineering office. Each county will change the water conservancy committee to a water conservancy association, and each township and bao will establish a water conservancy cooperative. In terms of transportation, a transportation repair committee will be established in the province or administrative region, and each county will establish a transportation association. Then, the preparatory meeting will be held. Tomorrow, the water conservancy and transportation groups will review the proposals.

Former Commander Gu Zhutong has repeatedly admitted that there was no other institution to receive them at that time, so he transferred them. He has now sent people to Wuhu to accept the investigation. (2) Zhang Weixia, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District of Anhui, sold part of the received materials and obtained 90 million yuan, which was used for Wuhu municipal construction.

[Our Taixian Correspondent] The weather has been turning cooler recently. The local relief authorities, mindful of the suffering of displaced refugees, have received 10,000 pieces of winter clothing from higher authorities and have begun to distribute them. As the quantity is too small, they are currently soliciting donations widely. In addition, when the enemy troops stationed in this county surrendered, they left a batch of biscuits, which the county government has temporarily preserved. The county government believes that they will inevitably spoil if stored for a long time, so they are distributing them to the refugees to fill their hunger.

### Pinghu Self-Defense Corps Reorganized; Storage Warehouse to Begin Construction Immediately

[Our Pinghu Correspondent] The reorganization of the county's Self-Defense Corps into the police corps has been underway for two months since receiving the order.

### Cricket Fighting Leads to Gambling; Resistance to Arrest and Assault

[Our Jiangyin Correspondent] In the Hudaqiao area of the Fourth District, cricket fighting was held, and public gambling was openly conducted. On the 12th, the Zhouzhuang Police Station sent Inspector Xu Jianxun to lead nine policemen to investigate. More than 20 gamblers were arrested on the spot, and more than 500,000 in gambling tools and cash were seized.

### Chief of Staff Displays Power; Disregards New Life Movement

[Our Changsha Correspondent] On the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, all sectors of Hunan Province launched a large-scale Cleanliness and Order Movement Week. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the third day, Wang Zuoji, a chief of staff of a certain military department stationed in Changsha, and Peng, the director of the military department, watched a play at the Le Yuan Theater. Their attire was not neat, and they were smoking cigarettes (according to the New Life Movement regulations, smoking is prohibited in public places). Zhang Ruoye, a member of the New Life Movement Discipline Squad, which was jointly organized by the military police and constabulary and was enforcing order on the spot, asked them to follow the creeds of New Life Movement and not to smoke. Unexpectedly, Wang and others believed that the soldier dared to interfere with their behavior, which damaged their dignity. They beat Zhang Ruoye severely and angrily cursed, "What New Life Movement," and shouted for the adjutant to arrest people. The audience on the spot expressed public indignation and criticized them. The leader of the New Life Movement Discipline Squad, because Wang and others were violent and unreasonable, fearing that they would disrupt order and the safety of the audience, had to tolerate it, appeasing the beaten Zhang Ruoye and asking Wang and others to calm down, and persuading the audience to calm down, fortunately not escalating. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the play, Wang and others retreated to the back of the seat and brutally insulted Shu Wenbo, the leader of the military contingent of the Discipline Squad, and then left in satisfaction.

New Students Heading North Face Problems

I am one of the new students admitted to Beiyang University this time. During the oral examination on the 8th, the examiner said that it is very difficult to gather and go north this time in terms of ship tickets, and it is best to find a way to handle it yourself. Therefore, in order to go north within the time limit, I have been running around for several days, inquiring about the shipping schedule and ship tickets to the north. Most of the replies are that there are none, which makes me very anxious. The school requires reporting to Tianjin by the 25th. According to this situation, I am afraid that even if I wait for a few more months, I will not be able to buy a ticket! If you buy on the black market, the ticket price is extremely high, and whether you can buy it is still a question. In fact, the school may not be able to buy it for you, let alone the students. According to this situation, if all the students going north encounter such difficulties, then most of them will not be able to go north. At the same time, there is still one question. Most of the new students admitted in the Shanghai area this time, I believe, have not been to the wharf, let alone Tianjin. Therefore, there will inevitably be many difficulties in the required clothing, travel expenses, and how to travel to Tianjin. In this situation, I hope that the authorities of Beiyang University can order the students to gather and travel together (because the previous batches of Beiyang University students going north also went together). On the one hand, students who are going out for the first time can take care of each other, on the other hand, they can avoid the pain of buying black market tickets, and at the same time, the students will not be late to report. We know that it is very difficult for the school to gather and go north, but it is much more convenient for the students. (Yishao)

Municipal Ferry Company Should Repair Roads

The Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi is an important transportation hub for people from the four counties of Pudong, Shangnan, Chuan, and Feng to go to Shanghai. Since the 1st of this month, it has been changed to the municipal ferry, which is very convenient. However, the road surface from the wharf to the Limmalu section is rugged and uneven, and the sunken area is very deep. Electrical wires and iron wires are scattered all over the ground. When it rains, the water accumulates to a foot deep and does not dry for several days, making it muddy and difficult to walk. People slip and fall, and their heads and knees are broken every day. In addition, farmers and village women from the four townships and eight towns of Pudong and farmers from the suburbs of Tangqiao Town go to Shanghai to sell vegetables as a side business. They take this municipal ferry at three or four o'clock at night and carry heavy loads on their shoulders, making it extremely difficult to pass this rugged road. I am erroneously honored as a consultant to the township office, and I have repeatedly received complaints from the people. I cannot remain silent. I sincerely hope that the Municipal Transportation Company will quickly find a way to fill the road surface, remove obstacles, or apply to the Public Works Bureau for assistance and cooperation to benefit travelers.

Echeng Murder Case Appeals to the Capital for Justice

The Jiang and Hu families in Echeng County, Hubei, share a large lake called Ya'er Lake. They take fish and grass from the lake for fertilizing the fields, which often leads to disputes. In March 1936, another dispute arose over harvesting grass in the lake. The Jiang family secretly hid guns and ammunition in advance. During the dispute, they gathered a crowd and opened fire, killing eleven members of the Hu family on the spot and seriously injuring sixty-seven. After the incident, the magistrate of Echeng County personally inspected the scene. The Hu family took care of the aftermath and applied to the county government for legal action. Because the case was serious, Hu Airong was appointed to represent the victimized families to petition the Executive Yuan. In July 1936, Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan, instructed the Hubei Provincial Government to investigate and deal with the matter seriously. Sixteen criminals, including Jiang Bohua, were arrested one after another and interrogated by the Echeng County Judicial Office. In April 1937, the Sixth Branch of the Hubei High Court sentenced two to death, four to life imprisonment, and ten to ten years imprisonment. Because of the appeal, none of the sentences were carried out. Later, due to the Japanese invasion of Wuhan, the government moved west. The sixteen criminals who had been sentenced took the opportunity to bribe the guards during the escort to the west and escaped home, where they lived freely during the enemy and puppet regime. In August last year, when Japan surrendered and our government returned, the Hu family continued to ask the Echeng County Government to arrest them. Unexpectedly, it has been a year since the application, and not a single criminal has been captured, and not a single gun has been recovered. Although the Sixth Branch of the Hubei High Court and the Hubei Provincial Security Command successively ordered the Echeng County Government to handle the case according to law, the county government transferred the order to the township office, and the township office transferred the application to the bao. The order was transferred down layer by layer, and they did not directly arrest them according to law, allowing nearly 100 criminals to live freely at home without being arrested and interrogated. Those who had been sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment but had escaped were also not wanted according to law. Ai Gu recently returned from Chongqing and believes that this extremely serious murder case has not been dealt with anywhere. He has to come to the capital to submit a petition to the Executive Yuan and various senior competent authorities for justice, and also asks all circles to uphold justice.

### Ten Nazi War Criminals Executed on Gallows; Goering Commits Suicide in Prison; Three-Person Committee Formed to Investigate Truth of Matter

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 16th] Shortly after Goering committed suicide by poisoning in prison, ten Nazi war criminals were executed one by one in the prison gymnasium under brilliantly lit conditions, ascending the thirteen-step platform. The first to be executed was Hitler's Foreign Minister, Ribbentrop, at 1:11 AM. The last was Jodl at 2:45 AM (9:45 AM Shanghai time). After the executions, the Four-Power Commission overseeing the Nazi war criminals released a statement confirming that the convicts had been executed according to law. Goering, however, had committed suicide by poisoning at 10:45 PM. Bavarian Governor Hoegner and Nuremberg Chief Prosecutor Reisner, as witnesses for the German people, examined Goering's body. Goering was lying in bed with a small glass tube of potassium cyanide in his mouth. He made a sound in his throat before the doctors and priests arrived and then died. Authorities began investigating this morning to discover how the poison was smuggled in. Goering had drafted two letters before his death, stored in a sealed envelope, one of which appeared to be addressed to the prison warden.

[United Press, Nuremberg, 16th] A three-person committee has been formed to investigate Goering's sudden suicide before his execution. According to McNair, an official with the US Information Service, the committee will be chaired by a US military officer, but the names of the three committee members have not been announced. When asked whether Goering's wife would be arrested, McNair simply repeated what he had said above.

[United Press International, Nuremberg, 16th] Security was tight in the prison before the execution of the eleven Nazi war criminals. American guards were stationed outside each cell, constantly inspecting, and rotating shifts every two hours. The Nazi war criminals sentenced to death had to sleep facing the wall every night, with their hands exposed outside the blanket. If they accidentally turned over in their sleep, the guards would enter the cell to restore them to their original position, so their faces could be observed at all times. One hour before the execution, the number of guards increased significantly. The sentries were equipped with Thompson submachine guns and pistols. The Nazi war criminals had no hope of escaping execution. But suddenly, the impossible happened: Goering was sleeping in bed, facing the wall, and did not violate the rules, but suddenly made a strange noise. It was 10:45 PM last night. The guards looked in through the small hole, and after seeing the situation, they were extremely alarmed and immediately notified the duty officer, who immediately summoned doctors and priests. They rushed into the prison and found Goering lying across the bed, already dead. The official announcement of Goering's suicide was made by Colonel Andrews, the commander of the prison. He said: "We are currently investigating how Goering was able to hide the poison, because the prisoners' clothes are searched very carefully every day." As for the nature of the poison, it was obviously the same as that carried by ordinary Nazis and that found on Goering when he was brought into prison.

### A Glimpse of the Execution: The Dying Words Differed Among the Convicts

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 16th] The final act of the German tragedy was performed tonight in the Nuremberg prison execution ground. Ten Nazi war criminals were hanged, while Göring committed suicide by taking poison beforehand. The news of Göring's suicide was announced by the court marshal at midnight, causing quite a shock. To prevent further accidents, the court had all other convicts wear handcuffs when they were brought to the platform. The execution ground was located in a secret room, where three gallows stood, painted dark green. Two of the gallows were used in rotation, while the other was kept in reserve. There were 45 observers, including four representatives from the Allied Control Council, guards, military doctors, eight journalists, and interpreters. The bottom of the gallows was covered with a thick curtain, which concealed the bodies when they were hoisted up after the mechanism was triggered. Ribbentrop (former Foreign Minister) was the first to enter the execution ground. After the interpreter verified his identity, Ribbentrop climbed the steps to the gallows. When he reached the top, the interpreter asked if he had any last words. Ribbentrop replied that he hoped for world peace and asked God to save Germany. After speaking, the two executioners placed the noose around his neck. The mechanism was triggered, and a loud bang echoed like a cannon shot, breaking the silence in the room. Ribbentrop's body disappeared behind the curtain. The remaining convicts were executed in order. After each execution, the military doctor confirmed the death before the body was removed. The last words of the convicts differed. Sauckel (former leader of the Sturmabteilung) hoped to protect Germany. Jodl (former Chief of the Army Staff) shouted "Long live Germany!" Seyss-Inquart (former Governor of Austria and the occupied Netherlands) hoped that this execution would end the final tragedy of World War II. Keitel (former Commander-in-Chief of the Army) asked God to have mercy on the German people and shouted, "Sacrifice everything for the country!" Kaltenbrunner (former Chief of the Security Police) said, "Die in loyalty to the country." Streicher (the notorious Jewish executioner) rushed into the execution ground shouting "Heil Hitler!" Then, in a hoarse voice, he yelled, "The communists will hang you all one day, goodbye!" Suddenly, he became calm and optimistic, saying, "God, my Father, I am coming!" Finally, he shouted, "Adele, my dear wife." Frank (former Governor of Poland) did not say a word before his death. The last to be executed was Frick (former Governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia), who shouted, "Long live eternal Germany!" By 2:52 AM, the last rope was cut, the body was removed, and the task was completed.

[United Press, Nuremberg, 16th] Following Ribbentrop to the gallows was Keitel, who was wearing his uniform and black boots when he died, maintaining the same calm demeanor as during his trial. When his handcuffs were removed and he was bound with leather straps, he stood with his head held high. He ascended the last thirteen steps to the gallows with a solemn air, as if he were mounting a reviewing stand to salute soldiers, displaying the arrogance and haughtiness that fully represented the spirit of a Prussian officer. Onlookers unanimously agreed that Keitel was the bravest of the ten who were hanged. Keitel spoke his last words in a complete and clear tone, saying, "May God bless the German people. More than two million German soldiers have already sacrificed themselves for the country, and I am now following them underground. I am not afraid of death, I regard death as going home, sacrificing everything for Germany!" Keitel was a soldier in life and remained a soldier in death.

### The Bodies Were Removed from the Execution Ground; The Location is Kept Strictly Secret

[United News, Nuremberg, 16th] The bodies of Göring and the other eleven were placed in covered cargo trucks today and sped out of the Nuremberg prison under the guard of armed soldiers. According to Captain Bente of the Security Police Detachment, the destination of the bodies will be kept secret. However, it is speculated that a portion of the journey will be by airplane, which is likely correct. When the trucks drove out, military police with machine guns rode in two jeeps as escorts, and a brigadier general followed in a black car. The vehicles sped away, making two round trips in Nuremberg before finally heading towards Fürth. There are two airfields in that area. At the time, the airfield was dark, with only a few personnel present, who seemed unaware of any special event. The vehicles then turned towards Erlangen, where there is another airfield. Military police set up roadblocks along the road in that area, making it impossible to track the vehicles further.

### All Photos Sent to the U.S. for Filing

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 16th dispatch from Nuremberg: As the forty-five witnesses watched the ten Nazi war criminals being hanged last night, U.S. military official photographers took many photos. A set of photos was taken each time a body was moved from the gallows. All of these photos will be sent to the U.S. Forensic Archives and the other three major powers for filing. Because of the sensitive nature of these records, they cannot be made public.

### The Murky Atmosphere Is Chilling; A Midnight Visit to the Prison; The Former Glory of the Convicts, Where Is It Now? The Expressions Before Death Were Filled with Internal Anguish

[United Press, Nuremberg, 15th] The eleven German convicts have only a few hours of life left. Their last supper was very simple, consisting of only a bowl of porridge, a few slices of bread, and a cup of coffee. According to prison guards, the convicts are able to maintain composure. These people will be executed after midnight. A deathly silence has thickly enveloped the dark Nuremberg prison tonight, and the executioners are also preparing. The first to be executed is rumored to be Göring, followed by Ribbentrop. Several hours before midnight, the sky over Nuremberg is cold and gray, with signs of rain or snow. American troops are stationed around the prison to provide tight security to prevent prison break attempts, and anyone without special business is not allowed to enter. Aircraft are also prohibited from flying overhead.

Göring Receives a Flood of Strange Letters

During the day, Göring received sixteen letters, mostly strange. Keitel requested that the prison guards notify him shortly before he was taken to the gallows so that he could tidy up his cell to make it clean before leaving. All convicts except Göring took a ten- to twenty-minute walk in the prison corridor. Prison press officers said that the execution results will not be announced before 4:00 AM standard time (noon on Wednesday, Shanghai time). All prisoners except Nazi philosopher Rosenberg sought comfort in prayer during the last few hours, and most were writing wills. Göring, who was next to Hitler in terms of the severity of his crimes, told the prison doctor that he was not afraid of death and would face it as if he were going home.

Terrifying Visages

[United Press, Nuremberg, 15th] American journalist Smith was allowed to enter the Nuremberg prison to observe the execution of the German convicts. He sent his first dispatch tonight, saying: Entering the heavily guarded corridors of Nuremberg prison, I looked through the cracks in the cell doors to see the conditions of Göring and Hitler's other assistants before their deaths. The faces of the eleven convicts all revealed a helpless and terrifying expression. The once invincible Göring was now sitting on a small iron bed, which previously only held ordinary prisoners, and had never borne such a heavy burden. A U.S. soldier was guarding Göring's cell. I saw that Göring's huge head was full of rage, resentment, and inner pain.

The Listless Nazi Foreign Minister

[Another dispatch] American journalist Smith sent a second dispatch stating that after seeing Göring, I saw Ribbentrop in the next cell. He stared blankly, his eyes dull, his expression listless, and his clothes were untidy. The cell was cluttered, and he shuffled around in it with an arrogant attitude. Next, I saw the former German Army Commander-in-Chief Keitel. He paced around his cell with his hands clasped behind his back. Judging from his expression, he seemed to be suffering greatly inside. He clenched his teeth as if trying hard to suppress this pain.

An Ape Having His Last Meal

The next cell was occupied by Sauckel, the former leader of the German Sturmabteilung. He was having a meal. His body was more like that of an ape than a human. I shuddered at the sight and left immediately.

### By Special Presidential Plane, Bernes Returns to Washington; Remarks on Peace Conference Made Before Departure; Molotov Sails to New York on British Mail Ship

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 16th dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes left the French capital this afternoon on President Truman's plane to return to Washington. Before his departure, he made very optimistic remarks. Byrnes predicted that the four foreign ministers would be able to reach a complete agreement on the difficult issues of the peace treaty during their meeting in Paris this month. Byrnes firmly believed that the four powers would not fail to agree because he had great confidence in public opinion. Byrnes did not believe that any foreign minister could refuse to recognize the issues that had already received a two-thirds vote. Byrnes' words were clearly in response to Molotov's statement that he had advocated reconsidering some of the peace treaty stipulations that had been passed by a majority vote. Byrnes expressed regret over Yugoslavia's withdrawal from the peace conference and hoped that the country would change its attitude before the foreign ministers' meeting. Byrnes pointed out that the peace treaty with Japan would be delayed. At the suggestion of French Foreign Minister Bidault, the next topic to be discussed will be the peace treaty with Germany. When asked by reporters whether the Paris Peace Conference had damaged international relations, Byrnes replied that he did not see any damage. Byrnes continued, stating that the division between East and West was not created in Paris, but had become more evident in the peace conference.

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 16th dispatch from London: The "Queen Elizabeth" liner, on which Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was traveling, sailed from Southampton at 2:00 PM today for New York.

### Japanese Conspiracy to Invade Mongolia; Soviet Union Provides Evidence

Details of the Nomonhan Incident Still to Be Released

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Soviet prosecutors presented documents in the Far East Court today proving that the defendants, former Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Seishiro Itagaki and former Minister of War Araki Sadao, had already planned to invade Outer Mongolia as early as 1936. Records in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs archives stated that on March 28 of that year, Itagaki told former Ambassador Arita Hachiro: "Looking at the map of the Far East, one can see the importance of Outer Mongolia to Japan and 'Manchukuo' because it protects the defenses of the Siberian Railway, which is the main route between the Soviet Union's Far Eastern part and Europe. If Outer Mongolia is merged with Japan and 'Manchukuo,' the Soviet Union's Far Eastern territory will be in great danger, and the Soviet Union's power in the Far East will disappear without a fight. Therefore, the military's goal is to do its best to extend the power of Japan and 'Manchukuo' into Outer Mongolia." Soviet prosecutors then excerpted an article by Araki entitled "The Mission of Japan in the Showa Era," which stated: "Japan does not want ambiguous regions, such as Outer Mongolia, to be near its sphere of influence. In any case, Mongolia should be the Mongolia of the Orientals and should be granted independence, peace, and tranquility. The Mongolian issue has become a greater obstacle to promoting the imperial way than the 'Manchurian' issue. Here, we must declare that we have the determination to destroy any country that attacks the imperial way." Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Detvofs said: "This document is only preliminary evidence. Details about the 1939 Japanese attack on Outer Mongolia at the Nomonhan Incident will be released later."

### U.S. Black Market Meat Prices Skyrocket; Public Opinion Poll Results Indicate Republican Party Will Rise

[United Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman's announcement yesterday that he would lift meat price controls on a scheduled basis and accelerate the removal of wage management has quickly had a wide-ranging impact.

### 王叔賢俞建民等定二十三日宣判

The cases of Wang Shuxian and Yu Jianmin, both suspected of being traitors, were concluded by the High Court yesterday, with sentencing scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 23rd of this month. Wang Shuxian served as the managing director and head of the shipping department of the China Shipping Company, jointly operated by the puppet government's Ministry of Construction and the enemy's East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd. in 1945. Yu Jianmin colluded with Wang Shuxian to establish the New China Shipyard, undertaking repair work for the enemy's puppet Tiansheng Maru vessel. Using the excuse of lacking funds to pay for the repairs, he received 31.5 tons of iron materials after the victory of the war of resistance, which he hid in Nanjing. The authorities discovered this, transferred him for investigation. Also concluded at the same time was the case of Xu Atao. Xu opened the Hefengxie Rice Shop at No. 28, South Riverbank, Kunshan County, in 1942, specifically collecting rice, wheat, and rapeseed for the Japanese Xi Zhong Yangxing and colluding with the enemy's 169th Unit, Erlang Chishan, to collect military rice, causing harm to the people's food supply. This case is also scheduled for sentencing on the 23rd of this month. Also, Mao Tiemei, the inspector of the puppet capital police department, Mao is 36 years old, from Qingdao, Shandong. In April 1919, he joined the puppet organization, initially serving as an inspector in the puppet capital police department in Nanjing and being assigned as the bodyguard of Shen Shuzhenggang, the head of the department. In November 1933, he was appointed as a liaison officer for the Pudong branch of the puppet political security bureau, seeking contact and exchanging information with the enemy's gendarmerie captain, Mizutani, and Ohno Shigeru. During yesterday's interrogation, he admitted to holding a puppet position, but argued that he was acting on the orders of underground personnel from the Central Government to assist the safety of underground comrades, and he had to use this as cover, etc. After the defendant's lawyer responded, the court ordered the case to be concluded and sentenced on the 23rd of this month.

### 胡林根尙待偵查

### Hu Linggen Still Under Investigation

Hu Linggen, the puppet Lianbao chief of the Second Lianbao of Zhoujiaqiao Town, West Shanghai, was also interrogated by the High Court yesterday. Hu is from Shanghai, 32 years old. After the enemy occupied Shanghai, he immediately became the puppet Lianbao chief and served as a guide for the chief sergeant of the West Shanghai Gendarmerie, Takeda Takeo, searching for our underground personnel. He successively led the enemy gendarmerie to arrest Li Baoqing, the leader of our Salvation Army demolition team, and team members Li Mao, etc., who were released only after the victory. They immediately filed a complaint and reported the matter, but the High Prosecutor's Office failed to arrest him repeatedly. The defendant was detained and sent for investigation by the police station on June 29 of this year at the Coca-Cola restaurant on Jiujiang Road for failing to surrender after shooting and killing someone. During yesterday's interrogation, the defendant only admitted to serving as the puppet Lianbao chief, and denied all other crimes. The court ordered that the case be continued for further interrogation as it was still under investigation.

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Miss Panda arrived in Shanghai, she resided on the top floor of the slaughterhouse on Feilun Road. Her spirit was quite weak, so the escorting authorities do not intend to display her publicly. It is reported that the injury to Miss Panda's foot when she was captured has not yet healed. The wound is being treated by the medical officer with Sulfadiazin ointment, but because Miss Panda often licks it with her tongue, she swallows the medicine, resulting in a very poor appetite. They will now switch to other medicines with the same properties that do not affect appetite. The International Publicity Office contacted an aircraft for Miss Panda yesterday and planned to send her abroad today, but due to the limited time, it is feared that it will not be possible to leave today.

### Third Meeting of the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee: Discussing Suppressing Theft in the Port, Dredging Waterways, and Adjusting Docks

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee held its third meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Wu, Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, Zhang Fuyun, Ding Guitang, Yuan Jin, Liu Hongsheng, Li Jianhua, Xuan Tiewu (represented by Fang Zhichao), Ha Xiongwen, Wei Jimin (represented by Tang Yonggen), Zhang Xu, Li Guifan, Wei Huanzhang, Peng Chongwei, Ye Youqing and more than 20 other people attended.

Unified Guard Enhancement Control

Chaired by Chairman Wu, the following was discussed: (1) Drafting implementation measures to suppress theft in the port of Shanghai—Based on the results of the on-site investigation by the investigation and guard team, the main reasons for the theft in the city's port are: the management equipment of the wharves and warehouses of various ships is not comprehensive, the responsibilities of the operators at each stage are not clearly defined, and the institutions responsible for inspection and security cannot effectively control. The team now provides three preventive measures: (A) Strengthen the management and equipment of wharves and warehouses of ships, (B) Specify the responsibilities of operators at each stage, and (C) Unify the power of inspection and security and increase its control. It was decided that the above proposal should be sent to various shipping companies and relevant agencies for research and submit their opinions within one week for discussion.

Dredging and Repair Proposals Three Items

(2) Regarding the measures for dredging waterways, adjusting docks, and clearing warehouses, the Huangpu River channel is silted up year by year, and there must be a comprehensive dredging and repair plan. At yesterday's meeting, three proposals were made: (A) Order the Junpu Bureau to quickly restore all original equipment and expedite the dredging of the Huangpu River, (B) Reorganize the wharves of the Huangpu River before the war, and (C) Divide the wharves into areas for river boats, sea boats, and ocean-going boats. It was resolved to ask the Junpu Bureau to inform the owners of the dredging and surveying of the river channel and the recent investigation of each wharf of the deadline for repairs, and send a letter to the conference for submission to the Senate for inspection.

Escort Personnel Must Be Assessed

At the end of the meeting, Director Wu raised the issue of quickly investigating the storage situation of each warehouse to make them empty and merged, and to conduct a thorough investigation of the owners of each warehouse, so as to sign lease agreements or return them. Liu Hongsheng also pointed out that after the war, the total number of lighters in the port and the lighters in the general assembly device was 597. If all of them can be completed, it may be possible to alleviate some of the threat to transportation in the port. The meeting did not adjourn until after 12:00.

[Another Report] According to a person in charge of the police station who spoke to reporters: In order to strengthen wharf management and prevent theft, the bureau has decided to unify the management of maritime security. All escort personnel and guards employed by various shipping companies must pass the assessment of the police station. In the future, the police station will uniformly manage them to increase work efficiency. It is firmly believed that wharf theft can often be improved in the future.

At 11:00 AM yesterday, Bo Liang, the legal advisor of the U.S. Embassy, Ru Bao Yi, and U.S. Consul Che Brown visited the Municipal Land Administration Bureau together. Director Zhu met them in the conference room of the bureau. The two sides raised questions and discussed them in a very friendly atmosphere. It was agreed that: (1) U.S. citizens who own land and have obtained a perpetual lease should apply to the Land Administration Bureau for a land ownership certificate in accordance with the treaty regulations. Those who have not yet obtained a perpetual lease should first apply for registration and then issue a land ownership certificate. (2) If the name on the deed is a U.S. citizen, but the actual owner is a Chinese citizen, the Chinese citizen should directly apply for registration with the Land Administration Bureau. (3) The Land Administration Bureau will not charge any fees for handling the replacement and registration procedures for U.S. citizens, in accordance with the new treaty. (4) U.S. owners will pay land value tax in accordance with the land price and tax rates stipulated by Chinese laws. The above discussions were quite satisfactory, and both parties were satisfied.

### Workers at American-Owned Electrical Company Briefly Went on Strike Yesterday Afternoon

The American-owned China Electrical Company in this city had previously dismissed workers for organizing a trade union. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, they were allowed to return to work. However, when the workers returned to the factory yesterday morning, they were refused entry. The entire workforce was very angry and went on strike at around 10:00 AM yesterday. The company authorities requested the Social Affairs Bureau to take effective measures, while the workers believed that the company authorities had not implemented the agreement and should request arbitration from the Municipal Government. The company authorities then asked the Social Affairs Bureau to convene a temporary arbitration committee composed of the American Chamber of Commerce and relevant military and political agencies. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the company's request was unreasonable and immediately refused, resulting in a stalemate. After the Social Affairs Bureau mediated in many ways, and with the strong persuasion of Liang Yongzhang, the representative of the General Labor Union, they first resumed work and then mediated again. The entire workforce resumed work at 4:30 PM, and mediation is scheduled to continue in the Social Affairs Bureau today.

### Reconstruction of Hengfeng Bridge to Begin This Year; Municipal Council Public Works Subcommittee Meeting Approves Construction Cost of 800 Million Yuan

[Report] The Public Works Committee subcommittee of the Municipal Council held a meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday in the conference room of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Zhao Kang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Tang Mingshi, Chief Secretary, Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Engineering Department, Qian Jifan, Commissioner, and more than ten people attended, chaired by Xi Yujin. Four cases were immediately discussed: (1) Approved the reconstruction of Hengfeng Bridge to build a permanent steel-concrete bridge with a load of 20 tons and active bridge lights. After the bridge is completed, it will facilitate the traffic of passengers at the North Station, Maigen Road Station, and the Caojiadu area in West Shanghai. The congested form of traffic in the central district can also be improved. In addition, the Zhabei area has been desolate after the war. In the future, passenger and freight transport from the North Station can take Xijiang Road, Changan Road, Maigen Road, and then turn into the Ka Line Road. The road map can be reduced by more than one-third, and it is expected to restore prosperity within one year. The cost of rebuilding the Hengfeng Bridge is estimated at 800 million yuan, which has been approved at yesterday's meeting. Construction will begin within this year, and it is expected to be completed next spring.

(2) Regarding the construction funds for the Public Works Department in this city for this year, within the scope of the budget, the Finance Bureau should be requested to allocate them as soon as possible to facilitate construction. (3) Request the Ministry of Communications to allocate the Jinghu Highway. For building materials and expenses within the scope of this city, please ask the Municipal Government to request a supplementary allocation from the Central Government. (4) The bottleneck-style houses on the main roads are hindering traffic. The Public Works Bureau should plan to demolish them. The owners of the demolished houses should be subsidized for the demolition and repair costs, or relocation costs, and land requisition costs, while the owners who benefit from the roads on both sides should be charged a benefit fee. The proposal has been approved. As for its detailed plan and implementation methods, the Public Works Bureau will study it and submit it for discussion at the next meeting.

### 解決電荒限制用電　下月起行將實施

### Limiting Electricity Consumption to Solve the Electricity Shortage Will Be Implemented Starting Next Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 PM last night for Xu Jiqing, Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council, the conveners of each sub-committee, and the directors and heads of various bureaus of the Municipal Government. During the banquet, the serious electricity shortage facing the city was discussed, and it was decided in principle that the electricity consumption of various businesses and households in the city must be restricted. The restriction methods differ slightly for businesses and households, and it is believed that businesses should be stricter in order to save a large amount of electricity for the production of factories in the city. As for the restriction methods, it is heard that the amount of electricity used in the previous month will be used as the basis, with an 80% or 90% limit. As for the detailed methods, the Public Utilities Bureau will study and formulate them, and it is expected to be implemented starting on the first of next month.

Regarding the case previously decided by the Municipal Council that the single regulations of the Municipal Government must be passed by the Municipal Council, it is feared that there will be difficulties in practice, because there are often many things that must be implemented immediately. Therefore, three alternative methods were passed at yesterday's meeting to handle them according to the severity of the case: (1) The single regulations of the city will be reviewed by the sub-committee of the Council after being passed by the Municipal Government Meeting. (2) The single regulations of the city will be reviewed and passed by the sub-committee of the Council after being passed by the Municipal Government Meeting, and then ratified when the General Assembly is convened. (3) For important cases, such as orders from the Central Government, they can be implemented immediately without going through the review steps of the Municipal Council. As for how to distinguish the severity of their nature, it will be jointly decided by the Municipal Government Counselor's Office and the Legal Affairs Sub-Committee of the Council.

### German Spies Employed by Japanese Army Before Surrender: Aoyama Harumitsu Testifies, Recalling Activities in Shanghai

The trial of 27 Nazi war criminals, accused by the U.S. military of endangering the Allied countries, has been going on for nearly a month. Yesterday, former Japanese military liaison officer Aoyama Harumitsu testified, recalling the activities of German and Japanese spies in Shanghai. They obtained a great deal of information in Shanghai, which was first sent to the Third Air Force Command of the Japanese Army in Hankou, and then transferred from Hankou to the Japanese Army in Nanjing, or directly to Tokyo. Even before Germany surrendered, the Germans had already been employed by the Japanese army and were working under the Japanese. After Germany surrendered, the espionage activities of the German and Japanese became more active, and Italians were used as telegraph operators to carry out communications work. Aoyama Harumitsu was the liaison officer at the time, so he knew the details very well. He was questioned by both the prosecutor and the defense lawyer. Each Nazi war criminal sat by and listened, taking notes. The case is scheduled for a retrial this morning.

### Japanese Military Atrocities - Too Numerous to Count - War Crimes Oversight Team Returns from Northeast - Welcome Meeting and Report by Zou Renzhi

[Report from Our Newspaper] For fourteen years, the Northeast was occupied, and the number of Chinese citizens whose lives and property were sacrificed under the iron heel of the Japanese military is countless. Now that the skies have cleared and the sun shines again, and the Japanese enemy has surrendered, Japanese war criminals in various locations are being successively subjected to the sanctions of our national law. The atrocities of the past fourteen years should be accounted for. However, these criminals have now found other places to live, resulting in them remaining at large!

The Northeast Oversight Team of the War Crimes Handling Committee has returned from the Northeast. According to the team leader, Zou Renzhi (who is also the Director of the War Crimes Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense), at yesterday's welcome tea party, the various ways in which the Japanese invaders enslaved and poisoned the Northeast were truly hair-raising. Zou first presented and explained in detail over forty pieces of photographic evidence of Japanese war crimes brought back by the team from the Northeast. Some of these photos depicted the Japanese military beheading compatriots, dismembering bodies for live sacrifices, and other scenes too gruesome to bear. He then reported on the actual situation of Japanese war criminals in the Northeast, stating that there were at least 600,000 to 700,000 Japanese troops in the Northeast, but only a very small and insignificant portion remain. Among those reported by the public for war crimes, given the vast area of the Northeast, there are only two to three hundred people, including only two or three major generals and brigadier generals!

Recent Situation in the Northeast

When discussing the recent situation in the Northeast, Zou stated that the Japanese always regarded the Northeast as part of Japan, hence Puyi was referred to as "Emperor" rather than "Huang (Sovereign)," and people in the puppet organizations had to refer to Japan as the "Parent State." The written language and spoken language were also influenced, being called the "Concord Language." For example, we would say "Wan le (finished)" at the end of a sentence, but the people of the Northeast have replaced it with "Yi shang (the above)." The intelligence of young students is generally below standard. During the fourteen years of occupation, the Japanese did carry out considerable construction in the Northeast, but it was the blood and sweat of our Northeast compatriots that flowed, while the Japanese reaped the benefits. Every year, over a million compatriots were mobilized. During the construction of the Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Plant, the most famous project in the Northeast, as many as 300,000 compatriots died from the work! As for the poisonous acts of the Japanese military police against patriotic compatriots, they are truly hair-raising. There were underground passages leading to various places, about two to three zhang (6-10 meters) high and wide, with many small rooms, all so-called "secret rooms." Anyone considered to be ideologically "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" would be abused there. In some cases, entire villages were "subjugated," and all the compatriots were killed. The evidence of the Japanese poisoning schemes is everywhere in the Northeast. For example, outside the East Gate of Shenyang, there was a "Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium Workshops," which was actually an opium manufacturing facility. There were also heroin factories and morphine factories.

Missing Women

After the Northeast was recovered, the National Army was unable to immediately move in, and order was disrupted. At the time of recovery, it was discovered that over 20,000 women had gone missing! Furthermore, because Japanese women who married Chinese men could avoid repatriation, many hastily married Chinese citizens, with 5,000 couples already registered. The lives of Japanese residents were generally not very prosperous due to repeated upheavals, and many Japanese women became prostitutes, among whom syphilis was very prevalent. The housing shortage is currently very serious in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, but the Northeast has a situation of many houses and few people. As for the female movie stars of the puppet Manchukuo regime, almost all of them have married American soldiers stationed there.

"Another Visit" The war crimes oversight team, a group of five people, went to Beijing last night to report on their duties. The team representatives gathered a great deal of information during this trip to the Northeast. The details are recorded below to provide a glimpse into the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Northeast:

Record of Atrocities

(1) "Great Arrest" in Shenyang: In early December of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), incidents of sabotage of railways by volunteer armies occurred in Tie Ling, Kaiyuan, Dashiqiao, and other places near Sujiazhai in the southern part of Shenyang. Morita, the Japanese military police captain stationed in Shenyang, instructed his subordinates to carry out large-scale arrests inside and outside Shenyang City for two consecutive weeks. More than 400 people were arrested. After interrogation, more than 130 were deemed to have committed crimes, including party and government personnel, and military police officers. Among them, Tan Gan, a member of the party, escaped from prison at night, along with seventy others. The Japanese military then vented their anger on the remaining prisoners, torturing them severely and arbitrarily arresting family members and others involved, totaling 400 people, of whom 160 died from torture.

(2) "Great Arrest" in Andong: In April of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), a Japanese police chief named Omachi, while conducting a household survey in Andong County, discovered suspicious letters and arrested a party member named Gao. He then carried out a raid on anti-Japanese elements, affecting Shenyang, Yingkou, and other places. More than 1,500 CCP members from Zhejiang were arrested, of whom only a dozen survived.

(3) "Great Arrest" in Jilin (the Yuwencheng Middle School Incident): After the September 18th Incident, Liu Gangzhong, the person in charge of the Northeast Party Affairs Office in Beiping, sent Liu Jinglan, Zheng Zhi Kuan, and others to Jilin to contact party members there and organize the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. In early February of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the matter was discovered by the puppet Manchukuo Jilin Police Department due to remittance issues, and more than 60 people were arrested. Among them, Li Guanghan, the principal of Yuwen Middle School, and four others died in prison under severe torture. The rest were sentenced to imprisonment until their release in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). However, they were mentally disturbed and physically disabled.

Also, in May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), in Panshan County, Jilin Province, Wang Dianchen led his men to destroy the railway. The secret was leaked, and they were arrested by the Japanese military, resulting in thousands of casualties.

(4) Harbin Incident: In December of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), several patriotic individuals in Harbin agreed with the volunteer army in the Songhua River and Heilongjiang area to launch an uprising in Songpu, north of Harbin. They were secretly reported to the puppet Manchukuo Binjiang Police Department by a traitor named Dong, who mobilized a search and killed them all, without a single survivor. This is the so-called "December 31st" Incident.

(5) "Great Subjugation" Incident in the Eastern Border Region: From the 23rd to the 25th year of the Republic (1934-1936) and from the 27th to the 29th year of the Republic (1938-1940), the Japanese military carried out two major subjugations in the "Eastern Border Region," resulting in approximately 6,000 victims. Countless villages and houses were burned. At that time, there was a Japanese lieutenant colonel in the Japanese military who was particularly fond of killing, and he personally beheaded approximately 160 people.

(6) Large-Scale Sweep in the Dunhua Area: In the winter of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the Japanese military began a "large-scale sweep" in the area from Dunhua to Jingpo Lake. The commander, Lieutenant Colonel Tsukino, and others burned villages and killed people, which was extremely inhumane. The number of victims reached three to four thousand, with villages reduced to ruins and displaced people everywhere. Moreover, it was during the harsh winter, and countless people died from freezing and starvation.

(7) Chen Hanzhang Incident: In the summer of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Chen Hanzhang, a teacher at Jilin Middle School, was forced to revolt, and four to five thousand people responded, becoming active in the mountainous areas of central Jilin. As a result, the Japanese military launched a large-scale "subjugation." Chen's forces were unable to resist and suffered many casualties, retreating into Soviet territory. They re-emerged the following spring, robbing weapons from puppet military police in Dunhua and Mingyuegou. Later, due to being pursued by enemy and puppet forces, they retreated to the Dahuanggou area in eastern Dunhua, where they ran out of ammunition and food. Chen was wounded and committed suicide, and most of his troops were massacred.

(8) "Great Arrest" Incident of December 30th: On December 30th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the enemy and puppets launched a "Great Arrest" throughout the Northeast, with a total of 355 people being arrested. They were later handed over to the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Justice for processing, with 193 being prosecuted, 87 not being prosecuted, 9 being sentenced to death, and 18 being sentenced to life imprisonment. For details, see the book "Overview of the December 30th Incident" compiled by the Criminal Affairs Department of the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Justice in June of the 11th year of Kangde (1944).

(9) Pingdingshan Massacre in Fushun: On the night of the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the volunteer army of Tang Juwu attacked the Fushun mining area and passed through Pingdingshan. Guan Chengyi, the person in charge of the Kuriyagawa Workers' Store in the coal mine, falsely claimed to have been robbed and colluded with local Japanese military police and Japanese personnel from the coal mine, gathering at Pingdingshan Qianjinzai Dongshan. At 2:00 p.m. on the 16th, they concentrated all the villagers, about 5,000 people from 350 households, on the Xishan side of Pingdingshan. They set fire to the houses and used machine guns to strafe the fleeing villagers. They then rushed into Xishan and used bayonets to stab more than 60 severely wounded people who were not dead in the chaotic piles of corpses. Only a dozen people survived. Regarding this case, in August of this year, the Northeast Security Commander's Office recently captured four war criminals related to the massacre: Tang Tianfan, Takahashi Keio, Nishiyama Shigeyuki, and Tu Zhi Feng.

(10) Crimes of the "Guandong Prefecture Police Bureau": According to Chapter 24, Section 5 of the "Thirty-Year History of Guandong Bureau Administration" (1936 edition), "Records of the Guandong Bureau Police Officers' Arrest of Anti-Manchu and Anti-Japanese Elements and Pacification Work during the Manchurian Incident": "Political bandits," ideological bandits," and religious bandits," etc., in the Northeast amounted to 250,000. During the Japanese military's large-scale suppression of anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese elements, they successively arrested and "legally executed" them. The names of the "criminals" and the dates of arrest are listed in detail.

(11) Wanbaoshan Incident: The Wanbaoshan Incident began in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and was also one of the major events of the Japanese invasion of China. The details of the incident have been recorded in detail in history. It has recently been learned that Hao Yongde, the main culprit of this massacre, who used Koreans to expand the incident when it occurred, has been captured by the inspection team of our New Sixth Army and sent to the Military Law Office of the Changchun Garrison Command for interrogation.

(12) Poisoning Policy: Secondly, this Northeast Oversight Team also conducted a detailed investigation into the truth of the enemy and puppet regimes' implementation of a poisoning policy in the Northeast. Before the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese used the concession areas attached to the "South Manchuria Railway" as bases to harbor and transport large quantities of drugs. The Japanese Consul General did not prohibit it but instead encouraged Japanese merchants to sell them. By the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the puppet government, in order to increase its finances, established an opium monopoly system, setting up a special general bureau under the puppet Ministry of Economy, with special purchase offices and special purchase bureaus (totaling 108 bureaus) and special purchase sub-bureaus (totaling 190 bureaus) under it. The number of permitted opium dens was 2,100. The amount of opium sold was 13 million taels. The factories for manufacturing drugs were in Shenyang, and the opium raw material came from Rehe. The large quantities of opium they manufactured were promoted with trademarks such as "Fu (fortune), Lu (prosperity), Shou (longevity), Xi (happiness), Song (pine), Zhu (bamboo), Mei (plum), Lan (orchid)" as rewards. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the opium monopoly was stopped and transferred to the "Ministry of People's Livelihood," which established the "General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium," with 145 "Kang Sheng Hospitals" and 1,800 "Ying Yan Offices" under it. At this point, the opium public sale system was superficially abolished, but in reality, the "Ministry of People's Livelihood" also sold it. By the 30th year of the Republic (1941), after the Pacific War, the Japanese planned to increase their financial income, abolish the "Kang Sheng Hospitals" in various places, and increase the quantity of opium sold. They also greatly expanded the areas for opium cultivation. In addition to Rehe Province, Liaoning, Liaobei, Jilin, and other provinces implemented large-scale group cultivation of opium. They also transported large quantities to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other areas for dumping. Regarding the Japanese criminals related to opium, there were those who advocated opium monopoly, those who implemented poisoning, those who initiated the lifting of the ban, and those who requested opium production, including Umeno Cho Shiro, the ringleader who advocated planting opium in Liaoning, Liaobei, and Jilin, and Tsushima Keiji, who sold opium in the Nanjing area, and dozens of others.

### China National Aviation Corporation to Open Shanghai-Xiamen Route

China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), considering Xiamen, Fujian, to be an important coastal city, is opening the Shanghai-Xiamen route to facilitate transportation to the region. Test flights have already been completed, and the opening date and ticket prices will be determined shortly. CNAC flights traveling to and from Shanghai and Hong Kong will now land in Xiamen. CNAC is not planning to open any other new routes this year, due to a shortage of aircraft parts, insufficient gasoline, and a lack of available personnel.

### President of Economic News Agency Returns to Shanghai to Discuss Impressions of Northeast

Zai Yan Jinshi, President of the Economic News Agency and Specialist Committee Member of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, recently flew to Shenyang at the invitation of Chairman Zhang Jia'ao. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago and gave the following impressions of the Northeast: (1) The patriotism of the people in the nine northeastern provinces is no less than that of those in the interior. The desire for peace is especially strong. (2) The economic order of the nine northeastern provinces is gradually recovering. Zhang Gongquan, the economic leader, is very eager for young and ambitious people to go there, work hard, and build a new Northeast. (3) The financial situation in Shenyang is good, with low interest rates. The general public has no concept of interest, and there is no possibility for speculators to exist. Therefore, the Northeast can be called a "paradise for doers." (4) Although the industry in the Northeast has been destroyed, it is not a great loss. The Japanese economic construction in the past was entirely to cooperate with their military aggression. If it is maintained as it is, it will not conform to our national conditions. It is necessary to re-establish an economic construction plan. (5) What the Northeast lacks most is cotton cloth and industrial raw materials. The exportable goods are coarse grains. The authorities welcome barter trade.

### Tax Evasion and False Accounting - Two Businesses Discovered

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yongchang Cigarette Shop at No. 65 Fengyang Road in this city was recently investigated by the Finance Bureau and found to have committed the crime of evading taxes by forging accounts. It is said that the amount of concealed business revenue reached as high as 2 billion yuan. Since taking over the business tax, the Finance Bureau has been actively rectifying and intensifying investigations. In mid-September, Inspector Yang Wenguang of the Bureau suspected that Yongchang Cigarette Shop was evading taxes. After three weeks of continuous investigation, he learned that Lu Tongshun Flower Shop at No. 85 on the same road had concealed real account books. He then, on the afternoon of the 15th (the other day), together with Inspectors Qiu Zhongming and Zhou Ding, and Investigator Tian Shengwen, investigated more than 20 fake and real account books.

### Bada Company's Motorized Sailboat "Hua Jin" Trial Voyage to Kouan - One Trip Every Four Days with No Stops - Little Cargo and Few Passengers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the victory, the Shanghai-Kouan line has been closed due to the special circumstances there. There are no regular sailing vessels. Recently, Bada Company dispatched the motorized sailboat "Hua Jin" on a trial voyage, sailing directly from Shanghai to Kouan, once every four days, without stopping at other ports. According to the company, the situation in that area has become peaceful, but the cargo is still scarce, only eggs and duck eggs, etc. Because passengers are not clear about the local situation, few people are going there. It is said that Tongxing Shipping Company will also open a Kouan route.

Transportation on the North-South ocean lines has recently become slightly quiet. The Southern Ocean line has been affected by the ban on shipping cotton yarn and cotton cloth to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and the Northern Ocean line has been affected by the high prices of goods in Shanghai. The goods imported from the North-South ocean lines to Shanghai are entirely dependent on medicinal materials and fruits. The stock of timber in Fujian is sufficient and not easy to transport all at once.

The Daxing vessel has been issued a permit. The China Shipping Company's Tianlong vessel sailed to Qinhuangdao for the first time yesterday. Because the inspection procedures were not complete, the Maritime Affairs Bureau blocked its exit and supplemented the procedures separately. The Daxing Company's Daxing vessel was requisitioned by the enemy puppet regime. After the victory, it was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau and renamed "Jiangli," sailing on the Yangtze River line. Xu Zhongxin, the manager of Daxing Company, applied to the Enemy Puppet Handling Bureau to transfer to China Merchants Bureau for return. The bureau had issued an order to return it on the 14th, and Xu Zhongxin of the company signed to receive it.

There is also the cargo ship "Montal Laugus," which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next week. The other passenger and cargo ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai have been affected by the strike and will not be able to arrive in Shanghai this month. The Manila Lynx mail ship was originally scheduled to sail to the South Pacific today, but due to incomplete procedures, it has been changed to depart from Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, via Hong Kong to the Little Luzon, and then return directly to the United States from the Philippines, without coming to Shanghai again.

"It's good to stay at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to take even one step out the door." I didn't expect this old saying to still be relevant today.

### Digging up Tombs - UNRRA Employee Accused in First Case - District Court Rules Against Hearing Part of the Case Against Defendant Hayes - Zhang Songzhou and Jin Zhixuan to be Investigated Separately Before Further Hearings

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Detang and Wang Yunting, brothers, accused Hayes, an Australian and General Manager of the UNRRA Zhenru Machine Factory, Jin Zhixuan, the factory director, and Zhang Songzhou, the manager of Datong Bank, of privately digging up tombs and arbitrarily occupying the cemetery. The District Court held its fourth hearing yesterday. After a heated debate between the lawyers for both parties, the court ruled that the private prosecution filed by the plaintiff regarding Hayes's part would not be accepted. Hayes is the first UNRRA employee to be accused. The court refused to accept the case because it respected international agreements, which is also the first time for this case. After this case occurred, Major General Eggerton, Director of the UNRRA China Office, formally sent a letter to the President of the District Court, Zha Liangjian, on September 30th, proving that Hayes was a UNRRA employee. The defendant's lawyer also presented the "Basic Agreement between the Chinese Government and UNRRA," which stipulated that "UNRRA employees, when performing official duties, are exempt from any form of legal process for their actions within the scope of their duties," requesting the court not to accept the case. They also said that it was a matter of international reputation and should comply with the agreement. If the court accepted it, it would set a precedent, and UNRRA employees would have more troubles. The lawyers requested the court to seriously consider the decision. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that if the court did not accept the case, the people's lives and property would have no protection. The second defendant, Jin Zhixuan, said that he had not yet taken office when Wang's cemetery was used, and the former General Manager, Hayes, should be fully responsible. The third defendant, Zhang Songzhou, denied that he rented out the cemetery. After the debate ended, the court ruled that Hayes's part would not be accepted, and the parts of Zhang Songzhou and Jin Zhixuan would be investigated separately before being heard again at a later date.

### Training Electrical Engineers: Power Company Acts as Examiner for Interns, to Send Part of Trainees to Northeast After Completion of Training

[Our Report] The Shanghai Power Company, to assist in the training of electrical technicians, previously jointly recruited intern technicians with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. As a result, eight people were admitted and started working at the company on September 1st. Recently, at the request of the Executive Yuan's Resources Committee, the company recruited another six intern technicians the day before yesterday. After two months of training, they will be sent to serve in the Northeast. Yesterday, our reporter made a special visit to Hu Wen'an, the officer in charge of the electrical engineering training class at the Power Company, to inquire about the training situation. According to him, before the war, the company recruited four or five new technicians each year. During the war, the enemy, in order to exclude the British as much as possible, recruited 40 or 50 Chinese personnel each year, resulting in a phenomenon of excessive Chinese personnel. To this day, there are still 43 people in training.

The organization of the training class is extremely strict. Five representatives from affiliated institutions such as power plants participate as members of the committee. There are also more than 20 people from various institutions responsible for training matters. The training period is four years, and the qualifications for candidates are limited to graduates of universities and specialized schools. After foreign students are admitted, the internship period is six months to one year. In this joint recruitment with the Public Utilities Bureau, more than 200 people applied, and more than 140 people were qualified. However, due to the limited number of places, four people each in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering were finally admitted. The electrical engineering majors were Yang Juntao, Cui Lunyuan, Shou Jican, and Zhou Qingchang. The mechanical engineering majors were Qian Zhongpeng, Zhu Wenyu, Feng Yimin, and Hong Fuyu. Six of them are graduates of Jiaotong University, one from Datong University, and one from Lin University. They are now assigned to practice at the Yangshupu Power Plant. In the future, they will be rotated and trained in more than 20 departments, such as the machine room, copper workshop, control room, pattern shop, chemical laboratory, and distribution room, with each department training for about one to three months.

As for the treatment, the starting basic salary is 80 yuan, calculated according to the workers' cost of living index, and then increased by 20 yuan each year. Upon completion of the internship, the salary will be paid according to the performance, ranging from 175 yuan to 250 yuan. However, the company is not responsible for signing contracts with interns. They can be dismissed at any time during the internship period, and continued employment is not guaranteed after the period expires. The company's aspect is purely an obligation training nature, and the annual cost will reach tens of millions of yuan.

### Responding to Readers: Legal Questions

(1) Inheritance Tax

Chen Shumin asked: After my friend Xu's father passed away last year, his brothers divided the inheritance, but the land part was not transferred at that time. It was not until April of this year that they started to go through the transfer procedures. May I ask: (1) For the industry inherited one year before the implementation of the inheritance tax, do I need to retroactively levy taxes? (2) Does the ownership of property take effect from the date the contract is established, or from the date the registration and transfer procedures are completed?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied] (1) No retroactive payment is required. (2) The transfer of property ownership of real estate takes effect upon registration.

(2) Using Two Names Simultaneously

Zhou Xiaoping asked: My friend Zhang Yunqing, 43 years old this year, was born seven years before the Republic of China. At that time, due to local customs, his father inherited his maternal grandfather and changed his name to Chen Defu. Therefore, one person has two names, which are used interchangeably. Now I have several questions and ask for your legal instructions. (1) The current law has restrictions on using two names. This is a fait accompli before the era. Is it necessary to make corrections?

(3) Apprentice Complaint

A reader asked: I was introduced by a friend to a small department store in the spring of the 33rd year to serve as an apprentice. It has been two years and six months since then. Due to the hardship of life, I am no different from a cow or a horse. If this continues, I have no hope for the future. Therefore, I am unwilling to do this meaningless work anymore. I plan to work elsewhere and implement work-study. Now I want to leave the store, but the boss has repeatedly obstructed me, using the excuse that I have not yet completed my apprenticeship. Now I have several questions: (1) Is the boss guilty of abusing the apprentice for no reason? (2) If I leave without saying goodbye because I can't bear it anymore, is it legal? (3) Is it reasonable to resign before completing the apprenticeship? (4) Should I compensate for food expenses when resigning? (5) Is the three-year apprenticeship system applicable today?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied] (1) Crimes are determined according to the consequences of abuse; (2) The contract should be terminated according to the law; (3) You may not resign before termination; (4) You should compensate for food expenses if you resign for no reason; (5) This is a social issue.

### All Crew Members of Huaqiang Wheel Show Great Benevolence in Saving the Poor

Maintaining Sovereignty and Demonstrating Patriotism During the War of Resistance

[Our Report] Yesterday, we received 120,000 yuan in legal tender from Mr. Zhu Fanseng of the Jianghai Customs, which was donated by more than 50 crew members of the Huaqiang Wheel from their frugality to the Qingxia Elderly Orphan and Poor Relief Fund sponsored by this column. According to Mr. Zhu, the ship was originally owned by the Huasheng Shipping Company in this city. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in the 26th year, it changed to flying the Dutch flag and continued to sail on the North and South Pacific routes. On December 8, the 30th year of the Republic of China, when the Pacific War broke out, the ship happened to be chartered to a foreign merchant in Japan to load coal. After hearing the news, all the crew members sailed the ship away from Japan overnight. The two Japanese guards on board were also monitored. They experienced all kinds of difficulties along the way. They were intercepted by Japanese ships, but they were able to turn danger into safety and sailed to Seattle, USA. At that time, the Dutch shipowner of the ship tried to take advantage of the opportunity to seize the ship for himself. After being opposed by all the crew members, the ship was requisitioned by the US military. After Japan surrendered last year, the ship returned to the country and resumed commercial use to serve the people. The entire crew of the ship is not only chivalrous and admirable, but also made great contributions to maintaining national sovereignty. They are truly the light of Chinese seafarers.

### Implementation of Rayon Allocation Measures Starting Today; Reconstruction Textile Company to Re-Allocate Today; Black Market Declines, Speculators Face Doom

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau, acting on behalf of the Government Materials and Property Committee, has drafted eleven articles on rayon allocation measures and submitted them to the Bureau Director for approval and implementation. Rayon allocation will commence today, according to these measures. The full text of the articles is as follows:

(1) The Committee will allocate rayon based on the following priority order, according to supply and demand quantities: (A) Manufacturers for whom rayon is the primary raw material; (B) Manufacturers for whom rayon is an auxiliary raw material; (C) Rayon traders.

(2) Manufacturers applying for rayon allocation must first fill out a registration form with their machinery and equipment, product types, quantities, and current monthly rayon yarn count requirements. This form should be compiled by the respective trade association and submitted to the Committee for allocation approval, followed by periodic allocation.

(3) Traders applying for rayon allocation must fill out a registration form with their business name establishment date, sales location, and sales quantity. This form should be compiled by the trade association and submitted to the Committee for allocation approval, followed by periodic allocation.

(4) All manufacturers and businesses applying for rayon allocation, after the Committee approves their monthly allocation quantity, may purchase the approved quantity in installments or at once, limited to the approved quantity and at the price on the purchase date. If the actual purchase quantity for the month is less than the approved quantity, the remaining amount cannot be carried over to the next month for purchase.

(5) The Committee will allocate rayon provisionally twice a week. Applying manufacturers must fill out a detailed purchase order on the designated application day and submit it to the Committee. After verifying the seal and approving the allocation quantity, the Committee will issue a purchase permit.

(6) Manufacturers purchasing rayon must pay at the Trust Department of the Bureau on the day following the approval of the allocation, based on the purchase permit. On the day following payment, they can exchange the receipt for a bill of lading at the Committee.

(7) All manufacturers purchasing rayon must pick up the goods within seven days from the date the Committee issues the bill of lading. Overdue goods may be re-allocated by the Committee, and the user will be suspended from allocation for one month's worth of demand.

(8) Any user approved for allocation by the Committee who fails to pay according to the prescribed date will be suspended from allocation for one month's worth of demand.

(9) The Committee will post the price of rayon allocation on a public notice board each time an application is made.

(10) If a manufacturer purchasing rayon resells it for profit, their purchase eligibility will be revoked once discovered.

(11) These measures will be implemented upon approval by the Bureau Director.

Furthermore, after the Central Trust Bureau determined to allocate rayon today, the silk weaving factory owners of this city decided to bring their seals to their trade association before 10 a.m. today to register the amount of rayon needed for the first period to facilitate the association's compilation and application to the Central Trust Bureau for allocation. It is heard that the Central Trust Bureau will temporarily allocate one-quarter of the monthly actual demand registered by each factory before sending staff to re-examine the registration forms submitted by each factory. In addition, the Hangzhou silk weaving industry's request to register for rayon allocation has also been approved by the Central Trust Bureau. The Central Trust Bureau has agreed to allocate 400 boxes first and hand them over to the Hangzhou branch of the Bureau for allocation.

At the request of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, the China Textile Construction Company will re-allocate a batch of rayon today, approximately 300 boxes.

Yesterday, the black market price of rayon had reached the end of its rope. The No. 120 flyover [location reference] had a light that was 100,000 yuan weaker than the previous day, and only one or two boxes were traded. Some speculators planned to hoard and monopolize semi-gloss goods, but real sellers remained calm and did not panic. This plan ultimately failed, so the price of semi-gloss goods also followed suit yesterday and decreased slightly. Due to the scarcity of goods on the market, factory merchants saw a slightly more active transaction yesterday, with each stall up about 50,000 yuan. Silk goods remained stable. Because of the scarcity of goods, Huajin crepe's price showed a slight profit, trading at 3,400 yuan yesterday.

### Gold Price Falls Back 10,000; Demand for US Dollars Gradually Weakens

Yesterday, smelted gold was stable with little change, opening at 2.21 million. Resistance was met starting at 2.215 million, with long positions being liquidated one after another, leading to a slight decline. However, there was quite a struggle at the 2.2 million mark. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at a price of 2.195 million, but there was still no special movement. Credit remained tight, and the price once dropped to 2.19 million before noon. It stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, forward contracts rose slightly, rebounding to around 2.205 million. As a result, the closing price was 10,000 lower than the previous day. There were no changes in jewelry gold and refined silver. Silver dollars were also flat. The off-book interest rate initially stabilized and then tightened, with interest rates still ranging from 15% to 18% per month.

Foreign currencies were suppressed by news of the Legislative Yuan's resolution to buy foreign currencies, and demand decreased slightly. Yesterday, the retail market for US dollars was still buying at 3,500 yuan and selling at 3,530 yuan, but there were no transactions. It was reported that asking prices were slightly lower in the gray market, retreating from outside 4,200 yuan to around 4,150 yuan, slightly lower than the previous closing. Affected by the continued rise in Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraphic transfer forward contracts, Hong Kong dollars retreated from 920 yuan to below 880 yuan before stabilizing slightly at the end. As a result, it also fell by ten yuan, with Hong Kong telegraphic transfer at around 890 yuan, Indian remittances at 1,090 to 1,110 yuan, British remittances at around 14,200 yuan, and US exchange rates unchanged. Matching transactions remained quiet.

### Government Bonds Rise and Fall Sharply

Yesterday, the supply and demand of government bonds were again balanced. A major account holder on the seventh floor sold bonds on behalf of a money shop, while a bank accounted for 4 million yuan of transactions. The rise and fall were very narrow, merely fluctuating. Unified Class C bonds opened at 1,930 yuan in the morning, rose to 1,970 yuan, fell back to 1,860 yuan midway, and then stabilized, resulting in a gain of 20 yuan for Class A and B bonds compared to the previous closing, a small gain of 30 yuan for Class C bonds, and a decline of 50 yuan for Class D bonds. Unified Class E bonds remained flat.

### Financial Inspection Completed, Spot Check Work Begins

After the Ministry of Finance's Currency Department sent personnel to Shanghai to oversee the inspection of the city's financial institutions, the Central Bank closed its original Financial Inspection Office. The evaluation of transactions between the city's banks and the Central Bank has been transferred to the Auditing Office, which is now responsible for overseeing these matters. At the same time, it is said that the special commissioner responsible for the Currency Department has now begun regular spot checks after auditing and re-examining the accounts of over one hundred commercial banks and shops last month.

### On-Site Cotton Inspection

Since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently decided to establish a special cotton inspection office, various preparatory tasks have been launched. The Bureau has now agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to establish cotton inspection offices first in six locations: Shanghai, Shaanxi, Hankou, Hebei, Henan, and Nantong. These offices will be jointly operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau in charge of the administration of each office. Personnel have been dispatched to the aforementioned locations to oversee the preparatory work, and it is expected that the work will officially begin in each location by the middle of next month.

### Asphalt Shows Slight Turnaround

Since the previous week, asphalt has been weakening daily because new supplies are about to arrive, and holders of goods are eager to sell. However, users also have this in mind to wait for the new supplies, so there has been little change. Recently, after a long period of weakness, it has received little attention, and the situation in Jiangbei has calmed down slightly. Commerce is eagerly awaiting recovery, so those coming to Shanghai to purchase goods have been continuous, and the market has seen a turnaround. Selling prices are also not as accommodating as in the previous two weeks. However, because new supplies are approaching, even if there is a good market, it will be very limited. Sales prices in various sectors have been adjusted. The prices are as follows: Kaihe brand asphalt from Shantou is 135,000 yuan, Intsubo brand asphalt is 125,000 yuan, Ryusaki brand asphalt from Shantou is 120,000 yuan, Dokujo brand asphalt is 116,000 yuan, Soren brand asphalt is 112,000 yuan, ordinary Lan oil is 110,000 yuan, high-grade Kei oil is 120,000 yuan, Tsurumachi oil is 112,000 yuan, and ordinary Machi oil is 108,000 yuan.

The taxi trade association has scheduled a meeting in the coming days to adjust prices. It is heard that the fare for every 20 minutes of rental will increase to 6,000 yuan. The current hourly rental fee is 15,000 yuan, so the future hourly fee will be 18,000 yuan.

### Rice Prices Stable; Abundant Soybean Supply; New Raw Peanut Goods Plummet

Rice sales are active but not booming. High-grade japonica rice is fixed but slow-moving, while glazed rice remains sluggish, down 1,000 yuan. However, white rice remains active in sales, continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Registered guest goods amount to more than 10,000 stones in both the North and South markets.

### Sugar Market Declines

Yesterday, the price of medium-grade white sugar in the sugar market loosened due to trading activity by merchants. The association's quoted price for spot No. 20 medium-grade white sugar initially was 136,000 yuan, then 135,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan compared to the previous price.

Currently, Concordia has imported 74 cases of new Wenzhou "Precious Eyebrow" tea at a price of 160,000 yuan per dan [unit of weight], and the market is very stable. Domestic sales of red and green teas, except for fried green tea, are still being stocked by shops on this street, while the rest are quiet.

[Reported by This Newspaper] The newly appointed Chairman of the Textile Enterprise Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Mayor Wu Guozhen, formally took office at the Committee's office on Jiangxi Road at 9:00 AM yesterday. The former Chairman, Shu Yunzhang, Vice Chairman, Li Shengbo, Committee Members Wang Qiyu, Wang Yangxian, Guo Dihuo, Rong Hongyuan, and Department Director Liu Wenteng of the Committee's Business Department, and others, were all there to greet him. After Chairman Wu exchanged pleasantries with the committee members, he immediately proceeded with the handover procedures, but no ceremony was held.

At approximately 10:00 AM, Chairman Wu abruptly left the meeting and went directly back to the Municipal Government to preside over the port reorganization meeting. Before leaving, he instructed that if there were any official matters, please contact him at the Municipal Government at any time.

### Joint Yarn Allocation; Approximately 1,700 Pieces Yesterday

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee opened yarn sales as usual yesterday afternoon, with privately-owned factories selling 981 pieces and the Textile Construction Company selling 717.5 pieces. The allocation prices remained the same. The Textile Construction Company allocated 20-count Lima yarn to the Dyeing and Weaving Association and the Camel Wool Factory, 32-count Blue Phoenix yarn to the Towel, Handkerchief, and Handicraft Association, 42-count Baoguang yarn to the Dyeing Factory, and 60-count Colorful Ball and 32-count Feng yarn to the Knitting Factory.

### Yarn and Cloth Sales Are Sluggish; Market Conditions Are Slightly Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market turned sluggish due to weak sales to customers and apathy among traders. Except for 20-count yarn, which fell back 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, 32-count and finer yarn had risen too much in the previous days, so they fell more than 100,000 yuan. 42-count double-ply yarn was also slow-moving, but it remained firm due to the limited supply.

The cloth market was flat. Fine cloth sales to customers were very scarce due to the lack of colored goods. The buying interest of dyeing factories was also weak, and the situation had not improved. Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 87,500 yuan, and Blue Chicken cloth was quoted at 80,000 yuan. However, Four Gentlemen serge was quoted 1,000 yuan higher, and someone raised the price to buy it, increasing it to 2,500 yuan, but it dropped back to 1,000 yuan by the close.

### Chinese Stocks Still Show No Improvement; Bearish Sentiment Is Strong

Chinese stocks continued on their old path, with high prices unable to sustain themselves and trading becoming even more sluggish. In the early morning, the opening prices of various stocks showed some improvement, and there were continued gains after the opening, but this was short-lived, and they successively declined. As a result, people became pessimistic again. Despite some purchases from banks, the two major sectors succumbed to bearish pressure and were unable to rise. Although there were some small rebounds midway, they were ultimately overwhelmed by selling pressure. Long positions were cut and sold off one after another, causing prices to decline. A temporary pause was reached after 11:40 AM. Near noon, short covering slightly increased, and some arbitrageurs came to buy. The noon close was weak but slightly stable. Compared to the previous close, except for Xinhe, Jinglun, Xinya, China Silk, Huafeng, and Wuhe, which remained flat, all other stocks declined. The market slightly rose in the afternoon, but it was sold off by arbitrageurs, and soon the decline resumed. However, there were many buyers at lower prices, and prices slightly stabilized again near the close. Compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn, Meyer, Lianan, Cement, and Jinglun Company declined only slightly. Datong Underwear and Tongyi each fell by half a percent, while Huafeng, Wuhe, and Heping remained flat. The trading volume was 8.1 million shares in the morning market and only 1.8 million shares in the afternoon market. The over-the-counter stocks were stable only in Zhabei, while the declines in other sectors did not stop.

Foreign stocks continued to be depressed. Except for Yeguang, which remained flat, all other stocks declined again. Smaller stocks were even more sluggish. Compared to the previous close, Yeguang and Navigation remained flat, Yisha and British Union Paper slightly declined, and Yipi and Wheelock Marden fell by about half a percent.

### US to Gradually Lift Price Controls; Rent and Sugar Are the Only Exceptions

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] A senior official of the US Price Administration anticipates that all government price controls will effectively end by or after Christmas. The first to be decontrolled will be food. The first batch will likely include bread, flour, biscuits, macaroni, tea, cocoa, whiskey, and most canned foods and fruits. Items scheduled for later decontrol include household consumer goods such as radios, irons, vacuum cleaners, gas appliances, and water heaters. The last to be decontrolled will be steel and steel products, railroad cars, newsprint, textiles, and similar goods. Most Price Administration officials admit that most price ceilings will be removed within two months, but rent and sugar are important exceptions.

### Industrial Decline; Few Raw Material Orders

A certain raw material importer in this city said that due to delayed lead times and extraordinarily high interest burdens, traders have suffered huge losses in terms of ordering. Since August, there have been no large orders, and at present, there are virtually none. The raw material trade has also been very weak recently. The reason is the decline of domestic industry. The outlet for raw materials lies in factories. When factories shut down, raw material transactions naturally become sluggish. Traders who hold goods, although there are many popular goods, most are bought and sold quickly because they are easier to sell. There are also quite a few unpopular goods. Some unpopular goods have no sales outlets at all, resulting in high storage costs and unbearable interest burdens. Moreover, operating with popular goods is not easy. Often, once sold, it is impossible to replenish the current goods. Therefore, the more real sales decrease, the less the business is done. Therefore, the raw material trade will not be easy to prosper until there is hope for the revival of domestic industry.

### Woolen Fabrics Implicitly Weakening; Affected by South African Goods

The trend of woolen fabrics was mostly firm yesterday, but the prices of most American goods have implicitly weakened because of the impact of the large influx of South African woolen fabrics at the beginning of the week. The total amount of these goods is 6,000 tons, of which floral fabrics account for more than a dozen colors. Large wholesalers in Chessboard Street have successively offered goods for sale, so the prices of goods of equal quality from local factories have been dragged down. However, the prices of British goods have not changed because their quality is different.

### Dextro Firm Specifies Method for Tendering for Pigments

The Dextro Firm Liquidation Office has established specific tender forms for the convenience of organizing the tender purchases of pigments and various chemical raw materials by various manufacturers. Each form can only be used to bid on one group. If a bidder intends to bid on two groups, they must use two forms, and so on. Before purchasing these tender forms from the office, they must first pay the required deposit amount for each group before participating in the tender.

### Printing and Dyeing Factories Are Busy; Orders Reach as Far as November; Serge and Indigo Cloth Are Popular and Selling Well; Still Depends on Whether Raw Materials and Dyes Are Sufficient

[Reported by This Newspaper] After struggling to survive in the shadow of a recession, the printing and dyeing factories in this city have now shown a glimmer of hope. Yesterday, a magnate in the printing and dyeing industry told a reporter: "The recent turnaround in the printing and dyeing industry is purely due to the popularity of printed serge and indigo cloth. The sales of these fabrics are mostly concentrated in this city. Since the wages and allowances of the city's laboring masses have been adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, incomes have generally increased, and purchasing power is also stronger. Now that it is autumn and winter, the sales of fabrics have been smooth. The market prices of various fabrics in Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and other places are similar to those in this city, and there is often a price reversal situation. Therefore, export sales are not as smooth as those in this city. As for the current printing and dyeing industry, profitability depends on whether the raw materials and dyes are sufficient. There are many varieties of dyes, and prices have risen by 100% after the exchange rate adjustment. However, the allocation of goods from Dextro is still insufficient. However, printing is still more profitable than dyeing. Taking printed serge as an example, the base fabric costs 60,000 yuan per bolt, and after printing and dyeing, it can be sold for 100,000 yuan, with a net profit of 10,000 yuan per bolt. Dyeing, for example, using 190 indigo cloth, the raw material used is ordinary medium-grade fine cloth, costing 80,000 yuan per bolt, and after dyeing, it can be sold for 130,000 yuan. However, with indigo dye alone, each bolt already costs more than 25,000 yuan. Therefore, after adding processing fees, interest, and losses, there is no profit to be made. It is now heard that the goods from various large and small printing and dyeing factories in the city are mostly in short supply. The orders for one factory have reached as far as November. However, the common threats to industry today, such as high wages, high interest rates, and miscellaneous taxes, are not exceptions in this industry. These people believe that the most important plan for the printing and dyeing industry at present is to seize the current opportunity to turn the tide, consolidate the foundation as much as possible, expand the scale, and increase production, so that the production costs of each unit can be proportionally reduced, so that the lower the selling price, the smoother the sales, and from this city to foreign ports, expanding to Southeast Asia, then the printing and dyeing industry has an optimistic future."

### Smooth Transportation Between Shanghai and Taiwan

[Reported by This Newspaper] The cargo transportation between Taiwan and Shanghai has been smoother recently. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had two ships, one coming and one going. The Tixi Kanglun arrived in Shanghai from Keelung, transporting 2,600 tons of sugar. The Haiyu sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan, carrying a large amount of 75,690+ bags of fertilizer (each bag weighs 100 pounds), 544 pieces of raw cotton, and 649 boxes of orange powder, all of which are relief supplies. There were also 1,200 bags (large bags) of commercial fertilizer, 450 bags of beans, 2,000 blocks of bean cake, and 438 boxes of piece goods.

### Sales in Northern Jiangsu Are Gradually Picking Up; Paper Has Already Been Purchased

Paper prices have been extremely stable in the past week. Except for glossy paper, which is slightly higher than the previous week's increase of 20% to 30%, there have been no significant changes in other types of paper. It is heard that more merchants from northern Jiangsu are coming to Shanghai to purchase goods, and yesterday (the 15th), the number of bidders increased sharply at the auction of enemy and puppet paper, and sales have gradually improved.

### Rubber Prices Rise by 20%; Three Reasons Cited

The price of rubber finished products in this city has recently risen sharply, increasing by 20% compared to ten days ago. It is understood that the main reasons for this are: (1) The price of yarn and cloth has risen. The black market price has doubled compared to September, and yarn and cloth account for 40% of the raw materials for rubber finished products such as glue balls and shoes. (2) Employee salaries and allowances have increased. (3) Rumors of foreign exchange fluctuations.

### Weak Purchasing Power of the British Pound

[Reuters, London, 15th] The British Chancellor of the Exchequer said in a reply to the House of Commons today that the purchasing power of the British pound on July 1, 1945, was 48% compared to 1914, and on September 1, 1946, it was 49%.

### Warehouse Rents Collected in Foreign Currency

Recently, warehouses in the city have been charging extra handling fees and additional expenses for the delivery of stored goods. The situation is even worse in foreign-owned warehouses, with some insisting on calculating warehouse rents in foreign currency. The Cotton Yarn Association and Flower Association of the Sixth District of this city held a special meeting and requested the authorities to strictly prohibit this practice and ensure that warehouse rents are paid in domestic currency.

### 264,000 Bales of Brazilian Cotton Have Arrived in China

### Situation of National Language Promotion in Taiwan Province

[Additional Report] The National Language Promotion Committee of the Ministry of Education held its second regular meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 16th) at the YMCA in Shanghai. Chairman Wu Jingheng attended and presided over the meeting. Standing committee members Li Jinxi and Wei Jiangong, as well as Director Ying Qianli of the Department of Social Education and Director Wu Yan Yin of the Department of National Education, were also present. First, Standing Committee member Wei reported on the situation of national language promotion in Taiwan, stating briefly: Taiwan compatriots are extremely enthusiastic about learning the national language and place great importance on the standard, even demanding the authentic "flavor" (pronunciation) of Beijing. Students are surprised when teachers' national language is not up to standard, mistakenly thinking that there are several kinds of national language. Currently, the Taiwan National Language Association is designing various methods based on the actual situation, paying particular attention to teacher training to ensure suitability. After the report, the meeting discussed proposals: Regarding teacher training, it was decided to request the Ministry of Education to establish a national language teacher training institute in Beijing to recruit students who can speak standard national language and provide them with several months of training in phonetics and teaching techniques, which will be sent by the Ministry to various provinces and cities to promote the national language.

### Concrete Measures for Promoting the National Language

All normal colleges and normal schools should, in the semester before students graduate, have standard national language personnel dispatched by the Ministry to each school to test students' spoken national language and pronunciation. Those who fail must take remedial classes, and those who still fail after remedial classes will have their diplomas withheld until they pass the remedial exam. Regarding elementary schools, it was decided that students must use standard national pronunciation completely when reading the national language aloud and pay attention to the reading method that is consistent with spoken language. Speaking teaching must be implemented effectively. Regarding the elimination of illiteracy, it was decided that uneducated people should receive literacy education, with the first two months focusing on learning phonetic symbols and literacy, so that they can read phonetic symbol books and newspapers and express their opinions using phonetic symbols. During the discussion, Directors Ying and Wu provided as many concrete suggestions as possible, and the decisions were very practical. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

### Jinda Professor Dismissal Issue Resolved Satisfactorily by Ministry of Education Official; Couple Teaching at the Same School Resolved at the Same Time

The National Jinan University experienced a major uproar due to President Li Shouyong's unwarranted dismissal of returning professors. The Ministry of Education sent an official to Shanghai to handle the matter, which was resolved satisfactorily. The school authorities have admitted that the unwarranted dismissal of professors was a mistake. However, new professors have already been hired, making it difficult to advance or retreat. As for the dismissed professors, most have received offers from other universities or colleges. The reason they have been insisting on the matter is that the school authorities' actions are unreasonable, and they must argue on principle to protect the rights and interests of the professors. Therefore, after mediation by Tong Dakun, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, the matter was settled. The aftermath measures have been agreed upon by both sides: (1) The school authorities will rehire five professors. The professor representatives will first submit a list of twelve names, and then the school authorities will select and hire them according to the needs of each department. Currently, Ye Zuozhou and Ke Pengzhou have been hired as professors in the School of Commerce. Huang Yuanfang has been hired as a professor in the School of Science. Wang Zhiheng has been hired as a professor in the School of Literature. Chen Wenbin has been hired as a professor in the School of Law.

Professor Shen Lianzhi to be Invited Back to the School

(2) All the professors who were hired by Yingshi University before, with Shen Lianzhi as the dean of the School of Literature, and later transferred to the position of dean of academic affairs, and even acting president, are still being hired this semester, which is very dissatisfied. They firmly demand that Shen be invited back to teach at the school. However, the school authorities and the Ministry of Education supervisor believe that Shen is currently the dean of academic affairs at National Yingshi University, and it is difficult for him to leave Zhejiang. Therefore, they plan to first seek the opinion of the Yingshi University authorities in Zhejiang. If they agree, they will continue to hire him. (3) The school authorities have agreed to pay compensation to the dismissed professors. Those who came to Shanghai with the school and were dismissed will receive an amount equal to four months of salary, and those who did not come to Shanghai with the school will receive an amount equal to two months of salary, both calculated according to the standards of July this year. Most of the professors have left Shanghai one after another to teach at other schools. In addition, all the dismissed professors express their gratitude to the colleagues from various newspapers and news agencies in this city for speaking up for justice and calling for attention, which enabled the government to pay attention and resolve the matter satisfactorily. They have sent letters to express their thanks.

Mrs. Wang Xiunan to Take on a New Position

[Additional Report] The dismissal of Professor Wang Xiunan's wife by Li Shouyong, President of National Jinan University, on the grounds that couples cannot serve in the same school, has also attracted attention, just like the unwarranted dismissal of returning professors. After the case occurred, Wang telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education for instructions, but he himself predicted that the Ministry of Education authorities would be difficult to answer. When the Ministry of Education supervisor came to the school to mediate the dismissal of professors this time, he stated that although the Ministry of Education did not have regulations on this, there were still schools with such special precedents and mediated from the middle. The reporter met Professor Wang Xiunan yesterday, who said: "Regarding whether couples can serve in the same school, the Ministry of Education has not yet issued instructions. However, my wife's matter has been resolved at the same time as the other forty-odd professors who were not rehired. I will still be the professor at Jinan University. My wife will change to an associate professor at the National Youyi Kindergarten Normal College."

### The Case of Li Rui and the 50,000 Piculs of Military Grain

— Changsha Dispatch, September 23rd, by Huang Chao-ru

There, upon leaving office, accused of corruption, the trial is not yet concluded;

Here, taking over the position, acting suspiciously, many problems arise.

This year, the most sensational news in Changsha, besides the lawsuit against the outgoing Director of Finance and concurrently Director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, Hu Mai, for corruption, is the "Case of Li Rui and the 50,000 Piculs of Military Grain." Currently, Hu Mai's corruption case is still under trial. The current Director of Finance and concurrently Director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, Li Rui, is the one who took over Hu Mai's seat. Logically, with the example of the past, even with Hu Mai's meticulousness, he still inevitably ended up in jail, facing imprisonment. One would think he should do a good job, but unexpectedly, another sensational "50,000 Piculs of Military Grain" case has occurred.

Senators Raise Questions, Land and Grain Office Releases News

This case was brought up by the Provincial Senate for questioning. After several twists and turns, although it has not yet reached the stage of confirming that the Land and Grain Office has committed any fraud, the facts are already clearly laid out, and there is no way to cover them up.

The process of this case is roughly as follows: After the Provincial Land and Grain Office ordered the cessation of grain purchases from various counties at the end of June this year, from July to September, more than 70,000 bags of grain were needed, equivalent to more than 190,000 piculs of grain, which needed to be purchased separately for allocation. Furthermore, before the end of May, there was a widespread grain shortage in various counties, making it difficult to collect the allocated grain, resulting in an accumulation of more than 80,000 bags of military grain in arrears. Additionally, in accordance with the telegram from the Chief of the General Staff, 11,000 large bags of garrison grain were to be raised in Changsha and other places. In order to pre-arrange the grain source so that the military grain could be supplied continuously, without interruption, in addition to expediting the transport of grain from Jiangxi for replenishment, a portion was also purchased. It was entrusted to the Central Plains Company, a Republic of China university student management office, each to purchase 10,000 piculs of grain, and the Hunan Supply Bureau was entrusted to issue 30,000 piculs of grain in lieu of payment to the troops (if physical grain was needed, the bureau would purchase it on its behalf). The above totaled 50,000 piculs. The total grain was priced at 13,500 yuan per picul, according to the price approved by the central government, with the delivery location in Changsha.

On the surface, there is nothing wrong with the above situation. What is especially trustworthy is that at that time, the price of rice in Changsha was higher than the price of the purchased grain. Who could deny that our Director Li attached importance to public funds, ensuring that the public did not suffer losses? However, upon closer examination, the matter is quite different, and there are still many suspicious points.

After this matter was brought up for questioning by the Provincial Senate, the Land and Grain Office, in addition to replying to the Senate, also issued a long press release explaining the process of ordering grain, with the emphasis still being that the price of the ordered grain was lower than the price of rice in Changsha at the time, to demonstrate that there was no wrongdoing and the painstaking effort to save public funds.

Dissatisfied with the Reply, A Second Inquiry is Proposed

Subsequently, the Provincial Senate did not consider the "reply satisfactory." At the 20th meeting of the resident committee, a second inquiry was proposed:

"First, regarding the grain price issue, the grain price mentioned in the document is the market price in Changsha, but the grain purchase location is actually in the grain-producing area around the lake. What was the actual grain price around the lake from the time of the contract to the time of delivery?

Second, was all the purchased grain transported to Changsha for delivery? If it was indeed all transported to Changsha for delivery, what were the required transportation costs?

Third, when the contract for purchasing grain was signed, the autumn harvest was approaching. Grain prices were expected to fall. Did the grain administration authorities pay attention to this fact?

Fourth, the Central Plains Company, the Republic of China University, and the Hunan Supply Bureau are not grain merchants. Since they did not go through bidding procedures, nor were they specially designated by the Ministry of Grain, why were they exclusively entrusted with purchasing on behalf of the authorities?"

Speaking from conscience, these four questions raised by the Provincial Senate are not deliberately making trouble or intentionally finding fault; they are the doubts of common sense that everyone shares. The most important key point in these four questions is, "When the contract for purchasing grain was signed, the autumn harvest was approaching. Grain prices were expected to fall..." As the Director of the Land and Grain Office, in charge of the grain administration of a province, did he not have this much observational ability? It was clear that grain prices would fall sharply in another ten or fifteen days, but the Land and Grain Office insisted on seizing these ten or fifteen days to entrust non-grain merchants to purchase on its behalf, resulting in a loss of more than 5,000 yuan per picul (in early September, the price of grain in Changsha fell to 8,000 or 9,000 yuan per picul, and the price of rice around the lake was even lower). What kind of medicine is Director Li selling in his gourd? A discerning person can guess a thing or two without detailed investigation.

It goes without saying that the "50,000 Piculs of Military Grain" case has attracted attention, but the most puzzling thing is that while Hu Mai's corruption case is still under trial, this Director Li, sitting in Hu Mai's seat, openly dares to do such sneaky deeds, which cannot help but make people admire his boldness.

Every day, bandits are executed by firing squad, and every day, robberies occur. Are these people really unafraid of the law? Being driven by livelihood is still excusable! While corruption is being punished on one side, corrupt practices are being carried out on the other side. How can this be justified? In this "50,000 Piculs of Military Grain" case, whether Director Li has any improper intentions is being closely watched by all parties, and perhaps the truth will come to light soon.

### A Glimpse of Changsha

— Changsha Dispatch, 5th, by our correspondent Gao Yuan-li

The heat has passed, autumn is coming, and the leaves are falling from yellow to withered. Various social phenomena are also like this. Several notable corruption allegations have been exposed one after another, following several meetings. They are truly like autumn leaves, withering and falling in the wind, with nowhere to hide.

Li Rui's Military Grain Issue Creates a Great Stir

The most intense and attention-grabbing issue in Changsha is still the grain case. The Provincial Senate held a meeting for this case, inviting senators stationed in the province to hold a discussion with the Director of the Land and Grain Office, Li Rui, and the Director of the Supply Bureau, Zhou He-ting, to explain the situation. However, more than a month has passed, and there is still no concrete solution, and it will probably end without resolution. The whole case is as follows: In July, when the autumn harvest was approaching, the Provincial Land and Grain Office, in order to compensate for the military's grain arrears, entrusted the Central Plains Company, the Production and Management Office of the Republic of China University, and the Hunan Supply Bureau to purchase 50,000 piculs of military grain at a legal price of 13,500 yuan per picul. The Central Plains Company and the Republic of China University each undertook to purchase 10,000 piculs, and the Supply Bureau undertook to purchase 30,000 piculs. In fact, at that time, because the autumn harvest was approaching, grain prices fell sharply, and the market price in Changsha was no more than 6,800 yuan per picul, resulting in huge losses to the public for no reason. The senators were greatly alarmed. When convening a discussion meeting with senators stationed in the province, they fiercely criticized Li Rui, the concurrent Director of the Land and Grain Office, believing that these three institutions were not grain merchants and were using their positions to compete with the people for profit. The person in charge of the Central Plains Company was Senator Chen Yun-zhang, and the Production and Management Office of the Republic of China University was headed by Lu Dang-ping, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. Moreover, the matter was not approved by the Military Grain Procurement Committee in advance, nor was the public informed, nor was it subjected to a voting procedure. The measures were improper, and they should be held administratively responsible. When answering the senators' questions, Li Rui repeatedly stated that Chen Yun-zhang and others had been pestering him for a long time, and he could not get rid of them, so he had to allow them to undertake the purchase of 10,000 piculs. At that time, Senator Chen Yun-zhang went to Shanghai for business, so his response was not heard at the meeting. As for Lu Dang-ping, he sent a private letter to Speaker Zhao Yan-wu, explaining the difficulties of running the Republic of China University, saying that during the War of Resistance, the university moved four times and suffered heavy losses. After the victory, it was difficult to resume operations, so they had to become self-reliant and seek small profits to supplement the school's expenses. This purchase of military grain was definitely not for personal gain. (According to reports, the Production and Management Office of the Republic of China University has a machine sawmill and a rice mill in Changsha.) In the end, the plenary session decided that the provincial government should be responsible for compensating for the losses, and if the purchasers had any illegal profits, they should also be recovered. This matter came to an end from the perspective of the Provincial Senate, but when the Changsha County Senate held a meeting, the old case was brought up again, and a telegram was sent to the Provincial Senate requesting that personnel be dispatched to thoroughly investigate the matter, and that the Supervisory Yuan be requested to punish both the giver and the receiver according to law, and a telegram was sent to the senates of various counties and cities to respond in unison, so the case has the potential to expand.

The Provincial Congress Results in Clichés

After the Second Administrative Conference of the Changsha-Nanyue District convened by the Hunan Provincial Government ended, the Fifth Hunan Provincial Congress of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters was held in Changsha. The results of the meeting can be said to be clichés, all about proposals for improving party affairs, politics, and the economy, a grand spectacle. The most eye-catching was the election of executive and supervisory committee members. Many people participated in the election, including leaders from all walks of life. Ou Bing-kun, the chairman of the Hengyang City Chamber of Commerce, also came to Changsha specifically to participate in the election. The Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Changsha City Chamber of Commerce provided strong support for him. Their reason was based on vocational groups, believing that the business community should have someone participate in the work of the party. On the day before the election, the City Chamber of Commerce hosted a gathering of all the delegates and the election supervisor, Lai Lian, at the YMCA. Most of the delegates expressed their approval at the meeting, but in the end, Ou Bing-kun was still defeated. According to sources, Ou's election campaign started too late, which was probably one of the reasons.

The Farewell Words of the Investigation Team: Regret for Not Having a Supreme Sword

Around the time of the Fifth National Congress, the Enemy and Puppet Materials Receiving and Investigation Team, led by Mr. Qiu Yi-shan, came to Changsha to work. The materials received in Changsha were mostly from the enemy and less from the puppets. However, the materials received from the enemy were in the hands of the military, specifically the Fourth War Area at the time. The area had already left Hunan and been transferred away. Only Shen Da-ke, the representative of the former Wartime Transportation Bureau, who received the vehicles from the Fourth War Area, could be found. According to Shen's report, all the vehicles he received were already damaged, but the original inventory list could not be found. When a telegram was sent to Wang Yao-wu, the former commander of the Fourth War Area, to inquire, no leads could be found either. However, the results of the investigation proved that Shen did have some "problems." The total number of vehicles originally handed over by the enemy was fifty or sixty, and at least half of them were in good condition, but according to the reports of the various vehicle distribution agencies, they had not received a single fully functional vehicle, which was a strange thing. The investigation team did not stay in Changsha for long, only transferring Shen's case to the local court for investigation. The local court has investigated several times, and it is said that more than a hundred people are involved. The date of filing a public prosecution is still far away. Regarding other investigation cases, the investigation team did not make any announcements. Mr. Qiu Yi-shan said to people temporarily, "It's a pity that we don't have a supreme sword." The implication is naturally that there are some concerns.

50 Million in Pensions, A Cause for Both Tears and Laughter

The case of Huang Li-shuang, Director of the Hunan Postal Administration, and Liu Si-cheng, Director of the Hunan Branch of the Pension Committee, being impeached, also caused a sensation in Changsha. The Pension Committee sent 50 million yuan in pensions to the Hunan Branch, but the Hunan Branch was unaware of this for several months. When the post office received the remittance, it was listed under the category of negotiated loans. Both parties muddled through for several months. The administrative efficiency was so low that it was a cause for both tears and laughter. This case is also under investigation by the local procuratorate.

### A Record of Gold Panning in the Jiufen Gold Mining Area

— Taipei Airmail Dispatch, 3rd, by our correspondent Jiang Mu-yun

Government employees who come to Taiwan are often wished "good luck in panning for gold." This expression contains a degree of commercial irony. In reality, the island of Taiwan is indeed a "golden country."

Geologists and industrial researchers say that the gold content of this province is quite high. The mines with mining value include Jiufen and Ruifang in the north, as well as Baojinpu in Keelung, the Xiuguluan River basin in Hualien Port, and Fenglin Ruishui Village, Xinxing Port in Taitung, and other places. In particular, the Jiufen mine produces gold, silver, copper, and iron sulfide. The mining area covers 18,325,594 square feet. If refining is completed, it can produce a total of 500 catties of gold per year, equivalent to 800 large bars.

The reporter ventured into the mining area under the summer heat a few days ago. The reporter did not intend to pan for gold, but attempted to conduct an on-site investigation in one day. In Taiwan, people also like to use gold as ornaments. They even have a saying: "As long as there is gold to be had, even life is disregarded." However, another saying negates this: "The mouth of Keelung harbor has stone sailboats; no matter how much gold you earn, you will not benefit." This explains that the gold miners are not the owners of the wealth, but the institution that controls the gold panning is the owner of the gold. The customs and people of the island are the same as those in the mainland. And now, the words floating on the lips of government employees in the mainland are: "The water in Keelung is salty, the water in the Yangtze River is sweet." They all want to buy a boat and return home.

(1) Going to the Mining Area

To get to the Jiufen mining area, there is only one road perched on the top of Sandiaoling. This road enters the mountains as soon as it leaves Keelung City. The car body revolves in the valley. This is the coal mining area. Hundreds of thousands of tons of second-class coal are piled up at the pit entrance, and some of it is still self-combusting in the rain. The fare for the bus from Keelung to Jiufen was originally only a few cents, but now it has risen to thirty yuan. This amount is alarming to the locals. The first large station is Ruifang, which is halfway to the mining area. Because it is close to Nuannuan, which is famous for its rainfall all over the world, the weather was clear in Keelung, but it was raining heavily in Ruifang. The weather and geography are obviously different from the plains. In the section of the road that the reporter passed from Ruifang to Jiufen, the body was like squatting in a violently vibrating airplane, the head was a little dizzy, and the reporter was floating. Looking down outside the window, the peaks were no longer visible, and there was only a road passing over the green hillside, drawing a meandering curve like a sheep intestine. The vast face of the Pacific Ocean was far away, and the boundary between the horizon and the sea waves could not be distinguished. After two hours, we stopped on a hillside built with cement. The driver wiped his sweat and said happily that we had reached the destination.

(2) Bird's-eye View of the Slope

Following the cement stone steps, we walked up the mountain. On both sides were neat, purely Japanese-style wooden bungalows. There was a silence. The person leading the reporter on the tour said that this place used to be full of Japanese technicians. They have all been sent back to their country in the spring. Because there is no one to take over, they are still vacant. We took a bird's-eye view on a slope on the top of the mountain and could clearly see the undulating houses, temples, elementary schools, and destroyed refineries built along the mountain. Iron water pipes are connected along the road. The ones used by the people are now changed to temporary measures with bamboo poles that follow the water. Taking a short rest in this desolate mountain village, I felt a bit of pressure on my heart. The hard-working spirit of the Japanese is admired, but they are willing to work in this coastal wilderness and never tire of it, even though they are aggressive and exploitative.

The reporter walked with his back bent on the path, heading towards the mountainside. A group of unkempt and wild workers walked towards us, casting strange glances at us. We looked him up and down: a set of ragged clothes covered in yellow mud, a pale complexion, skin lacking nutrition, long black beard setting off black eyes, his face was pitiful but also terrifying. His only tools were an iron pick, a hammer, and a carbide lamp. But he revealed a kind tone to us and said that it would take about twenty minutes to get to the mining area, but you can dig for gold on the whole mountain, the fear is that there may not be any. We looked down and saw three or five people in the canyon of yellow sand dunes, holding large sieves, pouring mud into them, and pouring it onto the ground after sieving. Looking ahead, two workers were sitting on stones resting, and another was squatting by the stream, using an iron spoon to mix the yellow sand with water, and then grinding the sand with a small iron hammer, once, twice, countless times. In the end, he said softly to his companion, "Nothing." When we asked him how many workers there were here, he almost revealed his miserable situation: "There is no other business to do, so I have to come to the mountains to pan for gold, but there is no way, and I really cannot have great hope. The government has come to inspect this place. When will work start, I don't know when. Now everyone is doing their own thing, but most of the gold they pan cannot support themselves!"

(3) The Pit Entrance Has Collapsed

The reporter tried his best to climb towards the top of the mountain, because the road was made of rubble and had not been repaired for many years, it was not easy to walk. With great difficulty, he climbed to a place with two or three houses. The houses were covered with reeds, only one side was sheltered from the wind. One was selling snacks and tea, one was a "rest room" where a few workers were lying down, and there were several workers panning for sand gold in one of the rooms. Three men leaned on wooden sticks and used their feet to grind the sand back and forth in the iron trough. After this procedure, the sand was moved into a roughly made wooden trough like a large duckbill. Skilled workers deftly tossed the wooden trough with both hands, and of course water was added at this time, and the yellow floating mud was thrown away again and again, leaving a layer of light blue or gray sediment; then, the gold content was selected by manual analysis. This primitive manual gold panning method forces some coolies to work day and night in order to live, and at the same time makes the wealthy in the free gold digging business richer and the poor poorer. This place is completely like an unexplored virgin land. As long as there is capital, you can recruit workers on a small scale to dig in the mountains. It is said that there used to be hundreds of them, but now there are few left! Standing above is the mountain peak that has been eroded of its youthful years. A worker pointed and told us that this is the main peak. Like here, people are helplessly searching for the dream of gold. After a while, he turned to us again and said, "Look, the back is the former pit entrance. The Japanese used to repair it at any time, but now it has collapsed!" Then he said sadly, "The whole mountain has been dug with dozens of deep pits. People are afraid that one day a great tragedy of collapse will occur!"

(4) How to Pan for Gold

This place was originally the Jiufen Mine of the Japanese Mining Co., Ltd. It is now under the jurisdiction of the Taiwan Copper Mine Preparation Office of the Resources Committee. According to the person in charge, the mine was in its heyday from the 10th to the 13th year of the Republic (1921-1924), and the highest production volume in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) was sent to the Saga 関 Refinery in Japan, which smelted 2,603 kilograms and 6,954 metric tons of copper. The gold mine stopped working in March of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), and could produce 215 tons per year. The copper mine was also shut down in March of last year. The office is currently actively repairing the mining tunnels and mineral processing equipment, and collecting mine water precipitation. Several plans have been drawn up, but due to lack of funds, it is now planned to start small-scale gold ore mining and mineral separation and copper production from precipitated mine water. In addition to the current sorting and repair of mining equipment, the new smelter and by-product sulfuric acid plant will have to wait for cooperation with the Canadian Novanda Copper Company and successful business negotiations before it can be realized. The company is currently sending experts to the mine for inspection. However, he frankly told the reporter that after years of mining by the Japanese, most of the rich mines have been dug up, and the current reserves are only enough to meet our country's consumption for a few years. The mine is large in scale, and the mine has a mineral processing plant and cyanide plant equipment that can process 2,500 metric tons of ore per day, but it has been in disrepair for many years and cannot be produced without large-scale repairs for about a year.

There are 900 miners inside and outside the mine. They have hospitals and cinemas, and thousands of people live directly and indirectly on them, which is incomparable to the peak period when tens of thousands of workers were employed, so the severity of the unemployment problem has forced them to spontaneously dig for sand gold!

Do you want to come to Taiwan to "pan for gold"? The island has a lot of gold, and it is said that the production area in the aboriginal area of Hualien Port is even more abundant, but no one can muster the courage to come. The gold that the Japanese dug in Taiwan was sent to Japan for refining. Japan never regarded Taiwan as a purely industrialized zone, and fully produced its products through the means of production. Therefore, to complete this high degree of industrialization, it is necessary to allocate the largest amount of capital and technology, but this is at least impossible in the short term. After staying in the mining area for an hour, when I hurried back from Jiufen, the reporter's confidence was strengthened.

### Eight-Gui Youths Fear Not Loneliness

— 2nd of the Month, Guilin Airmail News, Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong

As the harsh season begins, one might occasionally, under the solitary lamp of a cool night, softly read a verse from Du Fu's "The Officer at Stone Moat," solemnly recite "Ballad of the War Wagons." It seems as if the suffering eyes of millions from the Middle Ages are once again watching us, the people of today, smiling bleakly, weeping with quiet resentment. As October begins, when the reeds turn white and the swallows and geese disappear, the grain bureaus of every county and city joyfully celebrate their grand opening. The collection of grains, actual goods, and surtaxes begins punctually. The deadline is the end of December for everything to be completed. In normal times, paying grain and taxes is a more mundane task than farming in the eyes of the common people. However, alas, a vast land plagued by drought, floods, wind, and pests has resulted in an unprecedented famine. Grain levies, however, are like sharp arrows piercing the eyes of those still carrying hope. Listen to the two lines of a popular song in northern Guangxi, filled with tears: they sing in low voices, "Having put down the sickle, there's not a grain of rice; the common people are Tang Sanzang's flesh." Where is the Western Paradise for this group of emaciated Tang Sanzangs? This time last year, the terror of hunger and death loomed over the entire province of Guangxi. Helpless tenant farmers, struggling to escape the clutches of death, hardened their hearts and went to "sell the green crops," borrowing just enough money from landlords and ruthless usurers to stay alive. For example, borrowing 20,000 yuan at that time could buy at most a little over 20 jin of rice. But this autumn, they must repay 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, while the price of rice has plummeted to a miserable 20,000 yuan per dan, making those exploited unable to even cry. Over 20 jin of rice must be repaid with two dan of rice! What kind of world is this? Everyone understands that cheap grain hurts farmers, but who can truly understand the pain of "having put down the sickle, there's not a grain of rice"? Moreover, there are still annual grain levies to pay, and failure to pay by the end of the year will result in "officials arresting people at night"? The remission of last year's land tax entirely benefited the landlords. This year, reducing rent by 25% is the focus of Guangxi's administration. The government has attempted to redistribute some of the benefits of the land tax exemption from the landlords to the tenant farmers, while also earnestly carrying out rent reduction work. However, due to the pervasive influence of evil forces and the ignorance of tenant farmers, the rent reduction measures have encountered unprecedented difficulties. Under the high-pressure persecution, tenant farmers remain on the brink of death, heavily exploited for their blood and sweat. Who will truly face this bloody reality, this ugly and ferocious state of affairs! The deep-seated pain of the past two years is a dream in the hearts of the farmers…

Conscription, just like taxation, is the people's supreme duty. Therefore, after the establishment of two military districts throughout the four million-plus dead in eastern, western, southern and northern Guangxi, the conscription work is slowly spreading like a wave in all directions as a result of the one time investigation into the families of the conscripted. After the autumn harvest, the barren years force farmers to busy themselves with planning the winter planting. In their hearts, besides a plow, a rifle faintly appears, vaguely imagining yet another unknown war. Although the conscription quota has not yet been officially announced, judging from the recent situation where the Provincial Security Headquarters was ordered to transfer one-third of the active-duty soldiers (Security Regiments) to Wuhan for training, and the number of officers and members of the 10th Army Officer Training Corps borrowed from various military districts, it is believed that the number will be quite considerable in the future. The Eight-Gui youths, shouldering a rifle, are valiant fighters. It is hoped that the muzzle of this rifle will forever point towards the sky, or at the enemies of the nation.

So many troubles bring people into a helpless world. Here, I tell the dear readers about three unemployed groups in Guilin, and from this desolate corner, we can see the entire current situation of China. Perhaps this will not be a meaningless thing. First, the provincial-level organs are implementing layoffs starting this month. One-third of the civil servants face a dark road ahead. Those who believe they "have a good chance of being laid off" are desperately trying to network and find a way out, but in the end, they are mostly burned out, preparing to sing of returning home. However, those who are cunning and know how to please their superiors have their own tricks. Director ×× received two boxes of mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and when opened, they were full of golden gold. After hearing this, I am really worried that this old man was careless at the time and swallowed the mooncakes whole without even opening them, resulting in a painless death. What a set of officialdom revelations!

This year's graduates of Guangxi University are like the late-harvested rice in their hometown, delayed in their graduation time due to a relocation storm to Wuzhou, suffering a great loss. In a society that is scrambling for jobs, the bachelors of various universities who graduated a month earlier have already gained the upper hand. By the time the graduates of Guangxi University registered and applied to the Ministry of Education, it was already "too late." One letter was from the Ministry of National Defense saying "waiting for assignment," another was from the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office saying "deep regret." They are indeed a little lost. Less than one-tenth of them can be sure of finding a job. Those who studied engineering still have some places to go, but those who studied political economy are crying out in despair. During the graduation ceremony, the representative sent by the provincial government repeatedly expressed the hope that the students would serve their hometowns. But when the students really wanted to serve their hometowns, it was another "registration for selection and waiting for use." What bitter university students! Where does talent come from?

The pampered university students are distressed, and the rickshaw pullers who sell their labor are also distressed. The rickshaws in Guilin have wooden wheels, and walking on the broken roads is like riding in a bullock cart. However, in order to maintain the call for humanity, the authorities have also decided to eliminate these 300-plus bullock carts within a limited time. The rickshaw pullers are red-eyed, shouting, "Get rid of more inhumane things before you get rid of us!" Occasionally, when talking to the rickshaw pullers about this matter, most of them have a sense of "living or dying with their broken carts." Originally, in Chinese society, inhumane things are more than just pulling rickshaws. Welfare work has not been done, but they first boast about benevolence and righteousness. How can people stand it?

The labor problem, when it involved the gateway to eastern Guangxi – Wuzhou, there was a not so small disturbance. There are good and bad ways to sell one's labor. Originally, there was a stevedore group within the Wuzhou Seamen's Union, which was an ugly dark secret.

For the past eight years, they have extorted fees from passing ships for commercial goods, amassing countless wealth. Until September of this year, they became increasingly fierce, even arbitrarily manipulating the cargo transportation of ships traveling between Guangdong and Guangxi. The merchants could no longer tolerate it and collectively petitioned the provincial government, recounting the dark secrets of the stevedore group. As a result, the stevedore group was ordered to disband by the provincial government. Unexpectedly, the workers, incited by dissidents, actually forcibly occupied the docks and intensified their actions, leading to the interruption of shipping between Guangdong and Guangxi for a time. The situation was serious. It was not until recently, after the Guangxi Provincial Government prepared to take active measures, that they scattered like a swarm of bees. This stage was brewing a major seamen's strike, but in the end, everything quietly dissipated again.

The roar of the overnight gale pushed Guilin into the gates of early winter. The midnight cries of the refugees who had survived a hundred calamities can be heard every night. The measures for winter relief are still a mystery, a mystery that I am no longer willing to guess.

Terrible addiction once again adorns this diseased mountain city. Everything is so impoverished. The reporter had a severe addiction that almost cost him his life, but he was fortunate enough to have injections of Pukang Mother Star available and recovered his health. However, some hospitals in northern Guangxi can only break a quinine pill into four pieces and distribute them to four patients, which is both absurd and tragic to talk about.

A few days ago, Chairman Huang returned from Shanghai and, in addition to lamenting that "sesame cakes are more expensive than bread, boiled water is more expensive than kerosene, and tea is more expensive than coffee" in Shanghai, he also compared Guangxi with another province, expressing infinite comfort. Chairman Huang admitted that Guangxi is lonely, but the construction work can still be done by "doing whatever comes to mind." Besides the terrible separation between the central and local governments, there is a bright road ahead. The Eight-Gui youths are not afraid of loneliness, and what the people of Guangxi need is real comfort… (Sent on October 2nd)

### A Glimpse of the Street Stalls

— 11th of the Month, Chongqing Airmail News, Our Correspondent in Chongqing, Wang Boxiang

Crowded and Lively

The street stalls in Chongqing, filling the streets and alleys, are a new business that has emerged since the victory. From the outside, the street stalls in Chongqing are no different from those in other places, but in terms of their development process, the street stalls in Chongqing are "ahead of the curve." Even with the return of various central ministries and commissions to the capital and the return of thousands of residents to their eastern hometowns, this prosperous and splendid capital has been able to maintain its bustling phenomenon for the past year without suddenly becoming deserted, the street stalls have also made a significant contribution.

Chongqing has dance halls, but in terms of the entire population, the big spenders who frequent dance halls every night are still in the extreme minority. There are Beijing opera theaters, Sichuan opera theaters and cinemas, but the number of people they can accommodate is limited, and the ticket prices are too expensive, which is not entirely suitable for the economic situation of ordinary people. Thus, browsing the street stalls has become a form of entertainment for ordinary people, and it has gradually become a habit. Browsing the street stalls does not necessarily mean buying things, but it allows one to enjoy a wide variety of new and old items, which is the most economical and enjoyable experience that formal shops do not allow. Sometimes, standing around a street stall with two or three friends, talking about irrelevant matters or serious business, the stall owner is happy to have people joining in the fun and welcomes them. Spending time like this is naturally a different kind of pleasure than sitting and chatting in a teahouse.

Street Stalls are a Product of Victory

The reporter once attempted to divide the development process of Chongqing's street stalls into three periods. Within these three periods, each has its own operating characteristics and different types of goods. These three periods are: (1) the original period, (2) the transformation period, and (3) the white-hot period. For the sake of convenience, I will explain them in order below:

The first original period, began around the time the news of victory reached the capital, roughly up to the end of the Gregorian calendar year, lasting about four months. Initially, the general non-native people residing in Chongqing, shaken by the sudden arrival of victory, and also due to their overwhelming desire to return home, regardless of whether land and water transportation was difficult, and whether the value of daily necessities in the recovered areas was cheap or expensive, all emptied their chests and boxes, putting all the clothes they could not carry on the street stalls for sale at relatively low prices, so as to avoid regretting abandoning them once they set off. Therefore, the characteristics of this period are: (1) the stall owners are mostly non-native people, mainly the elderly, weak, women, and children, as adults generally do not have time for this, or are busy with official duties; (2) bargaining is particularly polite, and sometimes they sell as soon as you make an offer, first giving people the impression that buying things at the street stalls is indeed cheaper; (3) the items sold are mostly old goods, but because they are usually cherished, they are still beautiful and practical after washing and sorting, so that people do not dislike them; (4) the types of goods range from shoes, socks, hats, books, antiques, porcelain bowls and dishes, to all daily necessities, each street stall more or less showing the family situation, social status, and economic situation of the stall owner.

Used Clothing Store Employees Seize the Opportunity

The second transformation period, came quickly thereafter. Within this period, there were not many non-native people. The reason was not that the non-native people had already left, but that everyone had clearly recognized the difficulty of returning home. On the one hand, they had also heard about the prices in the recovered areas. Secondly, the lunar New Year was approaching, and even if they could leave, it would be next year's matter. As a result, reason prevailed over emotion, and it was better not to sell the daily necessities. However, the cheapness of the street stall goods had already established trust, and people had a good impression of them, so the local people seized the opportunity to take their place. Therefore, the characteristics of this period are: (1) the stall owners are mostly young employees of used clothing stores, who are ordered by the store owners to compete for customers in the streets and alleys with a new attitude; (2) there is no standard for bargaining, and sometimes it is more expensive than the original price. If one is not careful, one will be fooled; (3) the items sold are mainly old goods, and it is difficult to find unused items such as towels and elastic bands, but old clothes such as woolen coats, suits, or Zhongshan suits can be found in dozens of sets on each stall, making it clear at a glance that they are from used clothing stores, rather than from ordinary households. This kind of speculative street stall could not be maintained for long, and by March and April of this year, as goods from other places gradually arrived in Chongqing, it was naturally eliminated.

Smuggled Goods Reach Their Peak

By the time of the white-hot period, the development of the street stalls had reached its peak. In the first two periods, their scope of activity was limited to quiet streets and secluded alleys, but now their influence has spread to all prosperous streets, especially on both sides of Doyou Street and Daliangzi Road. They even go directly to the department stores to pick goods, such as in front of the stores selling cosmetics, where you can often find vendors selling glass, hair combs, elastic bands, and long stockings; in front of the stationery stores, you can often find vendors selling various fountain pens. All the goods are mostly smuggled, and are not subject to taxes and fees, and the expenses are also saved, so the selling price is lower. Under this threat, the general legitimate stores often take two ways to resist. In the passive aspect, they use the discount sales or clearance of various commemorative items to attract customers. In the active aspect, they simply choose some of the goods in the store and order the apprentices to set up street stalls outside the store to implement the occupation of space. Among these two methods, the latter is especially effective, making the general vendors secretly complain, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

"Package Carriers" are Very Active

Therefore, the characteristics of this period are: (1) most of the stall owners are "package carriers", especially those from Hubei, and the rest are apprentices from various stores; (2) almost all the goods sold are American goods smuggled from Shanghai and Hong Kong, mostly stationery, cosmetics, and novelties, and old goods have completely disappeared; (3) all the vendors are gathered in prosperous streets, and back streets and secluded alleys have returned to normal; (4) the mobility has reached its peak, and as soon as patrolling police appear, they can immediately put all the goods in boxes and take them to a quiet place to avoid them temporarily; (5) during this period, all taxes, transportation, city appearance, and order are directly or indirectly affected by them.

Measures to Ban Have Been Stipulated

Due to the various effects caused by the above-mentioned fifth point, the municipal authorities have recently taken necessary measures to ban them, but the general vendors are unwilling to show weakness due to livelihood reasons, and immediately established horizontal organizations to form a street stall association, using the power of the organization to protect their own interests. On the 2nd of this month, many representatives of the association went to the municipal government to petition, raising various demands and asking for protection. On the same day, the 335th municipal meeting of the municipal government decided: "The various street stalls in this city are everywhere, which not only damage the city appearance and hinder transportation, but also affect tax revenue. These street stalls originally belonged to the period of repatriation when people returning home sold old goods. The temporary nature has gradually changed into a place for selling new goods. A time limit should be stipulated, and temporary sites should be allowed for setting up stalls, and strict management should be implemented." It was decided that Chang'an Temple, Daitie Street, and Jiaochangkou are three places where temporary street stalls are allowed, and the time limit is the end of this year. After the expiration, they will be banned.

Street Stall Beauty Has Good Business

Everything will turn to its opposite, and street stalls cannot escape this common rule. I still remember that in front of the Le Lu Chun Restaurant near the Guotai Grand Theater, there was a street stall, and the stall owner was a young woman, very similar to Zhuo Wenjun running a wine shop. Her business was "absolutely great". Those curious went so far as to give her the nickname "Street Stall Beauty". Whenever the sun set and the electric lights were on, most of those standing around the stall did not care about the wine, but just came to feast their eyes on her beauty. Since the departure of the "Beauty of the West", the place has become very deserted. In the future, all street stalls will be banned, and Chongqing streets will probably never be as lively as they are now.

Publishing Industry Published Every Thursday

### The Light of the Publishing Industry

— A Word of Warning

These days, no one is very willing to engage in the publishing business; it is truly thankless and unprofitable. The employees are demanding pay raises, saying that the capitalists are exploiting them. The sales of publications are also not good. If you consider the cost and raise the price, the readers will say that you are destroying culture. If you do not consider the cost, there is no such principle in doing business. In terms of the content of publications, if it is too profound, it will be esoteric and unpopular, and no one will buy it; if it caters to low-level interests too much, people will scold you for being boring and selling savage heads; if you want it to be in-depth and easy to understand, and to write profound theories in popular language, such writers are not easy to come by. In addition, there are many political barriers and restrictions. Good works are not easily allowed to be published and distributed, and bad things, due to certain relationships, have to be published. Who would be willing to do such work?

The day before yesterday, the newspaper carried very good news, saying that Mr. Zhu Jingchen was willing to resign from his position as Vice Minister of Education to take the position of manager of the Commercial Press, and Director Gu of the National Education Department was also resigning from his official position to join the Zhonghua Book Company and engage in the publishing business. We feel that this is a gratifying phenomenon. The publishing industry needs such people with a spirit of sacrifice to work hard. We hope that they will not only be hardworking and dutiful, but also maintain the attitude of educators to run the publishing house, so that the Chinese publishing industry can release a brilliant light and serve as a cornerstone for the revival of China. We want everyone to understand that publishing is a very important job, and its mission is to promote culture. In whatever environment, it should move toward this goal. Engaging in this work requires a group of brave warriors. We are willing for many people to participate in this arduous work. Zhu and Gu have given us a very good example.

### Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy

— Written by Yang Hui and Wang Yanan, Sold by Kaiming Bookstore

In today's world, specialized treatises on the reality of the Chinese economy are rare treasures. Professor Wang Yanan's "Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy" is a most precise and fitting gift to our economic forum – delivering something most needed and desired.

It's no coincidence that a few words Professor Wang mentioned in the preface are exactly what I have been repeatedly saying to friends and seniors these past two years. At National Chiao Tung University, I also teach advanced economics courses. The teaching experience and resulting sentiments are coincidentally similar to those of Professor Wang at Sun Yat-sen University. These are perhaps the thoughts of other professors as well:

"...Based on my usual research, I believe I have greater certainty when lecturing on Ricardo's economic theories than when lecturing on Chinese economic history, but students show far greater excitement about the latter. At the time, I felt that this reason should not be solely attributed to the difficulty of reading and teaching Ricardo's great work, but rather to the question of whether Chinese students of economics, in their capacity as Chinese economic researchers, need to understand such abstract theories, or at least, whether the abstract theories they study can be related to reality, especially Chinese economic reality. Due to this feeling, I felt a great need for reform in the teaching materials and methods adopted in Chinese university lecture halls for economics and all related courses. I wrote this clearly at the time."

Let me briefly introduce this "Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy." It is not just an ordinary work similar to "Principles of Economics." As the author himself says, his purpose is vastly different. Writers of "principles" should take the saying "Everyone has it in their heart, but no one can write it down" as their guiding principle. Professor Wang, in addition to this, has also created outstanding new theories. Here are some of his words: "This book attempts to treat the entire Chinese economy as a unified process or movement permeated by certain basic economic laws. Therefore, the internal causal relationships between various economic forms are what I particularly want to analyze. The final section, or the eighth section, of this book is intended as a conclusion, as the ultimate consequence of the action of all basic laws, but due to insufficient data and the limitations of my personal research ability, I frankly admit that this book is extremely limited and may only be considered the beginning of a scientific and systematic study of the Chinese economy." The following few sentences are the author's humble and polite words, because in this book, I saw for the first time such a detailed dissection of the real Chinese economy. In the past decade, the domestic economy has undergone extremely complex wartime changes, and now it has become an extremely abnormal and chaotic situation. However, Professor Wang has given us the most complete and fundamental understanding and explanation of how the Chinese economy has evolved into this wartime situation (which is a question in the mind of every Chinese person today).

What must be introduced separately is the third chapter of this book, "The Forms of Chinese Currency." Everyone knows that all current Chinese economic problems are centered on currency. The late British economic authority, Sir Keynes, once proclaimed that economic theory can never be separated from monetary theory, and these two things are actually the same. I want to say to everyone who cares about the current Chinese economic crisis and likes to study all current Chinese problems: you must read this book. Please read Professor Wang's fundamental analysis of the most realistic and pressing problems in our current currency situation. It is truly insightful:

"We do not deny that appropriate monetary policies are very helpful to the development and prosperity of the entire economy, but based on our previous analysis, the role of currency has inherent limitations. In an economically developed country, its currency and even finance are linked to industry, and thus, it is possible to use sound financial organizations and appropriate monetary policies to greatly promote and lead the overall economy. However, in a backward economy like ours, our currency and finance are more closely linked to commerce. In the end, when commercial capital activities are extremely rampant, the function of currency and finance to correct this is bound to be limited!..."

The following chapters, "Forms of Chinese Capital," "Forms of Chinese Interest and Profit," "Forms of Chinese Wages," "Forms of Chinese Land Rent," and "Forms of Chinese Economic Panic," all use economic principles to dissect Chinese economic society. The method is to divide the main body of the Chinese economy into its various constituent forms and provide extremely detailed analysis and explanation. Within the limits of viewing economic panic as the inevitable culmination of the entire economic movement, the author, in the final conclusion of the eighth chapter, places those individual economic constituent forms in the whole to give a comprehensive examination. (Note: The title of the fifth section of the original book's eighth chapter is: "The Panic Genes and Their Consequences Manifested Under the Joint Action of General Economic Laws.")

"Our agricultural, underproductive, chronic, and regularized economic panic is produced under the joint action of the various laws embodied in the above-mentioned series of economic movements—small commodity production, commerce turning products into commodities, commerce dominating industry, commercial profit being higher than industrial profit, profit being regulated by interest, various unequal exchanges, capital concentrating in cities and foreign countries, the mutual interaction of various primitive capital forms in rural areas being the circulation of capital between them, labor expelling machinery, and even expelling animal power. Therefore, once the world panic reaches an upward or recovery cycle, we feel at ease that our economy is also entering a good state. This illusion is strengthened by superficial observations, that is, the belief that rent and taxes remain the same or increase. In fact, especially in our society, the increase in rent and taxes is not only a phenomenon that can coexist with the decline in social labor productivity, but it can even be directly regarded as a causal relationship and a phenomenon that must appear simultaneously...."

These are the genes of panic, and the consequences of our chronic and regular panic, as many economists are worried about, will probably become increasingly heavy and difficult to support if this trend continues. Those who superstitiously believe that Chinese economic panic is only the shock wave of the world economic panic should wake up, because to engage in economic reconstruction and take effective measures, the first step must be a sound understanding of the basic situation in the country.

The appendix of this book contains quite valuable information and theories regarding Chinese commercial capital, especially how commercial capital has been searching for its old path and development since the War of Resistance against Japan (after the outbreak of war, all the new objects and fields of commercial activity brought by international capital were successively lost, and at the same time, the limited domestic industry could not provide any significant avenues for commercial activity, so the result was that commerce "repeated its old tune" and regarded land products as its most likely and profitable speculative objects). The book has unique insights and detailed elaborations on the circulation problems of commercial capital and industrial capital. "Political Economy in China" and "The Austrian School of Economics in the Chinese Economic Community" can correct our common misconceptions about the Chinese economy. Based on Professor Wang's own years of experience and research, it can surely enable us to fully achieve the goal of exploring the entirety of the Chinese economic movement after reading this book.

After finishing "Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy" and closing the book, I would like to introduce this book to everyone who is interested in modern Chinese economic society.

### Postscript on "Mass Education"

— Zhu Zaide

Publisher: Zhengzhong Book Company

Editor: Yu Qingtang

Publication Date: March of the Thirty-fourth Year (1945)

First Edition in Shanghai

The eight-year War of Resistance defeated the ambition of the invaders, allowing us to step back onto the path of national rejuvenation and embark on the milestone of nation-building. How gratifying it is that everyone is moving towards the common goal of "building the nation through education!" At this time when the authorities are striving to promote universal education – national education – we cannot ignore mass education. Moreover, about 80% of our country's population is illiterate. Among them, at least 200 million out-of-school youths and adults have not received education. Therefore, children's education and mass education should be advanced simultaneously, with both sides being taken care of and implemented together, in order to seek the common development and growth of universal education and meet the needs of nation-building.

We have widely surveyed Chinese publications, and the number of refined and substantial materials on mass education is still scarce. The author is now introducing Mr. Yu Qingtang, an expert in mass education, whose recent book on mass education published by Zhengzhong is worth reading by every person engaged in national education. The content of this book can be briefly introduced as follows:

The first chapter is an introduction, which first explains the relationship between education and society, and emphasizes the need to recognize the supreme principle that "education is life." For society to progress, the groups within society – the masses – must have the opportunity to receive universal education. Next, it explains the meaning and scope of mass education. Then, it explains how to conduct research on mass education.

The second chapter is on mass education and adult learning. Its intention can be said to be a kind of "psychological construction" for the ability of adults to learn. Based on the physiology and psychology of adults and many experiments by experts, the author points out that the learning ability of adults is not necessarily lower or higher than that of children; but at least it can be recognized that adults are superior to children or that children are not necessarily superior to adults. The traditional view that adults cannot learn or that adults' learning ability is not as good as children can be refuted without being attacked. At the same time, it also points out that the so-called decline in adult learning ability is due to (1) gradual decline in health; (2) weakening of learning interest; (3) scarcity of learning opportunities; (4) fear of ridicule and other reasons. The author instructs us to try to eliminate these unfortunate events, so as to increase the efficiency of adult learning.

The third chapter is on the masses and the social economy. The author first reminds us to recognize that "the focus of mass education is on the people's livelihood, and we should focus on the people's livelihood and start from the people's livelihood to achieve the progress of civil rights and the nation." Then, it explains the Chinese economic background, collects information from various sources, and analyzes its factors: (1) insufficient arable land; (2) the collapse of the rural economy; (3) the decline of national industry. It also cites many examples of the existing contributions of mass education to economic construction and how to achieve the greatest wish.

The fourth and fifth chapters are on the evolution of mass education in China and an overview of adult education in foreign countries. These two chapters can be said to be a discourse on the history of mass education in China and foreign countries, respectively explaining their characteristics, so that we can understand the differences between adult education in our country and adult education in foreign countries, and provide us with reference and lessons when implementing it.

The sixth chapter is a discussion of mass education and the education system. The author points out that in the current Chinese education system, there is only a school system, but no education system; and in the school system, only school education is listed, but not mass education. In the education system, mass education is still excluded from the door, and it is considered necessary to study and reform it. Next, it explains the administrative problems of mass education, and has excellent opinions. The main requirements of this chapter are: (1) the establishment of a new education system; (2) the construction of a new society. The country and the nation need to improve the culture of the vast masses and awaken national consciousness in order to undertake the work of building the country and revitalizing the nation.

The seventh chapter is on mass schools. The author tells us how to run a perfect mass school? It is the most practical and applicable information. (1) How to divide classes; (2) How to allocate courses and teaching materials; (3) How to compile grades; (4) How to teach; (5) How to solve the difficult problems of enrollment and retention; (6) How to implement moral education; (7) How can mass school teachers seek the progress of the school?

The eighth chapter is on mass education centers, respectively explaining their organization, business, and their implementation center institutions (1) mass education experimental zone, (2) mass library, (3) mass gymnasium, listing the undertakings that should be established. It also explains that mass education centers should be linked with other institutions in order to seek the development of their careers; and finally, it explains the necessary qualities of mass education center service personnel and their important responsibilities.

The ninth chapter is on mass education experimental undertakings. This chapter explains that the experimental undertakings of mass education in the future should be based on the actual needs of the local area and should apply scientific principles and methods to experiment. Issues such as rural autonomy, rural construction, and the integration of politics and education are all discussed. The author also introduces the actual situation of the three famous mass education research and experimental institutions in China, respectively explaining their characteristics, which can be used as a powerful reference for our future experimental undertakings.

The tenth chapter is on the purpose and method of mass education, which is the conclusion of this book. The author once said: "The purpose of mass education is high above real life and far in front of people." He also said: "If you want to relieve the people's poverty, the first thing to do is to take care of them and educate them. The ultimate goal of maintenance is to enable people to be self-sufficient. If you want to unite the people of the whole country to pool their wisdom and efforts to take care of each other, then the people must have the necessary knowledge and skills, which cannot be achieved without education, especially without engaging in adult mass education with all our strength... In particular, the leadership of the central government must be promoted to intensify its efforts in order to complete the great cause of the revolution and achieve the full success of revitalizing the nation!" Finally, it also points out many important principles and methods for implementing mass education, which can indeed give us a lot of help and motivation.

The whole book is divided into four major units, divided into ten chapters and thirty-eight sections, with a total of more than 90,000 words. The content is roughly as described above. As for the detailed content, it is still up to the readers to study and experience for themselves. It goes without saying that the biggest shortcoming of this book is that most of the information is pre-war. There is no discussion of the War of Resistance, which is regrettable! I hope the author can revise it in the next edition.

Finally, after reading this book, the author was inspired to make the following urgent demands for mass education at the current stage:

(1) "Ignorance" and "Poverty" - At present, the vast masses of China have a very strong desire for knowledge and hope to solve the pain of "ignorance"; but for the sake of livelihood, for the sake of solving the problem of life (that is, the problem of "poverty"), sometimes they cannot spare time to receive education and have to struggle on the starvation line, thus distracting them from their desire for knowledge. Because reading and acquiring knowledge does not necessarily solve their life problems. There is a saying circulating in the countryside of Pudong: "You can find food without knowing how to read; but you can't find food without knowing how to recognize people." Therefore, mass education in the future must first be able to solve this problem, just as the author reminded us in the third chapter, we must focus on the people's livelihood and start from the people's livelihood. That is to say, we must plan the construction of the entire social economy.

(2) "Selfishness" and "Dispersal" - Observing from all levels of society, we can find that individuals in society are "too selfish" in every event, showing "greed," "hypocrisy," and "luxury," only knowing personal enjoyment and the wealth and pleasure of one's own family. Observing from the groups in society, the groups are "scattered" and "unorganized," so the entire society is shrouded in an atmosphere of chaos. Therefore, mass education in the future should train its service ethics from individuals, and there must be a "greater self" before there can be a "lesser self"; from groups, it should strengthen its group organization, that is, strengthen the organization and training of the masses.

(3) "Disease" and "Weakness" - In every corner of society, there is filth and garbage everywhere; in every family, there is disorder, poverty and disease, forming an unhealthy country and the people are getting weaker day by day, presenting the decadence and lifelessness of the entire China! Therefore, mass education in the future must be able to rescue the "disease" and "weakness" of the Chinese masses, and should strengthen health education, enrich health facilities, and actively promote national sports.

### Several Books on the Study of the Soviet Union

— Hua

The Soviet Union is a world mystery. It is not only Americans who want to understand this mystery. Recently, Americans have written many books on the study of the Soviet Union, which can be used as references.

To study the Soviet Union, one should start with history. Professor George Vernadsky wrote a book for the Yale University Graduate School, A History of Russia. It is not long, but it is very concise. He does not focus on historical facts, but analyzes the Soviet people, Soviet culture, religion, philosophy, and the development of society and politics one by one, so that we can easily understand this seemingly contradictory nation. He does not engage in political theory. In the introduction, he said: "The task of the historian is to write history, not to deduce political or moral aspects. It is all right to agree with or oppose the Soviet political system, but the evaluation of this organization should not be preconceived." This book has been revised once after the Second World War and published by The Home Library.

Soviet Politics: At Home and Abroad, by Fredrick I. Schuman et al., published by Alfred A. Knoff. The author has written many books on international issues, the most famous of which is International Politics. The author has traveled to the Soviet Union and the Balkan Peninsula and is familiar with the Soviet situation. This book explores the truth of Soviet politics and diplomacy behind the scenes of Soviet propaganda policies. It seeks clues from the words and deeds of several Soviet leaders, the provisions of the constitution, and important international declarations, and pays special attention to the causes and consequences of changes in foreign policy. In the eyes of Americans, Soviet diplomacy is indeed a bit mysterious and unpredictable. The author mentions the question of whether the Slavic people can cooperate with Western democracies, and his views are quite accurate and the writing is also very fluent.

David J. Dallin was exiled abroad before the revolution, and later his political views were inconsistent with the authorities, but the books he wrote were fair and had the style of a historian. Russia and Postwar Europe seeks the basic objectives of Soviet foreign policy from the aspects of geography, people, and the course of the revolution, with complete and well-founded arguments. Churchill once regarded Soviet foreign policy as a sealed gourd. This sealed gourd is not easy to break, and it must be explained with reason to understand it. The author wrote this book with a calm mind, with new insights. Published by Yale University Press.

Russia and the Western World, published by The McMillan Company. Written by Max M. Laserson. The author was born in Latvia and graduated from St. Petersburg University. He taught for many years and wrote many books. This book explains the attitude of the Soviet Union towards other countries, especially Western countries, in the past 25 years from another point of view. He believes that this is evolved from political and social aspects. It has little to do with its leaders. The war has had a great impact on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union still needs to have considerable cultural and economic ties with Western countries after the war. The author can calmly answer this difficult question.

Soviet Far Eastern Policy is one of the works of the Institute of Pacific Relations, by Harriet L. Moore et al., describing the relationship between the Soviet Union and various countries in the Far East, especially China and Japan. Most of its materials are collected in the Soviet Union and are rarely seen abroad. The book is appended with diplomatic documents, which is very convenient for reference. The author has paid much attention to the daily newspapers and periodicals published in the Soviet Union in the past ten years, is proficient in Russian, often travels in the Soviet Union, likes to communicate with Russians, and has extensive knowledge.

Henry A. Wallacc and Anorew J. Steiger co-authored Soviet Asia Mission, published by Reynal and Hitchcock. Americans know very little about Soviet Asia. This book is a record of the authors' travels. They took experts and translators and abandoned planes to inspect various places, paying attention to their economic development and diplomatic process, especially focusing on agricultural surveys. During the journey, they talked with businessmen, factory workers, teachers, and scientists, so it was not hearsay.

At the same time, there is also W. L. White's book Report on the Russians, which is also a true record. When the Soviet Union allowed Americans to travel freely, he ran all the way from the Caspian Sea to the Finnish front, and from Siberia to the US Air Force base deep in Ukraine. He met countless Russians, high and low, along the way, visited rural areas, and also visited industrial areas; visited battlefields, and also visited lively towns. What he heard and saw was not only very cautious, but also very humorous, with endless aftertaste. The book is published by World Publishing Company.

George B. Cressey's The Basis os Soviet Strength is dedicated to writing about the strength of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has one-tenth of the world's population and one-seventh of the territory. Its manpower and material resources cannot be underestimated. The author is a geography expert at Syracuse University and has recently returned from the Soviet Union. He has traveled to Siberia five times. The whole book discusses raw materials, new agriculture, climate, industry, ethnic background, and the characteristics of various regions. The materials are all obtained from field surveys and are not copied. The writing is lively and not boring. Published by Whittlesey House.

Science in Soviet Russia, published by The Jaques Cattell Press, is a collection of reports from various sources. The Soviet Union has been working hard on scientific research in recent years, is good at using radio, and has also made progress in genetics research, and is more attentive to treating wounded soldiers. The United States and the Soviet Union are fighting each other in this regard, competing for the short and long of the day.

Leon Trotsky, Stalin's political enemy, wrote a biography of Stalin, which has been translated into English. The book was not complete, only two-thirds of it was completed, and he was assassinated. Fortunately, the notes survived and were compiled into a book by Charles Malamuse and published.

Trotsky was a person in the know, and the description is intimate and flavorful. The process by which Stalin was able to gain power is recorded in more detail, and the materials are extremely rare.

Americans are enthusiastic about studying the Soviet Union, and they should know themselves and their enemies in the open and secret struggles.

### "Smoke and Powder Spirits" "New Lyrics Fiction"
I regret that only the names are listed in the "Siku Quanshu Summary," and the number of volumes, chapters, and versions are not specified. "New Lyrics Fiction" was undoubtedly compiled by people of the Ming Dynasty; "Smoke and Powder Spirits" may be the work of people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which is also unknown. Qian Zeng's "Yeshiguo Book Catalog" has four volumes of "Smoke and Powder Novels," written by people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. This "Smoke and Powder Spirits" may be from the same period. This kind of title was commonly used by people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, but rarely used by people of the Ming Dynasty. According to the former's record of novels, they belong to the "Smoke and Powder" and "Spirits" categories, so they are collectively referred to as "Smoke and Powder Spirits." These two types are not listed in Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Vernacular Novels."

On the Translation of Musical Terms Zhu Lixing

Long ago, I had planned to write an explanation of my "personal position" on the issue of "Chinese transliteration" of musical terms. However, I felt that this matter might be "laborious and unrewarding," and would only invite much "blame for seeking perfection." From a slightly more "rational" perspective, it was truly "unnecessary."

However, now our era is about to complete the 1950s of this twentieth century. Since the Opium War, when the country's doors were opened, although our civilization has only moved forward and never retreated, comprehensively speaking of Western art in general, just in terms of the four most common types of "transliteration" or "translation of meaning"—"item names," "title explanations," "personal names," and "place names"—even now, each still goes its own way, and there is absolutely no unity. People in the country engaged in cultural work, even though they have hoped generation after generation for the education authorities to issue a clear plan, but who has seen such a public announcement or news? Therefore, many non-Chinese people who reside in China and can write and read Chinese characters often encounter many academic difficulties because of this. Because today it's "Xūbó," tomorrow it changes to "Xiūbótè," and the day after tomorrow it changes to "Xǔpōdé." In fact, it's just one person, "Schubert," who in China is no less than "Sun Wukong, who can pluck a hair and transform it into eighty thousand heavenly soldiers and generals." It is truly a "miracle." As for "Washington," "Berlin," and "Paris," which do not have these kinds of "miracles," they are ultimately a minority within the majority. One cannot therefore assume that there are no problems with "transliteration."

Some people say, "As long as the prominent ones like Washington, Berlin, and Paris that we have daily contact with do not undergo metamorphosis, that's enough. As for the rest that are not necessary for contact, or are not related to our daily lives, it doesn't matter if one person has three 'names.'" This kind of "loose sand theory" certainly cannot be dismissed as absolutely unreasonable. For example, European symphonies are understood by only a minority of Chinese people, so they are naturally placed in the category of "not related to our daily lives," and there is no need for the education authorities to issue a general order for "unified transliteration." But even considering "a minority within a minority," this kind of "Sun Wukong" with one person having three "names" is a bit too "inconvenient"!

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a German, born in Salzburg, and never went to England, nor did he know English. But more than one hundred and fifty years after his death, he has now become (1) "Mòchādè," (2) "Mòcái'ěrdé," (3) "Móruò'ěrtè," (4) "Mòcházhādé," etc., in the mountainous country, completely transliterated according to English pronunciation. Frankly speaking, since the education authorities of a country do not ask or care about these "trivial matters," then at the very least, a member of the minority within a minority must clarify this person's nationality before cautiously transliterating his name. It's not that I'm being impolite, but there are many countries in Europe, and even more countries in the world. English is not Latin. Unless someone arbitrarily regards English as the "chief representative" of all foreign languages, the fact is that "Mòcái'ěrdé" is wrong, "Mòchādè" is also wrong, "Móruò'ěrtè" "Mòcházhādé," and even those that have not yet been "invented" are still "wrong." This is not my "law," but based on "original words," "nationality," and "dialect," England has never had a composer called "Mòchādè" etc., and there has never been such a person at all. There is such a person, and his transliteration in Chinese Mandarin is "Mózā." If you add a "tè" or "dé" at the end of those two characters, then it might not be that person.

I can't write about so many inconsistent transliterations at once, and it's not easy to correct them all at once either. But in my personal opinion, first, we must at least adhere to the morality of not turning people into "Sun Wukong" and transliterate cautiously. Second, we must absolutely adhere to the boundaries of the original word's "nationality" and "dialect" so that its pronunciation in Chinese Mandarin does not overstep the bounds (but sometimes, according to custom, "Bēiduōwēn" and "Bèiduōfēn" are not distinguished, but these two names do not violate the original German pronunciation). Third, if we truly cannot find such a character in Chinese Mandarin pronunciation, we should follow the initial transliteration that is commonly seen and maintain the original state. I believe that as long as we can adhere to these three points, we generally won't "mislead people."

Recently, I wrote an article, "New World Symphony," and I transliterated the composer (Antonin Dvorak) as "Āduōní·Fúxiàkè," which can be said to be accurate and appropriate, because I have personally heard college students majoring in music unanimously call "Fúxiàkè" as "Dé Fú Lāikè." Who knew that the "D" is silent, just like the "T" in "Mozart" is silent. In addition, the "R" should be pronounced as a "J" sound, which is even more complicated than "Mozart." This can only be blamed on Dvorak for "joking" when he chose his name.
Writing Attitude and Life Attitude Hu Yingdong

Writing attitude is equal to life attitude. If you cannot enrich your own life and establish a serious life attitude, then your writing will become lackluster under a morbid lifestyle and artificiality.

The beauty of language, the brilliance of language and words, is also the brilliance of your life. Real life cultivates in you a "bright and clear" life attitude. This life attitude, through your writing skills, then embodies the style of your work. Jack London's famous work, "Martin Eden," is completely refined from his personal real life. Martin Eden's life history is a part of his life history, and he has indeed gained the secret to developing his personality. Because he came from actual experiences as a sailor, laundry worker, etc., the class-type personality is fully overflowing in this work; from here, we can easily discover the consistent connection between his writing attitude and life attitude.

Of course, the so-called life attitude is not rootless duckweed; its roots sprout from the reflection of the entire social consciousness. In other words, it represents a kind of newest and most advanced consciousness in the real society: the refinement of this new consciousness, in a certain sense, is the abandonment of old dross, morbid residue, and what is radiated out. In Shanghai, there are works that represent the "petty citizen consciousness," specially provided for the idle old folks lying on sofas as items for appreciation. These kinds of works are filled with the air of the marketplace, yellow-colored interests, and the complex, decayed, queue-dragging clerk's air; these kinds of works are not worth anything; they are merely commodities that can fetch the highest price in the "manuscript market."

A sense of complaint, megalomania, tuberculosis-type sentimentality, and cell senescence and passion regression syndrome are all morbid phenomena in the writing attitude. It more or less circulates in the author's blood. These kinds of works will similarly infect readers, giving them nothing good, only giving them depression, melancholy, and distress.

Establishing a healthy life attitude is a difficult task. This is not merely a matter of the author's personal cultivation, but a real-life problem. If a poet goes into an ivory tower to find inspiration in order to write poetry, that is an extremely sad thing.

Living a down-to-earth life, feeling deeply, understanding real life clearly, seeing a wide world, touching a broad world, and encountering extraordinary people and events: under this multifaceted learning and experience, the works written will have a soul, have life, and have blood and flesh. Real-life subjects can give most people a deep and intimate feeling, and it will never make people feel monotonous, dry, and dark.

Hold a benevolent heart, use your limbs to feel, and use your brain to think; life is the soil of writing. Therefore, how to live life is the key to the problem.

How to live life leads to the approach you take to life, which is the problem of your outlook on life. How many people waste their breath talking about outlook on life, and how many people suffer and hesitate because of the problem of life; but they have caught a slight ailment: they have all isolated themselves and separated reality from themselves: this kind of view is precisely a third-person view. They have not grasped their own lives youthfully, and have not forced their own eyes to stare at the real world.

Expand the circle of life, expand the horizon, from the individual to the entire human race, and from the surrounding environment to the entire universe. In this, I can only use the four characters "expand the mind" to summarize it.

When crying, cry; when praising, praise; when criticizing, criticize; when rejoicing, rejoice; everything must be youthful in spirit. What is most to be feared is a stereotyped life attitude, and a veteran-like life attitude; these things do not require strange and profound nerves to twitch our nerves. Therefore, what we seek is a living brain, "using a living brain to feel a living life." This is our life attitude. Life is an epic; it is magnificent, it is also weak, it is like the clanging of metal and stone, and it is also like a babbling spring.
Gide's Quotes Tian Feng

Those who fear influence are simply admitting the poverty of their souls. Great thinkers do not fear influence, but are hungry and thirsty to seek influence.
An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 65 Ye Jingfeng

This Shuangqiao Station, on this branch line, is neither large nor small. When the train stopped here, it immediately became a bit chaotic, with people getting on and off, shouting and calling names. Only our group was squeezed between the porter and the police, and no one dared to break through.

"Go," the scar-eyed dog, looking like a fierce god, shouted at me and Tiger Brother, with a hint of wanting to get physical.

"What right do you have to tell us to go?" I could hardly restrain myself. "We're going to Tongxian. If you have something to say, go to Tongxian and talk to us."

"I don't care where you're going," the scar-eyed dog stretched out his hand. "You've broken the law. Come with us to the police station!"

This made me a bit embarrassed: going to the police station with them, the police station would of course be his gang of dogs, and we wouldn't be able to reason with them. But not going seemed impossible. Moreover, going there, who knows what would happen, wouldn't it be a waste of time? As the saying goes, "Desperation breeds wisdom," but even though I was "desperate" at this time, I couldn't come up with any "wisdom." Just when I couldn't figure out a solution, Tiger Brother suddenly stood in front of me, rushed forward, and spat a mouthful of saliva on the scar-eyed dog's face:

"Go!" Tiger Brother shouted, "The master's men, the master will go with you, see what you can do to the master."

Tiger Brother's saliva landed right on that guy's forehead. I saw him immediately grab it with both hands, shouting, "Ai yo."

"Little aunt," Tiger Brother turned back to me and said, "You don't need to get off the train, just go with the train. I know this place, and I'll catch up right away." As he said this, he winked, turned around, pushed aside the few guys blocking the way, and walked towards the train door. The guy who had been spat on closely followed behind.

Tiger Brother's move made me even more undecided, but this was also a helpless solution—the two of us would separate, and I could go to Tongxian first to find reinforcements. I thought Tiger Brother might have other solutions, and he certainly wouldn't be taken advantage of. It's just that it was difficult for me to go to Tongzhou alone, meeting people for the first time, and having to ask for help before even getting things done. Where would my face be? As I was spacing out, I caught sight of the guy dressed as a merchant waving his hand and shouting at the group of dogs, "No, we've injured someone again, we have to get that woman down too, she's a witness!"

With his command, I saw the other two police officers silently grab my handbag and snatch Tiger Brother's package, running straight to the train door. I thought, "It's better to get off, it would probably be difficult not to," so I followed behind the two police officers and walked towards the train, so as to avoid further trouble. The country folks on the train were all staring with wide eyes, with fearful expressions on their faces.

As soon as I got off the train, I saw Tiger Brother still standing on the platform, looking at the train engine, perhaps waiting to watch the train leave? But glancing over, he saw me get off the train and ran over to ask, "Why did you get off too?" I told Tiger Brother, "No way, I was squeezed by them, I probably had to get off." The saliva-covered scar-eyed dog also rushed over in surprise and alarm, afraid that Tiger Brother would get lost. I saw that he had already wiped off the saliva, and there was a large red mark on his forehead.

(I remember when we were in the village before, Tiger Brother told me that he could hit people with saliva, and I said he was lying. He said he would show me; he pursed his lips and called over a dog, and he spat a mouthful of saliva on the dog's head. The dog seemed to have been hit with a stick, and ran away immediately, barking all the way. He said this was Qigong, and he only used thirty percent of his strength.)

"Are there any people from our village here?" I held Tiger Brother's hand and walked towards the outside of the station, asking him in a low voice.

"I don't know if there are... but it doesn't matter... If we really go to the police station, I have a way."

"What way?" I was half-believing and half-doubting.

"I'm just afraid they won't go to the police station. I've heard that there are many of our people in the police force in Tongzhou City. This place is very close to there, only about ten miles away. Maybe there are one or two? If not, I'll have to make a big commotion, and naturally someone from our side will come..." Tiger Brother seemed very confident.
Fallen Leaves Yang Mou

Life has gatherings and dispersals, and aren't green leaves withering and yellowing?

As soon as I stepped into society, it was dyed with a strong atmosphere of sadness. In times of joy, I seemed to have already glimpsed the harbinger of storms, and a little withering and loneliness added countless sorrows to me.

The streets of summer are brilliant, injecting the stimulant of life into everyone with vitality. The scenery of autumn, however, brings everyone a mourning for decay. The leaves turn yellow, wither, and fall, rolling on the ground with the dust. No one can predict the destination of life, but who wants to have life wither and be lonely like this!

When we examine those fallen leaves, I seem to recall their dashing and heroic appearance, and I seem to have reviewed their beautiful history once again. However, not even a trace remains, and their short lives have passed fleetingly.

I want to bid them farewell. When they were rejoicing, people appreciated them, but when they withered, people discarded them. There are even more cruel facts in the world, and there is no room to talk about injustice.

I bless them to put on new clothes next year, and when they return to the world, to carefully calculate the warmth and coldness of the world.

Free Talk Shaofu

The cheapest entertainment is none other than a stroll in the park. May I ask, is a twenty-yuan entrance ticket the same as being free? Twenty yuan can only buy one-fifth of a fried dough stick. I once saw a fifty-yuan bill lying on the road, and several pedestrians passed by without even looking at it.

The parks of Shanghai each have their own unique charm. In the central district, the Bund Park is full of the beauty of movement. The cars, horses, and pedestrians on the road, the barges and sails in the river, a symphonic movement, are sounds that cannot be heard in other parks.

Sitting on a bench by the river, watching those boats coming and going, we must regain a little of our childlike innocence. Isn't the scene similar to children watching toy warships moving in a washbasin? Water inspires people's leisurely thoughts, and at the very least, it can cleanse the mind. At the corner where the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek meet, you can sit there mesmerized for half a day, reluctant to leave the scenery before your eyes.

Even if you turn your head to look at the rows of towering buildings on the Bund, golden domes, round heads, matchbox-style... although they are financial fortresses, manipulating the lives of countless people, the buildings are magnificent enough, supporting the sky of Shanghai.

People hurrying about in offices, shopping malls, elevators, cars, dance halls, and restaurants, please spend half an hour to stroll in the park!
Random Thoughts "Face Problem" S.S

In China, everything is about "face." When two families get into a lawsuit, if you want to find a way to mediate between them, then both sides must solemnly say: "Mediation is of course good, but my face must be fully supported. It doesn't matter if I spend a little more money on this." So, in the streets and alleys, people "fight each other" to the point of having black eyes and swollen noses. As long as a string of firecrackers is set off, the brother who was beaten will show a proud smile from the pain of broken skin and bleeding, because he has "face." When your own daughter or beloved wife is seduced and abducted by someone else, you not only remain silent, but also tell others not to reveal the secret, beautifully calling it "family scandals should not be publicized," but in reality, isn't it because you are afraid of losing "face" and your "reputation" going bankrupt!

Because of this, the business of teahouses and hotels thrives. Often, an extremely ordinary problem that can be solved with just a few words must involve a feast at Meilongzhen today and Xinghualou tomorrow, two catties of aged Shaoxing wine, and several courses of rich food. In the midst of tipsiness and flushed faces, they start with national affairs, speak freely about the political situation, and talk at length about women, before finally returning to the main topic. Once the theme is brought up, the guests are already tipsy, and in a daze, they only see the host's warm hospitality, bowing and scraping, and feel full of glory and comfort. The biggest things are completely O.K. between half-hearted compliance and a welcoming send-off. Even if you have suffered a bit of grievance because of this matter, a grand banquet and a few drinks will fill the gaps in the regret. By tomorrow, there will be many pink invitations to "Respectfully request your esteemed presence" pressed under the glass plate, knowing full well that small banquets every three days and large banquets every five days are harmful to time and the stomach, but when you think of it as "face," how can you not have face? So, you swallow a few "food supplements" and happily attend again; the sounds of pipes and strings in the restaurants are noisy, and the restaurants are crowded with people; "face" can then be seen shining in the crowd!

Officials are even more proficient in "face," being outstanding in their field; Tao Yuanming resigning from his post for five dou of rice was probably because that supervising official damaged his "face" when he bent over; this was a long time ago, but it makes us feel that we are both a bit too stubborn and close to clumsy. People now understand much better, and superiors have realized that if this trend continues, it will make people disdain to occupy the position of subordinates and officials, then the officialdom will not be like the officialdom; so bending over is still necessary, but "face" is maintained to the highest limit for you. In this way, everyone can feel at peace and satisfied. Look, hasn't He ×× already had "face" first, and then, under "joint impeachment," wasn't Lu Shizeng, the president of the Yunnan High Court, clearly transferred to the president of the Andong High Court afterward? Although it is "not in line with the situation," "face" must still be left for them.
Odds and Ends W.W

The Enemy Property Administration announced a gold receipt account: receiving 3,000 taels, of which more than 2,700 taels were used to pay secret report bonuses. The abacus is dialed, what is the net income? The "heavy" in "heavy reward" is very heavy! Reasonable disposal is also rare!

According to insiders, the bank's wealth creation is only a very small number on the books, five yuan is fine, ten yuan is fine, anyway, as long as there is an account. This is quite similar to the handling of the received gold account.

The motto of Principal Gong of Huangdu Township Normal School: "Don't be afraid of hardship, then there is no hardship. Finding joy in hardship is true joy. Don't be afraid of difficulty, then there is no difficulty. Seeking knowledge in difficulty is true knowledge; Don't be afraid of barrenness, then there is no barrenness. Establishing a career in barrenness is a true career; Don't be afraid of being busy, then there is no being busy. Experiencing people in busyness is a true person."

It is enough to provide great comfort to the general hard workers!
Anecdotes Cocktail Party This Newspaper Data Room

(Editor's Note: This article is a response to readers' questions from this newspaper's data room and is deemed to have a need for public release, so it is hereby disclosed.)

Regarding the origin of the cocktail party, there is such a legend:

In a certain town in South America, there was a small hotel, the owner of which was named Arden. All hotel affairs were personally managed by this old owner and his young and beautiful daughter, Mary.

Arden had a hobby of raising chickens. The chickens he kept were of various kinds, totaling no less than hundreds. Therefore, inside and outside the hotel, under the tables and chairs, there were often traces of them. Their fluttering, crowing, and shouting mixed with the drunken guests' clamor, laughter, and noise. Among the chickens, there was a rooster weighing fifteen pounds, with a red crown and phoenix tail, very tall and large, which was most loved by old Arden. He specially named it "Shuoguo."

One evening, the chickens returned to their nests, and upon inspection, "Shuoguo" happened to be missing. Arden spent a sleepless night in anxiety. Afterward, Shuoguo never returned, and the old owner's face was constantly filled with sorrow. Later, he simply closed the door and stopped business, posting a notice on the door offering a reward for finding the chicken: "This store has lost a large rooster. Anyone who finds and returns it will be rewarded with three hundred pounds, and I will never break my promise." He fully believed that with a heavy reward, there would be brave men, and "Shuoguo" would surely return safely. Unexpectedly, after five days, there was still no news. The old owner loved the chicken so much that he added a line under the notice: "And I am willing to give my daughter in marriage, and I will never regret it." For a time, the entire town was in an uproar, and everyone was fantasizing about finding "Shuoguo" and being able to marry Mary.

The next morning, before the red sun had risen high, someone was knocking loudly on the hotel's door. The owner opened the door and saw a handsome young man holding "Shuoguo" in his arms. The old man was overjoyed, and the young man explained his intention. Arden was overjoyed and wept, saying, "Please put the chicken down, and everything can be done."

The next day, the hotel was decorated with lanterns and streamers. Congratulatory guests filled the door, treating guests like family. Mary poured wine for the guests. One wanted champagne, another called for grape wine, and another called for whiskey. She was unable to fulfill each request one by one, so she mixed all kinds of wine in a large wine vat and then distributed a cup to each of them.

The guests tasted this cup of wine and found the taste to be fresh. They asked about the name of the wine. Mary couldn't answer, and in her anxiety, she suddenly saw "Shuoguo" raising its head, shaking its tail, and displaying its colorful plumage, dazzling and dazzling. So, she answered casually, "Cocktail."

That day's banquet was then named "Cocktail Party" by one of the guests. Since then, people far and wide have imitated it, and it has been passed down to this day, becoming a kind of banquet for entertaining VIPs.

How Roosevelt Dealt with Stalin (4) By Frances Perkins, reviewed by Ge Chunliang

Many loyal old Democrats, at that time, felt that he was indeed looking down on them. I remember the old Tim Sullivan, a councilman from the Bowery district, who was himself the center of a group of interesting people, said after a debate with Roosevelt: "A very arrogant man, that Roosevelt."

But in August 1912, during a summer vacation, Roosevelt was attacked by a childhood polio. He escaped alive in great danger, when he was only one step away from death.

During the long years of illness, Roosevelt underwent a great change of soul. I noticed that when he came back, he already had a character of bravery and perseverance. Pain and disaster had dispelled all his arrogance.

He never showed a hint of misery for any misfortune. On the occasional occasion, he told people that he had a particularly strong religious belief. He firmly believed that it was God's intervention that saved him from paralysis, despair, and death. He understood the principle that faith gives the soul a place to belong, and understood that a person's small power should be united with God's great power. (Containing the so-called meaning of doing one's best and leaving the rest to fate. - Translator)

Roosevelt was able to deal with the British with ease. But he found it more difficult to deal with the Russians. He found the Russian people interesting. I remember once, after the Tehran Conference, a conversation I had with him, he recalled, "I wish I could understand the Russians more deeply, Frances, do you understand my people?"

I replied, "No, I'm sorry, I only know a few in the embassy, and a few White Russian refugees driving taxis in Paris."

"Ah," the President said, "I wish someone would tell me about some Russians. I can't see a good Russian and a bad Russian. I can distinguish a good Frenchman and a bad Frenchman. I can distinguish a good Italian and a bad Italian; but I cannot understand the Russians. I don't know what it is that makes them so mysterious. Try to see if you can answer me what it is that makes them so mysterious?"

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to study the Russians deeply, but I read some books about Russia and often talked to several people who had lived in Russia, and often passed on what I knew to the President. On one occasion, I told him how one person, who had lived in Russia for a long time, answered my question, "What is it that makes the Russians so mysterious?" He said this sentence, "It is the desire to fulfill God's will!"

I asked again: Did the person who said this mistake the modern Russians for the Russians who deeply believed in the old religion before the revolution? But he insisted that they had the same character.

When I told the President this, he said, "You know, that sentence may have some meaning. That could explain why they have extended their almost mystical faith to communist society. They seem to be willing to do those things that are good for society. We take care of our own faces first, and then we work for the welfare of society."

In Tehran, Roosevelt dealt with Stalin with curiosity and goodwill. (The End)
News Figure New Administrative Relief Director Mr. Huo Shubao Qiu Nü

Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has resigned and is succeeded by Mr. Huo Shubao, the chief auditor of the Bank of China. Huo was originally a business figure, and his acceptance of the new appointment is just like the Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Wang Yunwu, entering officialdom from business.

Huo, whose style name is Yamin, is from Xinhui, Guangdong. In his early years, he was ordered by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, a veteran of the Kuomintang. (Huo was initially the secretary of the Central Construction Committee, and Zhang was the chairman). Zhang relied on him quite heavily. In 1930, when Zhang once took charge of Zhejiang's politics, Huo was also summoned to Zhejiang at the end of that year, serving as the chief secretary of the Zhejiang Construction Department.

In the autumn of 1932, the director of the Construction Department, Cheng Zhenjun, was sent to England for inspection, and Huo was appointed as acting director. In the spring of the following year, Cheng returned, and the provincial government divided the Construction Department into rural, fishery, and mining departments, and appointed Huo as the director of the three departments. His responsibilities and powers were no less than those of the director. However, when Huo served as the director of these three departments, although he worked extremely hard on planning, he ultimately failed due to the provincial government's emptiness and disputes. The three departments were only established for three months before being merged. At that time, Zhang Nanxian happened to be transferred by the central government to be the chairman of Zhejiang. Zhang Jinglao returned to his official position in the capital, and Huo also followed him back to the capital, being appointed as the director of the design department of the Central Construction Committee. Two years later, he was transferred to the United States for overseas inspection. Three months later, he returned to China, and soon after, he suddenly resigned and joined the Bank of China, serving as the chief auditor, until today, almost ten years without any changes.

Huo has an extraordinary appearance. When he was in Zhejiang, the people of Zhejiang called him "handsome man"; but Huo knew how to cherish himself and was cautious in choosing a spouse. During his time in Zhejiang, the inner court was still empty, and it took a long time before he found a good match. His wife, Ms. He, has an elegant demeanor and is skilled in music. She is fluent in spoken Chinese, English, German, and Russian, and is also good at socializing.
Trivial Matters about Li Yimang, a Chairman in the "Liberated Area" Xue Ou

According to reports, the residence of Li Yimang, chairman of the Soviet Border Region Government of the Communist Party, at No. 4 Anpan Lane in Huaiyin, is exquisitely furnished, exceptionally luxurious, with walls full of calligraphy and paintings, and a large collection of antiques. More than ten boxes of valuables were taken away during the retreat. The two beds that were not taken away, one was made of ebony and fine rattan, inlaid with marble, and the other was used in summer, the entire bed except for the wooden frame was made of glass, all extremely precious.

This news figure is little known in history by the general public, but he was quite famous in the communist cultural circles twenty years ago. Li's original name was Ouyang Jixiu, with the pen name Hua Han. He studied in Japan and, after returning to China, joined the New Literature and Art circles, together with Li Chu, the communist representative of the 27th small group of the Military Mediation Department, were both active members of the later Creation Society. (The Creation Society was a famous New Literature and Art organization in China, divided into two periods. The core figures of the early period were Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, Wang Duqing, etc., who advocated Romantic literature. The later period was presided over by Li et al., who specialized in propagating communism and advocating so-called Proletarian literature) He once edited a small bi-monthly publication "Quicksand," advocating class struggle very fiercely, so it was soon banned from publication, and the Creation Society was also banned because of this.

When the later Creation Society was at its peak, someone suddenly opened a "Shanghai Cafe" on North Sichuan Road, which was known as mysterious, and it also employed waitresses. This was truly innovative at the time, so it attracted a group of revolutionary writers who advocated proletarian literature, and they were all frightened by it. Li Yimang and Jiang Guangchi were both regulars at this cafe, flirting and joking with the waitresses from time to time, and anecdotes circulated. Sometimes, unable to restrain themselves, they often expressed themselves in writing, so it was inevitable that some people criticized them for not matching their words with their actions, which can be said to be exactly the same as his current behavior.

Li was originally a literati, so according to his neighbors, he enjoyed poetry and books in his spare time, and he still retained the nature of a scholar. However, recently, he wrote a poem "Nine Granny Mountain," praising the late Ming Dynasty Li Chuang to the highest degree, praising the outlaws, which is somewhat undesirable.
Fish, Shrimp, and Turtle Compete in Elections, Each with Its Own Merits Zhou Wen

Among the aquatic creatures, because the locality was not peaceful, they tried to implement Baojia. Fish, Shrimp, Crab, and Turtle were publicly recommended as candidates for Bao Chief. Therefore, they individually delivered election speeches, the content of which was rich and wonderful, and full of beauty. Now, the main points are selected and recorded briefly below.

Fish said: "Checking the effectiveness of work, the first is the mouth. The mouth can order everything, publish everything, and control everything. This is a condition for being successful. Please vote for me."

Shrimp said: "...Checking that the mouth cannot represent everything, being good at talking does not necessarily mean being good at doing. I have a delicate and clever figure, daring to go to large places and able to enter small places. There is a pincer in front and a knife on the head. This is a guarantee of strength... Please give me a hand!"

Crab said: "...If happiness befalls me and I am elected, I will never employ private individuals. I hate the tradition of 'a new emperor, a new courtier' the most. Just with so many hands and feet, I can stand alone. I can't speak, but the Big Pincer will speak for me. (It raises two big pincers) It's all about action. If it doesn't work, I'll run rampant. Please...don't forget I'm called Crab."

Turtle said: "...Thinking that the most important thing for candidates is experience. I come from a noble family in the water, which is the first point. I have the skills of two floors, able to climb and able to swim. If an event occurs on land, no one is better than me. This is the second point. My hands and feet may not

### Miscellaneous Talks on Fiction

— Zizhen

The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber

"The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber," originally named "A Continued Dream缘 of the Red Chamber," also known as "The Mirage 情梦," consists of forty-eight chapters. There is a reprinted edition from the Yichou year of the Jiaqing reign. Yao Bian's "Outline of the Dream of the Red Chamber" records an edition published by Rui Ning Hall. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Vernacular Novels" states: "Written by a certain Wang of the Qing dynasty, using the pseudonym 'Master of 　　.' It begins with a preface by the Recluse of the Bixie Garden of Xiling from the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign. The phrase 'Our family's Mr. Fengzhou' appears in the first chapter, indicating the author's surname is Wang. The book continues after Gao E's one hundred and twenty chapters." According to Sun's research, it was written by the Recluse of the Landao Island. Besides this book, there is also a book of anecdotes titled "Absurd 　　Words." This summer, I borrowed it from Mr. Zhou Xuliang and read it once. This book contains many obscene words, so during the Tongzhi reign, Ding Richang's list of prohibited obscene novels included it as the twelfth item ("Regulations of Jiangsu Province during the Tongzhi Reign"). The book is in a pocket-sized format, in five volumes. It begins with a preface by the Recluse of Lan 　 from the Jiayin year, and a postscript by the Carefree Man of the Mian Garden, containing the phrase "My younger brother Guan 　." Later, among the inscriptions by various individuals, there is also one by Wang Bixie Garden, indicating that the author is Wang Lan 　, with Bixie Garden being his elder brother, who is frequently mentioned in the book and is also the author of the preface to "The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber." The preface only records the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch year without the reign year. Based on the events in the entire book, Jiayin is determined to be the fifty-ninth year of the Qianlong reign. It involves many historical traces of the author, which are extracted and presented below in chronological order:

Volume Two, Ode to Spring, says: "After the Zhonghe Festival in the Bingxu year, the minister of this ministry, Wang 　 Garden, gathered famous scholars from various provinces at the Taoran Pavilion south of the capital to compose poems about spring... Wang Sheng Lanzhi, a native of Wulin, was the youngest... Wang wrote it immediately." This passage is autobiographical. Lanzhi is suspected to be his original name, and his place of origin can also be inferred from it. Bingxu is the thirty-first year of the Qianlong reign.

Volume Three, Dream Confirmation, says: "In the Gengzi year, 囗囗 resided in the capital, and obtained the Juren degree in the autumn." Gengzi is the forty-fifth year, passing the provincial examination.

Volume Two, Tiger Master, says: "I have heard this saying since I was young and did not believe it. When I governed Shouting, the land was entirely mountainous, the soil was barren, and the people were poor. I have a poem saying: 'The meager salary barely exceeds five dou, the desolate city is remotely located in ten thousand mountains,' which is a true record." It is a pity that the year he served as the prefect of Shouning in Fujian is not recorded.

Volume Three, Xia Dehai, says: "The Luoyang Bridge is outside the city of Quanzhou... When I was transferred to Chihkan, I traveled east from Fuzhou to Xiamen by sea, and passed over the bridge on both journeys." Furthermore, Volume Four, The Demon Crow of Taiyang, records that when he served as the magistrate of Chihkan in Taiwan, he encountered the Lin Shuangwen rebellion: "In the Yisi year, I was transferred to Chihkan, and arrived in the ninth month... The following year, in the Bingwu summer, there was the case of Zhuluo sending official to Douliumen... The following year, Dingwei... This campaign started in the eleventh month of Bingwu and the main force returned victoriously in the third month of Wushen, lasting eighteen months, and I was involved throughout." The above occurred between the fiftieth and fifty-third years of the Qianlong reign.

Volume Three, Spring Lantern Riddles, says: "In the Jiyou year, I lived in the provincial capital," which refers to events in the fifty-fourth year.

The same passage also says: "I visited Dongou and went out to see the lantern riddles on the Yuan Night." Volume Three, Dream Confirmation, says: "More than ten years later, I resided in Lucheng... I thus have the poem 'Amidst rivers and mountains, a traveler lodges in the Ou Sea, in wind and rain, by a cold lamp, I dream of the Wan City.'" Volume Five, Planchette Poetry, says: "In the Xinhai year, I resigned and returned to Yongjia." All of these refer to events in the fifty-sixth year. The "Absurd Words" was completed in the fifty-ninth year, and five years later, in the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign, "The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber" was completed. - The verifiable events in the life of Wang are roughly as described above.

### The Scholars

Much of what is recorded in "The Scholars" is drawn from earlier miscellanies. For example, chapter twelve, "The Knight Errant Falsely Sets Up a Meeting with Severed Heads," is based on Feng Menglong's "Discussions in the Osmanthus Garden," and chapter thirty-eight, "Filial Son Guo Meets a Tiger in the Deep Mountains," is based on Zhang Du's "Anecdotes from Court and Countryside." The sources of both have been found by Tianmu Mountain Hermit (Zhang Wenhu). Jiang Ruizao's "Textual Research on Novels," volume seven, quotes "Random Notes from the One-Leaf Studio" by the recent scholar Sha Ou, which also identifies several sources. However, the cited documents are either of later origin or not the original text, making them difficult to trust.

The matter of the ugly Taoist priest in chapter thirty of "The Scholars," "The Young Lover Visits a Friend at the Temple of Divine Music," is found in Ming He Fuzuo's "Random Talks from the Huadang Pavilion," volume seven, in the section on Xu Fangbo. The text states: "Xu Ziyu, whose name was Zhonghang, was hospitable and particularly fond of handsome youths. An extremely ugly guest, confident in his poetic abilities, was recommended to Ziyu by Mr. Cai Zimu. Cai wrote a letter praising the guest's likable qualities, fearing that the guest might see the letter and demand it, he treated it as a family matter. Ziyu was delighted upon receiving the letter and eagerly welcomed him, but was shocked and could not stop laughing. He presented the guest with a poem: 'Confident that your golden voice can shake the earth, who knew that your jade appearance is less pleasing to the eye?' The guest was still pleased and circulated the poem for appreciation." (The textual research cites "Solid Gourd Collection.")

Chapter thirty-five, "Zhuang the Recluse Resigns His Title and Returns Home," records how Zhuang the Recluse was stung by a scorpion and unable to attend court. According to Ming Lang Ying's "Seven Corrections," volume forty-three, the section on harmful insects contains the following: "During the Tianshun reign, the recluse Wu Yubi arrived in the capital. Emperor Yingzong summoned him to the Wenhua Hall for an audience and asked him about general affairs. Wu remained silent and only said, 'Allow me to submit a memorial.' The audience was surprised, and the Emperor, displeased, stood up and left. Wu went to the Right Shunmen Gate, removed his hat, and saw a scorpion on his head, its sting causing redness and swelling of the skin. People then understood that he was unable to answer due to the pain. During the Chunxi reign of the Song dynasty, the imperial censor Shi Lun was serving as a reader. He happened to mention something about Emperor Gaozong, and suddenly tears streamed down his face. The Emperor asked why, and he replied, 'I am moved by the late Emperor's kindness!' Emperor Xiaozong also shed tears. The next day, the imperial decree appointed Shi as a Vice Minister. It turned out that he was bitten on the mustache by a centipede and could not bear the pain. Alas! Both were bitten on the head by harmful insects. The one who was respectful was ridiculed, while the one who was deceitful received favor. Is this not fate!" (The textual research cites Xie Zhaozhe's "Sifting Sand from the Sea of Literature.") The event recorded in "The Scholars" is the former one. This event is also found in Ming Zhou Qingyuan's "Second Collection from West Lake," volume three, "The Clever Student Loses His Stance in the Golden Luan Hall." The latter event is also found in Qing Qian Yong's "Casual Talks from the Garden of Footprints," volume two, scholars section two (laughingstock), Scorpion Prefect: "During the early Yongzheng reign, an assistant prefect was granted an audience. A scorpion was hidden in his hat, and when it tried to get out, it stung his head painfully, causing him to cry. Emperor Shizong saw this and was astonished. He asked what was wrong, and the official took off his hat, kowtowed, and knelt, saying, 'I am mindful of the late Emperor Shengzu's sixty-one years of benevolence and virtue. My family has received favor for two generations, and I could not help but weep.' Emperor Shizong said, 'This man still has a conscience,' and recorded his name for future appointment as a prefect." Later, he was called the Scorpion Prefect." Because these two events have been passed down for a long time, they have become "talking points." "The Scholars" probably collected such "talking points" to create the book.

Chapter seventeen, "Doctor Zhao Presides Over the Poetry Circle" - narrating the joint birthday of the doctor and the magistrate, is found in Ming Zheng Zhongbian's "New Ears," volume eight, "My friend Li Qian of Qianshan, Wang Guozhu, and my disciple Mao Shi of Yushan were all born on the same day... Li passed the Jinshi examination in the Wuchen year and was appointed a Compiler, but died in office without children; Mao had many children, all of whom are outstanding, and he is still alive." (The textual research cites the same book, but the text has been changed in many places.)

Chapter five, "Yan Jiansheng Dies in His Bed," records Yan Jiansheng raising two fingers before his death. According to Ruan Kuisheng's "Teatime Talks with Guests," volume fifteen (Wang's Complete Edition), this was a real event at the time. The text states: "Wu Binting said: A certain merchant from Yangzhou had a fortune of millions but lived no differently from ordinary people. On his deathbed, he could not speak a single word. Relatives and friends surrounded him. Suddenly, at night, he raised two fingers and kept gesturing with his mouth. His son said, 'Is father worried that Erlang is too young to manage the business?' He shook his head no. The son then said, 'Is he worried that his second uncle will cheat and bully Erlang?' He shook his head no. Everyone was astonished. His wife arrived later, looked around the room, and said, 'He wants to pick out the two wick stalks from the oil lamp bowl.' The wealthy man lowered his hand, nodded, closed his eyes, and died. Gongdu and Shanting both personally witnessed this man, it is not a fabrication." Wu Binting's name was Huang, who was the son of Wu Jingzi, the author of "The Scholars." Ruan Yuan's "Biographies of Scholars" and Li Dou's "Record of the Yangzhou Painted Boats" contain biographies of him.

### The Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods

As Yuan and Ming dynasty novels were passed down, commentators arose in droves. For example, the book "Journey to the West" has six versions, including "Journey to the West: A Treatise on Spiritual Realization," "Journey to the West: The Original Intent," and "Journey to the West: The True Explanation." However, "Investiture of the Gods" has only two versions: Zhong Bojing's annotated edition and "The Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods." The latter is a manuscript and not a widely circulated book. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Novels," volume five, records "The Illustrated Exposition" as: "Unseen. Written by Jing of Qing. Yu Yue's 'Miscellaneous Writings from the Chunzai Studio,' six supplemental volumes, 'Preface to Yu Huyin's Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods,' states: 'There is a Mr. Yu from Renhe, named Jing, with the pseudonym Huyin, who, imitating the example of Wu Yizi's commentary on Journey to the West, wrote The Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods. His ingenuity in conceiving and his cleverness in understanding are as skillful as Wu Yizi's, though expressed in a different way.' It also says: 'Mr. Yu shares the same surname and is from the same province as I, yet I did not know him. Mr. Zou Lisheng obtained this book from among the remains of old books, and the ink was so faded that it was almost unrecognizable. He spent several years correcting and arranging it, hand-copying it into a finalized version. His wise son, Grand Secretary Jingshu, who is one of my students, showed it to me. I read it once and returned it to Jingshu, asking him to treasure it.'" The "Catalog" cites Yu Yue's text as the basis for its entry, as the original book had not yet been seen at the time. Later, at the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition held in Hangzhou, a manuscript of "The True Explanation of Investiture of the Gods" was displayed, borrowed from the collection of Zou Shilu of Haichang. The "Special Issue of the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition" also listed it in the catalog with a commentary. The original book has a preface by Yu Jing, written in the Yihai year of the Jiaqing reign (1815), stating that the book was written fifteen years earlier while teaching in the capital. There is also a preface by Zou Cungan (Chusheng) from the tenth year of the Guangxu reign (1884), stating that he obtained the handwritten manuscript of this book in the Bingchen year of the Xianfeng reign (1856) and revised it. Therefore, it is known that this version is no longer Yu's original. The book consists of ten volumes in six books. Zou's books were originally kept in Hangzhou and scattered in Shanghai after the war. A certain person in Beiping once obtained some of them, but it is unknown who possesses this "Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods."

### Tales of Romance, Spirits and Demons and New-style Fiction

Among the earliest collections of vernacular stories published during the Ming dynasty are the "Rainy Window Collection" and "Desire Pillow Collection" published by Qingping Mountain Hall, as well as fifteen stories published in Japan without an overall title. Mr. Dai Yu Shu and Mr. according to Gu Xiu's "Preliminary Bibliography of Assembled Books", "Six Family of Novels", and also got "Long Lantern Collection", "Follow Ship Collection", "Sister Leisure Collection", "Awakening Dream Collection" four names. Each type has ten volumes, and each volume has one chapter, for a total of sixty chapters. This is the total number of vernacular stories published by Hong Bian Qingping Mountain Hall.

I accidentally checked the Ming "Wenyuange Bibliography" and found two more types of vernacular stories collections in volume ten;
