### Mediators Propose Concrete Suggestions: If Both Sides Agree to Peace Talks, They Can Reopen; Stuart Pays Respects to the Chairman for a Long Conversation

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] During the informal comprehensive talks, when discussions on political issues achieve success, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee will be reconvened for approval. This suggestion was decided by the China Democratic League, the Youth Party, and respected figures during a three-hour meeting on the morning of the 6th. In the afternoon, Luo Longji and others visited Zhou Enlai to inform him of this suggestion and reported to the government that they had the determination to reopen peace talks. In the evening, Mo Dehui visited Lei Zhen and Shao Lizi again, formally presenting this opinion. Government representatives decided to discuss the answer at Sun Ke's residence on the morning of the 7th, and will focus on the draft constitution.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] As the National Assembly approaches its opening, the situation regarding peace talks has been fluctuating, and it is gradually approaching a critical juncture. It is reported that mediators, after summarizing the recent negotiations, have reached a concrete suggestion. After reaching an agreement on the afternoon of the 6th, it has been submitted to the government. If agreed upon and if the Communist Party has no objections, formal negotiations may commence as early as the 7th, aiming to reach an agreement on everything in the near future. On the mediators' side, the original plan was to hold separate talks with the government and the Communist Party on the issues listed in both the political and military aspects. However, to save time and reduce travel, the negotiation method was changed to having all parties hold informal comprehensive talks and a military three-person group meeting at the same time, discussing political and military issues separately. It is also reported that the issues to be discussed will include the following: "Political": (1) The reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan; (2) The issue of the number and list of delegates to the National Assembly, and the actual start date of the National Assembly's deliberations; (3) The issue of the draft constitution; (4) The issue of local governments inside and outside the customs. "Military": (1) The issue of ceasefire in place; (2) The issue of troop deployment locations; (3) The issue of the Executive Group separately implementing the ceasefire.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] Regarding the Third Party's opinions, the government responded this morning through Shao Lizi. The meeting originally scheduled for 3:00 PM was temporarily canceled. China Democratic League representative Zhang Junmai visited Shao again at 7:00 AM this morning for talks. Political Consultative Conference Secretary-General Lei Zhen was present. Shao expressed the government's opinion, not rejecting negotiations, but hoping that the Third Party would propose more concrete methods regarding the negotiation format and procedures.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] Sun Ke may return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. Liang Shuming left Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 6th, flying to Beiping. Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Chen Qitian returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] Ma Si met once on the morning of the 6th. In the afternoon at 6:00 PM, Stuart paid respects to the Chairman for a long conversation.

Key Decisions on the Overall Situation's Development to Be Made in the Next Few Days

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] A certain person from the Third Party, who recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, told reporters on the 6th: The key to the peaceful development of the overall situation will be decided in the next few days. The content of the exchanges of opinions in Nanjing among all parties focuses on two points: (1) The eight principles proposed by the government; (2) The issue of the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. Regarding the former, the government and the Chinese Communist Party have already reached an agreement on items (1) and (2), but have not yet signed it. The government has accepted the Third Party's opinions on items (3), (4), and (6), indicating that they can be considered and revised. The distance between the two sides' opinions is not difficult to close. Items (5) and (7) are procedures that must be followed and do not require discussion. Item (8) will not be a problem after the first seven items are resolved. Therefore, the eight principles proposed by the government do not present difficulties during negotiations. As for the latter, the government advocates reorganizing the Executive Yuan after the National Assembly is convened, while the Chinese Communist Party insists that it must be reorganized simultaneously with the National Government. This is only a matter of timing. If both sides can be slightly flexible, there seems to be no reason for dispute. Based on this, although the National Assembly session is only a few days away, the hope for peace in the overall situation is still very optimistic. Therefore, the Third Party is constantly actively mediating, hoping to facilitate the successful opening of the National Assembly.

In addition, regarding the two points of contention in the constitutional draft: (1) The issue of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan. (2) The issue of local governments. Before April of this year, during the Political Consultative Conference's Constitutional Draft Review Committee meeting, regarding the former, the government advocated abolishing it, while the Chinese Communist Party insisted on retaining it. In the end, there was a compromise suggestion, that the Executive Yuan would only be responsible to the Legislative Yuan within a certain scope, a limited responsibility rather than a general responsibility. With a little more discussion, a comprehensive opinion can be obtained. Regarding the latter, only slight adjustments need to be made to the articles. There are no major differences. If the Constitutional Draft Review Committee can be convened quickly, then agreeing on the draft constitution will not take much time.

Also, regarding the allocation of committee seats for each party in the reorganized government, the Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League originally requested ten seats, but recently expressed that they could consider being flexible. However, the recent informal exchanges of opinions among all parties have not yet achieved satisfactory results. The crux of the matter lies in other factors. The most important thing from now on is for all parties to show sincerity, make concessions to each other, avoid creating unnecessary complications, and seize the time. Then, successfully convening the National Assembly and completing peaceful unification can be realized.

### Central Standing Committee Holds Extraordinary Meeting to Discuss Issues of the National Assembly; Minister Peng Discusses the Impossibility of Postponing the National Assembly

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] After today's National Defense Council meeting, an extraordinary meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held. Chairman Yu Youren discussed the National Assembly issue for a long time, and there was also a heated discussion on the issue of all councilors attending the National Assembly.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 3:30 PM this afternoon, hosted by Minister Peng Xuepei and Director Ye Gongchao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The following are Minister Peng's answers to reporters' questions:

Question: Regardless of the attitudes of the Chinese Communist Party or other parties, will the government definitely convene the National Assembly on November 12th?

Answer: The National Assembly was postponed from May 5th to November 12th to accommodate the opinions of the Chinese Communist Party and other parties. Negotiations are still ongoing, hoping for unanimous participation. Now that the representatives have arrived in Nanjing one after another, it is no longer possible to delay it further.

Question: It is reported that Sichuan Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun will succeed as President of the Executive Yuan. What is the plan for reorganizing the Executive Yuan? Has President Song already resigned, or does he plan to resign in the near future? If the reports are not accurate, what is the reason for Chairman Zhang's urgent return to the country?

Answer: I have not heard of any situation that would indicate that President Song intends to resign. After the National Assembly is convened, we can expect the Executive Yuan to further broaden its base. Chairman Zhang Qun currently holds a very important position in the government. He went to the United States for treatment of a neck tumor. Now that the surgery has been successful, his health allows him to return to the country soon.

### Shao Lizi's Remarks

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th Dispatch] The preparatory committee for the National Assembly recently announced a new list of staff, with Shao Lizi still serving as chairman. Reporters visited Shao on the 6th to inquire whether his intention to resign, which he had expressed earlier, had been withdrawn. He replied: Because of my poor health, I often feel headaches. The preparatory work for the National Assembly is very heavy, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to handle it. Therefore, I sincerely requested to resign. Fortunately, the actual affairs have always been the responsibility of Secretary-General Hong Lanyou. I believe it will not be delayed. The reporter also asked Shao for his opinion on the National Assembly? He replied: Drafting a constitution is closely related to peace and unity. We originally hoped to convene the National Assembly after peace and unity were achieved. Now, we still hope to promote the success of peace and unity by convening the National Assembly. The purpose has not changed, and we just need to continue our efforts.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] During the Ministry of Information's press conference on the 6th, regarding military news, Minister Peng answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What is the military situation in Yantai? It is rumored that the National Army landed on the north coast of Shandong with the goal of capturing the port. Is this true?

Question: Reports state that the National Army is advancing towards Dalian. What is the actual situation in that area? What is the progress in recovering Dalian?

Answer: There is no fighting in the Dalian area. Reports that the Communist army shelled Andong from the Soviet-occupied Korean territory across the Yalu River, causing the National Army to retreat from Andong, are completely unfounded.

### Hebei to Promote Pacification Work; Plans to Divide the Province into Pacification Zones

[Our Beiping Office, 6th Dispatch] After the National Army opened the Pingbao section, the political center of Hebei is still in Beiping because transportation cannot be restored in the short term. Currently, important political decrees of the Hebei Provincial Government are still issued by the Beiping Office of the Provincial Government. Most of the heads and senior personnel of the various departments and offices also work in Beiping. Acting Secretary-General Shi Desen, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Sun Zhengbang, Director of the Police Department, and Director of the Health Bureau remain in Baoding. It is learned that before the Pingbao Railway is restored, this situation will be difficult to change. Currently, the most important political task in Hebei is pacification. Sun also serves as the chairman. In the past, the administrative commissioners could not effectively command the troops, and pacification work was difficult to promote. It is planned to temporarily divide the province into four pacification zones: (1) Eastern Hebei (2) Northern Section of the Jinpu Railway (3) Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway (4) Beiping (including the Tongxian area). The pacification work will be carried out with the commander of the stationed troops as the center. Except for the commander of the Eastern Hebei Pacification Zone, who has been appointed to be the 92nd Army Commander Hou Jingru, with the command post set up in Tangshan, the commander of the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Pacification Zone has been internally designated as the 94th Army Commander Mu Tingfang. The candidates for the commanders of the remaining two zones are still being considered. In addition, in view of the past inconsistency in the pace of the party, government, and military, which greatly affected work efficiency, it was decided to follow the example of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters and establish joint party-government-military offices at both the provincial and county levels. The provincial joint office will be personally presided over by Sun, with one secretary-general, served by the director of the political department of the war zone, and two deputy secretary-generals, served by the secretary-general of the provincial government and the chairman of the provincial party headquarters. The coordination between the party, government, and military will be strengthened and will be implemented soon. Regarding emergency relief, the central government has allocated 500 million yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has dispatched key personnel to the north to assist in distribution. The Hebei Provincial Government believes that the disaster-stricken areas in Hebei Province are very large this time and has telegraphed the central government to request an additional allocation.

### National Federation of Commerce Passes Important Provisional Motion: Urge the Government to Quickly Determine Economic Policies

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Federation of Commerce today passed the following important provisional motion:

Motion: To urge the government to promptly determine economic policies and improve financial measures, focusing on protecting production, developing trade, and stabilizing people's livelihoods to rescue the national industrial and commercial crisis.

Upon investigation, our country's current economic contradictions are numerous, and the industrial and commercial crisis is becoming increasingly serious. The root causes are nothing more than the following:

1.  High inflation, shrinking production, and transportation bottlenecks have led to high prices. Furthermore, high prices have resulted in high-interest loans. Currently, industries and businesses across the country are suffering from the oppression of high-interest loans, like drinking poison to quench thirst, and bankruptcies are frequently heard.

2.  Since the victory, imports have surged, and foreign goods are being dumped in markets everywhere. Domestic nascent industrial products struggle to compete, leading to foreign goods seizing original domestic markets, resulting in business depression and difficulties in maintaining operations.

3.  Because the domestic value of the legal tender is vastly different from its foreign value, the output of special products does not cover costs. This has affected industries such as silk, tea, tung oil, and animal husbandry. Agricultural products are stagnant, the economy is on the brink of bankruptcy, and purchasing power is shrinking, resulting in increasingly narrow sales channels for urban goods.

4.  Current financial policies focus on contraction, and credit is severely restricted for loans genuinely used for production. Furthermore, land cannot be mortgaged, factory buildings cannot be used as collateral, and there are numerous controls. Although called specialized banks, the Agricultural Bank of China is also subject to restrictions on commercial banks. Because the Central Bank has never earnestly handled rediscounting and re-mortgaging, it is difficult to turn around, so it seeks to protect itself carefully, causing finance to lose contact with production, resulting in a disjointed state.

5.  Idle funds flow into the black market. To maintain cost reductions, banks set deposit interest rates too low, resulting in a one-to-ten ratio compared to lending rates. This further discourages social idle funds from being deposited in banks, causing them to flow to the black market, leading to speculation. This not only hinders finance but also promotes the abnormal development of speculative markets.

6.  Donations and taxes are heavy, disregarding the ability of industry and commerce to bear the burden. Instead of cultivating tax sources, they specialize in killing the chicken to get the egg, draining the pond to catch the fish, and apportioning levies and borrowing taxes solely to increase the ratio of collection. As a result, the lifeblood is exhausted, and they are on the verge of death, ultimately leading to work stoppages and closures.

The above are all due to the fact that since the Anti-Japanese War and the postwar recovery, there has been no definite economic policy as a guide. Furthermore, financial measures do not start from supporting production but specialize in blind tightening, leading to this situation. The remedy should be to request the government to show compassion for the people's exhaustion of strength, face the current crisis squarely, and quickly determine economic policies. Furthermore, improve financial measures to ensure that finance and economy are linked, thereby protecting industries, developing trade, and achieving the goals of rescuing the crisis and stabilizing people's livelihoods. All extraordinary wartime economic laws that do not meet the needs of the current era should be abolished. The outlines of various measures are stated as follows:

1.  Regarding the Establishment of Economic Policies

A. Production is the mother of all economic activities. Only with large-scale production can there be substantial trade, wealth distribution, and consumption. Moreover, the government's financial resources also depend on the prosperity of production, only then can annual revenue achieve healthy growth. Therefore, our country's economic policy should focus on conserving and developing production as its central goal.

B. The elements of production are capital, labor, technology, equipment, organization, and management. Our country's industry is nascent, capital is short, technology is backward, equipment is simple, and organization and management are not very strict. To develop production, it is necessary to lay a good foundation in advance. Therefore, as a first step, the government should supervise and effectively assist the gradual enrichment and improvement of private industries, especially in terms of capital, and provide convenience with all its strength.

C. Nascent industries must never be subjected to the dumping attacks of foreign products. Protectionist tariffs must be established to protect necessary national industries, and one must never dig one's own grave in order to appease friendly countries.

D. The division between state-owned and private enterprises should be quickly divided and announced according to the economic construction plan, clearly specifying the types to show the people the truth, and actively proceeding with priorities in a classified manner.

E. The distribution of dividends should be stipulated to be no less than 50% of the bank's interest rate (year-end losses are naturally an exception) to encourage investment. Furthermore, the calculation of wages should be determined by the government for a minimum wage, but the limit should not exceed the employer's ability to bear it, so that both labor and capital can achieve a balance.

### National Federation of Commerce Concludes Successfully; Chairman Chiang Attends and Gives Instructions; The Government Resolves to Go All Out to Solve Difficulties for the Industrial and Commercial Sectors; Hopes the Industrial and Commercial Sectors Can Assist the Government in Developing Transportation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Federation of Commerce concluded successfully on the 6th after five days of meetings. Chairman Chiang attended the meeting at 4:15 PM and gave instructions, demonstrating the government's concern for the pain of industry and commerce, and resolving to do its best to assist in solving difficulties. Regarding tax issues, he hoped that the business community could assist the government in ensuring that statistical surveys are accurate. If this work can be done, taxation will naturally be balanced. In terms of transportation recovery, he also hoped to assist the government in developing it. The Chairman, wearing a yellow woolen uniform, looked energetic and rosy-cheeked. After arriving, he rested briefly in the lounge, where Wang Xiaolai presented the course of the meeting and the points of expectation of representatives from various places regarding the government. He then entered the meeting hall accompanied by Gu Zhenggang, and the entire hall responded with warm applause. After ascending the stage, Wang Xiaolai presented his respects, and reported that a total of 416 people had registered for the conference, with 301 actually attending, and a total of 504 proposals. The Chairman then gave instructions, briefly stating:

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, not only is our country's economy and industry lagging behind, and the general public is feeling pain, but the people of other countries also have the same situation. However, our country is particularly painful, especially the industrial and commercial sectors and the people in various places suffering the most. After a year, other countries have roughly gained a clue in the economy, and the economy and transportation have recovered. Only our country has not recovered its transportation due to various reasons, and farmers, businesses, and industries are suffering deeply. The government feels terrified by the heavy burden it bears to the compatriots and the industrial and commercial sectors. In the future, it is determined to do its best to reduce the pain of industry and commerce, and to reduce the pain of compatriots across the country. It is hoped that the national economic circles, especially the leaders who have come from afar, can work with the local governments to cooperate and enable the economy to recover quickly, transportation to recover day by day, and industry and commerce to improve day by day. Transportation is extremely important, and it is hoped that everyone can provide special assistance to develop railways and highways. Secondly, the basis of our industry and commerce cannot be compared with other countries. The biggest reason is that our organization is unsound, lacks statistics, and various economies cannot have a progress and concrete plan to proceed step by step. In addition, the survey is not accurate, and the tax cannot be balanced as a result. In order to seek the sound development of industry and commerce, the tax should seek balance and impartiality, and the suffering of merchants and people can be reduced as a result. The current investigation is inaccurate, and the statistics are inaccurate, so that the rich who should pay taxes are able to avoid paying, and those who should not pay are suffering from the burden of paying taxes. The two ministries of economy and society have been ordered to pay special attention to this matter, but it is still hoped that the society can automatically assist the government in the investigation. After the statistics and investigations are accurate, the suffering of merchants can be reduced (warm applause). This is the most important thing, as the fundamental issue of national construction is also the most important thing for industry and commerce to seek self-development, progress, and soundness. It is hoped that the government can be especially assisted, so that it can soon have a nationwide and practical statistics. Many proposals have been passed at this conference, and I, on behalf of the government, tell you that the government will definitely do its best to reduce the suffering of the national industrial and commercial sectors and solve the current important problems of the industrial and commercial sectors based on what you have proposed (warm applause).

After the speech, Chen Qinshi, a representative from Zhejiang (Mr. Guo Fu's respected father, also the oldest representative at the conference), presented two petitions, one petitioning the government to promptly determine economic policies and rescue the national industrial and commercial crisis, and the other concerning tax matters. The conference requested three points: (1) Please ask the Chairman to issue an order to exempt the profit tax for the 34th year, (2) Permanently exempt the business tax on grain, (3) Severely punish corrupt tax officials. After the Chairman accepted them, he repeatedly said "good." At about 4:30 PM, he left the meeting hall amidst warm applause.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Federation of Commerce held a closing ceremony at 8 o'clock. Government leaders Pan Xulun and all representatives attended. After performing the formalities, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, saying that a total of 504 proposals had been discussed, and they would be handled separately to solve the pain of industry and commerce, eliminate the crisis, and assist the government in economic construction and complete the great cause of national construction. He hoped that all representatives would cooperate and work together to complete the mission. Pan Xulun delivered a speech, saying: The conference proposals make great contributions to the country, society, and commerce. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will carefully study those related to it, and do its best to help solve them, to promote industry and commerce and jointly achieve economic construction goals. Subsequently, Minister Chen of the Organization Department and Director Lu Jingshi of the Social Department delivered speeches. Finally, Qiao Senrong, a representative from Ningxia, gave a reply, and the conference adjourned amidst melodious music.

### Important Resolutions Passed Yesterday: Request the Government to Exempt the Profit Tax; Stop Japanese Ships from Illegally Entering Inland Rivers

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] At the sixth meeting of the National Federation of Commerce on the morning of the 6th, the discussion of proposals continued. When discussing donations and taxes, representatives from various places spoke enthusiastically on the request to exempt the profit tax. All agreed that if this matter could not be done, the conference's mission to alleviate the difficulties of industry and commerce would not be achieved, and the representatives would have made a futile trip, and there would be no way to repay the trust of the people in their respective places. They requested the conference to earnestly submit this to the government and appeal to Chairman Chiang, so as to achieve the goal. Some representatives even suggested suspending payment until the government made a satisfactory reply. The first issue discussed today was 81 financial proposals, most of which were passed smoothly. However, when discussing the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to give full play to the highly autonomous spirit of commercial organizations to automatically stabilize prices, the representative from Ningxia stood up and said: Everyone wishes for price stability, but the current price increases are all caused by the government's state-owned public utilities raising prices. The Ministry of Economic Affairs does not care about the rising yarn prices of its own China Textile Company, but orders merchants to stabilize prices. I don't know how to stabilize them. We are not profiteers, and our strength is weak. We can only rise and fall according to the prices set by the government. The passionate remarks won a lot of applause. There were a total of 74 proposals related to industrial and commercial organizations, the main ones being the establishment of the China Federation of Commerce Bank, requesting the Central Government to add one National Assembly representative to each of the 51 units attending the National Federation of Commerce, and requesting the Ministry of Communications to strictly order Japanese ships not to illegally enter inland rivers without permission. The conference also made important resolutions on the conscription issue, the main one being that conscription should be collected from the conscripted person's place of residence as a principle. In the afternoon, provisional motions were discussed, the most important one being the motion proposed by Wang Bingjun and 91 representatives from various provinces and cities, including Wang Xiaolai, requesting the government to promptly determine economic policies, improve financial measures, and focus on protecting production, developing trade and stabilizing people's livelihoods to rescue the national industrial and commercial crisis. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce proposed that in order to rescue the crisis in various industries, the government should grant employers the freedom to adjust employees, which was passed in principle. Detailed measures were left to the Board of Directors for discussion. Another proposal submitted by the association, requesting the relaxation of measures for transporting domestic cotton yarn to the south to benefit production, was resolved to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to revoke the ban on transporting cotton yarn to the south.

### Declaration of the National Federation of Commerce Conference: Points out Where the Current Pain of Industry and Commerce Lies; And Calls on All Parties to Prioritize the People

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The declaration of the National Federation of Commerce Conference was passed at the general meeting on the afternoon of the 6th. The declaration is divided into three parts. The first part points out the current pain points of industry and commerce, which are (1) the oppression of high-interest loans, (2) the dumping of foreign goods, (3) the depression of general business, (4) the heavy burden of donations and taxes, (5) the blockage of transportation, (6) the high cost of wages, (7) the shortage of power machinery and technicians; therefore, the following suggestions are made to the government: (1) to promptly determine economic policies; (2) to improve financial measures, abolish the Four Joint Offices, and the Central Bank to conduct rediscount transfers; (3) to establish a protectionist trade policy; (4) to clear transportation and promote inter-provincial trade; (5) to abolish the newly added commodity tax, simplify tax collection procedures, prohibit new levies, and fairly handle enemy and puppet properties. Secondly, the mission of the association and the working direction after the meeting are proposed as follows: (1) To support national policies, promptly promulgate laws and regulations, and lead national industrial and commercial figures to implement government economic measures; (2) To report the suffering of industry and commerce, relay it to the government, and request improvement, so that the lower situation can be communicated upward and eliminate the separation between the government and the people; (3) To establish industrial and commercial economic research institutions in the national economic center, and recruit economic experts from home and abroad to cooperate with the association, so that the association can establish the staff headquarters of the industrial and commercial sector, and theory and practice can be combined into one, and engage in nationwide economic investigation, reporting and design work for the reference of the association's members and people from all walks of life; (4) Moreover, the economic crisis that our country has encountered before still needs to be actively planned and rescued by us. The association should communicate the strength of the government and industrial and commercial circles in various places to jointly implement various standard programs for relief; (5) Overseas Chinese work hard to start businesses through diligence and thrift. In addition, they have suffered discrimination and oppression from the local government over the years, and their situation is very difficult. The association should communicate with the government and overseas Chinese industrial and commercial circles and strive to provide assistance to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and develop China's overseas economic power. Finally, the association calls on all parties and factions to prioritize the people, abandon prejudices, cooperate sincerely, turn swords into ploughshares, and turn戾气 into auspiciousness, so that the foundation of industrial and commercial enterprises can be laid, and the great plan of nation-building can be seen early.

### Chief Engineer of the Yellow River Restoration Project, Todd, Discusses Recent Developments in River Management: At Least Three to Four More Months Required for Completion

[Report from Our Newspaper] Todd, Chief Engineer of the UNRRA Yellow River Breach Closure and Embankment Restoration Project, said when meeting with reporters yesterday afternoon: "In 1938, the National Army breached the Yellow River near Huayuankou in Zhengzhou for strategic reasons, flooding two million mu of farmland in Henan and Anhui provinces. In December of last year, Todd, who was then working in the US Army Corps of Engineers, was invited by UNRRA to come to China to oversee the Yellow River restoration project. Todd is a river defense expert who came to China as early as 1919 to participate in the work of repairing the dikes of the Grand Canal. After that, he specialized in the study of the Yellow River issue. In 1941, he won the Rowland Prize from the American Society of Civil Engineers for his writings on the Yellow River issue. He is truly the most ideal candidate to preside over the Yellow River restoration project."

Reasons for the Project Delay

Todd said: "The Chinese government has expressed to UNRRA that if the Yellow River restoration project can be completed as soon as possible, wheat production can be increased by more than one million tons within a year. Therefore, UNRRA is urging it vigorously, and Todd set off for China immediately, happily seeing the Yellow River again after more than ten years of separation. The project officially started on March 1. It was originally intended to be completed before the summer flood season at the end of June this year. The work progressed smoothly in the months of April, May, June, and July, but the UNRRA river management equipment failed to arrive on time, and local labor and materials were insufficient. In addition, the government requested guarantees that the railway would not be damaged when transporting these heavy materials, and the Chinese Communists also requested UNRRA to make proper arrangements for the relief of 250,000 residents in the old channel (90% of which is in the Chinese Communist controlled area) after the Yellow River was diverted to the new channel because the residents would inevitably be displaced when the channel was restored. Therefore, for various reasons, the project was delayed. On June 28, the Yellow River flood began, washing away the railroad, and most of the work had to be stopped."

"In late October, the water level had receded, so work resumed in early November. The National Government has also ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to complete all work by January 5. However, judging from Todd's tone, he actually thought the deadline was too tight. According to his estimate, although the project is now being stepped up, it will still take at least three to four months."

Difficulties in River Management

Todd said: "The difficulty in river management lies in the fact that the project includes areas controlled by the government and the Chinese Communists. The embankment restoration project in the Chinese Communist-controlled area is currently 80% complete. The wages of river workers in that area are exactly the same as those of river workers in Henan Provincial Government territory. In mid-July of this year, Zhou Enlai, Jiang Tingfu, and UNRRA's Plass met four times to discuss the relief of 250,000 residents in the old channel. At that time, Todd also participated in the talks. At that time, the government paid the equivalent of US$16 million for relief, part of which was in materials and part of which was in cash. This matter has not been completely resolved. UNRRA's representative in China, General Edgerton, is making every effort to mediate, and Todd hopes to reach a satisfactory agreement in the next few days to facilitate the work."

Still a Stopgap Measure

Todd said that 300 miles of the entire project are in the Chinese Communist-controlled area, and 30 to 40 miles are in the territory of the Henan Provincial Government. The total cost of the project is estimated at between US$15 million and US$18 million. After the project is completed, China's annual wheat production can be increased by 7.5 million dan and rice production can be increased by 13.8 million dan. Todd said that limited by China's current economic capabilities, the current project is still a stopgap measure. If we want to fundamentally solve the Yellow River disaster, we must have several experts conduct detailed research on the ground for many years, settle on a plan, and collect huge sums of money before we can succeed. According to Todd's estimation, this will take at least ten years and cost hundreds of millions of US dollars."

### Negotiations on Relieving Refugees in Communist-Controlled Areas Have Not Reached an Agreement

Dong Biwu Talks About His Mission to Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chinese Communist representative Dong Biwu told reporters yesterday that his trip was specifically to negotiate the relief of 250,000 refugees in the Chinese Communist area during the Yellow River embankment restoration. He met with UNRRA General Edgerton and Ho Baoshu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, yesterday, but no agreement was reached. He may continue talks in Nanjing in the next few days. When Zhou Enlai came to Shanghai this summer, he discussed with Jiang Tingfu, Xue Dubi, and the then Acting Director of the UNRRA Representative Office in China, Mr. Lai, and agreed to allocate 15 billion yuan, part of which was in materials. It was originally scheduled to pay 4 billion yuan per month in August, September, and October, and 3 billion yuan in November, but so far not a single cent has been paid, and Director Ho said that he knew nothing about it and suggested discussing it again in Beijing. Dong said that the relief supplies needed by the Chinese Communists were clothing, medicine, and agricultural tools, and there was also a shortage of farming cattle. He also said that there were still 200 dangerous projects in the Chinese Communist area that had not been reviewed.

[Another Dispatch] The Capital High Court publicly tried Yu Jinhe (Yu Jin), the former Special Mayor of Beijing and Chief of Police in the puppet regime, today. Yu Jin's defense focused on the motivation for participating in the puppet organization, saying that his actions were based on four instructions from the Central Government: (1) to protect the people in the occupied areas, (2) to cover up the underground workers of the Central Government, (3) to rescue the arrested underground workers of the Central Government, and (4) to notify the underground workers of the Central Government in advance when he learned of their impending arrest, so that they could escape. There were letters from Wang Rui and Li Shizhai as evidence, and hundreds of favorable documents were presented. The case is scheduled to be judged on the 9th.

### The Chamber of Commerce Passes a Provisional Motion; Above Text Continues from the First Page

2.  Regarding Improving Financial Measures:

A.  Quickly establish land finance, actively use cooperatives to carry out large-scale low-interest agricultural loans to save rural areas. A warehouse system should be established as soon as possible, and cooperative organizations should be established and connected with the Farmers Bank of China, in order to strengthen the foundation of the rural economy. The Farmers Bank should fulfill its special mission as a specialized bank, cooperate with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to establish a concrete plan to revitalize rural areas and support the production and marketing of agricultural products, and allocate funds as needed without any restrictions.

B.  All banks should quickly establish large-scale low-interest industrial loans and allow machinery and real estate as collateral. It should not be limited to half the price of raw materials and finished products as the sole collateral for loans. The conditions should not be too harsh, and the procedures should be simplified.

C.  The Central Bank must truly act as the bank of banks, not engage in the business of ordinary banks. It should freely engage in rediscounting and re-mortgaging for legitimate loans for production and marketing, and not promote its business solely from a commercial perspective.

D.  The organization of the Four Joint Offices may have been necessary during the war, but the cumbersome loan procedures and lack of timeliness have caused great pain to the industrial and commercial sectors. To this day, the country views it as a major obstacle to reconstruction and development. It should be abolished immediately so that each bank can maintain its independence, complete its specialization, be classified, and be responsible for assisting industrial and commercial development, production, and trade.

E.  In terms of concept, do not misunderstand that the lending of production funds, which can indeed be used to increase production, is an inflation of currency. In fact, the proper use of funds to increase production has the actual effect of contracting currency and balancing prices. This is the basic concept of industrial finance and should be noted.

F.  It should be stipulated that the difference between deposit interest and overdue interest of banks should not be too large, so that deposit interest and overdue interest are close to each other, so as to collect social idle funds and put them into legitimate uses. The Central Bank should use the rediscount rate to gradually suppress interest rates, eliminate the black market, reduce production and marketing costs, and stabilize prices.

3.  Regarding Trade and Foreign Exchange:

A.  Based on the principle of protecting industry, the government should adopt a protective tariff policy as soon as possible. The tariffs on imported goods should be increased for the industries that should be protected to regulate them.

B.  Agricultural materials needed by the government and agricultural materials related to barter debt repayment should be purchased by the government according to the cost of production plus a reasonable profit to maintain production, even if a slight subsidy is needed.

C.  At present, domestic transportation is obstructed, and freight rates are surprisingly high, which often increases costs, stimulates prices, and makes it impossible to compete for exports. Freight rates should be reduced and exempted by category. State-owned transportation agencies should aim to develop trade, not solely focus on profits. Regarding transportation, maritime transport in the northeastern provinces and cities should be restored as soon as possible. The number of ships to Taiwan, South China, and North China should be increased as much as possible. Inland waterways and highway traffic should be dredged and repaired as much as possible to ensure the smooth flow of goods, communicate inter-provincial trade, balance prices in various places, promote the export of domestic specialties, and compete for the international market.

D.  The Nanyang market used to be the end of Japanese goods. Our country should seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to export cotton and silk fabrics as soon as possible to ensure the Nanyang market. All subsidy methods such as financing, interest reduction, and subsidies should be adopted as much as possible according to actual needs.

E.  For the investigation, guidance, and management agencies for developing foreign trade, such as the former Bureau of Industry and Commerce Visits, the Bureau of International Trade, and the Trade Committee organized during the Anti-Japanese War, we should adopt their strengths and make up for their shortcomings, and re-establish them to guide merchants in developing trade.

F.  Overseas Chinese work hard overseas. In the past, due to internal troubles and weakness, protection was ineffective. Now that our country has become one of the great powers, we must not allow insults or injuries to occur in the places where overseas Chinese reside. In addition, overseas Chinese work hard all year round, and the remittances they earn back to the country are a huge gain for our country's international balance of payments. We should provide them with as much convenience as possible and not allow them to suffer losses. We should order the overseas remittance agencies to pay attention to improvement at any time.

G.  The government should assist the private sector in purchasing new machinery from foreign countries to increase industrial equipment, and purchase industrial raw materials that cannot be supplied domestically. For all kinds of foreign exchange needed, the government should provide them with as much convenience as possible in terms of time limits and procedures, and give them full convenience according to actual needs. In addition, surplus materials transferred from friendly countries should be sold to merchants at open and fair prices. Those that meet industrial needs should be preferentially allocated to factories in the industry to encourage them.

4.  Regarding Donations, Taxes, and Others:

A.  At present, taxes and levies are heavy, which affects industrial production. The government should consider reducing or exempting commodity taxes. The business stamp tax should be stopped immediately. Tax rates that are too high should be reduced. Direct taxes should be simplified and levied to avoid harassment and embezzlement. Other illegal apportionments and requisitions in various places should be strictly prohibited.

B.  At present, there is a lack of power in various places, which affects production. The government should plan the overall situation, import generators from foreign countries as soon as possible, and effectively encourage private operation.

It is proposed that the government adopt and implement the above suggestions one by one, and hope that the government will hold a national economic conference, where the competent ministries and departments of the government will invite experts, scholars, and representatives of this association to participate together, so as to promote the implementation of the new post-war economic policy, complete economic construction, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Whether it is feasible, please decide publicly.

Proposers: Wang Bingjun, Wang Xiaolai, and 91 others. (End)

Editorial

### How to Suppress High-Interest Loans?

There is a public call from all levels of society to ban high-interest loans. The factual manifestations, or those in writing, are roughly the following:

(1) According to the Banking Deposit and Loan Management Regulations, the maximum interest rate is set by the local banking industry in various places, and reported to the local central bank for approval and implementation.

(2) In addition to the approved interest rate, no clever names may be created to collect additional fees.

(3) Crack down on underground money houses and prohibit general commercial firms from concurrently operating deposit and loan businesses.

(4) The central bank uses its financial power to gradually suppress market interest rates.

(5) National banks and bureaus appropriately release low-interest loans and undertake rediscount and re-mortgage businesses.

The above items (1), (2), and (3) are passive means; items (4) and (5) are active means. In this way, both the symptoms and the root causes are treated, and the authorities cannot be considered not to be working hard. However, what is the actual effect? The usual lending rate is still around 15%, and exceeding 20% is also often heard. Those forced to collapse by high-interest loans have recently emerged one after another, and the profits of general industry and commerce that have been completely exploited by high-interest loans are even more common. It can be seen that the above measures are either disobeying in public and obeying in private, ineffective in promotion, or are addressing the symptoms but not the root cause, and are of no help.

The fact is very obvious that various production loans have now been decided to be temporarily suspended, and the policy of tightening money supply and tightening currency is still consistently adhered to. In addition, the huge monthly tax revenue and the large-scale bidding and selling of materials and enemy-puppet industries all make the chips circulating in the market decrease rather than increase, and the Shanghai sources are recovered. Then, even if the above two active measures are not just empty talk, will their effectiveness not be completely offset?

Everyone knows that interest rates, like prices in general, are high or low entirely subject to the law of supply and demand. It is an extremely subtle thing to try to suppress interest rates while trying to tighten the money supply. Moreover, even though the money supply is tightening, prices are still soaring. Looking at the cost of living index announced by the municipal government is an ironclad proof. Since prices are high, the required intermediaries - currency - will naturally increase. At present, however, the currency is tight, and prices are rising. Other various expenses such as donations, taxes, wages, electricity, transportation, and even postal and telecommunications fees are almost all increasing. In this contradictory and complex state, how can high-interest loans be suppressed?

Therefore, if the authorities really want to suppress high-interest loans, we believe that in addition to seriously promoting the above five measures, the following points must also be implemented:

(1) Effectively suppress prices, especially saving all kinds of expenses of political and military agencies, and fundamentally reduce the amount of chips needed. Because the government is still the largest consumer at present.

(2) Temporarily return all or part of the deposit reserve of commercial firms in the central bank to increase the head of the various firms that can be rotated.

(3) Whether it is the lending amount or the lending procedures of the central bank or other national banks, they should be relaxed as much as possible. As long as it is convenient for industrialists and merchants to finance, the high-interest loans on the market will be suppressed without being suppressed.

The above are all necessary emergency measures; and the most important and fundamental method is still to use all efforts to stabilize the value of the currency, increase the general public's belief in legal currency, and make them happy to "save," directly increase deposits, and indirectly increase chips. Moreover, if the belief in the value of the currency is high, then the wind of speculation and hoarding will disappear, prices will also fall, and the market can be expected to stabilize. This discussion seems too ordinary; but you must know that the suppression of high-interest loans is an extremely ordinary thing, and you can only think from the ordinary to be effective and without drawbacks.

### Criticism of the New Japanese Constitution

The draft Japanese constitution, after more than three months of discussion in the parliament, was finally promulgated by Emperor Hirohito on the 3rd of this month, and will be implemented six months later. The Japanese people after the defeat were no different from being mired in darkness, so that even the most stubborn Japanese had to feel pessimistic about the future; but to this day, only a little over a year has passed, and a new constitution has been promulgated, and soon they can embark on the road of peace and democracy. In the eyes of the Japanese people, not only do they feel that the future of their motherland is promising, but from now on their self-confidence can also be completely restored. Therefore, the Japanese are very proudly boasting that this new constitution is "the highest standard constitution in the world." Supreme Allied Commander General MacArthur also declared: "The new Japanese constitution is a major step towards world peace, friendship, and normalcy." In other European countries, the perception of the new Japanese constitution is that the promulgation of the new Japanese constitution is enough to symbolize Japan's hope of starting to get on the right track.

Recalling that after Japan surrendered last year, the Allied powers repeatedly announced the purpose of controlling Japan, which was to democratize Japanese politics and make it one of the peace-loving countries in the world, no longer invading other countries and threatening world peace and security; MacArthur, based on this policy, moved step by step towards the goals set by the Allied powers, whether it was the disarmament of the armed forces, the withdrawal of defense, the closure of the munitions industry, the reorganization of heavy industry, and the re-education of the people, to thoroughly eliminate the Japanese people's aggressive thinking, all of which have achieved considerable success. This promulgation of the new constitution is another major step forward for the democratization of Japanese politics, which no one denies. However, studying the content of this new constitution, there are many uniquely innovative places. The full text has a total of 103 articles, but to summarize, it is nothing more than the following characteristics: (1) maintaining the Japanese Emperor as a symbol of national unity; (2) the parliament still adopts a bicameral system; (3) implementing universal suffrage, and women also have the right to vote; (4) declaring the rights and obligations of the people and their basic democratic freedoms; (5) declaring that war is not used as a tool to promote national policy. Comparing this with the "Imperial Constitution," no matter from which angle it is observed, it has made great progress, and it is truly an epoch-making democratic constitution for Japan. However, in our view, the promulgation and implementation of the new Japanese constitution is not worth overemphasizing, and we must still take a considerable reserved attitude toward Japanese politics in the future.

First, the preamble to the new Japanese constitution states: "The Japanese people hope for lasting peace, and have full confidence in the noble consciousness of maintaining human relations; we are determined to entrust our security and survival to the justice and the good faith of the peace-loving people of the world. We wish to restore our inherent glorious position in the international community and devote ourselves to maintaining peace and abolishing autocracy; and recognize that all people have the right to live in peace and have freedom from terror and want." At the same time, Chapter 2 stipulates the method of renouncing war and rearmament, declaring that Japan yearns for international peace based on justice and order, and opposes the use of war as a tool to promote national policy. Although these clauses are full of the atmosphere of peace and democracy, and are uniquely innovative, enough to set a precedent for other countries to draft new constitutions in the future; but is this new constitution the true intention of the Japanese people? Is it disguised peace? Is it disguised democracy? Empty words are not enough to believe; it depends on the actual situation in Japan in the future? Japan must strive vigorously on the road of democratic innovation to complete the various principles stipulated in the constitution. Today, countries around the world not only hope that Japan will replace the old bottle with a new label; but also hope that Japan's internal political institutions can have a thorough transformation.

Second, a good constitution must be suitable for its national conditions. Turning over the political systems of various countries, they are all the result of natural evolution over hundreds of years, each with its own characteristics and shortcomings, and there is no absolute superiority or inferiority. However, if the constitution of Country A is implemented in Country B, it cannot be implemented because it is not suitable for Country B's national conditions. Comparing the content of the new Japanese constitution with the actual life of the Japanese people, it is no different from going in opposite directions. Therefore, we really dare not have too much extravagant hope for the future of this constitution. The Yorkshire Post of the United Kingdom commented on the new Japanese constitution, saying that "the new constitution promulgated in Tokyo is not the Japanese constitution, but the American constitution." Although this comment is inevitably too extreme; but it also has considerable truth, worthy of deep consideration by MacArthur himself and the American authorities.

Third, although the new Japanese constitution is full of beautiful ideals, its purpose is only to make others believe that Japan is already a peaceful and democratic country; but in reality, Japan's potential power is still preserved; Japan has only been more than a year since its surrender, and Japan has been striving vigorously day and night in silence, and is about to restore its old appearance. Not only will its manufactured products flood the world market, but it will also restore its inherent position in the international community. However, Japan's revival and re-emergence not only make China deeply uneasy, but also threaten peace in the Far East. Therefore, we must not ignore Japan's potential power, which is restless under the smoke screen of peace and democracy and attempts to make a comeback, and we should be especially vigilant; and take precautions at any time.

### Wujin Central Trust Bureau and Enemy Property Office Sell Scrap Iron Fraud Case; Transferred to Wuxi for Trial after More Than Two Months of Delay

[Our Newspaper Wuxi News] The case of the Central Trust Bureau and the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau in Wujin, which caused a sensation for selling a large amount of scrap iron fraudulently, was accepted for trial by the Procuratorate of the Local Court of this county at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th under orders. The defendants were Zhao Shuyi, director of the Changzhou branch of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, Yun Junshi, director of the Wujin branch of the Central Trust Bureau, Cha Bingchu, chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and Zhu Daoming. The respondents, including Shi Xuren, deputy speaker of the Wujin Provisional Senate, Sheng Xingfu, secretary-general of the county party headquarters, and Yu Yiqin and Meng Jutang, also arrived in court as summoned. On the Procuratorate side, due to the major corruption case involved, Chief Prosecutor Ma personally opened the court. It is reported that on August 18 this year, the Wujin Office of the Central Trust Bureau, entrusted by the Changzhou Branch of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, sold a large amount of scrap iron. The scrap iron was identified by members of the Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association as including items that had been forcibly requisitioned by the enemy army, totaling more than 360 tons. The manufacturers had already discovered the original items and could not sit idly by and let them be sold. The association sent a letter to the Wujin Office of the Central Trust Bureau requesting a temporary suspension of the sale. On the one hand, it submitted a letter to the county government requesting a transfer to prevent the opening of the bidding. However, at that time, the Wujin Office of the Central Trust Bureau did not approve it and still held the bidding on the original date. Members of the Dyeing and Weaving Association requested to participate in the bidding, but were not allowed to do so. On the same day, 500 tons of scrap iron were sold by bidding. Director Zhao of the Enemy Property Office entrusted Zhu Daoming to estimate the price in advance, at 40,000 yuan per ton. As a result of the bidding, Meng Jutang of Zhenhua Iron Factory won the bid with 91,400 yuan per ton. Later, for the property rights relationship of its members, the Dyeing and Weaving Association petitioned the Wujin County Provisional Senate to quickly seek effective prevention. After receiving the petition, the association believed that the case was highly suspicious and sent the entire case to the Wujin District Procuratorate for investigation. Subsequently, the relevant persons were summoned to the court, and after several interrogations, it has been delayed for more than two months and has not yet been resolved. Later, the Wujin District Court submitted an application to the High Court to transfer the case to the Wuxi District Court for handling. The court hearing lasted for four hours that day, and ended at around 7 o'clock. As a result, Chief Prosecutor Ma believed that there was insufficient suspicion and ordered all of them to be sent back for verification.

### Director of Jiangsu Provincial Field and Grain Office Inspects Grain Collection, Convenes Business Review Meeting in Suzhou

[Report from our Suzhou Office, 6th] Mr. Hong Qishen, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Field and Grain Office, recently arrived in Suzhou from Zhenjiang with his staff to guide grain collection. Our reporter visited the hotel to inquire about the situation of grain collection in Jiangsu Province, and received the following statement: The government, in view of the needs of military, political, economic, and social aspects, has decided to continue collecting grain in kind for this year's field tax, hoping to meet military needs and control a large amount of grain to regulate grain prices nationwide. The original tax amount in this province was more than 38 million yuan, which was collected at 40%, equivalent to more than 3.8 million shi of rice, more than 37,400 shi of wheat, and more than 13.76 billion yuan in legal tender. The standards for converting the tax are determined according to the actual production situation in each region. Specifically, Tongshan and Donghai counties collect wheat, and Nanhui, Taicang, Jiading, Fengxian, Baoshan, Nantong, and Shanghai counties collect cotton. However, legal tender is actually collected for the conversion. The remaining 28 counties, including Suzhou, Wujiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Songjiang, Kunshan, Yixing, Danyang, Qingpu, Zhenjiang, Liyang, Jiangning, Jintan, Jurong, Liuhe, Jinshan, Jiangdu, Chongming, Piaoshui, Taixian, Jiangpu, Gaochun, Chuansha, Yangzhou, Yizheng, Jingjiang, and Changzhou, all collect rice. Standard market scales are uniformly distributed by the provincial office after being verified by local legal entities to prevent malpractice. The reporter then inquired about the grain collection in the newly recovered areas in northern Jiangsu, and received the answer: Of the 38 counties and cities in northern Jiangsu, except for Jiangdu and other 8 counties and cities that have not been affected by war, which collect grain as usual, the remaining 30 counties are full of scars and almost reduced to scorched earth. The provincial government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan for exemption, which may be approved, to give farmers in northern Jiangsu a chance to recuperate. Mr. Hong also stated at the end: Grain collection is expected to be the norm this year, and it may be possible to restore the old system before the war next year. Mr. Hong convened a meeting of all district chiefs and cadres at all levels in the county government yesterday to hold a review meeting on field and grain affairs, and a concrete plan has been discussed for the development of the work. He will soon transfer to Wujiang, Danyang, and Kunshan counties to inspect and supervise.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: Having recently read a "Wuxi News" item in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month, reporting on a conflict between students of the 17th Army Officer Corps and Wuxi Railway Police, the content is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to detail the actual course of events as follows: On November 1st, Luo Biao, a student from the 42nd Company of the 6th Battalion of the 17th Corps (originally stationed in Shitangwan), came to the Corps headquarters to complete his discharge procedures. When returning to his unit, while passing through the station, he saw a railway policeman beating an old woman from the countryside and arbitrarily insulting her. Student Luo Biao, deeply disturbed by this, stepped forward to offer some gentle advice, but the railway policeman was rude and unreasonable, and argued back, leading to a quarrel. Many people on the platform gathered upon hearing the noise and rushed forward without asking the reason, surrounding and beating Student Luo Biao, and detaining him in the Wuxi Police Team. At that time, a few students at the station heard the news and came to help, intending to rescue their detained classmate with their bare hands. Unexpectedly, the railway police officers and soldiers, relying on their weapons, acted as if facing a formidable enemy, firing their guns incessantly. At that time, Commander Tao happened to be attending a meeting at the Wuxi City Defense Headquarters, and rushed to the scene to stop it, in order to avoid causing trouble. However, the railway police officers still did not put away their weapons and ignored Commander Tao's persuasion. Commander Tao first ordered the students to leave the station and sent the injured students to Puren Hospital for treatment, and Deputy Commander Chen and both parties resolved the matter, and the matter came to an end. Unexpectedly, the next day, a few students brought their families to Wuxi for shopping, and as soon as they got off the train, another misunderstanding occurred with the railway police there, who immediately opened fire, and a student from our corps was injured and fell to the ground, and the order on the platform was in chaos. Later, Commander Tao rushed to the scene again to restore order and await resolution. Commander Tao specially went to each battalion for several consecutive days to earnestly instruct each student, who all obeyed orders and remained in their units, and there was no undisciplined action. Unexpectedly, yesterday, a few newspapers at sea published news that was completely contrary to the facts. The manuscript was clearly inconsistent with the facts. It is found that all officers of the Army Officer Corps are adhering to the national plan for nation-building and military reorganization, and are obeying orders to be demobilized. They should have been properly resettled by the state long ago, but since the victory, the political situation has been unsettled and internal strife has continued, so the plan for military demobilization has not been completed as scheduled. Most soldiers have been under training for nearly a year, with difficult lives and mental distress, but most can remain calm and self-disciplined. Even if one or two people act slightly differently, it is difficult to avoid in human nature. Soldiers have always received meager treatment, and when interacting with the people, they inevitably have the trouble of borrowing housing and furniture, and riding third- and fourth-class trains without tickets, which has caused them to be despised by society, indifferent to the suffering of soldiers, and often enjoy reading "soldiers causing trouble" news, which is really regrettable! Soldiers fought for eight years in the War of Resistance, shedding blood and sweat. After the victory, they were suddenly demobilized, and not only were they not sympathized with by society, but they were cursed by the people. We, officers at all levels, have tried our best to advise and exhort them on their situation and mood, and we sincerely hope that our journalists will show them sympathy and guidance. (Zhang Fangcheng, Commander of the Second Battalion, Representative of Students of the 17th Army Officer Corps of the Central Training Corps)

[Reuters, New York, 6th] The Republican Party, with the slogan "The American people have clearly had enough," has gained a very clear advantage in the House elections. The Republican Party also claims to have obtained a majority of seats in the Senate election, enough to overwhelm the Democratic Party. Although the final results have not yet been fully tallied, the absolute advantage of the Republican Party seems to be beyond doubt by this morning. The most surprising result was the re-election of New York Governor Dewey, who won more than 500,000 votes more than his opponent, an unprecedented record. Dewey's becoming the Republican candidate in the 1948 presidential election seems to be a sure thing. After his victory, he said: "The American people have indicated that what they want is not a government that tries to become the master of the people, but a government that serves the people. In this election, the people are choosing between two governments of different natures and different doctrines." In the New York Senate election, there was a surprise upset. The Democratic candidate, Lehman, the first director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, was defeated by the little-known Ives. The Republican Party also gained ground in the southern states, which have traditionally been Democratic strongholds. Bricker, a strong competitor of Dewey in the Republican presidential nomination race, also won a record number of votes in Ohio and was elected as a senator. Warren, another strong competitor of Dewey in the party, was also re-elected as Governor of California without difficulty.

### Future of Congress

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The biggest problem facing the next Congress, which will almost certainly be controlled by the Republican Party, will be wartime controls on the economy and legislative proposals to ease labor-management friction. Republican leaders have long anticipated that this election could restore the glory of fifteen years ago and regain control of both houses, so they have scheduled a series of meetings before the opening of the 80th Congress on January 3 next year to determine policy. However, because Democrats still firmly occupy the White House, Republicans must either persuade President Truman to accept their program or find enough votes to pass legislation to override the President's veto. This is no easy task and requires a two-thirds majority in both houses. Each house must decide the following questions: (1) The extension of conscription is due to expire on March 15 next year, and closely related to this issue is the government's firm insistence on implementing a permanent compulsory training program, which will spark heated debate. (2) The merger of the Army and Navy is another issue, which the government will face sharp opposition from the Navy. (3) Accelerating the housing construction program is another major challenge, especially for housing for veterans. (4) Reduce high wartime tax rates. (5) Reduce government spending and balance the budget, which the Republican Party will receive assistance from the Democratic Party. Congressman Martin is expected to become Speaker of the House. Because the Republican Party has an advantage in Congress, President Truman may once again propose most of the programs inherited from Roosevelt, advocating the establishment of a permanent Internal Fair Employment Committee, the abolition of poll taxes as a voting requirement in federal elections, the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the expansion of social security laws.

Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on US Elections

[United Press, Moscow, 5th] The Red Star newspaper today commented on the US elections, saying that there is no longer much difference between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, as can be seen in the country's tough policy toward the Soviet Union. The Democratic and Republican parties seem to be constantly fighting, but their real purpose is nothing more than to prevent the formation of a third party. The rise of right-wing groups in the United States has a dangerous result, namely, as Premier Stalin said, those who are allied with Churchill will have increasing influence in American foreign policy. These dangerous warmongers will strongly shelve Roosevelt's policies and replace them with Vandenberg's atomic diplomacy. Fortunately, Molotov's speech at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday greatly encouraged progressive Americans. Friends of peace around the world hope that all progressive elements can unite and continue to promote Roosevelt's peace policy.

### Unprecedentedly Enthusiastic Voting

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The weather was clear everywhere in the United States today for the election, and people were enthusiastically voting, enough to break records. Voting started in the East, followed by the Midwest, and then the West.

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] In today's elections for the governors of 47 of the 48 states in the United States, and for members of Congress, the number of voters who went to the polls ranged from 35 million to 40 million. This year's Congressional elections will elect 432 members of the 80th Congress and 35 senators and 33 governors. Maine is the exception, having elected one senator, three members of Congress, and the state's governor in September. Across the United States, there will be lists of 854 candidates from major parties, and the Democratic Party will clearly lose to the Republican Party. According to neutral political analysts, the Republican Party will dominate and control the House of Representatives. Even in the Senate, the 17-seat difference with the Democratic Party may also be broken, obtaining a similar number of seats. If the Republican Party wins, it will have a major impact on Truman in the final year of the 80th Congress and in the 1948 presidential election. Although the Democratic Party's control of the federal administration has not ended, this will end the party's sixteen years of control of Congress and will effectively cut off the Democratic Party's domestic policies. Although the Democratic Party's foreign policies may still be sustained for a while as various parties express their differences, because the United States is the leader of world politics. Although this development is a domestic matter, it should also have repercussions globally. In short, a Republican victory will separate the administrative and legislative branches of American politics. This separation will make it difficult to cope with the international situation in times of crisis, and it will also be difficult to feel the need for legislative action in the face of domestic tensions. The results of today's election will also largely determine Truman's chances of success in the presidential election two years later, and will have an impact on the political future of the Republican nomination in 1948, especially New York Governor Dewey.

### Repercussions in Public Opinion of Various Countries

[United Press, San Francisco, 5th] It is rare for the world to pay such great attention to this year's US elections. British newspapers discuss the separation of powers in American politics in complex terms, and the tone is full of criticism that this system is outdated. A Soviet journalist believes that the differences between the Democratic and Republican parties are not significant, and that American foreign policy is tantamount to taking a firm stance against the Soviet Union. German newspapers predict that regardless of the outcome of the election, American isolationism has come to an end. The Soviet Union is concerned about the growth of this firm American foreign policy toward the Soviet Union. British concern is sharpened by its reliance on foreign trade. Increasingly socialist England is exerting its highly organized strength to regain this trade. A French newspaper summarizes foreign opinions as follows: "The winning party will have the best chance to choose its party member to be the new president of the United States for future elections. The talent of the master of the White House in 1948 is indeed related to the fate of the United States, and even the fate of the world."

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Continues, Listening to Italy's Southern Statements, Southern Representatives Prepare to Propose New Plan, US-Soviet Dispute Over Trieste Port Very Fierce

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] The four foreign ministers will hold an extremely important meeting today to listen to the statements of the Yugoslav representative on the Italo-Yugoslav issue. The Southern representative will propose a completely new draft for resolving the Italo-Southern disputes. Political observers believe that if Britain, the United States, and France believe that the Southern proposal is worthy of consideration, then the Soviet Foreign Minister may strongly urge it to be accepted. If so, the main friction between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States may be eliminated.

[United Press, New York, 5th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today apparently decided to make a last stand to bring the disputed port of Trieste into the Eastern European group. The foreign ministers of the four countries held their second meeting in New York today to discuss the five-nation peace treaty, and the Trieste port issue was still the most difficult.

[United Press, New York, 5th] US Secretary of State Byrnes insisted at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today that Yugoslavia could not enjoy the various rights of the Italian peace treaty unless it signed the treaty. Britain agreed, while France opposed. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov accused Byrnes of nothing less than submitting an ultimatum to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but Byrnes denied it. The two sides were unable to resolve the dispute and decided to postpone the discussion.

### US Proposal for Disarmament: Draft Amendment

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] Regarding the issue of universal disarmament among nations, it is reported by well-informed sources that senior government officials and politicians in the United States are currently studying a plan based on the recent statement made by the head of the US delegation, Austin. This plan will be submitted to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council for discussion. Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union formally proposed to the United Nations General Assembly days ago, advocating for universal disarmament among nations. The plan that the United States intends to propose will be presented in the form of an amendment, advocating for supplementing the shortcomings of the Soviet proposal with a monitoring system. This plan is essentially the first step towards reconciling the plans of the US and the Soviet Union and achieving consistency.

US Chief Delegate Austin delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly on the 30th of last month (United Press, no-cost Telex)

### The Netherlands Sends Note to Four Allied Governments, Requests Adjustment of Dutch-German Border, Seeks Mining Rights to Compensate for Economic Losses

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Dutch government tonight notified the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, requesting a revision of the Dutch-German border and compensation from Germany for economic losses. The notification indicated that the Dutch government is prepared to limit its land claims to only some border adjustments, and intends to make economic loss compensation the primary demand. The demands of the Dutch government are as follows: (1) Certain mineral resources on the left bank of the Rhine River in Germany will be granted to the Netherlands for mining rights, for a period of forty to fifty years. The Dutch government attaches great importance to obtaining this concession, as the need for coal can be balanced, and the implementation of industrial plans can be further assisted. (2) Transportation fees for German railways, highways, and waterways, as well as port and warehouse fees, should be regulated to prevent unfair competition with Dutch ports. (3) Germany is prohibited from excavating new canals to change the existing waterways of the Rhine River. (4) The Dutch government believes that Germany's monetary policy should be based on the principle of not harming its major interests. The notification continued, stating that the Dutch government is in principle opposed to expanding its territory by annexing the land of others. However, due to the repeated creation of difficulties by the original Dutch-German border in the past, it is forced to request some border adjustments. The Dutch government has considered the following points in this regard: (1) Shortening the border line, (2) Improving local transportation, (3) Partially improving canals and waterways. One of the results of the border adjustment is that the length of the Dutch-German border line can be reduced from 825 kilometers to 340 kilometers. The land that Germany will cede to the Netherlands as a result should not exceed 1,750 square kilometers. Among them, 119,000 German residents, except for prominent Nazis, will be allowed by the Dutch government to continue residing in the area if they resided there before mid-January 1940.

### If the German Question Reaches a Deadlock, A Four-Power Summit May Be Convened

[United Press, London, 6th] British government authorities stated today that if the Foreign Ministers' Conference fails to reach a basic agreement on the future of Germany, they will "actively consider" inviting Truman, Attlee, Bidault, and Stalin to hold a meeting. However, this four-power summit will only be considered if the Foreign Ministers of the four countries reach a deadlock on important issues.

### United Nations Headquarters: Either San Francisco or New York
Belarusian Amendment Rejected

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened today and passed the US proposal to use San Francisco or New York as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations. However, this decision is not final, as the General Assembly has not yet discussed it, and any representative has the right to propose an amendment. When the General Committee convened yesterday, the representative of Belarus proposed an amendment advocating for the relocation of United Nations institutions to Europe, which was rejected by a vote of seven to two, with three abstentions. The President of the General Assembly, Spaak, declared on the spot that moving the United Nations headquarters to another country would be a major political mistake.

### South Africa Requests Annexation of Southwest Africa: Indian Representative Firmly Opposes, Should Be Managed by the United Nations to Achieve Independence Soon

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] The Trusteeship Committee of the United Nations General Assembly convened tonight to discuss the issue of the Union of South Africa's request to annex Southwest Africa. During the meeting, Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai, the representative of India, delivered a speech opposing South Africa's request, stating that South Africa's move violated the principles of the United Nations and was a retrograde action. During the transitional period before the complete autonomy of each mandate territory, it should be managed by United Nations institutions. The Trusteeship Council must be established promptly to promote the early independence of the trust territories. Regarding the trusteeship agreement drafted by the United Kingdom for its mandate territory of Tanganyika, it is a unilateral action. There are as many as 30,000 Overseas Indians in that area, and the United Kingdom did not consult with India in advance, which is unreasonable. The trusteeship agreement must stipulate a time limit. In the past, the actions of various mandate nations in handling the political education of residents in their mandate territories have often been slow. The African natives of the various mandate territories are not on an equal footing with European expatriates in politics and society, and the political rights of African natives are extremely limited, all of which should be improved. The representatives of France and the Netherlands then delivered speeches, stating their determination to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter.

### Condemnation of Actions to Eliminate Ethnic Groups: Resolution Included in General Assembly Agenda

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 6th] The General Committee of the United Nations passed yesterday, by a vote of ten to two, the proposal submitted by India and Cuba regarding the case of the elimination of ethnic groups and religious practices, and included it in the agenda of the Plenary Session of the General Assembly.

### Land Dispute Between Vietnam and Siam Resolved
Siam Returns 70,000 Square Miles to Vietnam

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Prince Souphanouvong, Advisor to the Kingdom of Laos, stated this morning before boarding a French plane to Paris with Prince Sisowath Youtevong of Cambodia, that Siam has abandoned its territorial claims to Vietnam and has agreed to return approximately 70,000 square miles of disputed territory to Vietnam, Cambodia, and the two kingdoms of Laos. Details of this agreement will be announced by French Ambassador Payart within two weeks. It is revealed that these negotiations concluded a few days ago, with the participation of representatives from both Siam and Vietnam, as well as French Ambassador Payart and US Assistant Secretary of State Acheson.

### Discovery in Alaska: Floating Corpse of Ancient Giant Beast

This proposal was recently put forward by the Soviet representative at the Allied Council for Japan.

### Communist Party in Manila: Linked to the Hukbalahap Resistance Army - Announced by Philippine Interior Minister Zulueta -

[Central News Agency, Manila, 5th] Regarding the connection between the Hukbalahap Resistance Army and the Chinese Communist Party here, there have been new discoveries recently. Philippine Interior Minister Zulueta announced that, according to the report he recently received from the Chief of Constabulary, there is sufficient evidence to show a connection between the Chinese guerrillas and the Hukbalahap Resistance Army. This is because it was discovered that Hukbalahap leader Taruc had extracted 10,000 pesos from the 100,000 pesos donated by the Chinese community in Luzon. In addition, the local Chinese Communist leader, said to be Huang Jie, the commander of the Chinese guerrillas, in addition to using 1,000 pesos to entertain Taruc, 100 pesos to give to Taruc's wife, and 10 pesos to buy flowers, also extracted 62,000 pesos from the Chinese community donations. Therefore, it is known that there must be a connection between the two armies.

### The Debauchery of Hitler
At Least Five Women in His Bed Every Night

[Agence France-Presse, Dusseldorf, Germany, 5th] Stories of Hitler's debauchery during his lifetime are becoming increasingly bizarre. Previously, there was a rumour that Hitler had an affair with the wife of his propaganda minister, Goebbels, and had an illegitimate child. Now, according to the recent confession of Hitler's confidant, Giesler, Hitler had at least five women in his bed every night. The German Gestapo searched for and continuously presented beautiful women to Hitler.

### Wanted: Chen Binhe and Wu Yue; The Public Prosecutor's Office Detailed the Crimes of the Two Traitors in the Indictment: Attacking the Central Government and Deceiving the People in the Occupied Areas; Both Advocated for the Enemy and Puppet Regimes and Hindered the War of Resistance

[Reported by this newspaper] The Public Prosecutor's Office has already sent letters to military and police agencies in recent days, requesting assistance in apprehending the two traitors Chen Binhe and Wu Yue to be brought to justice for interrogation.

[Another Report] Chen Binhe, Wu Yue, Jiang Zhixin, Li Hanshan, Lu Huishan, Shen Qiaosheng, Li Chungen, Chen Boming, etc., have recently been prosecuted by the Public Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of being traitors. Sheng Shiming, Lin Wenzhen, Wei Dezhang, etc., were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.

The indictments of Chen Binhe and Wu Yue are published below:

Defendant Chen Binhe, male, age and origin unknown, president of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper, at large. Wu Yue, male, age and origin unknown, editor-in-chief of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper, at large. The aforementioned defendants are involved in Case No. 195 of the Special Investigation for Traitorous Suspicions in the 35th year of the Republic of China. After investigation by this prosecutor, it is deemed necessary to initiate a public prosecution. The facts of the crime, evidence, and applicable legal provisions are listed below:

Before the Pacific War, defendant Chen Binhe colluded with Japanese strategist Major Kazuo Wachi in Hong Kong, engaging in intelligence work for the enemy. After the fall of Hong Kong, he was introduced to Shanghai by Major Wachi and was connected with Su Sen, a Taiwanese councilor of the enemy's Katayama Agency under the leadership of Agency Chief Katayama, tasked with gathering intelligence on our central government. He sent the intelligence to the agency's office at No. 517 Hualian Hotel in this city every day. Because Chen had rendered meritorious service to the enemy, on December 8, 1942, he relied on the enemy's power to coerce and seize the Shen Bao newspaper, becoming its president and receiving a monthly subsidy of 500,000 military yen from the enemy's Army Department. Subsequently, Chen initiated the organization of the Shanghai Press Association, serving as its chairman and also as a consultant to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The opinions expressed in the puppet Shen Bao, which he operated, aimed to support the enemy and puppet regimes' Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, serving as a tool for the enemy and puppet regimes, assisting evildoers, and specializing in propaganda for the enemy and puppet regimes, attacking the central government, and deceiving the people in the occupied areas. Defendant Wu Yue served as the editor-in-chief of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper from May 1, 1945, also using his writing to produce propaganda that was beneficial to the enemy and puppet regimes. After the enemy country surrendered, he and Chen Binhe fled without a trace on August 11, 1945. This is specifically reported in accordance with the law.

The fact that the defendants served in the aforementioned puppet positions and committed the crimes has been verified and confirmed. There are proofs from the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Department, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the Shen Bao newspaper's replies. Also included are the article "Chen Binhe's Reply to Readers" published in the puppet Shen Bao on June 29 and 30, 1944, submitted by the Central Statistics Bureau of the Shen Bao newspaper, and the article "Chen Binhe's Discussion on China's New Unification" published in the Wen You magazine. His false and heretical arguments are too numerous to mention. In particular, the article that lightly criticized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of our National Government to curry favor with the enemy was serially published in the puppet New Shen Bao and puppet New China Daily for more than ten days. It was absurd and unprecedented, truly heinous and extremely sinful. Defendant Wu Yue, as the editor-in-chief of the puppet Shen Bao newspaper, colluded with Chen Binhe in writing editorials, both advocating for the enemy and puppet regimes and hindering the War of Resistance. According to Article 2, Section 7 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, those who serve as presidents and editors-in-chief of newspapers within the jurisdiction of the puppet organization and produce propaganda for the enemy and puppet regimes should be subject to strict reporting. The defendants incited the people to flee and defect to the enemy, and transmitted and investigated news related to military, political, and economic matters, all of which are included in treasonous acts. It should be recognized that they have committed the crime of conspiring with enemy countries to resist this country under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Section 1 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. A public prosecution is initiated in accordance with Article 1, Sections 1 and 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Regulations and Article 230, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Jiang Gongliang, Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court.

### Original Judgment of Yuan Ludeng Revoked, Retrial to be Held on the 14th

[Reported by this newspaper] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court for the crime of treason. The Supreme Court has now ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case for a new trial. The High Court has scheduled Judge Qiu HuanYing to hold a hearing on the morning of the 14th of this month at 9:30 AM to question him.

### Zhang Diesheng and Gu Zhuming: Trial Temporarily Suspended

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Diesheng, former general manager of the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, was reported after the victory by Yu Yunfeng, the former deputy manager of the factory, who alleged that Zhang had collaborated with Gu Zhuming to weave yellow military uniform cloth and white sanitary cloth for the enemy. The Public Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution in this case, but both Zhang and Gu have unknown addresses and could not be summoned. Therefore, the two defendants did not appear in court during the first investigative hearing held by the High Court. The case was heard again yesterday afternoon, and both defendants still did not appear. The defense lawyer hired by the defendant's family, Zhi Li, stated that Gu Zhuming is currently in Xi'an and will arrive in court soon. The presiding judge informed them that an arrest warrant had been issued for the defendant in Xi'an, but he had not yet been arrested. Before the arrest is made, the trial of this case will be temporarily suspended. After the statement, the court adjourned.

Zhu Yicai: Aiding the Enemy with Steel

Zhu Yicai, chairman of the Yangzhou Zhenyang Electrical Company, is accused of collaborating with the enemy after the fall of Yangzhou, reusing Japanese nationals Saburo and several ronin. He sold more than 200 dan of steel to the enemy's Xinye Company to aid the enemy. In addition, he served as a supervisor of the enemy's Central China Aviation Co., Ltd. The case was investigated in court yesterday afternoon. The defendant stated that he is 64 years old and from Wuxi. After the fall of Yangzhou, the Japanese did not take over the Zhenyang Company. It was still run by Chinese people, just like before the war. No Japanese ronin were reused in the company. Saburo was a section chief and was only responsible for purchasing coal from the Japanese in Nanjing. He did not advise on other administrative matters. The sale of scrap iron was handled by manager Zhu Hanfu, and the Xinye Iron Factory was not opened by the Japanese. The defendant never served as a supervisor of the enemy's Central China Aviation Co., Ltd. After the interrogation, the defendant was returned to custody.

Two Traitors: Aiding and Abetting the Enemy

In addition, Russian man Baodexi served as a secret agent for the enemy's Harbin Gendarmerie after the fall of the Northeast on September 18. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he worked in the Criminal Section of the enemy's Gendarmerie at the Broadway Mansion in Shanghai, specializing in interrogating arrested foreign nationals. He often demanded money from various gambling dens by relying on the enemy's power. In addition, Zhu Linsheng, the puppet Bao chief of the 20th Bao in the Second District of Shanghai, was a disciple of Lu Ying. He conscripted laborers to help the enemy build factories. Both of the above cases were investigated in court yesterday and were postponed for further interrogation. Zhu Wenbin, son of Zhu Linsheng, who served as the squad leader of Wu Shibao's special agent team and the chief of staff of Zhang Beisheng's puppet army, has fled to avoid punishment.

Ding Bochu to be Sentenced on the 13th

The case of Ding Bochu, the puppet town chief of Caoxing Town in Shanghai County, was also concluded on the same day and is scheduled to be sentenced on the morning of the 13th of this month.

### Communist Area Instructor Robbing Homes
Enemies Meeting on a Narrow Road, Victim Coincidentally Encountered

[Reported by this newspaper] Jiang Laihe, the former instructor of the New Fourth Army District in Northern Jiangsu, was stationed in Wujian Township, Taizhou on March 16 this year. He led more than 600 Communist soldiers to surround the nearby towns and villages, looting all the grain owned by rural farmers such as Ju Rubi, and slaughtering all pigs, sheep, and livestock. He also forced Ju to hand over 80 shi of grain, with a ten-day deadline. Before leaving, he also moved away all the boxes, cages, and furniture. At that time, Ju was unable to comply with the order and had to dismantle and sell the house. Under these circumstances, Ju felt that it was not easy to make a living and fled to Shanghai. Through a friend's introduction, he worked as a laborer in a factory on Tokyo Road and Macau Road. Unexpectedly, when he was returning home from work (living in Hengfeng Road, Zhabei) yesterday afternoon, it was a case of enemies meeting on a narrow road. He happened to meet Jiang Laihe on the way, and he immediately handed him over to the police on duty and detained him at the Zhabei Branch Bureau. At the same time, witnesses Shu Zhenxiang and Sun Yiting arrived at the scene to testify, confirming the facts. After the preliminary hearing, Jiang Laihe was taken into custody and sent to the local procuratorate for investigation this morning.

### Autumn Property Tax and Construction Surcharge Collection to Begin Today

Printed Payment Slips Distributed to Residents

[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Finance Bureau, to facilitate the collection of property tax and municipal construction surcharge, previously sent out a declaration form to each household to investigate the actual monthly rent from July to December of this year for calculation purposes. It is reported that the bureau will begin collecting the autumn property tax and municipal construction surcharge for the 35th year of the Republic, starting today. Payment slips in triplicate, printed in red, white, and blue, will be delivered to each household by special messengers. Upon receipt, residents should sign or stamp the delivery book of the bureau. The red slip serves as a notice, to be retained by the acting municipal treasury bank; the white slip is a receipt, to be stamped with the bank's receiving seal and date, and returned to the payer; the blue slip is a report, to be stamped with the bank's received seal and date, and sent to the Property Tax Section of the Finance Bureau for accounting and filing. The payment slip specifies the resident's name (if blank, the resident should fill it in on all slips), the landlord's name, the property address, and the property's classification. The bureau has separately designated three classes: A, B, and C, estimating the rental value in the 26th year of the Republic and the actual rent. The resident should pay the full amount of the autumn property tax for the 35th year (borne by the landlord) and the municipal construction surcharge (borne by the resident), and then deduct the property tax from the rent.

Upon receiving the payment slip, residents should, within the specified period of fourteen days, submit the payment or a check along with all three slips to any payment location listed on the receipt. If paying by check, it must be a crossed check payable to "Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau," and mailed by registered post, together with the three payment slips, to the Tax Collection Office of the Central District at 180 Fuzhou Road. A receipt will be issued within ten days and delivered to the resident. If the check is not drawn by the payer, the payer must endorse it.

Households that fail to pay within the deadline will be subject to a late payment penalty. For delays of less than one month, a penalty of one-tenth of the tax due will be added. For delays of less than two months, three-tenths will be added. For delays exceeding two months, five-tenths will be added, and legal action may be taken to recover the debt. Payment locations include: (1) 180 Fuzhou Road, (2) 80 Madang Road, (3) 28 Fulu Li Road, (4) 1 Lafayette Road, (5) 94 Jessfield Road, (6) 1762 Haig Road, (7) 1461 Xin Zha Road, (8) 788 Seymour Road, (9) 456 Avenue Road, (10) 130 Haining Road, (11) 265 Changyang Road, (12) 558 Jiangpu Road, (13) 50 Jiujiang Road.

### Pornographic Song and Dance Films a Thing of the Past: Hollywood Changes Style; Dialect Dialogue Unpopular; Small Films Expected to Penetrate Rural Areas

[Our Newspaper Report] Those who appreciate the art of film will likely not overlook the recent announcement by the agent of MGM, Mr. Luo, regarding the company's two new filmmaking plans: one is to add audio tracks with narration in the language of the screening location to existing films, and the other is to produce small, 16mm films.

The "Tarzan Goes to New York," which was recently screened at the Grand China Theater, was an experiment with the former plan. Readers may recall that the theater advertised the film with Mandarin dialogue as a selling point. However, the audience was greatly disappointed, as the entire film was not dubbed in Mandarin. Instead, a third-person narrator described portions of the dialogue. This failed to synchronize with the actors' lip movements, resembling the old silent films. The audience did not welcome this. After this attempt, MGM's Shanghai office reported the failure to its American headquarters, deeming this approach unsuitable for Shanghai. This is because Shanghai audiences generally possess a reasonable level of English proficiency, and the essence of artistic films lies in the dialogue. If simplified narration in Mandarin is used, the original meaning will inevitably be lost and the experience will be uninteresting. However, it is said that the headquarters is still considering this, as they believe that this type of reform can attract audiences who do not understand English, thereby promoting sales.

The other plan, involving 16mm films, aims to develop markets in small cities and rural areas. These small films are extremely easy to transport, and the screening venues do not need to be elaborate. It is reported that some small cities in southern China have already signed contracts with MGM. It is expected that British films will soon penetrate rural areas.

According to film industry insiders, Hollywood's filmmaking style has been changing since the end of the war. During the war, due to the need for entertainment in the military and the relative shortage of personnel and materials, a large number of crudely produced pornographic song and dance films and sensational slapstick films were released. Now, there is a gradual shift towards the production of artistic films, with a focus on quality rather than quantity. Examples include "Casablanca," "The More the Merrier," and "The Bells of St. Mary's," all of which were produced in 1945 and recently screened in this city. The old films produced during the war and accumulated in this city have been gradually cleared out after more than a year of screenings. At the same time, the US government has imposed quotas on film exports, so most of the films shipped to China will be new films. Starting next year, the films screened in this city are expected to be completely new.

### Goods Swindled with Bounced Checks, Stolen Goods Recovered, Perpetrator at Large

[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Guangqin operated Hengtong Shenzhuang inside Tongchenghang at 42 Wufu Lane. One day at around 3:30 PM, Cao Xinxian, the owner of Daxin Alkali Factory at 47 Wujia Lane outside the Dadongmen in the Nanshi district, purchased 600 bags of American alkali powder at 26,500 yuan per bag, totaling 15,900,000 yuan. At that time, four trucks from the Dalu Transport Company at 14 Xinyong'an Street successively went to the warehouse of the China Industrial Bank on North Suzhou Road to pick up the goods and drive away. Cao Xinxian, lacking cash, only provided two checks dated November 4th from Yisheng Shenzhuang at 10 Waitan, totaling 9,000,000 yuan and 1,450,000 yuan, and one check dated November 3rd from Guohua Bank, drawn by Xietai, with a face value of 5,450,000 yuan. To his dismay, all of the checks were returned unpaid when they matured. After Wang searched for Cao Xinxian without success, he realized he had been intentionally defrauded and reported the matter to the Laozha Police Precinct. The Criminal Division ordered officers Feng Xiushan, Liu Zongtong, Song Jiabao, and others to investigate based on leads from the Dalu Transport Company, and discovered that Cao had transported the goods to Xinyu Warehouse at 81 Yanghang Street. They raided the location and recovered 300 bags of alkali powder stored under the name of Jiutaihe and 41 bags stored under the name of Daxin. Another 246 bags were found at Baolai Warehouse at 5 Huangdai Street, stored under the name of Taiji. Thirteen bags are still missing and the investigation is ongoing. Cao Xinxian has not yet been apprehended.

### Li Jinglu Inspects Shanghai Yesterday, Instructs on Shipping and Transportation Issues, Strictly Prohibiting Black Market Ticket Price Adjustments

Li Jinglu, Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, came to Shanghai yesterday to inspect navigation administration. He instructed various leaders of the shipping industry on issues such as adjusting shipping routes, promoting shipping construction, organizing a disaster relief transport office, and taking over the Water Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Regarding the adjustment of passenger ticket prices on various shipping routes, he stated that the originally set prices were indeed too low. Since March 1st of this year, eight months have passed without adjustment, while the price index has soared and shipping costs have increased several times compared to March. For example, the price of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee has risen from 24,000 yuan per ton to 100,000 to 120,000 yuan, and the price of diesel has risen from 34,000 yuan per ton to 168,000 yuan. The prices of other hardware, ship crew salaries, dock fees, and passenger meals have all increased three to ten times. Previously, the Ministry of Transportation received a request from the Shipping Industry Association to adjust ticket prices and, after careful consideration, taking into account both shipping costs and passenger burdens, decided to increase the prices on the Beiyang route by two times the original price, and short routes such as Shanghai-Yangzhou by one time the original price. Other routes will be reviewed after detailed investigation. Starting this month, all public utilities have raised prices due to cost factors. There are fewer regular passenger liners in China, and in the past, due to excessively low ticket prices, shipping companies were unwilling to purchase passenger ships to avoid losses, which hindered the maintenance and development of water transportation. To promote the increase of regular liners, the government has approved a reasonable adjustment of ticket prices. However, the sale of black market tickets, whether by scalpers or shipping companies, is strictly prohibited and will be severely punished according to the law upon discovery.

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Freight Rates to Be Verified in Nanjing

Mr. Li Jinglu also attended a meeting of the board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday.

Director Li presented the report to the ministry for verification. Mr. Li returned to Nanjing by overnight train last night, and the issue of shipping ticket prices is expected to be resolved in the short term.

Shanghai-Nantong Vessels Have Not Raised Prices

Regarding the news reported yesterday that private cargo freight rates on the Shanghai-Nantong route had been raised, Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, solemnly stated to reporters that this was completely inaccurate. It is claimed that the current freight rate from Shanghai to Nantong is only 12,200 yuan per ton, which is the price set on March 1st of this year. It is even lower than the barge fee for crossing the Huangpu River, which is extremely low. It has not been increased at all in the past nine months. However, costs such as stacking and labor have increased many times, which are generally paid by the shipping companies. The cost of navigation has also increased sharply. The shipping companies operating on this route have tried their best to support it, and there has been no private increase in freight rates.

### Slap in the Face as Payment for Fare, Gun Pulled and Pedestrian Injured

[Our Newspaper Report] At 11:30 PM last night, four or five people arrived in three pedicabs at the entrance of the Zhengfeng Hotel on Guangdong Road. A dispute over the fare arose, and the hotel manager came out to mediate, resolving the issue. Subsequently, a companion hired a rickshaw, and a dispute over the fare arose again. The passenger not only slapped the rickshaw puller but also drew a gun from his waist and fired a shot. The rickshaw puller escaped unharmed, but a stray bullet struck a pedestrian, Gu Zhongqi, in the back, piercing through his chest, and he collapsed to the ground. After the incident, his companions scattered. The perpetrator was apprehended by nearby street police and taken to the Laozha Precinct for questioning. He identified himself as Zhou Fuyun, 29 years old, from Henan Province, and claimed to be a member of the tax police investigation team. The team leader, Xu Yapeng, had recently opened a room at the Central Hotel, room 325, two days ago, and the four or five companions were there to discuss official business. He claimed that the shooting was accidental. The injured man was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and his life is said to be in danger.

### For the Sake of an Actress, Vendors Gathered and Engaged in Armed Brawl

[Our Newspaper Report] At 10:00 PM last night, a brawl broke out between two groups of vendors at the intersection of Yunnan South Road and Zhongzheng Road. Each side gathered twenty or thirty thugs, and iron rulers and knives flew indiscriminately for twenty minutes. As a result, two vendors from the Yunnan South Road group were injured and collapsed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the fruit vendors from the 16th Pu group fled in all directions. After the incident, the injured were taken to Nanyang Hospital by car. The Taishan Road Police Station received the news during the brawl and dispatched a red patrol car. However, when they arrived at the scene, both sides had dispersed. The identity of the perpetrators is still under investigation. One of the injured, Yuan Derong, 21 years old, from Ningbo, sustained three knife wounds to his buttocks and one knife wound to his penis. The other injured, Ren Zhimin, 20 years old, from Ningbo, was injured by an iron ruler. The reason for the brawl was that the previous night at 11:00 PM, Wu Amao (16 years old), an actress who performs Yue Opera at the Great World Amusement Park, was harassed by vendors in Yunnan South Road. Vendors from the 16th Pu group saw the injustice and intervened, leading to a quarrel and an agreement to meet last night to settle the score.

### Young Man Deceives with Lead Buckets in Front of Shanghai Bank

[Our Newspaper Report] Yu Kunhua, 33 years old, from Shaoxing, makes a living selling boat buckets and lives at 133 Haining Road. At around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, while carrying lead buckets in front of the Minfu Bank on Tianjin Road, a well-dressed young man in his twenties suddenly approached him and inquired about the price of the lead buckets. He replied that each bucket cost 7,000 yuan, totaling 77,000 yuan for eleven buckets. The young man, without hesitation, took all the lead buckets and said, "Come with me to get the money." Yu followed him. When they reached the entrance of the Shanghai Bank, the young man told Yu to wait outside. Yu, unsuspecting, saw the young man carrying the lead buckets into the bank.

### Bank Association Suggests Using Remittance Checks Instead of Drafts, and Bank Checks Instead of Promissory Notes

The use of balance lines on promissory notes and drafts is not applicable, as stipulated by law, and recently, the Ministry of Finance has also issued clear instructions. However, the holder of the note seems to have little protection, especially for drafts circulating in distant places, which must be complete and secure. The banking community felt the importance of this issue, and the Bank Association commissioned the Banking Association to conduct a detailed study. The Banking Association now suggests using remittance checks instead of drafts and opening bank checks instead of promissory notes. An abstract of the draft method is as follows:

Name: (1) "Remittance Check" is the internal name, while the external name remains "Check." (2) "Bank Check" has the same name internally and externally.

Style: The style of "Remittance Check" and "Bank Check" should be similar to ordinary checks, but the color should be different from other checks of the bank (format omitted).

Applicable Accounting Subjects: (1) The accounting subjects applicable to "Remittance Check" follow the practice of drafts. (2) The "Bank Check" follows the "Promissory Note" subject, but the subject is divided into three sub-items for processing: "Sight Promissory Note," "Term Promissory Note," and "Bank Check."

Loss Reporting and Payment Suspension Methods: The loss reporting and payment suspension methods for "Remittance Check" and "Bank Check" are handled in the same way as for drafts and promissory notes.

### Future of Greater Shanghai: A Beautiful Dream, A World-Class City with a Population of 15 Million, Urban Planning Committee to Discuss Century-Long Plan Today

The Shanghai Urban Planning Committee will convene a general meeting of its members at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, the Finance Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Social Bureau, and national engineering experts, responsible for designing and building the urban plan of Greater Shanghai, will participate to discuss and determine the overall plan for Greater Shanghai. According to sources at the East China News Agency, the overall plan for the construction of Greater Shanghai can be divided into three parts: (1) Natural Construction, (2) Economic Construction, (3) Social Construction. Since this plan concerns a century-long undertaking, its overall plan must be carefully reviewed before being drafted. To accurately understand the current situation in Shanghai, five investigation principles have been formulated: (1) Investigation of the Greater Shanghai Area, (2) Investigation of the City's Population Residence, (3) Investigation of Industry and Commerce, (4) Transportation Investigation, (5) Public Utilities Investigation. The above five investigations include statistical capacity observation of the city, the current housing situation, and the use of the city's rivers. Currently, the city can only accommodate a population of 5 million people. The planned area will be expanded to a world-class metropolis capable of accommodating 15 million people. In this plan, the Shanghai area extends east to Pudong, south to Nanhui, west to Longhua, and north to Jiangwan Dachan. Currently, traffic congestion and transportation difficulties are caused by the concentration of people in the city center. In this plan, Pudong will be designated as a residential area, the city center as a commercial area, and the outer suburbs as industrial areas. As for the three constructions, the natural construction mainly belongs to material and geographical construction, such as fixed material constructions such as roads, docks, houses, parks, public transportation, etc., and attention will be paid to the development of the port, the connection of railway airports and highway main lines, so as to become the hub of various land, sea and air transportation. Then, it will be coordinated with the distribution of various industries and commerce, and the setting of residential areas, schools, parks and public constructions, as well as cultural and other social constructions. As for economic construction and social construction, they will be determined on the physical basis, and must take into account the economic and social development, and be practically matched with the current actual needs. The detailed plan will be discussed further today.

### Committee for Frugality Movement: Promoting Electricity Conservation, Encouraging Everyone to Sleep Early and Rise Early, Mayor Wu Suggests Seven Points

The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Frugality Movement held a standing committee meeting yesterday at 5 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Attending were Mayor Wu Guozhen, Speaker Pan Gongzhan (acting), Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian (acting), Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue, Party Secretary of the Municipal Headquarters Lei Jizhang Xie Renzhao, Peng Zhenqiu from the Education Bureau, Zhu Yunda from the Health Bureau, Cao Jun from the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, Jiang Baolian from the Lishi Society, Xu Jiqing from the Chamber of Commerce, Xi Yushu from the Guild of Accountants, Feng Youzhen (acting) from the Journalists Association, Qian Jianqiu from the Women's Association, Tang Shichang from the Local Associations, Bu Ruhan from the Municipal Sports Association, and Lu Gancong from the YMCA, among over ten others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. After the formalities, Mayor Wu stated the significance of the meeting, hoping to use the power of the people to promote electricity conservation. He hoped that the Municipal Committee for Frugality Movement would assist the government in launching this campaign. Following this, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau elaborated on the current situation of electricity conservation and future conservation methods, stating: Although the electricity restriction measures have been implemented, some waste is still unavoidable, especially in shops and public places. However, it is difficult to enforce conservation. It is only appropriate to use publicity and public opinion to make citizens aware of the importance of electricity conservation for national revival and reconstruction, and to conserve electricity voluntarily. Five methods for voluntary conservation are:

(1) Promote the use of fluorescent lights in places where lights are on for extended periods. (Fluorescent lights are easily damaged if switched on and off too frequently, so they are suitable for places where they are used for long periods.) (2) Promote turning off or reducing the number of lights when there is no need for lighting. (3) Promote early rising and early sleeping to conserve electricity. (4) Organize inspection teams to provide guidance and advice to public places, factories, and shops. (5) Reduce door lights and increase streetlights. Mayor Wu then made more concrete suggestions, stating: The most important time for electricity conservation is from 5 PM to 9 PM every day. There are three effective and practical improvement measures on the proactive side: (1) Retrofit fluorescent lights, which should be implemented especially in major stores. (2) Reduce the number of light fixtures, with standards of reducing 100 lights to 75 lights, and 40 lights to 25 lights. (3) Reduce the number of light bulbs, with standards of removing three out of ten, and one out of three. There are four measures on the passive side: (1) The committee should send letters to the Chamber of Commerce instructing all stores to implement electricity conservation, and the names of violators will be published in newspapers. (2) The committee should send letters to the general affairs and personnel departments of all government agencies to be responsible for implementing electricity conservation, and the names of violating agencies will be published in newspapers. (3) The committee should send letters to the district offices, requesting that they instruct the Baojia system to inform each household. (4) The committee should send letters to the Youth League to organize electricity conservation persuasion teams to go to various stores and residential areas starting from the 11th of this month to advise on conservation. All committee members present agreed, and the meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Opinions of Electricity Experts: Limiting Residential Lighting Does Not Help Increase Production; The Real Time of Electricity Shortage in This City is During the Day; The Fundamental Problem is Still Not Enough Machines

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding electricity restrictions, the Shanghai Electric Power Company will issue the first batch of notices within this month, including users with both electric heating and lighting meters, and commercial electricity users. The restriction amount for ordinary household lighting users will be notified later. The main cause of the electricity shortage in this city is the machine problem, and the most serious time of the daily electricity shortage is in the morning, lacking 17,000 kilowatts, and in the afternoon, lacking 10,000 kilowatts. There is no panic about electricity at night. Therefore, electricity experts in this city believe that limiting the amount of electricity used by residential lighting to increase industrial production is inconsistent with the actual situation in this city. Because no one uses electric lights during the day, and electricity is not lacking at night. The time of highest daily electricity consumption in this city is from 6 PM to 7 PM, so the power company hopes that the public will conserve electricity during that time.

### Guangfuhui Branch Reports Future Work

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Special First Branch of the Guangfuhui held a reception for the press of this city at the Jingu Hotel yesterday at 3 PM.

Then, Lu Mang reported on the history, future work and mission of the association, and its relationship with various parties. It was briefly stated that the Guangfuhui has a history of more than 50 years. The earliest initiators were Zhang Taiyan, Xu Xilin, and Qiu Jin, who made great contributions to overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and restoring China. After the founding of the country, the association's affairs gradually stagnated. Last November, the association established its headquarters in Chongqing, with the aim of revitalizing the association's affairs and working together to build the country. As for the association's mission, it is divided into political and social aspects. In the political aspect, the first is to promote the national movement, awaken national consciousness, enhance national health, and promote world peace. The decision is to promote the democratic movement, pay attention to local autonomy, universal democracy, and complete true democratic politics. In the social aspect, it is to innovate people's livelihood concepts and implement a planned economy. It also stated that the association and the Kuomintang are brotherly relations, and at the same time, it will work hand in hand with all political parties that advocate nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. After the report, Huang Kede, a representative of the Chongqing General Association of the association, delivered a speech, and the meeting adjourned at 4 PM.

### Land Registration Deadline is the 10th of This Month

[Report from this newspaper] The Land Administration Bureau has been handling land registration in the six districts of Huangpu, etc. in this city, which has been very smooth. The absolute majority of land owners residing in this city have already registered. Many people residing in other cities have also submitted official documents to the bureau stating the reasons. However, because the registration procedures for public land, foreign land, and enemy-puppet land have not been completed, the bureau has not yet been able to compile land statistics for this city. After the extension period for land registration ends on the 10th of this month, the bureau will compile a list of ownerless land. In addition, the bureau will issue a notice within a few days, declaring that all past old property certificates are invalid. As for the registered land, the bureau will issue "Land Ownership Certificates." Since the handling of land registration began, due to the heavy workload, the relevant departments of the bureau have selected specialized personnel to form a "Review Office" to accelerate the land review work.

### Stealing "Tip" When Picking Up Goods; Customs Inspector Prosecuted

[Report from this newspaper] Yu Chongxing of the Hengxingrui Cloth Store in this city went to the Nanmu Warehouse of the Jianghai Customs in September of this year to pick up cotton cloth. He temporarily found that two pieces of cotton cloth were missing. According to regulations, he could not pick up the goods when the actual quantity of goods did not match the quantity stated on the warehouse receipt. However, because Yu Chongxing was eager to pick up the goods, he asked Xie Yaoming, a customs inspector of the Jianghai Customs, to sign and certify the missing goods for future negotiation, and allow him to pick up the remaining cotton cloth first. Yu Chongxing then indicated that he would steal a "tip," and gave Xie Yaoming 1.5 million yuan in cash at the San Warehouse of the warehouse as a tip. Xie was caught by a high-ranking official of the Jianghai Customs while receiving the money, and Xie was detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was deemed that the crime was indeed committed, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday for fraud and embezzlement.

### Buying and Hiding Guns; Confiscated and Sentenced According to Law

[Report from this newspaper] At around 9 PM on August 10th of this year, a U.S. military soldier suddenly came to the Xiexing Embroidery Shop at No. 166, Section 14, Henan Road, and peddled a pistol. At that time, only Shen Huanrong, a 19-year-old apprentice in the store, was present and was very afraid when he saw it. He then took out 40,000 yuan in legal tender, and the U.S. military left the gun and took the money. After Shen Huanrong got the gun, he hid it in Zhang Han's (female) room. The next day, it was discovered by the Huangqing Sub-bureau, and the gun was found. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. Shen Huanrong, Zhang Han, and the store owner Zhou Juting were prosecuted by the prosecutor for endangering public safety and knowingly buying stolen goods.

Shen Huanrong denied intending to buy it, saying that he was afraid and gave 40,000 yuan with the intention of getting the U.S. military to leave. Zhang Han confessed that she was asleep when Shen came to deposit the gun, so she did not know what it was. Zhou Juting said that he stayed at home in the evening and did not know anything at all. The court considered that it was the first offense and gave a lenient sentence. Shen Huanrong and Zhang Han were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment. If they were to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at 500 yuan per day. Zhou Juting was found not guilty.

Houjiatan Engineering Facilities: A Large Bridge to be Built on the Huangpu River; Design Not Yet Completed

Eagerly Hoping for UNRRA to Provide More Materials; $500 Million Loan Principally Agreed Upon

This reporter interviewed Hou Jiayuan, the head of the Engineering Planning Team of the Executive Yuan, yesterday, and asked about various issues such as the transportation materials transported to China by UNRRA, the $500 million loan, and the construction of the Huangpu River Bridge. According to him: UNRRA has transported 32 train engines, more than 400,000 sleepers, and various other materials to help the development of China's transportation industry. However, the country's railway transportation is riddled with holes, and there is a special need for equipment. It is eagerly hoped that UNRRA can provide more active and large-scale assistance. Although Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi and other provinces in our country also produce sleepers, it is estimated that the annual output next year can reach more than one million, but it still cannot meet the needs of the national railway. Regarding the US loan of 500 million yuan, according to Hou, the principle has been agreed upon by both China and the United States, and it can become a reality once the domestic political situation is stable. In order to provide reference data, the Engineering Planning Team specially dispatched personnel to inspect the transportation business in various parts of the country. The investigation has now been completed, and the details of this investigation will be rushed to print reports and a list of schedules, which will be submitted to the government as a reference for loans. In the future, the team's work plan will still focus on investigation, design engineering and promotion and implementation, so that the national railways, highways, and transportation projects can be gradually completed in accordance with the established plans. Regarding the construction of the Huangpu River Bridge, the Engineering Planning Team has decided in principle to build an active bridge in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River, and an underground tunnel in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, which is the commercial district of this city. The design and budget of the project are the responsibility of the China Bridge Company. As soon as the design is completed and the funds are approved, construction can begin. However, the completion period is expected to be two to three years later.

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Yearning for Old Love

Asked by Zhang Sufang

A friend of mine, Ms. So-and-so, got engaged to Mr. So-and-so in the 29th year of the Republic. Mr. So-and-so used to have a mistress. Although Mr. So-and-so published a notice to sever the cohabitation relationship before the engagement, they still cohabitated after the engagement. My friend believes that marriage is related to lifelong happiness, so she intends to propose to dissolve the engagement. I have a few questions to ask for answers. (1) Is it legally permissible to sever the relationship after publishing a notice and then cohabitate again? (2) Is it reasonable to file for dissolution of the engagement? Is it legally permissible? (3) Does the woman have any compensation liability to the man? (Engagement expenses and assistance)? (4) Does the man have any liability to compensate the woman for prior losses?

[Answered by Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) There is no clear provision in the law, but if the woman who has been engaged to him marries the man, and the man engages in this behavior, it is a crime. (2) If one of the parties to the engagement commits adultery after the engagement is concluded, the other party may dissolve the engagement. This is clearly stipulated in Article 976, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 7 of the Civil Code. (3) If the woman is not at fault, she has no liability for compensation. (4) If the woman is not at fault, she can request compensation from the man for damages. This damage is not limited to property damage.

(2) Spilled Water Cannot Be Recovered

Asked by Shi Jianwu: I married Ms. Huang in the spring of the 26th year of the Republic through a matchmaker. At the beginning of the marriage, the relationship was quite harmonious, and we had a daughter. However, due to the war and unemployment, I was trapped in my hometown. Ms. Huang could not endure poverty. When the whole family returned home from refuge in the autumn of the following year, she made excuses to return home, abandoned our infant daughter who was not yet one year old, and left and never returned. Now, after more than four years, I have remarried Ms. Zhu and have a son. Ms. Huang suddenly returned. At that time, my mother was still alive, and she was turned away by my mother. Then, after my persuasion, she left. Her whereabouts are unknown. If she comes back one day, (1) can I directly deny that she is my wife? (2) There is a clear provision in the law that husband and wife should fulfill the obligation of cohabitation. Since she is unwilling to fulfill the obligation of cohabitation and has been absent for more than five years, can it be considered a voluntary abandonment of the rights of husband and wife? Can I be held liable under the law? Is my bigamy crime established? (3) Is it necessary to publish a statement in the newspaper now? Because I have never gone through any procedures, and I have not published a statement in the newspaper either.

[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) She left her husband and did not return for several years, which has constituted grounds for divorce. Moreover, the love and righteousness between husband and wife has been severed by her, so it is difficult to treat her as a wife again. (2) As described in the letter, the man has no responsibility in morality or in law. Remarrying does not constitute bigamy. (3) A statement should be published in the newspaper to sever the relationship between husband and wife and describe the whole story, so as to avoid her illegal activities abroad, which may cause unexpected entanglements.

### Recombination Committee Adjusts Allotted Yarn; Count Not Applicable; Setting Up Exchange Still Under Consideration; Those Who Did Not Apply Before Please Add More

[Report from this newspaper] The yarn allocation committee of the Cotton Yarn Recombination Industry Association is responsible for the allocation and sale of cotton yarn. The second batch of 5,626 pieces and 25, totaling 6,002 pieces and 908 of the standard 20 count, were issued yesterday. Because it was the first time, the textile building and various private yarn mills had changed the payment time. It is said that the payment must be cleared before the close of the market on Saturday. The textile building entrusted the Bank of China to collect the money, which was closed at noon. The private factories were extended to the afternoon. The distribution standard is still the same as the previous decision. However, the count of yarn from the yarn mills is not exactly the same as the last time, so the type and quantity of yarn that each factory has been allocated will also be slightly different. Generally, there is a surplus of coarse yarn and a shortage of fine yarn. There was a surplus of 10-count coarse yarn last time, and this time the surplus will be even greater. How to handle it next time is still subject to the decision of the Textile Management Committee. According to Mr. Shihao, the person in charge of the recombination committee, many colleagues from various guilds did not have time to participate in the second sale because of the urgency. Now, according to the declaration, the unallocated factories have been re-examined, and a list has been prepared and reported to the Textile Management Committee, requesting an increase in the allocation and sale. As for the actual amount of the previous sale, a list has been prepared and reported. For the previous sale, the recombination committee never forced the factories to accept the allocation, and it was clearly stated to each factory that even if they gave up, their allocation qualification would not be cancelled. However, each factory felt interested because it was a new creation, and most of them accepted the yarn allocated by the association. However, the count of yarn from the yarn mills did not match the predetermined plan, and there was a shortage of fine yarn, which was mixed with coarse yarn. Of course, it cannot be fully met in practice. The recombination committee is planning to set up an exchange to facilitate the exchange of each allocated household. The recombination committee is based on the degree of opening for the yarn usage quantity of each factory as the allocation standard. The recombination committee authorities also believe that improvements are needed due to the declaration being made in advance and the incomplete investigation. Recently, various associations have been inspecting and reviewing at random. According to the heads of various associations, the recombination committee reported that the crackdown on resale is extremely strict. If the allocated yarn exceeds the quantity, it will be deducted from the allocated quantity in the next period. The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has also allocated and sold some dyeing factories that have always prepared yarn for self-dyeing, but has convened a meeting to strictly restrict the price increase and resale. It is said that the allocation quota for this factory has been reduced this time, and the reduced quota and the surplus quota are used as return orders, and will not be transferred again. It is said that the number of return orders last time was more than 300 pieces in each association. In addition to a large number of return orders for 10-count yarn this time, there are also many remaining orders for 32-count cone yarn. The operating expenses required by each association have been reported to the Textile Management Committee for collection from each factory. Mayor Wu once ordered the yarn factory industry to return the yarn price collected by the black market for over-ordered yarn to customers. According to Mr. Pan, the recombination industry believes that it is not necessary to do so uniformly.

### The Market's Speculative Atmosphere Is Quite Strong; Gold Price Rises Another 60,000

Spot gold continued to rise, with brisk customer sales creating a very firm market atmosphere. The morning opened strongly at 2.4 million, and initially fluctuated around that price. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 120 bars at 2,400,250 each. Afterwards, buying interest intensified, with individual buyers carrying gold away, actual sales remaining robust, and buyers actively participating. Although there was some supply, it was not readily available. The price rose to 2,435,000 near midday, hovering around 2,430,000 at noon. In the afternoon, market sentiment grew even more bullish, with increased speculation. Next-day transactions rose to 2,460,000, resulting in a further increase of 65,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were priced up to 2.46 million. Silver bullion remained steady, while silver dollars saw a slight rebound. Illegal interest rates were around 15%. Foreign currencies remained stable, solely driven by the gold market's momentum. U.S. dollar black market rates were between 4,100 and 4,150, slightly higher than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars strengthened slightly due to the stimulus of the gold market, but because telegraphic transfers remained loose, the rise was weak, eventually recovering ten dollars. There was no clear direction for Hong Kong currency, with transactions at 865 considered relatively frequent. Indian currency traded between 1,045 and 1,055. British currency was around 14,000. U.S. dollar official rates remained unchanged, and reciprocal transactions had not yet commenced.

### Government Bonds Plummet

Government bonds plummeted yesterday due to reports that the National Defense Council had proposed a two-for-one arrangement for pre-war fixed-term deposits, leading to a sell-off by long positions. Unified bonds (Type C) opened in the morning at 1,500, immediately facing sell-offs from speculative long positions and firms like Fuyuan. The price soon plummeted to 1,170 before being supported by a certain firm on the eighth floor and Chengde. At noon, the price hovered around 1,250, resulting in a decline of 360 compared to the previous close. Types A, B, and D each fell 230, while Type E also dropped 150, with transactions reaching 5 million.

### Cotton Cloth Evaluation Committee to Discuss Retail Prices Today

### Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise; 20-Count Yarn Rises 30,000-40,000; Cloth Prices Up 1,000-2,000

[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market continued to show strength. Although various customer groups added to their orders, the quantities were small. Cantonese customers were still interested in heavy-weight yarns. In addition, weaving factories were making up for unfilled northern sales, so market sentiment grew firmer. The "Double Horse" brand once again reached a high price of 2.25 million. The "Tianfu Woman" brand from Tianjin and Yingkou was particularly strong due to extremely tight supply. Although the price slightly retreated at the close, the foundation was very firm. As a result, 20-count yarn rose another 30,000 to 40,000. Fine yarns remained sluggish. Customer sales in the cloth market also slightly improved. Afternoon market prices rose by 1,000 to 2,000. Counter sales on the street gradually became more active, but goods from the Textile Construction Company did not see improvement, mostly selling at breakeven prices. Spot goods were slightly higher, with "Dragon Head" fine cloth selling for 80,000 and "Blue Chicken" for 77,000.

### Last Month's Check Clearing; Bounced Checks Set New Record

### Despite Many Covering Short Positions in Chinese Stocks, the Market Shows No Improvement

Chinese stocks saw buying interest weakened as the Securities Exchange authorities were unable to schedule deferred settlement auctions, pending approval from the Ministry, disappointing buyers. However, continuous short covering led to rangebound trading despite declines. At the opening, stocks showed signs of weakness, with long positions closing and pushing prices lower, but prices were rangebound, and short covering occurred after declines, resulting in an uncertain situation. Both buyers and sellers traded sporadically, lacking significant activity. From 11:00 to 11:30, prices gradually rose after declines, with numbers 166, 97, and 198 all seeing short covering, briefly rising above the opening prices, but it was fleeting. In less than five minutes, sell-offs resumed. Under the combined pressure of sporadic supply, prices fell again after 11:45. Compared to the previous close, popular stocks such as Yong Yarn, Meyer, Trust Harmony, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell slightly to half a percent. Cold stocks such as Datong Matches, Yonggong, Luoan, Wuhe, and Jinglun Underwear remained stable, with China Textiles rising slightly, and the rest declining slightly. The afternoon saw a stagnant situation, with light trading. Only China Textiles and Wuhe experienced slight fluctuations, while the rest remained rangebound. As a result, compared to the previous close, popular stocks Yong Yarn, Meyer, Jingfu, Trust Harmony, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell between 2% and breakeven, while cold stocks such as the Company and Lian remained flat, Matches rose half a percent, China Textiles Underwear and Jinglun rose slightly, Wuhe fell 10%, and the rest declined slightly. The total trading volume was 11.75 million shares. Over-the-counter stocks were generally stable with little change.

Foreign stocks remained initially stable but weakened, with new buying absent. Except for Ewo Brewery, which remained relatively stable, the rest felt weak. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Brewery remained flat, while Ewo Yarn, Meyer, and Associated Industries declined slightly. Jardine Matheson, Paper Industries, Shipping Industries, and Steel Industries each fell about half a percent.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Are Flat and Weak; Edible Oil Prices Fluctuate

The rice market saw a total of over 12,000 shi of rice arriving from the north and south, with mediocre digestion. Japonica rice gradually declined, with northern markets retreating by a small amount of 1,000. Yangdu Indica rice was soft, while wharves Indica rice was stable. White Yuan rice remained stagnant and weak, with Yin Yuan rice offering discounts for quick sales. White Yuan rice in the southern market was flat and weak, while Japonica and Indica rice saw no difference. Wheat demand was stagnant, with prices falling 300-400. Flour sales were sluggish, with some supply arriving, and prices falling 300-500, with a soft outlook. Wheat bran followed with a decrease of 100-200. Soybean cake trading showed signs of stopping, with sales becoming stagnant, declining 100-200, and the future looking bleak. Soybeans from Northeast and Central China were arriving, but oil factories were not eager to purchase. Sales in various ports were inactive, falling 300-1,000. Broad beans from Fujian were being purchased but not heavily consumed. Sales in the city remained flat, and the market was temporarily stable. Sorghum sources were scarce, and distilleries had normal demand, leading to a neglected situation. Cowpeas from Nanyang saw some interest. Sesame sales were slackening. Shelled peanuts continued to rise 1,000-2,000. Red beans lacked buyers, plummeting 2,000-3,000. Soybean cake sales in Xiamen stopped, with prices falling 100-200.

### Southern Transportation of Yarn and Cloth Can Begin Next Monday

[Our Report] The names of the manufacturers approved for the southern transport of yarn and cloth were announced yesterday by the Textile Management Committee. Of the 262 factories that applied, 232 were approved. Of the 392 commercial firms that applied, 134 were approved. 64 commercial firms were asked to provide additional documents for further review. The Textile Management Committee has already issued notification slips to the qualified manufacturers, asking them to come to the committee to collect registration cards and application forms. It is expected that applications for southern transport of yarn and cloth can begin next week.

It is understood that the allocation of cotton yarn for southern transport will be based on the factory's spindle count and production volume. Commercial firms wishing to apply for export must first obtain a sales permit from the factory before applying to the Textile Management Committee for southern transport. The allocation of cloth for southern transport will be reviewed four times in January. The allocation of cloth for southern transport will be based on the factory's production volume. For commercial firms, the standard will be the scope of their past sales to various ports in South China.

### Limited Supply from the Fuel Management Committee; The Bituminous Coal Market Is Stirred Again; Fewer Stocks, More Applicants; The Association Will Formulate Concrete Measures

Since the 26th of last month, after the Fuel Management Committee adjusted coal prices and notified the Coal Business Joint Operations Office to suspend sales, rumors spread among the industry. Fortunately, through the efforts of the association, sales resumed as usual on the 1st of this month, but the quota was limited to only 20,000 tons per month, and the market turmoil temporarily calmed down. Industry applications were extremely enthusiastic. As of the 4th of this month, the Joint Operations Office had distributed 11,000 tons. To maintain the actual sales of the industry for the second half of the month and to avoid manipulation, the association ordered the Joint Operations Office to temporarily suspend sales starting today, and sales will resume after the association formulates concrete measures. Currently, the Joint Operations Office's coal stocks only consist of the remaining 9,000 tons allocated by the Fuel Management Committee for this month and the 6,000 tons quota from last month, for a total of 15,000 tons, which has made the industry even more uneasy. Some businesses have already pre-sold goods to users and are unable to replenish them from the Joint Operations Office, so they are searching for them on the black market, which has caused the black market price of bituminous coal to soar, higher by 10,000 to 40,000 per ton compared to the Joint Operations Office's allocation price, especially bituminous coal dust.

### Many Difficulties in Fur Export; Northern Transportation Has Not Recovered, New Goods Have Not Arrived; Export Rights Are Controlled by Foreigners, Unfavorable Terms

[Our Report] According to sources in the city's fur export industry, the fur samples displayed at the recent export commodity exhibition aroused the interest of a Swiss affairs officer. He contacted the industry to collect various exquisite fur products and send personnel to Switzerland to hold an exhibition. The industry stated that the city's fur inventory was in a period of shortage. New goods had not arrived, and existing inventory was running low. Most of the valuable fur products come from North China. Furthermore, due to transportation difficulties, it was impossible to purchase them temporarily. Therefore, it was impossible to collect all kinds of fur products and send personnel to Switzerland for an exhibition. It was decided to purchase goose and duck feathers and sheepskins in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas and send them to Switzerland for a small exhibition. The industry's recent fur exports are mainly to New York, but the situation is not good, and trade is largely controlled by Jewish merchants. Although Chinese businesses want to trade directly with foreign countries, the terms are very unfavorable. For example, they have to pay an additional business tax. Although the commodity tax is said to be exempt, it still has to be paid first and then deducted. In addition, the interest rate is only 6% per annum abroad, but even the low interest rate of the Central Bank in China is 5% per month. Under these difficult circumstances, it is impossible to compete with foreign exporters.

### Preferential Treatment for Fellow Banks; Central Bank Reduces Exchange Rate

It is understood that the Central Bank, to facilitate commercial banks, has granted a 30% discount on the exchange rate stipulated by the bank. This measure was decided at the recent bank affairs meeting and is now being implemented.

### More Pigs Arriving; Fresh Meat Prices Have Begun to Fall

Since the war in northern Jiangsu gradually subsided and order was restored, the authorities, to facilitate civilian ships and commercial transport, have re-designated ports such as Nantong and Tianshengang on the north bank of the Yangtze River as navigable ports. As a result, pigs, a special product of northern Jiangsu, have recently arrived in large quantities. It is estimated that more than 3,000 heads are transported daily by both water and land routes. Fresh meat prices have begun to fall, with wholesale prices falling by 40,000 per 100 catties and retail prices falling by 200 to 400 per catty.

### The Market Is Depressed; There Are More Rumors

[Our Report] Recently, rumors have been spreading that several reputable and financially strong companies and firms in the city are experiencing financial difficulties. These rumors are being used as gossip in the market. According to reporters' interviews with the companies and firms concerned, it is true that working capital has occasionally run dry due to the current tightening of credit, but it has not reached a serious stage. The exaggerated rumors circulating recently are excessive. In the daily accounts of various companies and firms, there are frequent instances of borrowing from other firms or relatives and friends. Due to the rumors, some are demanding early repayment or withdrawing deposits, which has caused the situation to become tense. Currently, various companies and firms have prepared sufficient cash to meet withdrawals. Public sentiment is gradually stabilizing.

### More Timber Arriving

[Our Report] A large quantity of timber has been imported this week. Large pine trees are stranded at the mouth of the Suzhou River at the Baidu Bridge. It may be difficult to transport such a large amount of timber elsewhere in a short time. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Lin Sen ship arrived from Fuzhou, also carrying 2,300 tons of wooden boards.

In terms of exports, some yarn and cloth were transported to the north. Yesterday, the Qimei ship sailed to Tianjin, carrying 500 pieces of cotton cloth, 185 pieces of cotton yarn, 1,680 bags of sugar, over 700 boxes of tea, and 300 pieces of iron sheets. Yesterday, the Pede ship sailed to Shantou, carrying a large quantity of over 52,590 pieces of soybean cake, as well as 450 bags of sesame.

### Cotton Collection Not Strong; The Reason Is Transportation Difficulties

The collection of domestically produced cotton is nearing completion. According to reports received by the Textile Construction Company from various locations, the total amount collected by various cotton collection points in Xi'an, Shashi, Hankou, Nantong, and Tianjin is only over 100,000 dan. There are still a small portion of reports that have not been received, and the estimated quantity is also limited. This year, the cotton collection locations of both state-owned and private yarn factories are concentrated in areas with convenient transportation. They are unwilling to go to places with transportation difficulties, so the poor cotton collection is unprecedented. The amount of raw materials for yarn factories next year will rely on more foreign cotton than in previous years.

### Italian Rayon Production; Monthly Increase

### The Knitting Industry's Urgent Demands; Reduce Interest and Taxes; Revise Wage Standards

The Municipal Industrial Association holds various industry symposiums every Tuesday to promote industrial development. Yesterday afternoon, the knitting industry symposium was held, with seven representatives from the industry, including Xu Zhaohou, attending. The Bank of Communications also sent Zhuang Shenwen, director of the Design Department, and Zhang Muliao, commissioner, to attend. According to the industry, the current difficulties they face are the burden of high-interest loans, wages, and taxes, which makes it impossible to compete with products from other countries in foreign trade. Before the war, Nanyang and the United States had good sales of Chinese knitted products. Although there is still demand now, they are reluctant to buy due to the high prices. At the same time, raw material prices are rising sharply, making it difficult to buy the same amount of raw materials with the proceeds from sales. Currently, the industry is requesting: (1) low-interest loans, (2) reduced taxes, and (3) revised wage standards. The Bank of Communications representatives suggested that the issue of low-interest loans should be studied first to determine an effective approach. If it can encourage large-scale exports, the bank can certainly share the benefits. As for the tax issue, after the symposium, they will formulate accurate figures for the authorities to adopt. For the wage issue, they will study the Factory Law and submit proposed revisions to the authorities for approval. Regarding the difficulty in balancing raw material price fluctuations and sales prices, they will discuss with the state-owned China Textile Corporation to facilitate them.

### Rice Prices in Hubei Province Rebound

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 6th] Grain prices in various parts of Hubei Province have generally risen. The price of high-quality rice is approaching 50,000 per shi. The plan to adjust grain prices to avoid low grain prices, which was previously proposed, will be temporarily postponed.

### Lack of Chemical Fertilizers; Taiwan's Sugar Production Greatly Affected

[Our Report] It is understood that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is currently facing the problem of a shortage of fertilizers. Under the 50-year rule of the Japanese, the farmers of Taiwan have become accustomed to using chemical fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and ammonium sulfate. However, these fertilizers are all necessities during wartime. Therefore, all countries are experiencing shortages after the war, and China is no exception. There is no open market for these fertilizers in the world at present. Most of them are centrally allocated by the Allied Food Control Board, and the United Nations provides them to various countries. However, the United Nations allocates these fertilizers mainly for food crops. Sugar has been classified as a luxury item and cannot get a share. However, the sugar industry in Taiwan has a close relationship with the national economic development and the economic recovery of the province. If Taiwan's sugar cannot be grown due to some reason, at least 55% of the people in Taiwan will have to declare bankruptcy, which would turn Taiwan, which has made great contributions to the national economy, into a burden on the national economy. Also, the normal planting season for sugar cane in the province is October, November, December, and January of each year. If planting is not completed during this period, all the three-year and five-year recovery plans for the Chinese sugar industry will be completely aborted. It is said that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation is currently in a depressed state and is planning to actively overcome the difficulties.

The original text of Article 41 of the County-Level Organization Outline is transcribed below: The financial revenue of townships is as follows: (1) Revenue granted by law, (2) Revenue from township public property, (3) Revenue from township public utilities, (4) Subsidies, (5) Temporary revenue collected with the resolution of the township people's representative conference, but it must be approved by the county government.

### Sino-American Commercial Treaty: From Proposal to Signing

— Nanjing Dispatch, 4th Day. Our Correspondent, Hande Jie

Conception

The Sino-American Commercial Treaty, long in the making, was finally signed at 4:00 PM on November 4th. This is a substantial and important offspring, gestated for three years and ten months. It's no wonder its birth was a difficult labor. The press corps acted as midwives, urging and chanting, finally delivering it today. It truly wasn't easy.

The initial mention of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was in Article 7 of the Sino-American New Treaty on January 11th, 1943. That article stipulated that both China and the United States agreed to commence negotiations within six months after the end of the righteous war in which both countries were striving for victory. The goal was to reorganize, select, eliminate, and reaffirm all existing, piecemeal provisions scattered throughout outdated treaty articles (mostly unequal treaties), or in de facto commercial, overseas Chinese, economic, navigation, and consular relations between the two countries. The aim was to create a perfect commercial treaty that complied with current international practices, would not subject Sino-American relations to unexpected turmoil, and would be all-encompassing and universally suitable. However, from then until victory, the United States focused on achieving victory in Europe and preparing for active operations in Asia. China was preparing for a counter-offensive while dealing with the enemy's final frenzy. No matter who was seen, during the height of the war, no one could forget the war and remember matters after victory. Thus, this provision was vaguely forgotten for a long time. This seed, once planted, lay dry and dormant for over two years.

Formation

Last spring, with victory approaching, the Allied nations began preparing for the post-victory situation. They began planning the establishment of the cornerstone of peace. The United Nations Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco on April 25th. Those thinking of restoration and reconstruction remembered what needed to be done. Preliminary contacts regarding the signing of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty took place in Washington. Our country's leading commercial authority (then Commercial Counselor at the Embassy in the United States), economist Gong Duxiu (Director of the Economic Research Institute of the National Resources Commission), and Assistant Commercial Counselor Liu Dazhong, representing the government, exchanged views with the United States Department of State on several occasions. As summer turned to fall, victories were achieved in Europe and Asia. The economic relations between the United States and its allies became even closer. The friendship between China and the United States was always at its highest. Economic cooperation, industrial and commercial mutual assistance, was the necessary path to maintaining American prosperity and promoting China's construction. But to secure guarantees for all normal operations, a standard and regulation were essential. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty entered a phase of concretization. Washington put forward its desired draft, which was brought to Chongqing by Gong Duxiu and others. The Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs became busy. In early February, they gathered opinions from various related government departments, assessed the post-war situation in our country, consulted experts and scholars, and proposed a counter-proposal. Formal negotiations began, with our representatives being Gong Duxiu (who, after returning to the country, had assumed the post of Deputy Secretary-General of the Supreme Economic Council), Wang Huacheng, Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Cheng Ximeng, Advisor and Director of the American Affairs Department. The American representatives were Counselor Smothers (who has now been transferred to the post of Consul General in Tianjin), Baxter, and Dr. Wilson, a special advisor dispatched by the State Department and a professor of international law at Duke University. (He came in early February, made some decisions on principles, and returned home in March.)

The draft and counter-proposal were like the two cotyledons of a small plant. A young sprout extracts nutrients from these two cotyledons and slowly grows and takes shape.

Development

Starting in February of last year, this young sprout grew bit by bit. The two sides negotiated one article at a time. The technical work of drafting the agreed results into articles was done by Chen Shicai, Assistant of the American Affairs Department, and Yu Nengmo, Wang Zhixu, Tao Yue, and others, assistants and specialists of the Treaty Department. They, like the representatives, worked hard, patiently, and cautiously, carefully writing down and translating identical views word by word. The young sprout grew and developed day by day, and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was agreed upon sentence by sentence. But at this time, the domestic political atmosphere was intense. The Political Consultative Conference, military reorganization, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and the People's Political Council followed one after another. The press corps didn't notice that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was already in the development stage. In early April, our newspaper was the first to publish a Chongqing dispatch stating that "the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is under negotiation." Everyone then knew about it. In late April, various newspapers published a Reuters dispatch from Hong Kong stating that "the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is under negotiation." No one knew if these two dispatches were a single entity manifested in two forms, but the matter was confirmed. Although due to the strict secrecy maintained by all relevant parties, it was always difficult to obtain more information.

Growth

From Chongqing to Nanjing, negotiations continued. Difficulties arose constantly and were resolved constantly. The United States demanded more freedom for industrial and commercial operations and the safeguarding of domestic economic stability and national interests. China demanded foreign investment to help the development of national industries and the safety of overseas Chinese residents and their lives. These mutual demands, if reasonably coordinated, would never lead to conflicts of interest or power struggles. However, due to the lack of reasonable coordination in the past and the lingering effects of unequal treaties and discriminatory laws, conflicts were not uncommon, and both sides considered matters with extreme caution. On the Chinese side, this was the first commercial treaty after the abolition of unequal treaties. Nation-building was beginning, and it had to obtain as much foreign aid as possible, so the treaty had to be meticulous, especially in terms of security. On the American side, this was a major event after the war. The lessons of 1929 were not far away, and it had to rationally obtain access to the Eastern market and cooperation with China, so the treaty also had to be meticulous and secure. For this reason, many issues took up a lot of time, especially immigration, industrial and commercial operations, the reservation of mining rights, the definition of coastal trade, etc., which were discussed for a considerable time and resulted in the relevant provisions stipulated today. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty negotiations held nearly forty meetings. It grew slowly in this way.

Inspection

When a fetus grows in the mother's body, inspection is a necessary procedure. Only after inspection can a diagnosis be made as to whether it is normal and whether the birth will be smooth. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty also underwent inspection from time to time during its growth phase. During consultations, whenever important decisions had to be made, the U.S. side would send telegrams to Washington to inquire; our side also took it more seriously. Members of the National Political Council and the Executive Yuan all participated in the consultation. Legislative Yuan member Wu Jingneng (currently serving as the Envoy to the Holy See) also frequently contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the initial draft was finalized in mid-October, it was reviewed by the National Defense Supreme Council. This thorough inspection ensured that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty would be approved smoothly by both countries. This period was the most stressful time for reporters, hoping for a quick and early birth, standing outside the delivery room waiting, and even trying to peek through the cracks in the door and listen. In late October, the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was extremely busy, and Li Qian ran to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs almost every day. The official versions began to be handwritten in regular script and carefully typed, once, twice, and proofread dozens of times. When the Information Department answered inquiries, they said, "Soon!" "Soon!"

Birth

This plump baby was finally born; the plenipotentiary representatives were dispatched, and the date and location were set. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty was born.

On the afternoon of November 4th, the signing ceremony was formally held in the conference room on the third floor of the Executive Yuan. The interior layout was mostly the same as usual, solemn and simple. On the left wall were the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, and opposite was a group photo of Chairman Chiang in military uniform. Two rows of seats were arranged on both sides, all covered with clean white cloth. In the center was a long table and five high-backed chairs with brocade cushions. The long table was covered with a brand new small checkered white tablecloth. On the left side was a set of jade-green Western-style stationery, and on the right side was a complete set of Chinese-style stationery. There were four volumes of the treaty, two originals and two copies. The set preserved by China had a deep red leather cover, embossed with the "Blue Sky White Sun" emblem, and the endpapers were plain silk. The set preserved by the United States had a dark blue leather cover, with gold-embossed borders and the gold-embossed eagle emblem, and the endpapers were plain silk with gold-embossed edges. Each volume was in both Chinese and English, with the Chinese text first in the volumes preserved by China, and the English text first in the volumes preserved by the United States. Each volume had two red, white, and blue silk ribbons attached to the end, and the wax seals of the four signing representatives were firmly affixed. Their order of precedence and the order of signing were arranged according to the principle of the possessor taking precedence. In front of the long table were five mercury lamps, although it was facing away from the door.

At three o'clock, reporters arrived one after another. The photographers from the Central News Agency were testing the lighting. Director Wang Huacheng was busy with Assistant Yu Nengmo and Attache Andeber from the U.S. Embassy, applying wax seals. All the preparations were completed in a short period of time. At 3:30, Foreign Minister Wang arrived, inspected the various preparations, and chatted with Minister Wang Yunwu and Executive Secretary Gan Naiguang. In less than three minutes, Ambassador Stuart, Consul General Smothers, and Counselor Baxter entered the room together. President Song, Vice President Weng, and Secretary-General Chiang arrived next. Everyone shook hands with each other, chatted briefly, and then the signing ceremony began amidst the whirring of cameras. President Song sat in the center of the long table, with our representatives on his right and the U.S. representatives on his left. After taking their seats, they first verified each other's full powers, and then began signing. Foreign Minister Wang and Director Wang first signed their Chinese names on the Chinese version with brushes, and then switched to their own fountain pens to sign their English names on the English version. Ambassador Stuart and Counselor Smothers signed all their names using their own gray-stemmed Parker 51 pens. After the representatives of both sides signed the original and copies preserved by their own countries, they exchanged them and signed the original and copies preserved by the other party. The signing was completed precisely at four o'clock. Everyone stood up. President Song first shook hands with Ambassador Stuart to thank each other. Then Foreign Minister Wang also shook hands warmly with Ambassador Stuart. Representatives and guests also shook hands and thanked each other. Champagne and sandwiches arrived. President Song picked up two glasses and handed one to Ambassador Stuart. "Congratulations for mutual help and cooperation." The two raised their glasses high and drank heartily. Immediately, the atmosphere in the conference room changed from solemn to lively. Glasses clinked, laughter filled the air, and the aroma of wine mingled with the joyful atmosphere, overflowing inside and outside the room. This plump newborn was born; the signing and announcement of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was made. This is an epoch-making product. From now on, Sino-American relations will have a new basis, and the sincere friendship and cooperation between the two countries will surely develop rapidly with this new era.

### Henan Provincial Assembly: A Democratic Drama Where Tongues Were Drawn, Only To Be Sheathed Again

— Kaifeng Dispatch, October 28th. Our Correspondent, Wang Shoumei

The Henan Provincial Assembly staged a tongue-lashing yesterday (October 28th) that was alarming but harmless. I hardly dare think back on it. Thinking about it still makes me tremble with fear. Imagine, when those angry, furious warriors were speaking passionately and heatedly, not agreeing with each other, what if some unscrupulous person had thrown a brick through the window? Wouldn't inkstones and teacups have flown everywhere? If that had happened, chaos would have erupted. Who could guarantee that the airborne weapons wouldn't have eyes and wouldn't fall on the reporter's head? But, thank God, we didn't encounter such an unfortunate event. Therefore, I feel that although I suffered a false alarm, it really opened my eyes.

### More Than Thirty Assemblymen Make an Emergency Motion

Some sensitive people had predicted that yesterday morning's general assembly would definitely have a fierce battle, so the press box was already packed. But the assembly started for a long time, and there was no movement. After the secretariat and the resident committee presented their work reports, everything was calm. Chairman Liu then announced the discussion of proposals. Just then, someone stood up from among the assemblymen. He shouted tensely, "Chairman, number forty-seven, number forty-seven, I have an emergency motion!" The whole place was somewhat shaken. Everyone focused their gaze on the speaker, Assemblyman Yu Qixian. He held a solemn attitude, walked with heavy and forceful steps, and took his "emergency motion" to the front of the chairman's seat. He handed the "emergency motion" to Secretary-General Han, who in turn passed it to Chairman Liu. Chairman Liu, whose cultivation had reached a high level, looked at it, folded the "emergency motion," and put it down. As soon as he did that, someone shouted, "Please, Chairman, read out the contents of the emergency motion!" So Chairman Liu handed the emergency motion to Secretary-General Han to read out. The main idea of the motion was that Chairman Liu of the provincial government was loyal to the country and had contributed to the region. During the war, he had endured hardships and supported the war effort. After the restoration, he had managed things painstakingly. Now, having attended this assembly, he had been subjected to serious accusations and had led all the members of the provincial committee to request their resignation. Everyone expressed regret and believed that the assembly should send a telegram to the central government to retain them. Signed to this emergency motion were Wang Puqing and more than thirty others. No sooner had Secretary-General Han finished reading than Assemblyman Liu Jiyan, number sixty, stood up. With a solemn attitude, he expressed his serious opinion. He said, "Chairman Liu has led the entire provincial committee to resign because of the criticism and accusations made by Assemblyman Wang Youmei. I regret this more than anyone else. Chairman Liu and I have been old friends for thirty years, and our private relationship is very close. I am unwilling to be second to anyone in retaining Chairman Liu. However, since Chairman Liu's decision to resign was due to the criticism leveled at him by this assembly, this assembly cannot abandon its position as a representative of the people and come out to retain him. Therefore, I propose that we retain him in our personal capacities. I do not agree to retain him in the name of the assembly!" Before Assemblyman Liu had finished speaking, someone else shouted, "Chairman, number one hundred." That was someone sitting in the last row, in his thirties, wearing a green uniform, speaking with a northern Henan accent. According to the seating chart, it was Assemblyman Yang Yufu. He said, "At the opening ceremony the day before yesterday, Chairman Liu believed that the assembly did not understand him because Assemblyman Wang Youmei gave the reply speech. In fact, Assemblyman Wang's opinion cannot represent all of us. Moreover, at the opening ceremony of this assembly, Chairman Liu was a guest. In the reply speech, he said, 'Handing over the bank to the central government, Chairman Liu and Director Meng had exchange conditions, saying something about a bureau chief, and so on.' May I ask Assemblyman Wang Youmei if you have any basis for this? If you have evidence, then present it. If you don't, then you are weak. If you make empty talk without evidence, you must take responsibility. Assemblyman Wang Youmei is arbitrary and considers no one else. The conscription case he proposed this time did not seek my consent in advance, and he stole my name. How can such arbitrariness and monopolization be allowed?" He sat down angrily, still holding his hat and slapping it on the table a few times. A portion of the audience even applauded. Assemblyman Wang Youmei stood up again to defend himself, saying, "Requesting a reduction in conscription is a matter of utmost urgency for Henan at present and is a major issue that needs to be discussed by this assembly. Due to the short time and the lack of time to get individual signatures, this is how it was done. Moreover, you often instructed me that when I encounter cases that have a major impact on the welfare of the people, I am willing to go along. This time, I didn't know that you disagreed, so I signed your name for you." At this time, heads were surging, and too many people wanted to express their opinions. Some were shouting "Chairman" here, and others were shouting "Chairman" there. The war of words had entered its most intense stage. The disorder was indescribable. Assemblyman Guo Haichang firmly opposed retaining Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. Assemblyman Zhao Peiwu also shouted loudly, "If we retain Chairman Liu in our personal capacities, I will sign first. If we retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly, I firmly oppose it!" Assemblyman Shang Shaohang spoke, saying, "...We assemblymen can by no means retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. Since ancient times, there have been loyal ministers who dared to remonstrate. This assembly represents the people and points out criticisms to the government, which is precisely being loyal to the people and loyal to the government. If Chairman Liu resigns entirely because his ears cannot bear loyal words, then if our assembly comes out to retain him, that would be equivalent to admitting that we are not loyal!" Assemblyman Wang Shiqu added, "This assembly should only thank the guest speaker for representing his people to express gratitude. It is inappropriate to criticize the guest at a grand ceremony. Therefore, we fully agree to retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. Assemblyman Wang Youmei's reply speech can only be regarded as his personal opinion. We absolutely do not agree with it."

### The Assembly Hall Is In A State of Emergency, and The Verbal Battle Enters An Intense Stage

Swords were drawn, bows were strung, and war clouds were gathering. Assemblyman Wang Youmei stood up calmly. He first shouted, "Chairman, I have a few words to say in response!" Then he turned around and faced the rear left. "There is no explicit provision in the law that the chairman of the provincial government must be paid complimentary remarks at the opening ceremony of the assembly. I have not seen any provision in the law that prohibits assemblymen from criticizing the chairman of the provincial government in their reply speeches. I only know that assemblymen have the freedom to speak in the assembly. If everyone thinks that what I said should not have been said, or cannot represent everyone, I will naturally take responsibility for what I said. But you also have the freedom to speak. Why didn't you object at the time?" Another person stood up. That was Assemblyman Wang Puqing, number sixty-one. He was absolutely in favor of retaining Chairman Liu. His demeanor when speaking could be described as "imposing." His mouth was like a river. Before he had finished speaking, Liu Huandong, number fifty-five, shouted "Chairman" several times in a row. Then he used all his senses, first hammering the table a few times, and then speaking sternly. He said, "Whether Chairman Liu resigns and whether the assembly retains him is a secondary issue. However, I feel that Chairman Liu was appointed during a time of crisis. During the Central Plains War, people from all walks of life in this province crossed the Qinling Mountains and fled to Xi'an. He sat firmly in Nanxiang Sangping, directing the war of resistance and vowing to coexist with Henan, enduring hardships and supporting the remaining situation until the enemy surrendered. Who can compare to this spirit? Therefore, I say, without the Liu brothers, there would be no Henan. After the restoration, he worked extremely hard to clean up the shattered situation in Henan. Now we are still criticizing him in this way. I ask, do you still have a conscience? Moreover, Wang Puqing and several other assemblymen unanimously attacked and opposed retaining Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly. The two sides were evenly matched and on equal footing. You attacked me, and I attacked you, and neither side would give in. The tension in the entire venue had reached an extremely urgent point. I squeezed a handful of sweat, but I still had the greatest determination to see it through because I felt that a democratic drama like this was not easy to see!

### A Gentleman Loves Others With Virtue; A Loud Voice Overwhelmed The Audience

In the midst of the uproar, Assemblyman Liu Jiyan, number sixty, finally overwhelmed the assembly with his loud voice. He said, "If we retain Chairman Liu in our personal capacities, I am willing to kowtow and bow to Chairman Liu. But to retain Chairman Liu in the name of the assembly after such a quarrel would not be glorious for Chairman Liu either. A gentleman loves others with virtue. I absolutely do not want to cause him to be even less honorable because I love him. At the same time, I feel that it would greatly diminish the dignity of the assembly. Let us not forget our own position!" A large part of the audience applauded. Assemblyman Lu Yunhan, number two, also rose in response. His unique argument was as follows: "Retaining Chairman Liu can be said to be a common feeling. However, whether we should retain him in the name of the assembly or in our personal capacities, I propose that after the meeting, one representative from each administrative district and the chairman thoroughly study this issue." Someone, a third party longing for peace, echoed him. Many people proposed to adjourn the meeting, but the warmongers continued to chatter incessantly, determined to win by force. Chairman Liu, who was old, virtuous, dignified, and calmly seated on the rostrum, stood up calmly at this time. He calmly made a comprehensive conclusion on the disputes of both sides and the opinions of the third party. He said, "Regarding this issue, I have something to prove. Retaining Chairman Liu is everyone's common opinion. In fact, we lightly began to work on the matter of retaining him yesterday in another way. If we use the assembly's name to retain Chairman Liu again, some people are concerned about the dignity of the assembly, and it is indeed necessary to consider. As for which method to use, we can adopt the proposal of an assemblyman just now and have the representatives conduct a thorough study after the meeting. Now, let's start discussing the proposals." As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately began to read the proposals. Although many people were still eager to fight, they had no choice but to temporarily sheath their knives. Although there was almost another uproar when discussing the conscription case, after all, because it was too late and people were tired, they finally did not make a scene.

A fierce debate war, thanks to God, ended without any injuries. Otherwise, I think this democratic drama would definitely be included in the future "Romance of Democratic Politics in Henan."

### A Glimpse of Liangduo

— Liangduo Dispatch, October 25th, Our Reporter Ling Songchou

The time was the afternoon of the 23rd.

The location was inside the forward command post of the Anfeng 83rd Division.

The frontline commander, Liu Guangyu, the one defending Taidian, got off his bicycle and walked up to Division Commander Li, saying:

"Three to four hundred enemies have been spotted across from Zhangjia She, moving towards the vicinity of Wangjia Xinyuan, with the intention of crossing the river for a sneak attack. We are now preparing to strike them head-on. Please advise, Division Commander." The Division Commander said:

"Strike what! Do they dare? If they cross the river, we'll just deal with them."

After some consideration, the Division Commander immediately ordered:

"The artillery positions should move towards Gujia Zao, preparing to fire. At the intersection of the two rivers across from Wangjia Xinyuan, the engineer battalion should strengthen fortifications and prepare to build a bridge. The heavy artillery near Caojia She should also begin preparations. The infantry will await intelligence tonight before taking action." After the deployment was completed, the Division Commander drew an arrow on the map with his finger, saying:

"Fighting here is just like Anfeng and Fuan; flanking maneuvers are essential, a frontal assault simply won't work!"

Having been there personally, the reporter understands that the fate of Liangduo has already been decided and the outcome will be known tomorrow. The sound of machine guns and artillery raged all night.

On the morning of the 24th, as expected, the reporter heard the good news that the National Army had recaptured Liangduo. He immediately rushed to the front line. The Division Commander was already there. The reporter asked the Division Commander bluntly:

"Has Liangduo been recaptured?"

"At five o'clock this morning," the Division Commander replied very forcefully. He pointed to Sanli'an on the map and said, "The vanguard troops have already crossed this place!" After a while, he took out a pre-determined action plan from his pocket square. On the map, the reporter noticed an arrow pointing to Liangduo, with "October 20th - 25th" written on its tail. The Division Commander said humorously:

"The reality will never exceed my predetermined plan. Haha! This is my magic weapon, my treasure!" At twelve o'clock, the adjutant's office sent personnel to set up camp in Liangduo. The reporter accompanied them to see this place that had been recaptured just seven hours ago.

Anfeng and Liangduo are only seven li apart. The drive took only ten minutes.

The streets were full of national flags, but they were all old. Some families simply pasted a piece of red paper onto a reed and hung it at the door as a welcome flag. Slogans were everywhere, red and green, adding a lot of vitality to a dead town. The residents were very enthusiastic about the National Army. Everyone unanimously called the National Army "Bodhisattvas." They were able to do their best to lend objects and assist with work. The Communist troops retreated from Liangduo around four o'clock; at five o'clock, the National Army moved into the town. When the National Army was advancing with guns blazing, the residents thought the battle was intense, and they crossed a river east of the town and took shelter in the countryside. Bullets and shells flew over their heads, scaring them all out of their wits. It wasn't until dawn that they learned that the National Army, for whom they had been longing, had arrived. One resident pointed to a wet piece of clothing and said to the reporter:

"If we had known that you 'Bodhisattvas' were coming, why would we have hidden? Look, we weren't killed by bullets, but we were almost drowned!"

There was very little fiat currency in the streets. They hadn't even seen some of the large denomination banknotes. The reporter personally heard a housewife say to her husband:

"Did you see that? The five and ten yuan notes are the same as before!" One person even took out a neatly folded stack of ten and five yuan fiat currency from his pocket to show the reporter; I thought, this must be an antique from eight years before the War of Resistance!

The doors of the shops were half-open, half-closed. The reporter couldn't even buy some yunpian gao (thin rice cakes) from the tea and snack shop. In the evening, buying some cabbage to make noodles still required the homeowner to go to great lengths. Prices have not yet returned to normal. Generally, ordinary things follow the price of rice, and the price of rice is based on the Anfeng area. Currently, the price of rice is roughly 36,000 yuan per dan (unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters), for good quality.

The night before the Communist troops retreated, they distributed a lot of propaganda in Liangduo. The rapidly disintegrating Communist troops in northern Jiangsu still hadn't changed their old habit of fabricating facts, which only served to show their pathetic and desperate state!

On the one hand, the residents respected the National Army like "Bodhisattvas"; on the other hand, they feared them like a pitiful child encountering a stern father. They dared not say anything about the past. The reporter looked for a ten-yuan "anti-Japanese currency" note and, after much persuasion, finally obtained it. When he wanted to find a second one, they refused no matter what.

There are fewer men than women in Liangduo, and even fewer young people. Most of them have probably already escaped to live a life of exile. On one main street, there were only soldiers and no civilians. This phenomenon was quite unique! There are many children, and they are very lively. The reporter once asked a girl if she knew how to do the "yangko dance"? Her mother rushed to answer, "We don't understand." But after a while, when the reporter played two phrases on his harmonica, "5656i6i5i65323......," the children outside the door all hummed along. I secretly smiled to myself. Early in the morning of the 25th, Division Commander Li also arrived. The reporter accompanied him to inspect the artillery positions and took some photos. At the positions, the reporter could clearly see a certain temple and a pagoda on the outskirts of Dongtai City through special scissor-shaped binoculars. Liangduo is eighteen li from Dongtai. The range of the National Army's artillery positions has extended to Dongtai. The Division Commander smiled and said, "Even if the people don't catch up to him, the artillery has to catch up to him!"

Hello! Dongtai, we'll see each other before the end of the month!

### Scenes from Fanyang

— Our Special Correspondent in the Northeast, Kai Rongqin, Airmail from Fanyang, October 6th

It's late autumn, but Shenyang is not too cold yet. The wind is not strong, and the sky, except when occasionally obscured by gray-white clouds, is mostly a bright blue. The bright sun often brings warmth to people. The people of the Northeast say that in the past, Shenyang had more cloudy days in autumn, often with unpleasant drizzles, but this year seems to be an exception.

The electricity is on, but the power supply is still insufficient. The circuits often malfunction. There's no electricity during the day, and even at night, it flickers on and off, symbolizing our current situation.

There are no major battles being fought in the Northeast right now, but after the sieges of Xichang, Xi'an, and other places were lifted, National Army generals such as Sun Liren, Liao Yaoxiang, and Long Tianwu still seemed to be coming and going in a hurry. Reporters, poking their heads around everywhere, couldn't figure out when they arrived and when they left.

Prices Rise Without End

Half a year ago, even three months ago, people coming from inside the border often praised the cheap prices in the Northeast. But now, no one says that anymore. In fact, they shake their heads and click their tongues, saying it's expensive. Rice has jumped to seventy or eighty yuan per jin (approx. 500g), and sorghum rice has also risen to more than twenty yuan. Pork is hard to get even at one hundred thirty or forty yuan per jin. Fur goods that are even slightly presentable cost thirty or forty thousand, and mink coats can even cost six or seven hundred thousand yuan. Many people are saying that if they had bought ten or eight fur coats half a year ago, they could have made a small fortune. Wealthy people, used to hearing the word "ten thousand" inside the border, don't care much about spending money outside the border. Public school teachers all shake their heads and sigh. Although buying gold has become a thing of the past, smugglers are particularly active. Transporting a hundred or so jin of rice from Jilin, Changchun, or Siping can earn several thousand to ten thousand yuan. Transporting apples and crabs from Haicheng and Yingkou also has a market profit of more than double. Who wouldn't do it! Even suffering for a few days in open train cars or on the roofs of covered cars, experiencing the same life as repatriating Japanese or even in damp warehouses with luggage, is worth it! A certain artist who had been buried in writing and painting in Jilin all day also put down his brush and came to Fanyang, trying to find a way to get a carload of goods. The exchange rate of one to thirteen has gradually become a historical term in Shenyang, where prices are soaring. Bank remittances are one to one and a half, and the value of unofficial circulating currency is even lower, with one yuan only exchanging for ten or even eight yuan of national currency.

Due to the high prices in Shenyang, goods from Tianjin and Beijing have been continuously transported here. Phrases like "American flints" and "American cigarettes" are encountered everywhere. The number of vendors selling cigarettes is increasing daily. Their numbers are probably no less than those of newspaper vendors, and they all display beautifully packaged American cigarettes prominently. Domestic cigarettes, even those transported from Shanghai, have been relegated to the cold palace. Even though the price is much cheaper than it was half a year ago, there are still not many customers.

Traffic Chaos - Vehicles Take Responsibility

The Municipal Provisional Assembly, which is currently in session, in addition to letting public school teachers vent their anger, has also listed Shenyang's "seven chaos," one of which is "traffic chaos." The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has paved the half of the gravel road leading from the station into the city with asphalt, and public buses and trams have also come out to embellish things, but the traffic is still a bit "chaotic." Military vehicles are partly responsible for the chaos. Every so often, they either smash a horse-drawn carriage beyond recognition or flip a rickshaw over. Their driving speed is so high that even traffic police with vigilant eyes sometimes don't have time to direct them. Public vehicles, especially trams, are too few. You can wait at a stop for half an hour and not necessarily get on. Following the appearance of public vehicles, there are a few more empty rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages on the roads, but they have still not lost their importance.

Haruhimachi—the Japanese street that used to be so crowded that it was impassable—was once deserted after the Japanese expatriates left. Now, it is no longer deserted. Replacing the former Japanese expatriates, our compatriots are setting up densely packed stalls of used goods there. Woolens, furs, civilian goods, and military goods are piled high. Prices are several times to dozens of times higher than they were a few months ago. Still, there are buyers. People will not completely forget the lessons learned in many ways. Escaping the noisy city, taking a car or walking to the suburbs for a stroll makes one feel much more relaxed and happy. Although, in the suburbs, you also see many underage young people or old people with stooped backs carrying heavy bundles of firewood, one after another, trudging from the distant countryside towards Shenyang, further increasing the desolation of the late autumn wilderness.

In the Suburbs - Both the Northern and Eastern Mausoleums

The Northern and Eastern Mausoleums in the suburbs are somewhat like the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum in Nanjing. People who come to Shenyang always want to see them. The road to the Northern Mausoleum is closer. Taking a car from the city takes only ten minutes to reach. Because it's late autumn! There are few people around. Except for the three or so photographers taking quick photos in front of the gate and those selling fruit, there is a sense of being able to catch sparrows in the doorway after walking in. Even though the entrance ticket is only two yuan! The central avenue leading to the stele and the sacrificial hall is wide, flat, and still clean. The densely packed pines and cypresses standing on both sides of the avenue are dark green and black. Seeing them makes people yearn and feel emotional, but it also makes people feel empty. The stele engraved with Han and Manchu commemorative texts is tall and black. If someone hadn't smeared some white powder on it, it would be difficult to see even half a word. No one knows that the Qing Taizong is lying in the walled tomb a hundred paces away from the stele.

The road to the Eastern Mausoleum is even farther than the road to the Northern Mausoleum. Taking a jeep from the city takes at least thirty minutes. The Eastern Mausoleum is where the Qing Taizu's tomb is located. The architectural style is the same as the Northern Mausoleum, so the Northern Mausoleum should have been built to imitate the Eastern Mausoleum. It is surrounded by city walls, and outside the city walls are gloomy cypresses. Climbing to the third floor of the sacrificial hall, you can overlook the scenery of the wilderness. The tomb is a three-zhang-high (approx. 10 meters) small mountain, and the top of the mountain is smeared with a layer of cement, but most of it has peeled off. The photographer said that in the past, neither the Eastern Mausoleum nor the Northern Mausoleum were allowed to be seen by people, only the Japanese were an exception.

Isn't there a housing shortage in Shenyang? But in the near suburbs, you still see empty houses everywhere. Although these houses are so damaged that only the empty shell or only the four walls remain, they could still be useful if they were repaired.

### Thoughts After Returning From the Book Market

— Tong Xian

Every time I go to bookstores, I always go with excitement and return with disappointment. In a nutshell, we only feel the poverty of the Chinese cultural world. Regarding books on current affairs, we know that authors cannot break away from their personal positions, but most of what we see is propaganda that is too strong, some bordering on abuse, lacking the demeanor of a current affairs commentator. Regarding scientific books, it is truly like finding gold in the sand, not easy to find a few. Even if there are a few, they are outdated. As for reports of one's own discoveries or experiments, we have not seen any. Regarding academic research and writings, there are said to be no creative masterpieces. It is not even easy to find a systematic work. Several academic elders have only published a few collections, compiling and publishing many scattered pieces of writing that have been written over time. Rising stars who have a complete set of research have not yet emerged.

This proves that in the past eight years of the War of Resistance, scholars, due to the difficulties of life and the instability of the environment, were unable to engage in systematic research. Mr. Hu Shi said that the level of students in Beiping was three years lower than before the war. I think that we people who do academic research are also three years behind. Perhaps even more than that. This is our spiritual loss in the War of Resistance. Others cannot compensate us for it. We need to make up for it ourselves. The academic atmosphere is very thin everywhere. We only hope that people who research academia can calm down and devote themselves to writing, so that they can relight the already dim cultural brilliance, and that we can see a few great works in the bookstores.

### "Social Thought"

— Jun Zhi

Author: Sun Benwen Publisher: The Commercial Press

We live in today, and yet there are still people who are developing and thriving on the decadent academic theories that should have been "abandoned." Young friends who do not recognize them, if they accept these theories, will be "poisoned" by them and will even drag this advancing era backward.

This can be said to be a major crisis!

Indeed, the times are constantly developing. In this process of development, the growth of new ideas and the "abandonment" of old consciousness are constantly circulating. People always push new developments by following new growth! To make the world tend toward a prosperous path. However, in our country, this crisis is hidden. New ideas cannot be adopted, and old corruption is expanding, growing longer than before. In another ten or twenty years, I don't know what kind of China it will become? Only "thought" can control an entire person. Once thought is "poisoned," one's actions will inevitably be so. Therefore, to rescue this crisis, we must first give people correct thoughts and use these correct thoughts to transform a new and forward-looking society. The current academic community in China is carrying this great mission!

Youth's Recognition

The vast youth population, due to the circumstances, has developed petty-bourgeois habits. Other than their homework, they waste their time on movies and literary novels. Of course, this is not necessarily a bad thing, but you cannot gain a recognition of society. Although there are also literary works on revolutionary careers such as "Iron Flood" and "How Steel Was Tempered," if you do not know the historical background and the source of academic thoughts at the time, then even if you read the above-mentioned literature, you still cannot understand what is going on in this era? Then, you will still have no recognition of "society."

Based on the above, we feel that it is necessary to have a recognition of society, and it is necessary to advance thought. Therefore, it is even more necessary to read some books on correct academics. According to a statistic from a professor teaching at a university, only two or three out of every hundred Chinese college students pay attention to academic thought. Judging from this, the backwardness of Chinese society is a matter of course.

Young friends! We will never be content to fall behind. Now, let's all read some academic books and recognize this world.

This unavoidable digression must stop here. Now I would like to introduce an easy-to-read book to you - "Social Thought." In this book, the origins and content of many Western social thoughts are discussed concisely and clearly, from Plato and Aristotle to Marx and Comte. It expounds the main points of the ideas of various European and American thinkers, and also talks about the correctness and errors of the theories of each. We can know its outline, and we don't necessarily accept its conclusions. After reading it, we can have an image of each family's thought. From this image, we can then do further research—individual research of each family. From this, we can obtain recognition of each era and use our own pure academic and objective viewpoints to research and obtain correct recognition of each family. Here, I will briefly analyze and review this book:

The Legacy of Antiquity

Plato, we know that he was a famous Greek philosopher (487-347 BC). He once studied under Socrates. His knowledge was mainly based on "justice." The book briefly mentions his life and thought. The work "The Republic" can express his ideal society. In addition to Plato, there are Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Epicureans. Aristotle's philosophy is that society is produced naturally; the Stoics believe that it is produced by "unified consciousness," and the Epicureans believe that it is produced by self-interest.

Roman ancient philosophy is different from Greek philosophy. Due to convenient transportation, the country is more unified. Polybius valued cause and effect and advocated the theory of political cycles; Cicero believed that people have social instincts; Seneca advocated that society originated from the fall of human nature. As for the social thought of Jesus and the Christian religion, the above five families cannot be suitable for today's society.

After this ancient past, we entered the Middle Ages. Aquinas's "Summa Theologica" and Dante's "Divine Comedy" were both deeply influenced by religion. Dante's praise of imperialism and singing of utopian peace, with one person dictating the world; although he created the law of peace, it is still difficult to see in practice today.

Since the end of the Middle Ages, the situation has changed to the early modern period. Royal power was abolished, and various countries were also moving towards freedom and peace. From this time on, it was a new departure from the old and corrupt past. Machiavelli of Italy regarded political immorality as patriotism, that is, implementing harsh policies to treat the people. This kind of thought was realized in defeated Japan. Luther's "Theory of Obedience" and Calvin's "Institutes of the Christian Religion" are both backward thoughts. Bodin can be compared to Aristotle, and his academic theories are very compatible.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, under the autocratic and fatuous politics of the English king, Thomas More's two-volume "Utopia" appeared, criticizing the society at that time and expressing the state of contemporary society. Following him, there were also many "Utopian" thinkers. In the 17th century, there were the Englishman Hobbes's "Leviathan" and "The Laws of Nature and Nations"; Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," and Rousseau's "The Social Contract"; these three men represented the social thoughts of that era. At the same time, Montesquieu of France's "Separation of Powers" explained the requirements of the time. By 1747, Turgot had written "Reflections on the Formation and the Distribution of Riches," and some say it was the precursor to "The Wealth of Nations." Before Turgot, Bacon, Descartes, and Montaigne had all stood on the path of "progress."

Hume was famous as a skeptic. Voltaire and Condorcet were both reformers during the French Revolution, but they trusted the power of subjective science too much. At the same time, in Germany, Fichte and Hegel's subjective idealism was changed to objective idealism, which was also adopted by the people at that time.

Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations" in naturalism was a contribution to economics; his social thought had a "laissez-faire" policy, which was also an original view for reducing oppression. Smith's friend Ferguson's social thought was also naturalist like Adam. He argued that people have a "motivation to move upward" and that the progress of society depends on the two factors of culture and psychology. At that time, their views were already rare. Later, there were also economists of the Adam Smith school such as Malthus. Malthus's thinking was even more advanced, with the "population theory." The origin of the increase and decrease of the population theory, placed in today, is of course no longer correct.

Saint-Simon used scientific methods to study social phenomena, or for the founding of Comte's sociology; before and after the founding of Comte's sociology, in the 19th century, social thought showed a tendency of "monism." Buckle used the role of the material environment to explain social phenomena, while Gobineau was the opposite of Buckle, believing that race is the main thing for the prosperity of a nation and culture; Chamberlain trusted talent.

The last two chapters discuss the social thoughts of Marx and Comte:

Regarding Marx, he is famous for his book "Capital." The achievements of this book are highly praised by both supporters and opponents of Marx's theories. This book briefly elaborates on Marx's historical background and the important theory of "historical materialism." The author pointed out various errors of Marx, but some of the arguments are subjective. This point needs to be changed to stand on an objective position.

As for Comte, he is an important figure in the ideological world. His contribution to sociology is very great. Everything about Comte is described in the most detail in the book, but because it is detailed, it is inevitable that there is too much praise. If we avoid this point, we can better understand Comte.

Above, I have briefly described the content of this book. Apart from some unavoidable minor errors, most of this book is worth adopting.

I said earlier that this book is easier to understand because the material is still rich. We can use this book as a starting point for studying social thought, and we don't necessarily have to fully accept its conclusions, but we can read its concise elaboration.

Young people! I hope that you will gradually develop correct thoughts.

### "A Cry in the Wilderness"

— Xiao Hong

Aunt Xiao was a kind-hearted old woman, with no meanness in her heart and no curse on her lips. She chatted idly and casually, murmuring about the small things around her, ordinary and affectionate, simple and natural. Precisely because she was affectionate and natural, she used her resentments sparingly. Even her "Field of Life and Death," which carried the pain of national subjugation, was no different; it was as if an old man of seventy or eighty years was talking about the wars of his youth, bringing back memories of loved ones and cherished little objects that had been lost. He couldn't help but have a few tears of heartache in the corners of his eyes, letting them well up or fall—after all, the era was long ago, and the erosion of time had worn away the piercing pain and the grinding hatred. This is also the style of Xiao Hong's works.

Those mustard-seed-like little people, humble and insignificant, forgotten in the corners of the world, were each and every one mentioned by her, and each equally shared her deep and broad sympathy. There were no earth-shattering characters, no sensational stories; they were either common soldiers' helpers, boatmen, or farmers, or else kiln workers or washerwomen: these people had good hearts and hard lives, and each received her passionate love. In another work entitled "Hands," the daughter of a dyer went to school, and her classmates ridiculed her indigo-stained blue hands, disliked her, and distanced themselves from her; she felt the world was so cold that she had her father take her out of school with her luggage. The author worried with her, and wept with her. Did the author, feeling sympathy for her plight, turn around and complain about those who bullied her? No. To love beauty and hate ugliness is human nature, and the author did not feel that there was anything strange or hateful about them.

In her writing, one cannot find a single hateful character. Even the mother-in-law who tormented her adopted daughter-in-law to death, and the old widower who robbed graves for a living, were forgiven and excused by the author. When the young daughter-in-law was seriously ill, didn't her mother-in-law exhaust every method: folk remedies, wild medicines, welcoming gods and chasing away demons, consulting oracles, and spending over five thousand strings of cash, thereby crying herself blind in one eye? "Which family's adopted daughter-in-law doesn't suffer? ... Although I did beat her a bit too much, how else could I have disciplined her into a good person?" The old man by the lotus pond, whose son had died and whose daughter-in-law had remarried, didn't he try to learn to be a carpenter, even though he didn't know how to use his son's axe and saw? When he went out to rob graves in the middle of the night, didn't he hide it from his grandson, and when he thought of him possibly finding out, didn't he "feel great shame and immediately blush"? In the article "Disaster," He Nansheng, who told his students fine-sounding words about living and dying with the land, while packing up broken spittoons and empty cans to squeeze onto the train early, was treated in the most impolite way, but it was only a cold mockery, and it couldn't be called a heavy-handed condemnation. Throughout the entire work, there is not a single hateful character; what Xiao Hong portrays are poverty and ignorance. She does not denounce human nature, but complains about the system.

The characters are ordinary, and the plots are simple; to put it bluntly, most of the works have no story. Xiao Hong cannot be considered a novelist; she is an essayist. An old boatman warmly welcomes the X Road soldiers, and when he learns that the soldier is heading to his hometown, he asks him to take a message. ("Yellow River") A helper falls in love with the master's soldier and sends him off to fight, secretly wanting to save up her wages to arrange a future home. ("Vague Expectation") A village girl helps a Jiangnan evacuee wash clothes, and after losing this lucrative job, she still goes up the mountain to gather firewood. ("Under the Mountain") A young "red devil" is pushed into giving a speech but can't say a word, and bursts into tears in the laughter of the crowd. ("The Child's Speech") How intimately she knows the lives of those little people, how sympathetically she understands their joys and sorrows; even though they are insignificant little episodes, she picks them up casually, presses them down casually, talks about them murmuringly, and strums them lightly, like tuning a secluded piano string, singing out unmelodious, rambling notes.

On the literary labor, what identity does she present? —She is well-versed in the sufferings of the people, but does not wield the scalpel; like a kind-hearted and responsible nurse, Xiao Hong uses warm sympathy and gentle tones to comfort the souls of the suffering under her care with a spring breeze.

"Accepting fate passively, you say my life is a pity, but I myself don't care, you think it's very dangerous, but I think it's a source of pride. If not proud, what can I do? Life is more bitter than sweet." (Postscript to "Tales of Hulan River") This is Xiao Hong's self-analysis. She says that the character of "accepting fate passively" not only universally influenced—but also deeply permeated—the characters in the author's writing.

Spring and Autumn

### Stories of Poets: Lu Fangweng and Tang Huixian

— Tang Jingde

Lu Fangweng (named You, courtesy name Wu Guan, from Shanyin), the patriotic poet of the Song Dynasty, had one of the most heartbreaking events in his life, which he still remembered and could not forget even in his eighties. It was his beloved wife, Tang Huixian, who was not favored by his aunt and was forced to leave her husband's house. Tang was the daughter of Hong and was related to Fangweng through marriage. She was also able to write, but not as exquisitely as Li Qingzhao and Zhu Shuzhen.

After Tang was expelled by her aunt, Fangweng secretly rented a house for her outside and still secretly visited her. But the good times did not last long. One day, his mother accidentally found out, and after that, Lu You was monitored and cut off from Huixian, and no longer had the opportunity to visit her. As for Tang, she was young and had no one to rely on, so she had to remarry Cheng, a clansman from the same county (or Zhao, according to one version). At that time, Gu Weng was also matched by his mother and married on a selected date.

However, by chance, one day, Fangweng was bored and went for a walk in Shenmin Garden near Yuji Temple, and met Huixian and her husband. Fangweng was not convenient to greet her at the time, but Tang told Cheng, saying that he was her cousin. Cheng then set up a banquet to entertain Lu You, and Huixian also fulfilled the duty of a host, personally offering wine. Fangweng was overwhelmed with emotion and could not help but write a poem "Hairpin Phoenix" on the wall in the garden, which read:

Red crisp hands, yellow rice wine, the garden full of spring palace willow, the east wind is evil,

Feeling thin, a heart of sorrow, years of separation: wrong, wrong, wrong!

Spring is as old, people are thin, tear marks are red and wet with silk, peach blossoms fall,

Idle pond pavilion, mountain alliance is still, brocade book is difficult to entrust: do not, do not, do not!

Fangweng was only thirty-one years old at the time. The meaning of his poem is that the old events were triggered by Huixian's yellow wine, mentioning his mother's stubbornness, which caused his young couple to be separated. Although he regretted it, it was already too late. Tang saw the inscription and wrote a poem with him, (but this poem is quite suspected of being fabricated by later generations,) which reads:

Worldly feelings are thin, human feelings are evil, rain sends dusk and flowers are easy to fall, the evening wind dries,

Tear marks remain, wanting to write about the heart, talking alone leaning on the railing: difficult, difficult, difficult!

People become different, today is not yesterday, the sick soul is always like a swing rope, the horn sound is cold,

The night is late, afraid of people asking, swallowing tears and pretending to be happy: hide, hide, hide!

Later, after thirty-seven years, Fangweng was already an old man of sixty-eight years old. One day, he went to Shen Garden again. The owner of the garden had changed, and Tang was no longer in the world. He wrote another poem "Visiting Shen Garden," which said:

Maple leaves are beginning to turn red, oak leaves are yellow, Heyang's sad temples are afraid of new frost, (Pan Yue once served as the magistrate of Heyang, and began to see white hair at the age of thirty-two, white hair refers to white hair.)

The forest pavilion feels old and empty, who can tell the broken heart on the spring road,

The wall remains covered in dust, the broken clouds and dreams are vast,

Over the years, delusional thoughts have been eliminated, returning to the futon with a stick of incense.

Seven years passed again. He was seventy-five years old. One day, he revisited Shen Garden and wrote two more poems:

The dream broke and the fragrance disappeared for forty years, the old willows in Shen Garden do not fly with catkins,

This body will be made into Kuaiji mountain soil, still mourn the relics with a sigh.

Also

The setting sun on the city wall mourns the horn, Shen Garden has no old pool,

The spring waves under the heartbreaking bridge are green, once a startling goose reflected its shadow. (Startling goose—Luoshen Fu has a phrase "Ruo Jinghong", which is used as a metaphor for his wife Tang.)

After another six years, he was old and was already an old man of eighty-one years old. However, he was still affectionate. One evening at the end of the year, he had a dream, dreaming of everything in Shen Garden, the plum blossoms were still there, but the beauty was gone. The "Hairpin Phoenix" poem written on the wall fifty years ago, I suppose, has also fallen off and blurred. His poem said:

I am afraid to walk on the red road south of the city, and I am even more saddened by Shen's family,

The fragrance penetrates the sleeves of the plum blossoms, the green dips into the spring water of the temple bridge.

Also

I met spring again on the small path south of the city, but only saw plum blossoms and no people,

The jade bones have long been buried under the spring soil, and the ink marks still lock the dust on the wall.

### An Extra Chapter Outside the Deep Alley

— Hu Mu

Deep Alley

That deep, deep alley, an alley that people cannot find their way through... I have come.

On a rainy night, I listened attentively to the raspy sound of the copper gong, a blind fortune teller, leading an eleven or twelve year old girl. That little girl did not have the white and tender skin of a noble lady, the wind and frost of life had made her suffer enough...

A few days ago, in this small alley, there was a wedding sedan chair drawn by horses. It seemed that another humble family was going to marry off their daughter, and another aristocratic young master was going to marry a "concubine"...

On rainy days, I am even more afraid to walk through this alley, because this alley is not only dark, but also very muddy... I only love that teahouse in the deep alley, where every day, many vagrants tell of the hardships of life.

I only love that family in the alley, they seem to be singing on the streets every day, a clapper, a fiddle, coupled with that raspy throat, arousing the joy of those poor people.

I love even more that bright little lamp in the deep alley, illuminating the path I trudge through in the dark night.

Record of Buying Water

In the early morning, when tufts of dawn clouds are rising in the sky, at this time the sky is about to radiate rays of golden light, the woman who buys water comes out, with disheveled hair, twisting waist, and drowsy eyes, blankly shooting out a tired divine light. At this time, the stove in the tea room is bustling. Besides the sparks crackling and jumping in the stone stove, the rest would be the tender voice of the woman buying water. "Boiled water, one kettle..." Listen, how beautiful, how elegant, how tactful this voice is!

And every woman who buys water, always puts on a red silk shirt, a fruit-green cloth or light blue trousers, and as a rule, wears a pair of wooden clogs (many women even wear big red satin slippers). When they go to buy water in groups, I know that their habit is on the one hand to save on firewood costs, and on the other hand to use this boiled water to cook rice. The girls who buy water are definitely not from wealthy merchants or noble families. On the contrary, they belong to a kind of poor class. Every day, I see them smiling at me with their teapots, and I understand the hardships of their lives...

So, on rainy streets, I prefer to sit in the teahouse, waiting for them, they like to hear me tell fables of the new era, but I need to hear their stories of life...

Interesting Anecdotes About Writers

### Andersen's Bedtime Curses

— Shen Si

Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) was a famous Danish fairy tale writer. He was the most timid and suspicious. It is said that every day before going to bed, he had to throw a thick book under the bed and mutter: "Hey! Am I still afraid of you? You're here again! I knew long ago that you were hiding under the bed." He had to perform this set every day, because he was afraid that someone would hide under the bed and harm him after he fell asleep.

### Let Time Test Faith — French Writer Maurois's View on Peace —

— Wang Rui

A few days ago, I was chatting with a young French officer. When the Nazi German army invaded Alsace and was about to occupy Strasbourg, he was stationed in Alsace. At that time, the situation was very serious, and the defense line could not be easily broken through.

"At that time, I was leading a hundred brothers," the young captain told me, "but I suddenly had a whimsical idea, I felt that to preserve Strasbourg depended entirely on our one hundred and one people. If we could hold our fan-shaped position, nothing could go wrong. Of course, the evolution of the situation at that time was not entirely like this..."

"However, later it turned out as we expected, all other fan-shaped positions had the same idea as us, and decided never to surrender and retreat; as a result, the Chen line was as solid as a rock, and the German army was never able to cross the thunder pool."

The situation we are in today is the same. If we do not want the peace defense line to be easily broken through, then each of us—men or women, young or old—must think like this: "It all depends on my determination, I should do my best to defend peace."

Faced with a peaceful world, a world of destruction, we must now choose. Because, if we cannot unite sincerely, then in the end we will inevitably be defeated one by one by the atomic bomb.

The current situation forces us to consider, what depends entirely on individual actions. If a unprecedented revolution does not occur in the hearts of mankind, this revolution will be of great benefit to the liberation of world peace. - Then all education will be in vain. We can and we must make the greatest efforts to defend culture. The foundation of peace, is not here, not there, but in the hearts of mankind. We must adhere to this faith between us. And the responsibility of you Americans is especially great, you must think about this repeatedly, and obtain a correct and appropriate conclusion, because you are one of the two strongest countries in the world today. My American friends, you should show to all other countries in the world that we can lay the foundation for peace from the fair resolution of economic problems, and the facts are waiting for you to make unremitting efforts.

Translator's note: Maurois is a famous French writer of today. During World War II, he could not bear Nazi oppression and fled to the United States. The above is a conversation between Maurois and American reporters when he recently left the United States to return to his French hometown.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 85

— Ye Jingfeng

Fearing that the lights would sweep over and make it inconvenient to delay, I took a quick look, climbed down the stone wall, and followed Tiger Brother, drilling into the thickets. I gave a signal, and Tiger Brother responded from the edge of the thicket. This thicket was full of German holly, densely planted. It took a lot of effort to get through. At a glance, I saw that all the buildings were in the north, scattered in twos and threes, with few lights and not very bright, probably because important people had already left. The one in the middle seemed to be a three-dimensional building, in the form of a fortress, towering there darkly, very ferocious. This square was at least half a kilometer wide, paved with a mixture of sand and mud, the ground was yellow and black, as if uneven, but in fact it was very flat; all sides were surrounded by the same color holly, with only one entrance at each end in the far north.

The form of this restricted area was completely different from the sketches we had drafted, so the exploration work had to be started again. The first problem at the moment was to avoid the patrols. This area of thickets was of course a cover for carrying out work, but it could only cover human eyes and ears, but not the dog's sense of smell. On the surface, like the man and dog patrolling just now, there was only one person and one dog, and only two bullets were needed to settle the matter. But if the bullets could not hit, and did not hit a fatal place, once the alarm went out, we would be in a desperate situation. Moreover, this place was very quiet, and the sound of gunfire would be like reporting to the enemy ourselves, how could we mess around at will?

But after careful calculation, the patrol just now passed by at about half past seven, probably walking along the road, counting him half an hour, then he must have started from the departure point at seven o'clock, and walked here in half an hour. This patrol, according to the usual time limit, is either once an hour, or once every two hours. Looking at the calm situation today, maybe it's once every three hours, it's not impossible. Now, taking caution as the top priority, only count him as once an hour, then, there is at least forty minutes left, we can turn north again along this thicket to the east, and meander past.

Before, in Saizi, when I was fighting guerrillas with Tiger Brother, there were also several times when I scouted the enemy's camp with the sentries. The only difference was that although we two sneaked into the tiger's den, we had backup and were fearless. Here, there are only two of us, and the time and place are very different, so I ordered Tiger Brother to go first, and I followed his route at a distance of six or seven meters, so that no matter if there was an alarm in front or behind, we would have a little assistance from each other, and we could also restrain the enemy.

Following this thicket to the east, at the end, we turned and walked north. Under such action, we reached the enemy's building area safely. The problem now is to find out what these buildings are used for, and where most of the people are. To measure this first problem, we can only guess from the building form, and the second point can be based on the amount of light. The area where we are located is the left wing of the building, with a series of four four-story Western-style houses; each separated by two or three meters; it looks like the doors are facing south, and in terms of design, there is clumsiness hidden in the sturdiness; estimating down, they are probably offices and dormitories. A strange point is that no sound can be heard, and there are no posts. There is also an open space nearly thirty meters wide on the side.

Looking at the three-dimensional building in the middle, it is obvious that it is the main headquarters, with five floors, and the top seems to be a platform, with very powerful radio transmitting and receiving equipment. The west side, because the distance is too far, I can't see clearly, according to Tiger Brother, it looks like a warehouse, because the windows are round, small and few.

We observed for a while, and then in the darkness, we went around to the east side of the four buildings. As soon as we approached the corner, we faintly heard some voices and broadcast music from the far north; it turned out that behind these four clumsy buildings, there were rows and rows of many small houses, the voices and music were transmitted from there, and the lights were more and larger. Needless to say, that area must be the barracks. All the small teams of Japanese troops who had not yet been dispatched must be living there.

At this time, we carefully walked along the base of the wall, looking for cover, and attacking forward. When we reached the northeast corner of the first house, we leaned against the corner of the wall and stood.

"Little aunt," Tiger Brother pointed to the edge of the open space to the east and said, "should we run to that area of thickets, and follow the forest, close to the back?"

### Newsstands

— Shaofu

For the sake of rectifying the city's appearance, there are really too many things that need to be done. For example, the traffic problem, although the authorities have made efforts for several months, has made a lot of progress. Frankly speaking, it is not up to standard. For example, the yellow stop lines at various intersections are neither universal, nor do they fade away after being painted for two or three weeks, and pedestrians and vehicles often exceed this line.

Now the authorities are coming to ban the newsstands in the central district. The congestion of the sidewalks and the obstruction of traffic by some newsstands are indeed facts, but we should also think about these small business operators. Not to mention the positive contribution they have made in promoting the circulation of books and publications and the dissemination of culture, some newsstands are not always obstructing traffic and damaging the city's appearance. Therefore, the authorities may designate certain areas to allow them to continue to set up stalls, or impose various restrictions and improvements on the existing situation. If this can be done, the newsstand vendors will certainly be happy to follow.

Newsstands are different from ordinary hawker stalls. Many vendors have received secondary education. They are forced by livelihood, and they cannot shoulder the burden of carrying baskets. Helpless, they scrape together and borrow a little capital to engage in this business that is close to poor scholars. Their situation is pitiful, and their behavior is also beneficial to society. Therefore, in the ban on street vendors, it is best to consider slightly, and it is not necessary to treat them all the same.

On the main streets of Europe and the United States, there are often newsstands dotted in between. It can be seen that the main reasons for the smooth and spectacular traffic and city appearance are elsewhere.

We absolutely support the authorities' painstaking efforts to plan for all aspects of the city, and their courage to go to work. We would like the authorities to be able to think carefully in all matters, and improve them step by step, so that they can get on track in a natural and gradual manner.

The Dark Side of Shanghai

### "Old Ghost" and "Old Old Ghost"

— Wei

Yesterday at about ten o'clock in the evening, I took the Route 5 public bus from Caojiadu back to school. Probably because it was very late, there were very few people on the bus. There were only five or six people in the carriage. Across from me, there were two passengers wearing Chinese-style short shirts talking loudly. Because the voice was very loud, it attracted my attention.

The one sitting on the right, wearing a woolen hat crookedly, holding a half-smoked cigarette in his hand, was pouring out his triumphant experience—

"Haha, A ×, my father made an unexpected fortune last night, haha, it's simply an unexpected fortune!"

"How so?" His friend felt that it was necessary to hear it.

"Haha, last night, I came out of the old wine shop where you were, and on the way, two little ghosts (pronounced '　ju' in Shanghai dialect) suddenly popped out to borrow copper coins from me. Hey, I was just thinking about how to get rice for tomorrow! Hey, guess what I did, I told them: You two old ghosts are running into an old old ghost today!"

Just at this moment, two friends in suits turned around the corner. I thought to myself, what a great opportunity, so I said to them, "If you want to borrow copper coins, follow the old old ghost!" I waited for these two to approach, and patted them on the shoulder, "Hey! You two bosses, lend me some money to use." They paused for a moment, as if a little embarrassed. I also said to them, "Be nice, lend me some money, I'll spare your suits today, don't be ignorant." The two young men were quite nice, and they took out about a dozen ten thousand dollars in foreign currency. Haha... How about the old old ghost?"

Then there was a burst of laughter in the carriage. Five or six passengers and the conductor, Mr. ××, were all laughing heartily. His friend praised him repeatedly: "Unexpected fortune, unexpected fortune!"

Sitting in the corner of the carriage, I couldn't laugh, but couldn't help but feel a chill. I have been in Shanghai for a few months, and almost every day the newspapers have reported robbery cases, all kinds of robbery methods, all kinds of cases, which have really opened my eyes, who came from a small city; but like last night, doing robbery and singing it to people in the bus like a triumphant masterpiece, I couldn't help but be stunned, but what surprised me even more was that the two ×× also laughed indifferently as if they were listening to a joke, what is their responsibility, I am simply at a loss! Maybe it's because I don't understand Shanghai enough? Maybe I'm still too naive and overreacting? Didn't everyone in the car laugh it off? But I even thought that winter is coming soon, in Shanghai today, where people's livelihood is difficult, I have to worry about winter defense!

### "Be Smart - One of Us!"

— Da

On a No. 8 trolley, a well-dressed passenger was pickpocketed, so the trolley stopped; several companions of this passenger helped him search, and they were all well-dressed individuals, with two even rolling up their white sleeves or holding toothpicks in their mouths.

Sure enough, a well-dressed man with gold teeth and a felt hat grabbed someone who was not so well-dressed and said:

"Be smart, hand it over."

The person who was grabbed blushed and struggled.

"We're all in this together, just say it, it's okay!" Two of the well-dressed men also went up and said to the red-faced person who was grabbed.

Seeing that things were not going well, the man could only blink his eyes and twist his mouth. Immediately, a uniformed, dignified doorman x dug out a large stack of banknotes from his pocket, red ones, flowered ones.

"Smack!" The doorman x was slapped across the mouth.

"Damn it! You're also in on it, I saw it coming." One of the well-dressed men said.

This man's face also turned red, and the five finger marks on his right forehead were even more visible.

"Drag him down! Drag him down!" Amidst a chorus of "drag him down," both men were dragged off the trolley. The pickpocket victim also got off the trolley, and the trolley continued on its way, leaving a large group of people on the side of the road.

"I never thought ×× would actually be an accomplice!" An middle-aged woman exclaimed.

"He was just scolding pickpockets as hateful, isn't he the very pickpocket who deserves to be killed?" A young man said.

"Look at him wearing a uniform, hey, damn it, I saw it coming a long time ago! Who do you think we are! He's really digging his own grave." One of the gentlemen who hit the doorman also spoke up; he didn't get off the trolley, and at this moment, he was still holding a toothpick in the right corner of his mouth.

Then the trolley car buzzed with chatter.

—This was many days ago; the day before yesterday, a friend came to tell me that he had been pickpocketed for 100,000 yuan on a bus. At the time, he was certain that someone dressed like an agency employee was the most suspicious, but he didn't dare to search him. (This is probably because my friend hasn't learned to say things like "Be smart, one of us!")

After this, I understood that in some situations, we should skillfully say a few phrases like "one of us," as this can often be much more advantageous. However, when you want to use the phrase "one of us," you must first consider whether you have learned to roll up your white sleeves or hold a toothpick in your mouth, etc. Otherwise, it will backfire. An experienced citizen certainly cannot fail to understand these things.

### ### List of Students Studying Abroad

— Yu Feng

The list of students admitted to study abroad has been published. I curiously read through the names of all the admitted students, and as a result, I discovered that many of the names of the admitted government-funded and self-funded students were the same. Not only were the strokes identical, but even the subjects they wanted to study were the same. This naturally cannot be a coincidence of people with the same name and surname, but rather that the students, after taking the government-funded exam, were afraid that they would not be admitted, so they took the self-funded exam as well, in order to leave themselves a backup plan, but who knew that they would be admitted to both.

I cannot criticize the few students who were admitted to both programs, but this occupies the places of others. For example, there were originally 148 government-funded places, but because one person took the exam twice and was admitted both times, the places of those with slightly lower scores who could have been admitted were taken away. How cruel this is to those who should have been admitted but were eliminated as a result!

And this also reduces the benefits to the entire country. If there should originally be 2,000 talented people returning to the country after studying abroad, then because one person takes up two places, the number is insufficient.

It is excusable for those taking the exam to have a mindset of seeking luck, but there are doubts about the method of publishing the exam list. I believe that those selecting people should examine the names selected to see if they took and were admitted to both exams, and then try to arrange things according to the situation, so as to avoid duplication. The list says there are 2,000 people, and I believe there should actually be 2,000 people going abroad to study.

### Paris Shanghai

— Xie Ping

Young Woman · Prostitute

If you want to enjoy yourself, please go to Paris!

Think whatever you want! What do you want to use to enjoy yourself? In what way do you want to enjoy yourself? There will definitely be no shortage in Paris. Please rest assured.

Paris is a consumer of "hedonism." The people of Paris are all filled with dramatic, novelistic charm.

Here is a poem praising Paris:

"Then drink wine, don't forget pleasure, because what will happen tomorrow, what will happen in the future,

No one knows. Don't run, don't work hard;

Please drink as much as you like! Share! Eat! Think about the present!

It doesn't matter whether you live or not.

Life is all like this, only opportunity matters!

If you get it first, then it's yours;

If you die, it's all someone else's, you have no share!"

If you can understand this poem, then you truly understand Paris.

Some people say that this hedonistic view of life in Paris is wrong. So they placed the blame for the fall of Paris this time on "pleasure."

If that is really the case, then the Parisian view of life after the war should change somewhat!

Compared to pre-war Paris, our Shanghai is inferior in every way. Only in one thing is Shanghai more extravagant, more licentious, and more decadent than Paris! If Paris is a young woman just learning about romance, then Shanghai is an incorrigible prostitute.

Paris has learned its lesson, but Shanghai may not even get a chance to repent!

### The Doctrine of the Mean

— Nian

Passenger: Is it one hundred and ten cents to ×× Road?

Ticket seller: Yes.

Passenger: Hehe, I only have one hundred and ten cents in change.

Ticket seller: It's unreasonable to be short ten cents, I'll just give you a one hundred-cent stamp.

Passenger: Oh!
