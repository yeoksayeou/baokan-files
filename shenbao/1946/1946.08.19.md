### Premier Song Issues Written Statement: Exchange Rate Readjusted, Hoping for National Cooperation to Stabilize Prices; Minister Peng Announces at Yesterday's Press Conference

[Our Own Dispatch] Propaganda Minister Peng Xuepei, yesterday at 6 PM, hosted domestic and foreign journalists at the Shanghai Municipal Government conference room, announcing that the Central Bank has been approved to adjust the foreign exchange rate, which will be changed on the exchange board this morning (19th) at 10 AM. Minister Peng first stated: Premier Song was unable to attend in person due to official duties, and then read Premier Song's written statement, the full text of which is as follows:

Today, the Central Bank has been approved to adjust the foreign exchange rate. On the 17th of this month, the government also decided to abolish export taxes. The purpose is to seek a balance in import and export trade and the vigorous development of production enterprises. In the future, it will continue to use gold reserves to stabilize the domestic currency value. Now that the purchasing power of the national currency abroad has exceeded the domestic currency value, this change in the foreign exchange rate can bring about a reasonable harmony between domestic and foreign currency values. It is hoped that people across the country will understand this purpose, and especially that production enterprises across the country, especially those dealing with essential goods for people's livelihoods, will appreciate the significance of the government's policies, which are related to the entire national economy and people's livelihoods, and even the safety of the entire future of production, and work together to ensure that prices are stabilized as a result.

Tracing Relevant Factors

Before deciding on the method, the government conducted a detailed review of various relevant economic issues, and especially carefully considered the timing of implementation. The important factors related to this issue are traced back to their origins and briefly explained as follows:

During the War of Resistance against Japan, our country suffered heavy direct losses of materials, and a large number of factories and all production equipment were destroyed, resulting in a significant decline in production capacity. In addition, foreign trade was extremely difficult, and imports were on the verge of extinction. By the time victory was achieved, domestic materials were in extreme shortage. Therefore, the most urgent need at that time was to replenish a large amount of materials, and the most effective and rapid method of replenishment was undoubtedly to encourage the import of foreign materials.

Implementing Parallel Policies

The provisional measures for the management of foreign exchange implemented in early March of this year have yielded significant results in terms of the expected effects. Over the past five months, the quantity of imported materials has increased, and prices have gradually decreased. However, the profits of some imported goods are still excessive, and some imported goods compete with domestic goods, which has a significant impact on domestic industry. As for the export industry, it has not made satisfactory progress, and the foreign exchange earned from exports is far less than the amount from imports. At the same time, agricultural and industrial products that can supply foreign markets are difficult to compete in the international market due to high production costs and are in a disadvantageous position. The continued collection of export taxes further increases the burden on export trade. All of the above require innovative measures to solve the difficulties currently encountered. The current time is the most appropriate for implementing reform measures. On the one hand, a bumper harvest is expected, and grain prices have gradually fallen. On the other hand, the export season is about to enter a period of sustained prosperity. After implementation, the following good results should be obtained: (1) Encourage exports and reduce imports; (2) Encourage overseas Chinese to remit funds back to the country; (3) Support domestic production enterprises. All of these can help to balance imports and exports. In addition to these measures, the government is also working hard to implement other parallel policies. In terms of transportation, it will make every effort to restore trunk routes by land and sea, and within the scope of financial possibility, expand as much as possible the port management and dispatching of national industrial and commercial centers such as Shanghai. It will set up strong management agencies to reduce the cost of loading and unloading goods and take all necessary steps to promote the smooth flow of trade. In terms of the disposal of enemy and puppet industries, it is planned to transfer them to private operation as much as possible. The government has absolutely no intention of adopting a universal state-owned system. As for larger production units, such as the China Textile Company, which require a large amount of capital and cannot be taken over by merchants for a while, they will be temporarily managed and operated by the government. However, the equity will be transferred in a planned manner within a short period of time, and the national treasury can obtain appropriate compensation. As for the capital market, it is currently actively planning to restore the Shanghai Stock Exchange to divert idle funds and provide a flexible way for state-owned enterprises to transfer when needed. Other enemy and puppet materials and equipment are being distributed and sold separately to increase supply and supplement treasury revenue. As for regular tax revenue, it is also being effectively organized and is increasing monthly. However, post-war reconstruction involves many aspects, and temporary expenditures are enormous. The response policy should be to postpone non-essential expenditures. During this period of reconstruction transition, the suffering felt by all parties is unavoidable. The government is determined to use all its strength to balance the budget, stabilize prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods. In short, the ultimate goal is to seek a peaceful and prosperous life for the people across the country and a prosperous social economy, so as to maintain our country's due position in the international community.

### Central Bank to Post Rates Today; Mayor Calls Important Meeting; Urges All Sectors Not to Raise Prices on Pretexts

After Peng read Premier Song's statement, Mr. Wei Jingmeng, a specialist from the International Propaganda Office, translated it into English. Peng then rose and stated that the Central Bank will officially post the foreign exchange rate tomorrow (the 19th) at 10 AM. At 9 AM, Mayor Wu will convene an important meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Government with the chairmen and executive directors of various industry associations in the city. Those invited include the chairman and executive directors of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Shops Association, the Textile Industry Association, the Department Store Industry Association, the Oil Industry Association, the Flour Industry Association, the Flour Mill Industry Association, China Vegetable Oil Plant, China Textile Company, and the general managers of Sincere Company, Wing On Company, Sun Sun Company, and The Sun Company. In addition to announcing the government's important policy of adjusting the foreign exchange rate, it will also appeal to the heads of various industry associations not to raise the prices of domestic goods that are not related to the foreign exchange rate on the pretext of the exchange rate adjustment, because the government's decision to abolish export taxes and adjust the exchange rate is purely for the development of production enterprises and export trade, so as to improve the current economic difficulties. As for general domestic goods, which are not fundamentally related to the foreign exchange rate, there is no reason to raise prices accordingly, especially for grain. With bumper harvests in various provinces, grain prices will gradually fall. On this point, it is hoped that the media will publicize more and assist the government in its efforts to stabilize prices.

Establishing a Port Affairs Committee

Minister Peng then made another announcement, saying: "The port of Shanghai has always been congested, and merchant ships have had to wait for two or three weeks outside the port to unload their cargo, which has been criticized by foreigners. The government has recently instructed the organization of a Port Affairs Committee, with Mayor Wu Guozhen as the chairman, and representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Finance, the Resources Committee, the Garrison Headquarters, the Jianghai Customs, the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, and various shipping companies as members, to study how to reform port affairs, control warehouses, docks, river traffic, and dredge the Huangpu River, etc., in order to quickly improve port affairs and cooperate with the measures just announced."

Purchasing 50,000 Tons of Vietnamese Rice

Finally, Minister Peng also clarified the recent domestic grain situation. He said: "This year, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces have had bumper harvests of grain. In Jiangxi, due to the new grain already entering the market, prices have fallen sharply. Although rice prices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have not fallen due to the current period of transition between harvests, there is no cause for concern. Because there are many ships now, the government is planning to transport grain from Sichuan, Jiangxi and other places in a continuous stream, so the rebound in rice prices in this city is only a matter of time. The government has also discussed with Mr. Mu, head of the French economic delegation, to order 50,000 tons of Vietnamese rice, which will be transported to China in the second half of this year. The rice is handled by four French companies, namely (1) Loddon, (2) Oriviel, (3) Canti Nintal, and (4) Denise Frere."

At yesterday's reception, in addition to Premier Song being unable to attend due to official business and Minister Peng presiding over the announcement, those present included Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, Feng Youzhen, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, Wei Jingmeng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the International Propaganda Office, Zhu Xubai, Director of the News Publication Office of the Municipal Government, and more than 60 domestic and foreign journalists. The meeting adjourned at 6:40 PM.

Remarks by the Director of the Customs Administration

(Another Dispatch) Yesterday, reporters interviewed Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, to ask for his opinion. According to Zhang, the government's implementation of the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate in accordance with the actual situation, although the adjusted tariff standards may not meet the ideals of domestic industry and commerce, is very suitable for the current environment in terms of reason and sentiment. (Please refer to page 7 for additional information on the exchange rate change.)

Fluctuations in the Price of U.S. Dollars Over the Past Year

Supporting Private Industry and Commerce; Industrial Loans and Technical Guidance Will Be Handled First; Ministers Wang, Zhu, and Yu Leave Guling for Nanjing

[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu stated that industrial loans have been approved by the authorities, and the measures have been drafted and will be announced soon.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Wang Yunwu and Zhu Jiahua are scheduled to leave Guling for Nanjing together on the 19th. On the afternoon of the 18th, Wang paid another visit to Chairman Chiang, reporting on the recent measures of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Afterwards, he told reporters that supporting the post-war recovery of private industry and commerce does not require petitions from the industrial and commercial sectors. As a matter of duty and conscience, he is obliged to do so. The way to support this will be to start with handling industrial loans and providing technical guidance. Detailed measures will be implemented gradually. Zhu stated that it is possible that Chairman Chiang will invite university presidents and professors to come to Guling in batches to inquire about matters.

[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei visited Chairman Chiang at 9:30 AM on the 18th for an hour, and visited Mr. Ma at 1 PM for more than an hour. According to Yu, the visit to Chairman Chiang was to report on the recovery of transportation and the implementation steps in the future, and the discussion with Marshal Ma was purely in the field of military science and did not involve other matters. Yu is scheduled to leave Guling for Nanjing on the morning of the 19th.

### Three Main Reasons for Improvement in Our Financial Situation

[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Sources concerned stated that the recent improvement in China's financial situation is mainly due to three reasons: (1) The clearing of enemy and puppet property has made headway, and sales in some areas have been smooth, increasing treasury revenue; (2) The revenue of state-owned enterprises has increased; (3) Various tax revenues have also increased. Under these circumstances, there has been a salary increase for civil servants. It is understood that this salary increase was implemented based on the principle of Chairman accepting the proposal of the Legislative Yuan. This move will increase the treasury's monthly expenditure by 15 billion yuan, but due to the improvement in revenue, it is no longer necessary to rely entirely on issuing currency.

### Chief of Staff Chen Cheng Works All Night

[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Amidst the busy military affairs, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng worked all night at the Ministry of National Defense yesterday and did not return to his residence.

### U.S. Troops at Beidaihe Station Attacked Again by Communist Troops; Continued to Hear Reports on Anping Incident

[United Press Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] A portion of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps, stationed at the Beidaihe train station, was attacked by Communist troops yesterday. According to the Yishi Daily, 10,000 Communist troops have disarmed the National Army road protection team guarding the station and surrounded a portion of the regular National Army troops in the area. The fighting continued into the night. National Army troops from Tangshan are currently rushing to Beidaihe to reinforce.

[Our Own Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] The 25-member group investigating the Anping incident continued its work as usual on the 18th. According to the rotational chairmanship system, Major General Zhang Shuheng, the government representative, presided over the meeting on the 18th. First, Lieutenant Colonel Burge, commander of the 1st Marine Battalion, and Corporal Wei Gen, who participated in the Anping battle, were questioned. Lieutenant Colonel Burge's report provided the most new materials. He stated: (1) The composition of the patrol on July 29 was four patrol vehicles in front and four patrol vehicles in the rear, with fifteen transport vehicles escorted in the middle, commanded by a lieutenant, with four sergeants and thirty-seven soldiers, and one medical officer. The weapons included one .50 caliber machine gun, one .30 caliber machine gun, set up on the front and rear vehicles, two 60mm grenade launchers, ten Browning automatic rifles, one Thompson submachine gun, and twenty-six ten-round rifles. This patrol was an enhanced version of the general patrol. The general patrol had a minimum of 25 soldiers and one officer. This patrol was assigned soldiers from the 1st Regiment in addition to the soldiers belonging to the 1st Battalion. Communist Party representative Huang Yifeng pointed out that this kind of formation exceeded the battalion's structure and must have been organized by the division. (2) The enhanced formation of the patrol was due to the fact that U.S. military personnel were attacked twice on the way from Beiping to Tianjin on July 28, and the division headquarters had received reports. (3) There were no National Army troops stationed in the area five miles east and west of Anping, which is now a place for Communist troops to enter and exit, but he did not see it himself. (4) He denied that combatants were concentrated in the front of the convoy. There were also combatants in the rear of the column. Duke's claim that the rear machine gun could not be operated was because he was a passenger and did not understand the overall situation. (5) Before the patrol set off, the instructions he gave were: A, escort the transport vehicles to Beiping, B, clear any obstacles encountered on the road, and if shot at, accelerate and pass through. If there is unusual shooting that may endanger the vehicles, materials, and personnel, retaliate. (6) There was a truck in the convoy approved by the division headquarters, loaded with relief supplies, with four Chinese people on board. (7) His report to the Executive Headquarters was drafted after interviewing 49 people. He did not know about the National Army providing the U.S. military with intelligence. (8) There was a wireless vehicle in the front and rear of the patrol. Before the patrol set off that day, the battalion headquarters specially set up a radio station outside Tianjin to facilitate long-distance communication with the patrol. Contact with the patrol was lost at 11:05. (9) Due to the obstacles laid on the road and the deployment of troops on all three sides of the highway, it can be seen that the attackers were acting in a planned manner. The questioning was completed at 11:30. Corporal Wei Gen's report contained roughly the same content. It was not completed until 1 PM.

### Marshal Ma Cables Zhou Enlai; Rumored to Be Related to Resuming Peace Talks; Ambassador Stuart Postpones Departure from Beiping to Nanjing to Tomorrow

[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Marshal Ma is in good spirits after arriving at Lushan for the fourth time and may fly to Nanjing from here on the 21st or 22nd.

[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] It is rumored that when Marshal Ma visited Chairman Chiang after arriving at Lushan, he discussed how to resume peace talks. There is much close attention to this new development here. Colonel Ke Yi, Marshal Ma's representative in Nanjing, received a telegram from Marshal Ma from Guling on the evening of the 17th, entrusted to him for Zhou Enlai. He then drove to Liangyuan New Village at 10:30 AM on the 18th to visit Zhou, leaving at 11:40 AM. As for the content of Marshal Ma's telegram, reporters interviewed both the Marshal Ma's office and the Communist Party delegation, but both were tight-lipped. People on the Communist Party side only said that the overall situation is deteriorating and hoped that no illusions would be held. However, it is speculated that Marshal Ma's telegram to Zhou was related to resuming peace talks.

[Our Own Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] Ambassador Stuart was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 19th, but the trip was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. He has had more social engagements in the past two days. In each speech, he said that peace is not yet hopeless. Yesterday, he told students at Yenching University that "it is now even more necessary for me and Marshal Ma to continue our efforts" and put forward the hope that China would have a new revolutionary movement, led by Chairman Chiang, to restore the original revolutionary spirit, passively reform politics, and actively realize the livelihood principle of the Three Principles of the People. Ambassador Stuart is preparing to bring all necessary items to Nanjing on this trip, which can dispel the rumors that Stuart will soon leave the ambassadorial post. Tonight, Li Zongren will host a banquet for Ambassador Stuart and his secretary, Chuan Jingbo.

[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] It is said that holding the Lushan Talks is inevitable, but it will not be a formal meeting. The reason is that it is currently an extraordinary period, and the government must adopt public opinion from time to time for reference in order to gather wisdom and benefit.

[Our Own Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Central Committee Member Chen Guofu is scheduled to go down the mountain and return to Nanjing on the morning of the 19th. Also, Gu Zhenglun, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, is scheduled to go down the mountain at 9 AM on the morning of the 19th to Nanjing and then to Shanghai.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Guling, 18th] Zeng Qi and Liu Dongyan, leaders of the China Youth Party, visited Chairman Chiang at the headquarters at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 18th, the third meeting since arriving at Guling, and expressed their farewells. They left after half an hour. Zeng and his party will leave Guling for Nanjing on the morning of the 19th and issued the following parting remarks: I came here for a summer vacation. Although I visited Chairman Chiang three times, they were all friendly chats without formal consultations. The outside rumors are mostly speculations. (Please read page 2 for news about the internal disputes of the Youth Party.)

### Communist Troops Increase Troops and Intensify Siege; Situation in Datong Increasingly Critical; Six Divisions of the National Army Are Reinforcing from Southern Shanxi

[Our Own Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Military news: The situation in Datong is critical, but the Communist troops have not yet entered the urban area. Six divisions of the National Army are reinforcing northward from southern Shanxi. The Communist troops have redeployed their forces to attack the Zhengtai Railway, attempting to prevent the National Army from reinforcing and attempting to forcibly enter Datong City, but the morale of the defenders is strong and determined to defend to the death.

[Our Own Dispatch from Beiping, 18th] Ma Zhanshan continued to receive reports this morning that fierce fighting continued around Datong. The defenders are still at a disadvantage, and casualties on both sides are heavy. For ease of command, it has been transferred from the Second War Zone to the Twelfth War Zone for command. Therefore, it is rumored that Zuo Yi flew to Datong on the 16th for a six-hour inspection. The original plan was to airlift 4,000 reinforcements, but only more than 1,000 people have been transported. Yesterday, airplanes still transported a large amount of medical supplies, but the Yue Temple highland, the only barrier to the airport, is in fierce fighting.

[Reuters Dispatch from Nanjing, 18th] Beiping electric message: Communist troops intensified the encirclement of Datong, using artillery to bombard the city streets.

Editorial

### After Changing the Exchange Rate

The statement issued yesterday by Premier Song of the Executive Yuan covered a very wide range. To analyze it roughly, the main points are as follows:

(1) A decision to abolish export taxes;

(2) A decision to change the exchange rate;

(3) To fully restore trunk road and waterway lines to facilitate transportation;

(4) To reorganize port affairs to reduce loading and unloading costs;

(5) Enemy and puppet industries to be transferred to private management as much as possible;

(6) The equity of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Corporation to be transferred in a planned manner;

(7) To restore the Shanghai Stock Exchange as soon as possible;

(8) To separately allocate and sell enemy and puppet goods and equipment;

(9) To reorganize tax revenue to balance the budget.

(10) Concluding with the ultimate goal of stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods, in order to achieve a prosperous economy and a stable and happy life.

Premier Song's statement touched on all aspects of finance and economics. Since the opening of foreign exchange in March of this year and the establishment of import and export trade regulations, the government's announced financial and economic policies can be said to have been most important in this statement yesterday.

However, items (3) and (4) below to item (10) have either already begun or are still awaiting design and implementation. Their relationship to the present is not very close. The two items (1) and (2) are the most closely related and will have an immediate reaction and effect.

The abolition of export taxes was advocated by some in the late Qing Dynasty. In modern countries, except for monopolies or certain raw materials that still retain a portion of the export tax, the widespread collection of export taxes for financial reasons is extremely rare. The decision by the Supreme National Defense Council to abolish it entirely is indeed a noteworthy event in the financial history of our country. Especially today, when exports are extremely depressed and international lending cannot be balanced, it is also the most urgent and reasonable thing to do.

As for the change in the exchange rate, although the figure is still awaiting formal announcement by the Central Bank at 10:00 AM today, there is no doubt that the listed exchange rate will be raised. To what extent will it be raised? Although this question is of deep concern to the general public, it will be announced soon, and we do not need to speculate too much in a very short period of time. According to the government's consistent approach and the authorities' emphasis on stabilizing prices, it should not differ too much from the current black market price, right?

The biggest problem following the exchange rate change is, of course, prices. The government is most concerned about this; the general public is also most concerned about this. We believe that, apart from some speculators deliberately creating trouble, there is actually no reason to excessively stimulate prices due to the exchange rate change. The arguments are as follows:

(1) The black market exchange rate has been hovering around 2,500 or 2,600 for a long time, and even exceeded 700 last Saturday. Therefore, if the newly set exchange rate does not significantly exceed reality, then it will not have any stimulating effect on prices at all.

(2) Most of the imported goods that have arrived at the port were settled at prices that were relatively cheaper.

(3) The authorities are very serious about the issue of foreign exchange. We believe that there will be no more changes in a considerable period of time after this change.

(4) Currently, foreign goods are flooding the market, and the prices of several types of goods have already fallen to the equivalent of the cost of import.

(5) This year's autumn harvest is abundant, and the supply of goods is different from the period during the War of Resistance and the early period after the victory.

Even so, our people's enthusiasm for speculation and foreign goods has always been very strong. After the restoration, many emerging enterprises and many old businesses have also engaged in imports and hoarding due to the difficulty of production. These kinds of speculative and hoarding activities still need to be deeply noticed and prevented by both the public and private sectors. At the same time, actively promote frugality and advocate domestic goods. This is the fundamental salvation.

Developing production and prospering the social economy are not simple matters. It is inherently a luxury to solve all difficulties with a single, simple method. Therefore, in addition to raising the exchange rate, we believe that there are many things that still need to be addressed separately and implemented in tandem. For example, many unnecessary and undesirable foreign goods that are currently available may be further restricted or completely prohibited. We feel that imported goods should be handled in four major categories: (1) prohibited, (2) restricted, (3) freely imported, and (4) imports encouraged. Because even though the exchange rate has changed, domestic and foreign prices may not be balanced for a while. Looking at the prices in our country, they have risen four or five thousand times compared to before the war, while in the United States, they have only risen three or four times. (Based on the black market) The current exchange rate has risen approximately 600 times, which, multiplied by the price of goods in the United States, is only 1,800 times. We do not yet know how much the degree of this increase will be at this time, but we believe it will not increase by more than double, right? Therefore, in order to maintain domestic industries and save the industrial and commercial crisis, in addition to political measures, we still hope that all citizens will practice frugality and happily use domestic goods. Although this is an old saying, it is the fundamental solution.

### Evaluation of Marshall's Mediation

Marshal Marshall came to China from the United States more than seven months ago. As President Truman's special envoy, he mediated the political and military conflicts within China, hoping that his credibility, prestige, and detached, objective attitude could promote China's unification and fulfill its responsibilities as a member of the United Nations. Apart from a brief return to the United States in March, Marshal Marshall has been running around in China for at least six months, so-called "wearing disheveled hair and unkempt crown," with tireless effort and painstaking dedication. We, the Chinese people, can only express our heartfelt gratitude for his spirit of "not even warming the seat." Although the mediation work has not yet been fully accomplished, this is due to the obstinacy of a portion of China's warmongering elements, which will in no way damage Marshal Marshall's credibility and prestige, and even less so be regarded as an obstacle to Sino-American relations.

Although our evaluation of Marshal Marshall's mediation work in China is that "man proposes, God disposes," we have always believed that with his credibility, prestige, detachment, and objectivity, only with time and perseverance, "sincerity can move even metal and stone." We still have great expectations for Marshal Marshall's mediation.

However, the CCP is not the same! The CCP used to fear that negotiating with the government alone might be deceiving, so they sincerely hoped that the United States would mediate. We know that the reason why the CCP tried every means to appeal through the pens of American journalists for China to form a coalition government was originally to hope that the United States would favor the CCP and pressure the central government. Therefore, at first, they welcomed General Hurley, but then, because General Hurley was not used by them, they changed and attacked him. When Marshal Marshall was ordered to come to China, the CCP once again placed great hopes on him. Unexpectedly, after seven or eight months, although Marshal Marshall fairly persuaded, the CCP changed again and attacked Marshal Marshall, just like they attacked General Hurley in the past. In the past week or so, the strange theories of the Yan'an Liberation Daily and the Zhangjiakou CCP radio station have been endless. The CCP criticized the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, repeatedly insulting Marshal Marshall, saying that he was "deceiving" or calling him a "fool," and even insisted that Marshal Marshall was "mediating in name but aiding Chiang in reality," and made an absurd conclusion that "seven and a half months of mediation aided a larger civil war," as if China's civil war was not caused by the warmongering elements of the CCP who were intentionally planning to use force, but rather was made by Marshal Marshall who "came from afar." The CCP used to regard Marshal Marshall as a "god." Today, they even regard Marshal Marshall as a "liar" and a "fool!"

Marshal Marshall is still Marshal Marshall, the mediation is still the mediation, but the CCP's evaluation of Marshal Marshall's mediation is now worlds apart. Is it strange? It is not strange at all! The CCP has its own creed: "Everyone is a tool, everything is a process." Marshal Marshall himself, despite being a person of unparalleled credibility and prestige for a time, and Marshal Marshall's mediation, despite being a detached, objective work admired by all, in the eyes of the CCP, Marshal Marshall is still not its temporary "tool," and mediation is still not its momentary "process"?

To be honest, we have long seen through the CCP's tricks. The reason why the CCP will inevitably attack Marshal Marshall at this time is nothing more than hoping to bring the China issue to international arbitration! In other words, it is nothing more than praying for the Soviet Union to help the CCP betray the country! While Yan'an is shouting "pick up the guns" and "not hesitate to fight," it is also shouting "unconditional ceasefire," hoping to arouse international attention and come up with a common "punishment" of China, which would be "very happy." The CCP's approach naturally has its origins; it is just that our American friends are straightforward and naive enough that we used to say that the CCP may not be trustworthy, but they thought it was an overstatement. Now, the face of the CCP can probably be recognized clearly.

However, we would like to emphasize one more point: with all of Marshal Marshall's credibility and prestige in the United States, in China, and internationally, if he continues to patiently mediate China's political disputes, but unfortunately there is still no effect, then perhaps peace in China will at least temporarily be truly hopeless. Marshal Marshall is the epitome of Americans; we dare say that no one else can do what Marshal Marshall cannot do today. Even a peaceful elder like Marshal Marshall who has worked so hard to mediate can be insulted as a "liar" and a "fool," then who else cannot be scolded in the future? This is not only an insult to Marshal Marshall, but also tantamount to insulting all our American allies. Although this kind of rude defamation comes from the mouths of CCP members, they should still be considered "Chinese." Standing in the position of the Chinese people, we feel very ashamed to Marshal Marshall and to the United States. Therefore, we still earnestly hope that Marshal Marshall, with the cooperation of Ambassador Stuart, will continue to work hard to mediate, for China, for the United States, and even more for world peace, and forcibly implement the method of ending the conflict. Do not withdraw and return to the United States due to the CCP's anger, leaving the embers of the fire in Liaodong unextinguished! This is the cry of the Chinese people!

### The Double-Dealing Case of the Youth Party; Zhou Jidao Reported on the "Reform Movement" in Beijing; Reporters Raised Questions and He Had No Words to Answer

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Eighteenth Dispatch] The truth about the internal disputes of the Youth Party was announced this morning at 10:00 AM by the Central Committee of the Youth Party under the organization of Zhou Jidao at a press conference. It is said that the main meanings of the party affairs reform movement they advocated are approximately the following: (1) Because a few leaders of the party have gradually lost the party's basic spirit and are increasingly becoming dictatorial and monopolistic; (2) Focusing on matters rather than people; (3) Not for the issue of competing for National Assembly representative quotas, but believing that it should be elected in a democratic manner; (4) Zuo Shunsheng's remarks in Shanghai that a few people in the newly established Central Committee have been expelled from the party are actually a joke. It also claimed that they have the right to expel Zuo Shunsheng and others from the party. After Zhou finished his report, reporters raised questions one after another. Should the Youth Party be represented by Zeng Qi or Zhou Jidao, etc., externally? Zhou had no answer. He was also asked about the political views of the newly established Central Committee? Zhou also had no words to answer. He was asked about the number of party members, and he hesitated. This double-dealing case of the Youth Party ended hastily under the questioning of reporters. It is reported that Zeng Qi and others heard about the press conference here in Guling and telegraphed Zhou last night to stop it, but Zhou insisted on not listening, and ultimately staged this ridiculous scene.

### 勝利一年來 廣大地區仍遭封鎖 經濟混亂人民惶惑

[Reported by the United Press in Nanjing on the 17th] One year after Japan's surrender, China still bears many signs of a conquered nation – the people are bewildered, disappointed, and demoralized, and the economic situation is chaotic and unstable. Yet Japan, which China helped defeat through years of heroic resistance, has made considerable progress in recovery and stability, and has in fact embarked on the path of democracy. This is a tragic irony. Although Japan was defeated, it now enjoys the benefits of peace, while the diseased body of the Chinese giant continues to be ravaged by war and internal division. People cannot travel freely within a vast territory, and large areas remain tightly blockaded. Floods, famines, and fear threaten the entire country. Under these tragic circumstances, while various countries have demobilized, China still maintains a large standing army, with two-thirds of the national expenditure going to military expenses. Millions of gaunt-faced people are struggling with death, without any protection. In this dark picture, the only bright spot is that all sides are clamoring for democracy, equality, and prosperity, but so far there are only empty words, without any action. The people are growing tired of hearing it and have lost faith. To solve China's deep-seated problems, there must be a leader with a strong will. As for how to implement it, there are no secrets. According to experts, the main steps are as follows: (1) unconditional and permanent peace; (2) restoration of transportation; (3) stabilization of the currency; (4) reduction of taxes; (5) subsidies for domestic industries and protection of foreign investment; (6) strict control of rent and prices; and (7) reduction in the size of the military. China is today spending billions of national currency to maintain a large army and engage in civil war, while there seems to be insufficient funds to repair the roads in the capital. The housing shortage is also quite urgent, and there are no first-class hotels available. The only Western-style hotel in Nanjing is occupied by American officers and their civilian secretaries, and non-military personnel are not allowed to enter. Rent is not controlled. The annual rent for the new site of the Nanjing Foreign Correspondents' Club is 50 million national currency, equivalent to about US$20,000, which is indicative of the situation. Although prices are stable, they have not fallen. An ordinary meal costs about US$3 or more. A hard felt sun hat, which sells for only 25 cents in the United States, costs about US$4 here. A bottle of beer costs US$1, an orange costs 30 cents, and a newspaper costs 12 cents. These are not rare items, nor are they black market prices. There has never been any control. There are very few brand new or almost brand new cars in Nanjing. Most are jeeps, military vehicles, cargo trucks of unknown age, and rickshaws. High food prices have led many civil servants to resign. When will China's economy finally bottom out? This is the most popular speculation in Nanjing today.

### 各地通訊 縣級組織綱要 劃分兩期實施

[Local Dispatches: County-Level Organization Outline Implemented in Two Stages]

[Reported by this Newspaper in Zhenjiang] Because this province has fallen into enemy hands, local administrative and autonomous institutions have been devastated and destroyed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is actively reorganizing and restoring them after the recovery. However, due to the special situation in this province, the order in the counties south of the Yangtze River has generally been brought back on track, while most counties in northern Jiangsu are still occupied by the communist army, and the people are scattered and their homes are in ruins. It will take time to restore organizations at all levels. Therefore, based on the "Outline of County-Level Organizations" and the "Implementation Measures for County-Level Organizations," the Jiangsu Provincial County-Level Organization Outline Implementation Plan has been formulated, dividing the implementation into two stages based on the actual situation of the counties in this province that have been recovered and those that have not been recovered. This plan has now been submitted by the Department of Civil Affairs to the 50th Provincial Government Committee Meeting for resolution and implementation.

It is heard that the Corps will expand training starting from the 19th term, training demobilized officers transferred from various units and starting with 3,000 people. However, the address is insufficient, and construction is being expedited.

### 加爾各答動亂未已 尼赫魯真納同聲譴責暴徒 印臨時政府下週可望成立

[Calcutta Unrest Unsettled; Nehru and Jinnah Condemn Rioters; Indian Interim Government Expected to be Formed Next Week]

[Compiled News Report] According to a United Press report, Congress Party Chairman Nehru flew back to New Delhi from Bombay on the 17th and met with Viceroy Wavell to present proposals for the establishment of an interim government. However, both sides remained tight-lipped about the outcome. The Viceroy's Office only issued a very brief statement saying that the two sides had held preliminary talks on the formation of an interim government and would continue the talks soon. According to a Reuters New Delhi report, based on current developments, the new Indian interim government will be composed of six representatives from the Congress Party, five representatives from the non-Muslim League, one Sikh, one Indian Christian, and one Parsi. The list will be finalized tomorrow and submitted to the joint meeting of the Congress Working Committee and the Parliamentary Subcommittee for review. It is widely believed that the organization of the interim government may be completed by the beginning of next week.

The riots that occurred in central Calcutta on the 17th resulted in many deaths and injuries. Arson, looting, and stabbings were commonplace. In the evening, fierce fighting between Hindu and Muslim crowds was still ongoing. The roars and shouts, the sound of breaking glass, coupled with the sound of gunfire from British military suppression, were as dense as linked beads, weaving together a symphony of terror. Most residents were holed up indoors, afraid to go out. Important agencies such as the Telegraph Office and the Post Office were heavily guarded by military and police. Unscrupulous people took the opportunity to loot stores. Police opened fire, and the streets were stained with blood. Some corpses had not yet been claimed. Rescue workers were extremely busy all day long. Viceroy Wavell and the administrative head of Bengal frequently discussed the matter on the phone, which shows the seriousness of the situation. On the morning of the 18th, clashes broke out again, and police opened fire to suppress them in several places, making the situation even more serious. Although there are no official statistics on the deaths and injuries in the past three days, the Calcutta Morning Post estimates that there have been more than 600 deaths and more than 2,500 injuries.

Both Congress Party Chairman Nehru and Muslim League leader Jinnah have unanimously condemned the riots and unrest. According to a French News Agency New Delhi report, Nehru said that the future of our country cannot be decided by hooliganism. Jinnah also said that he strongly opposed such violence, which is a criminal act, and those responsible for the bloodshed should be punished by law. Muslims are quite uneasy about this incident, as its consequences are likely to damage the reputation of the Muslim League. Political leaders in Bengal Province also held meetings and broadcast appeals for calm in order to maintain order.

Hindu and Muslim leaders held a meeting on the 18th to discuss the issue of restoring peace in the city. Teams holding the flags of the Congress Party and the Muslim League marched through the streets, urging people to "maintain peace and fraternity" and chanting the slogan "Indian People United." Nehru and Jinnah also personally went to various districts to urge the public to remain calm, but the situation in Calcutta remains extremely deteriorated.

[Compiled News Report] According to a United Press Tehran report, although the Soviet Union has officially denied the deployment of troops on the Iranian border, diplomatic sources say that the Soviet Union has concentrated 15 to 25 divisions, or about 115,000 troops, on the border between Iran and the Soviet Union along the Araks River. These troops are special mountain troops, deployed 38 miles east of the Tuzilv border area, 80 miles north of Tabriz. Each division has an average of 5,000 troops, with fewer members in mechanized divisions. While Soviet troops are besieging the city, an independence movement is taking place within Iran.

Sheikh has also filed a similar complaint with the Iraqi government. Sheikh said that he can no longer tolerate the rule of the Iranian government and will strive for freedom and join Iraq. Arabistan Province originally belonged to Iraq and is located next to Kurdistan Province, where the oil fields are located.

[Indonesians Celebrate Independence Day; Sjahrir Delivers Speech; New Cabinet to be Established Next Week]

[Tass News Agency The Hague, 17th] According to Indonesian newspaper reports: People on the Indonesian islands celebrated the one-week anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Indonesia. Large-scale demonstrations and gatherings were held in major cities of Java, with slogans such as "Resolutely Defend the Republic" and "Strengthen Indonesian Unity."

[Reuters Batavia, 17th] Sjahrir declared: If Indonesians and Dutch continue to engage in combat behavior, causing resentment between each other, then negotiations to find a reasonable solution will be meaningless. Our dispute with the Netherlands seems to be intensifying. I deeply hope that the Netherlands will not change its intractable attitude. However, the recent remarks of Dutch officials seem to offer little hope. I think all parties concerned want to find a peaceful solution. This requires fairness and goodwill to make it a reality. If they continue to adhere to their prejudices, there will be no results. It should be understood that the Republic of Indonesia will not collapse on its own, nor will it be defeated by military action. Anyone who sincerely seeks a peaceful solution should not harbor the wish to defeat us.

[French News Agency Batavia, 17th] Indonesian Cabinet Prime Minister Sjahrir told the press: A new cabinet is expected to be established at the beginning of next week.

### 荷蘭將設委會處理東印事宜

[Netherlands to Establish Committee to Handle East Indies Affairs]

[French News Agency The Hague, 17th] Colonial Minister Jonkman said during the debate in the House of Representatives on the establishment of the Dutch East Indies Committee: The Dutch government is willing to reach a complete agreement with the Indonesian independence movement and is prepared to continue negotiations with Prime Minister Sjahrir's cabinet. The committee will decide which Indonesian political representatives to negotiate with in order to reach a solution that is beneficial to the Netherlands. The House of Representatives then passed a bill stipulating the dispatch of a committee to the Dutch East Indies, but the bill must still be submitted to the Senate for discussion.

### 美全國工業可能再度發生 工業專家如此預測

[Another National Industrial Strike May Occur in the U.S.; Industrial Experts Predict]

[Reuters New York, 17th] Industrial experts predict that another widespread labor strike will occur in the United States during the congressional elections this fall. The Congress of Industrial Organizations is prepared to challenge the authorities' price control policies in mid-October. The Chrysler Motors factory union has issued a warning that if the government does not control inflation within six weeks, workers will again demand wage increases. Two thousand American foreign telegraph workers began a strike at the beginning of this week, and 5,000 sailors in the Great Lakes region are also engaging in work slowdowns, with about 100 ships being blocked.

### Two Major Groups Form Opposition: Many Hidden Obstacles in the Path of the Peace Conference; Vandenberg Quite Dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's Attitude

[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] A New York Times reporter claims: The Paris Peace Conference concluded its third week of meetings on the 17th. In yesterday's meeting, invitations to Austria and Iran to attend and present their opinions were passed, first by a vote of sixteen to six, and then unanimously. According to a report from the Associated Press, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber has already departed for France today.

Date of Next General Assembly Undecided

The date for the next plenary session of the Peace Conference has not yet been determined, but Chairman Wang Shijie previously announced that Albania, Mexico, Cuba, and Egypt will attend and present their opinions on Tuesday. After the issue of Austria and Iran's attendance was resolved yesterday, the Soviet delegation did not suggest preventing France from having the right to vote on the drafting committee for the peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, or preventing the United States from having the right to vote on the drafting committee for the peace treaty with Finland. The Soviet delegation had previously raised these points in each of the drafting committees for the peace treaties.

The United States and the Soviet Union Accuse Each Other

According to a report from Reuters, since the Peace Conference began, it has become clear that the participating countries have formed two opposing groups. U.S. Senator Vandenberg, summoned by Secretary of State Byrnes, departed for Paris today. Before leaving, he expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union, stating, "The Soviet side has consistently obstructed the investigation of major issues concerning Austria and Germany from the beginning, and I do not know what their intentions are." He also resolutely opposed disclosing atomic bomb secrets or abandoning atomic bombs as weapons until there were sufficient security guarantees.

Meanwhile, Moscow Radio broadcast Davidov's "Current Affairs Commentary" last night, offering harsh criticism of the United States' latest 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and other ships soon visiting the eastern Mediterranean. The commentary claimed that the United States is moving toward world domination, and soon every country will be within the flight range of American planes, adding that what the United States values is not international cooperation but atomic bombs. Judging from the attitudes of all parties, the future of the Peace Conference is full of thorns.

France Calls for Persuasion to Cease Disputes

The French Radical Socialist Party's "L'Aurore" reported, "It is quite evident that the disagreement between U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is enough to endanger the Peace Conference. The United States opposes the Soviet Union's expansion of its power and attempt to control all of Europe for the same reason it previously opposed Nazi Germany's attempt to dominate Europe, not because of ideological differences. That is why French President Bidault requested the Peace Conference to cease disputes." Therefore, the Canadian representative's appeal to the five major powers to eliminate the state of division so that the conference can progress rapidly is indeed pertinent.

Disputes Arise Over the Issue of Adjournment

According to Agence France-Presse: There are widespread rumors in Paris that the Peace Conference will be adjourned so that the representatives of each country can go to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, but the Soviet delegation has openly opposed the adjournment of the Peace Conference and insists that if the Peace Conference cannot be concluded as scheduled, the United Nations General Assembly should be postponed. The position of the U.S. delegation is not yet clear, but it is said that they agree that the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland must be reviewed before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. As for the opinion of the British delegation, it believes that the Peace Conference and the United Nations General Assembly cannot be held at the same time, but while the representatives of each country are in New York, the committees of the Peace Conference can still be held as usual. However, this will inevitably cause some difficulties. If the heads of the delegations of each country do not attend the committees of the Peace Conference, it will be difficult to achieve concrete progress. The French delegation, summarizing the opinions of all parties, believes that the main task of the Peace Conference is to sign important treaties, and the United Nations General Assembly should be postponed accordingly.

Byrnes to be Visited by British Foreign Secretary This Week

South African Union Prime Minister General Smuts is expected to arrive here tomorrow to lead his country's delegation to the Peace Conference. In addition, U.S. Senators Vandenberg and Connally will arrive in Paris within days to strengthen the U.S. delegation. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will attend the Peace Conference starting next week. Next Monday, the committees will discuss the draft peace treaties, and given the different attitudes of all parties, fierce debates are bound to occur.

### Japan's Provisional Compensation Plan Under Consideration by the United States: Intended to Assist Economic Recovery in China and the Philippines; This Proposal May Be Submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for Discussion

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] According to well-informed sources here: The U.S. State Department and Army and Navy authorities are currently considering a provisional compensation plan authorizing General MacArthur to allow Japanese assets to be immediately shipped to countries damaged by the war, but not exceeding 20% of the estimated total value of each industry. This plan may be submitted to the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. The reason the United States put forward this plan is to utilize Japan's surplus materials as soon as possible to assist the economic recovery of China and the Philippines.

Japan Plans to Establish a Compensation Bureau

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese government is currently considering establishing a Compensation Bureau to handle the dismantling, packing, and transporting of approximately 10 million tons of industrial equipment, and to manage its records, as this equipment will be shipped out of Japan as in-kind compensation. This work is currently handled by the Central Liaison Office, but in practical implementation, special skills and experience are required, so a separate agency must be established, possibly directly under the Cabinet.

### Foreign Journalists in France: Paying Respects to the Battlefields

[Our Newspaper's Report] Paris, 18th Broadcast: Forty foreign journalists attending the Peace Conference, led by Dutch journalist Kaepel, went to Le Havre to pay respects to the battlefields. Local people said: 36% of the entire city was destroyed, 10,000 houses were completely bombed, and cleaning work is currently underway, costing 100 million francs.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes Britain and the United States in an Article: Claims that the World Can Never Be Absolutely Equal

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] "New Times Magazine" published a lengthy article accusing powerful imperialists in Britain and the United States of attempting to use United Nations agencies as tools for their expansionist policies, and stated that abolishing the principle of unanimous voting is equivalent to destroying the foundation of international cooperation. We must not deny that the support of great powers for peace is more important than that of small groups. For example, El Salvador can never be compared to Britain, and Luxembourg cannot emulate the United States. Therefore, in terms of the importance of supporting peace, the countries of the world can never be absolutely equal. The U.S. representatives in some international conferences have openly admitted that they have the support of twenty Latin American countries behind them. In this situation, how can one talk about the value of the "majority principle"? Therefore, the talk of equality is merely hypocritical.

### Nationalization of Labor Bill: Passed by the Philippine Congress; Chinese Overseas Merchants Affected

[Central News Agency, Manila, 17th Special Dispatch] The Philippine House of Representatives has passed the second reading of the Nationalization of Labor Bill. The bill was proposed by Congressman Teeson on July 17th. This bill has the greatest impact on Chinese overseas merchants here, as it stipulates that any privately-owned company or corporation in which the total salary of Filipino citizens employed accounts for 60% of the total monthly salary of all employees is not allowed to operate or engage in any buying or selling. Furthermore, the Philippine Senate has passed the second reading of the bill to nationalize public markets, which aims to completely drive out Chinese retailers in public markets.

### Ten Chinese Nurses Arrive in the United States for Training the Day Before Yesterday

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Ten Chinese nurses arrived here today, ready to join a fast-track nursing skills training program for a period of four months. UNRRA Director LaGuardia has drafted a plan to improve medical facilities in China and other countries, which will be implemented by the U.S. Army Nurse Corps.

### The Palestinian Problem is in a Stalemate: London Conference Expected to be Convened This Month; The United States Discussing with Various Countries How to Handle European Refugees

[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] The Palestinian problem is still in a stalemate. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, Bevin did not attend the plenary session of the Peace Conference on the 17th and stayed at his hotel all day, consulting with Colonial Secretary Hall, who had just arrived from London. Jewish leaders are waiting for the British government's response to their initial proposals. Sea Minister Alexander, who came here to discuss the Palestinian problem with Bevin, departed for Paris on the 18th, and it is expected that the situation will develop in two or three days.

The Palestinian conference, which is attracting attention from all parties, will be held within this month, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from London. A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the date will be determined after the seven countries of the Arab League and the Zionist Organization send their representatives. Some Arab countries have refused to attend the conference at the same time as Jewish representatives, so it has been decided that although Jews and Arabs will participate in the conference at the same time, they will be held separately in different locations. It is widely believed that this procedure will complicate the conference and take longer. However, the British government is prepared to extend the conference until a mutually satisfactory agreement is reached.

Illegal Jewish Immigrants Break Through British Blockade

According to a Reuters dispatch from Jerusalem, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants sneaking past the British blockade continues to increase. According to an Associated Press dispatch, 1,400 Jewish refugees in Haifa were originally scheduled to be escorted to Cyprus on two troopships on the evening of the 16th, but this was canceled due to opposition. The refugees refused to leave their original ships, and thousands of Jews gathered to demonstrate, protesting the deportation of the refugees. In fact, the refugee problem in Europe is a whole serious problem. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated on the 17th that the U.S. government has begun direct negotiations with other countries (presumably Britain) or through United Nations agencies to facilitate the resettlement of European refugees. It is estimated that there are currently as many as one million homeless refugees in Europe.

### Puyi's Testimony is Important: Attracts Worldwide Attention

[Remodeling Society, Tokyo, 18th] The trial of the Far East International Tribunal is becoming increasingly historically significant due to Puyi's testimony. Puyi's concealment on the 16th, the conspiracies and machinations of Honjo, Itagaki Seishiro, and others to organize the puppet Manchukuo and force him to become a puppet were completely exposed, vividly and deeply impressing people. Because he has broken free from the shackles of the puppet emperor, he can speak freely. The situation was reported, and Puyi's speech must be completed in one week. At the moment, people all over the world are very optimistic about this.

### The Issue of the Tatar Strait: Turkey's Reply Delayed; Turkey Hesitates; Britain and the United States Will Formally Clarify Their Attitudes

[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Ankara: The Turkish government's reply to the Soviet Union's request to revise the Montreux Convention will not be sent out for the time being. This is because the Turkish government first wants to consult the opinions of countries directly related to the revision, and the opinions of these countries have not yet been formally expressed. However, it is generally observed that Turkey will probably reject the Soviet demands, because the content of the Soviet note is equivalent to canceling the convention and supporting the regional agreement, thus violating the spirit of the original convention. Moreover, the convention was signed in 1936, and its validity period is 20 years, and it should not expire until 1956. There is no reason to invalidate it at this time. The Soviet proposal should at least gain the support of another signatory country.

Also, according to a Reuters dispatch from London: Like the United States, the British Foreign Office is busy drafting a formal declaration clarifying its attitude towards the revision of the Montreux Convention. It is expected that the British government's statement will soon be submitted to Moscow and Ankara. The British attitude is that the Soviet Union's request for revision, as stated in its note, does not conform to the revision conditions originally stipulated in the convention. Britain believes that the revision of the Montreux Convention should be negotiated by all the original signatory countries. In addition, due to changes in the environment, it seems that the United States should participate, and signatory countries that have become former enemy countries, such as Bulgaria, Romania, and Japan, should be rejected.

As for the U.S. attitude, it can be seen in U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson's remarks yesterday. Acheson said that the United States will reiterate Secretary of State Byrnes' position adopted on November 7, 1945, on this issue. On that day, Byrnes outlined the United States' policy on the Tatar Strait, the main points of which are four: (1) The Tatar Strait must be open to merchant shipping from all countries under all circumstances, so as to prevent Turkey from using the strait to block enemy merchant shipping in the event of war. The status of the Tatar Strait should be equal to the Suez and Panama Canals. (2) The United States requires that the Tatar Strait be open to warships belonging to countries along the Black Sea at any time. (3) Warships belonging to other countries should be prohibited from passing through the strait, except for the number of tons stipulated in peacetime, or when a Black Sea country is specially permitted, or when warships are under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. The current treaty stipulates that the number of tons for warships of all countries outside the Black Sea to pass through is limited to 40,000 tons, but Byrnes hinted that new figures could be considered. (4) The United States will propose to "refresh" some points of the Montreux Convention, just as the United Nations mechanism replaces the League of Nations, and will abandon Japan from the place of signing the treaty. Comparing Byrnes' statement with the Soviet Union's main demands, it can be known that the United States will support Turkey and oppose the Soviet Union's demands. This is because the Soviet Union requires the establishment of Turkish-Soviet joint defense bases, the new convention is limited to countries along the Black Sea, and the United Nations mechanism is not mentioned. If the Soviet Union insists on its demands, a new tense situation may occur between the United States and the Soviet Union. The cruise of the U.S. 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and several other British and American warships in the Mediterranean cannot but give people the impression of a show of power.

### Soviet Army Bans Gasoline Shipments: Austrian Transportation Paralyzed

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 18th Broadcast: Since the Soviet Union banned the shipment of oil from the Czechoslovakian Tafeld oil fields to the western British, American, and French occupied zones, all transportation in Austria will be paralyzed. If this situation is not alleviated immediately, the U.S. military's transportation and supply affairs will be greatly affected.

### Shigeru Yoshida Succeeds as President of the Liberal Party

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Special Dispatch] Shigeru Yoshida formally assumed office as President of the Liberal Party this afternoon. Six new members of parliament have also formally joined the Liberal Party. Therefore, the party's seats in parliament have increased to 146. Ichiro Hatoyama and other leaders of the party who were purged did not attend the meeting today.

### Hurricane Approaches Japan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] The Seventh Meteorological Station reported at 6:00 p.m. on the 18th: The hurricane is 100 miles south of Kyushu. The hurricane exceeds 75 miles per hour and extends more than 100 miles around. Kyushu and western Honshu are expected to be hit by storms tomorrow. Kyushu, Shikoku, and western Honshu are still on hurricane alert and are taking precautionary measures to avoid damage to U.S. military equipment.

### Nazi Germany's Secret Documents: Expose Plans to Invade Britain

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Among the documents collected by Nuremberg U.S. Prosecutor Jackson for the trial, there is an important secret document signed by Hitler on July 16, 1940, revealing that Hitler had planned to launch an attack on England from the broad front line from Ramsgate to the Isle of Wight in August 1940. The order briefly stated: "Although Britain is now in a state of military despair, it still has no intention of surrendering. I have now decided to prepare to land in England if necessary. The purpose of this operation is to destroy the domestic bases of Britain's war against Germany, and to completely occupy it if necessary. The landing will be carried out on a broad front line, from Ramsgate to the west of the Isle of Wight, in a blitzkrieg manner, with the air force replacing the artillery's task, and the navy replacing the engineer's task. Before a full-scale landing, it must be decided whether to occupy the Isle of Wight or Cornwall first, and then decide on future actions. The results of this discussion should be reported to me immediately. I now reserve this decision, and all preparations need to be completed by August." The Battle of Britain began on August 8, 1940, and reached its peak on September 15. At that time, the British Air Force shot down 185 German planes in one day, and the German headquarters had no choice but to postpone its attack, and finally gave up.

### Japan and Italy Conspire to Invade

Secret Document in Custody of the United Nations

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] Former Ambassador to Italy, Horiguchi, submitted a secret document to the Japanese government on December 3, 1941, stating that Mussolini had approved Japan's plans to invade the Far East on the same day and told Horiguchi that Italy would not only contain the British fleet in Europe, but also be willing to declare war on the United States if Japan decided to attack the United States. The document is currently in the custody of the United Nations.

### Soviet Rocket Plane Speed: Rumored to Reach 1,000 Kilometers per Hour

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] Pravda claims: The Soviet jet or rocket-propelled plane can maintain a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour (62,116 miles) for several hours. The Soviet people are extremely interested in the development of aviation, so the need for aircraft engineers and workers has greatly increased. (Note: The current world speed record is 606 miles per hour, which was created by the British Meteor jet-propelled aircraft last year. The aircraft is planning to make another official test flight to break the record soon.)

### A Two-Month-Old Fetus Survives Birth: As Big as a Kitten, Now Being Artificially Nurtured

[Reuters, New York, 17th] A baby conceived for only two months was born in New Rochelle, New York, on Thursday night. It is no bigger than a kitten, but it is still alive. Doctors say this is one of the smallest babies in modern medical history that has survived birth. It is estimated to weigh only one pound. Because it is too small, they dare not weigh it. It is now placed in an artificial incubator. Everything about the child is normal, and it is expected to grow up. Its mother is 23 years old.

### The Father of American National Water Conservancy Projects: Senior Senator Norris (Part 1)

Devoting His Life to Water Conservancy: Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

[Knoxville, July 25th Dispatch] The masterpiece that is the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) in this southeastern mountainous region is not only an achievement for the United States, but for the world. The creation of the atomic bomb relied on the high-voltage power supplied by the TVA. To this day, the atomic bomb factory in Oak Ridge (outside of Knoxville) is still connected to the TVA's power engines. Americans have a kind of innocent, constructive enthusiasm, and sometimes, a very superficial sense of humor. Near the Norris Dam, there's a large roadside sign that reads: "Visit the 18th-century TVA." Out of curiosity, I asked my guide, Mr. Goreby, to accompany me to see it. It was a large wooden water wheel built in a mountain gully, which is called a wooden wheel water windmill in the Jiangzhe area of China.

The stream flowed down from a height, turning the wooden wheel, which was connected to the interior by a shaft, and could be used to pound rice and hull it. The Belgian Supreme Court Justice, Mr. Percy, who was with me, looked at it and didn't understand. Goreby asked me, "Do you have this kind of thing in China?" I said, "There are still many in the countryside, but you can't see them in the big cities." We both nodded and smiled. In fact, water windmills still exist in the Midwestern United States, especially in the valleys inhabited by Native Americans. Civilization is inherently progressive, and without the primitive 18th-century water windmill, there might not be the TVA of today. At the same time, human civilization relies on human effort, and this effort is arduous, a crystallization of the human society’s pursuit of progress. Professor Li Man of the University of Chicago gave a very long speech in Chicago this June,

introducing the achievements of the TVA. He said: "From 1927 to 1932, an Eastern European country completed a major project that attracted worldwide attention. That was the great dam on the Dnieper River. The completion of this dam was overseen by an 'omnipotent' dictator, so the project progressed rapidly and its effects were particularly significant. This kind of high speed is impossible in a democratic country with differing opinions. In the United States, there was also a great thinker who advocated for water conservancy construction for forty years, and only saw it completed before his death. This great American thinker was George William Norris. Without Norris, America would not have the TVA, nor would it have been able to create the atomic bomb so smoothly.

Without Norris, President Roosevelt's New Deal would not have been so brilliant. Without Norris, 18th-century water windmills would still be scattered throughout the deep mountains and valleys of Tennessee. The year President Lincoln called for the Civil War to liberate black slaves, Norris was born in Sandusky, Ohio. His family was poor, and he lived a life of hard work in his childhood. He received his education in Ohio and studied law after growing up. In 1885, when he was 24 years old, he traveled alone to Nebraska, where he worked as a lawyer. At that time, the United States was experiencing rapid social and economic development after the Civil War, and due to the success of the westward movement, there was a need for talent in all areas. The young Norris's talent

was soon appreciated by the people of Nebraska, and he was elected as the judge of the 14th district. In 1902, Norris was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in Congress as a Republican. From that year on, he began his forty-year parliamentary career.

In the House of Representatives in Washington, Norris was known as an upright and outspoken person. Although he was a member of the Republican Party, he firmly opposed party dictatorship. He believed that the interests of the country should be above the interests of the party, and he emphasized that the responsibility of a member of parliament was to the country, not to the party. The current Director of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, former Mayor of New York, La Guardia, was a like-minded friend of Norris in Congress at that time. They jointly launched an "Anti-Party Boss Order Movement" to prevent a minority of the party from manipulating Congress. At the same time, Norris promoted a cooperative system in Congress,

advocating for agricultural loans to improve the lives of American farmers in the early 20th century. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, Norris was particularly interested in hydropower and water conservancy. He suggested that the state government of Nebraska lend money to farmers to develop the land in the west. The states in the western United States near the Rocky Mountains were originally very desolate. Norris advocated for the construction of the Pathfinder Dam on the North Platte River in Wyoming, to utilize hydropower on the one hand and develop farmland on the other. In the summer of 1912, Norris took a small trip. On the Columbia River, he saw the rushing water and the infinite potential power latent in nature, discarded on the ground without being utilized, and felt very sorry. He also saw that the farmhouses beside the river were still burning vegetable oil lamps, and felt even more嘆 about the contradictions of humanity. He wrote to his friend, saying: "I am 感嘆 God's grace, we have all failed to apply it. I must shout myself hoarse for these things, to make Americans realize the importance of water conservancy projects.

But I swear, if my plan succeeds, I must firmly oppose these benefits being monopolized by private individuals. This is God's universal gift to the American people, and it should be controlled by the government and universally beneficial to the people." Two years later, the plan for a hydroelectric power plant in the Hetch Hetchy Valley near San Francisco was passed by Congress. However, the plan to generate electricity from the Great Falls of the Potomac River in Washington was thwarted in Congress. Norris's position was very firm. He advocated that the nation's water conservancy should be state-run. He opposed the Potomac Electric Power Company's monopoly on the welfare of millions of citizens in Washington.

### The City's Restaurant and Catering Industry Holds a General Meeting, Demanding a Reduction in Banquet Taxes. A Resolution is Passed to Petition the Bureau of Finance to Reduce it to 10%. Representatives are Selected to Petition the Authorities Regularly.

The members of the city's restaurant and catering industry association are divided into 15 groups including Cantonese, Beijing-Hangzhou, Sichuan-Fujian, Anhui, Ningbo, Muslim, Vegetarian, Shanghai South, Shanghai West, Food, Local, Yangzhou, Rice and Vegetable, Jiangsu and other groups, totaling 576 businesses. The association has been faced with several changes by the city's financial authorities regarding the banquet tax rate. Initially, it was an additional 20%, then collective apportionment, and now it is set at 20% of 120%, and the industry association was notified to have its members purchase designated invoices and meal tickets from the Bureau of Finance. If each customer purchases a meal ticket in advance and is not full, and needs to add rice or vegetables, the restaurant must collect the meal ticket and charge banquet tax accordingly, which has caused widespread opposition. The association held an extraordinary general meeting of all members at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. In addition to the representatives from the Party, government and police agencies, more than 500 members from various groups attended. The directors of the association, Liu Songtao, Hong Xizhang, Yang Yuquan, Zhou Dunxiang, Zhao Kaihan, and others served as the presidium. First, Chairman Liu Songtao gave a speech, roughly saying: "Today's meeting is being held at the request of the representatives of each group to convene an extraordinary general meeting of members. The reason for the call is that the representatives of each group feel that the industry is facing increasingly severe difficulties, and the constraints of taxes are also increasing. If this continues, the industry will inevitably decline. This is urgent. Please share your great insights and unite to overcome the difficulties together." Then Hong Xizhang gave a report, followed by speeches from the representatives of the Social Bureau, Gan Simin, the City Party Department, Bao Boyi, and the City Chamber of Commerce, Yu Yulin. After the speeches, the discussion began. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Petition the City Bureau of Finance to reduce the banquet tax to 10%, (2) Banquet tax should not be levied on non-banquets, (3) Penalties should be based on evidence of tax evasion, (4) Request the Bureau of Finance to send staff to collect taxes on a long-term basis, (5) Waive the use of unified invoices to simplify procedures, (6) All members who sell braised food retail should be exempted from taxation, (7) Music halls should be required to pay the same tax, (8) Each group will nominate two representatives to join the presidium to petition the authorities regularly. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### All Passengers on the "Beihai" Ship Disembark, Temporarily Accommodated by the UNRRA. An "Interesting" Interlude: A Pregnant Woman Gives Birth to a New Passenger on Board.

More than one hundred passengers aboard the British Swire Shipping Company's "Beihai" ship were stranded.  Some ran out of funds and were unable to make a living after disembarking.  Representatives were sent to "UNRRA" twice on the morning of the 17th to petition for help, but without success.  After discussions between various parties, "UNRRA" sent seven trucks to the Swire Wharf yesterday to transport the stranded passengers to the UNRRA Yangshupu No. 2 Reception Center for temporary accommodation.  It is scheduled that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will send another ship on the 24th of this month to transport them north.  It is reported that the "Beihai" ship can set sail as soon as the Customs sends personnel to inspect and confirm that there are no more passengers on board.  The "Beihai" ship incident was also accompanied by an interesting interlude.  Passenger Li Shigui, along with his elderly mother, wife, and four children, boarded the ship in Shanghai to return to his hometown of Tianjin.  Since the ship was detained, Li had no spare funds, and his wife, Liu, was heavily pregnant.  With no relatives or friends, disembarking was inconvenient.  However, yesterday morning, before the "UNRRA" trucks arrived at the wharf, Liu gave birth on the ship.  The "Beihai" ship now had one more new passenger.  Since Liu had just given birth, it was inconvenient for her to travel by truck to the Yangshupu Reception Center, so she remained in the hold.  It is rumored that she may also receive relief from "UNRRA" and be sent to a hospital.

### Minister of Food Arrives in Shanghai

Xu Kan, Minister of Food, flew from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday and arrived at Longhua Airport in the evening. After disembarking, he went straight to his private residence on Rue Ratard to rest. According to reports, Mr. Xu's stay in Shanghai will be very short, and he will return to Nanjing within a few days.

### The Police Bureau Will Regularly Conduct a General Survey of Citizens' Occupations

In order to understand the details of citizens' occupations and to have statistics for reference, the municipal authorities have decided that the City Police Bureau will be responsible for carrying out the survey. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the bureau has ordered all sub-bureaus to inform their subordinates that they will conduct an occupational survey from the 21st to the 25th of this month. Each sub-bureau will be divided into groups to handle the survey, with each group consisting of two police officers and two voluntary police officers, who will work with the district and neighborhood chiefs to investigate the details. It is understood that the types of households for the occupational survey are divided into three categories: (1) ordinary households, i.e., ordinary residences, (2) business households, including commercial firms, factories, banks, cooperatives, and other business organizations that handle business, and (3) public households, including agencies, schools, and other public institutions.

### The China Merchants Electric Tram Company Plans to Continue Operating Trams in Nanshi

The Shanghai China Merchants Electric Tram Company's exclusive operating contract for trams in Nanshi with the municipal authorities was scheduled to expire in August 1943. However, the trams were suspended on August 13, 1937, and during the period of occupation, the vehicles and tracks were dismantled and removed by the enemy, resulting in considerable losses. Recently, the company has planned to sort out the located vehicles and the recovered steel rails and iron poles in order to resume operations. It is currently petitioning the relevant authorities to extend the exclusive operating period by 30 years, in addition to the six years of suspension due to the war of resistance. It is reported that the authorities have not yet made a definite statement.

### High Tide Yesterday Afternoon, Overflowing Ditches in Low-Lying Areas

There was a high tide in the city yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. Due to the backflow of the tide, there was some water accumulation in the low-lying areas and sewers, which did not hinder traffic. However, this month is the high tide season, so companies and businesses in the Bund area with underground facilities have paid attention to flood prevention measures. According to the predictions of the Dredging Bureau, there will be several more high tides this month.

### Suspected Embezzlement by Staff of the British Tramway Company: Falsified Deposits - Five Yuan Changed to One Hundred Yuan. Yao Wenzhong and Wang Songchen Arrested for Investigation.

The British Tramway Company, which operates tramcars and trolleybuses on various routes, has a daily revenue of approximately 60 million yuan. The company's comprador, Hu Ziyu, is responsible for the safekeeping of the revenue, and Yao Wenzhong, a local, is in charge of managing the loose change, bundling and sealing it securely. Wang Songchen from the Huishan Wharf station in Tilanqiao assists in packing and transporting it. All daily revenue of the company, a large amount of money, is routinely dispatched to the Shanghai Municipal Bank in the name of the British Tramway Company, and then transferred by the Municipal Bank to the Central Bank for deposit. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the company has directly sent a total of 420 million yuan in national currency to the Shanghai Municipal Bank since February of this year, all of which were 100-yuan banknotes. Each bundle contained 100,000 yuan, and each package contained ten bundles. Because the bundles were sealed and placed in large wooden boxes, the Municipal Bank authorities, in order to avoid trouble, trusted the company and did not send personnel to count the money, and forwarded it to the Central Bank for deposit. Each trusted the other without error. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, when the Central Bank deposited the money into the treasury, the hemp rope that was bundled around the money broke, revealing that there were 5-yuan banknotes inside. Subsequently, it was discovered that each bundle had the same situation. After statistics, it was found that there was a total shortage of more than 6 million yuan, so the bank refused to accept the money. The bank informed the Municipal Bank, which in turn informed the Tramway Company. The company's comprador, Hu Ziyu, believed that the difference was too large and reported it to the authorities for investigation. As a result, the aforementioned Yao Wenzhong and Wang Songchen were detained last night at 10:00 PM on suspicion of embezzlement and sent to the Huangpu Branch Bureau, which has jurisdiction over the case, for temporary detention and investigation. The bureau chief, Du Chun, has ordered Zhou Guanghui, the head of the judicial section, to send his staff member, Wang Shufan, to summon Hu Ziyu, the comprador of the British Tramway Company, to the bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday morning to inquire about the cause of the incident in detail, and is conducting a thorough investigation of Yao Wenzhong and Wang Songchen separately.

### The Number of Soviet and White Russian Residents in Shanghai: Accurate Statistics Still Lacking. Two Camps Clearly Differentiated Between "Red" and "White."

[Special Report from this Newspaper] At this time and in this place, the reporter wishes to report on the current situation of the Soviet and White Russian residents in this city.

What is the exact number of Soviet and White Russian residents living in this city? This remains a mystery, as no organization has been able to provide accurate statistics. According to one official source, the number is estimated to be between 15,000 and 50,000 (a very wide range of uncertainty). According to the Soviet community's own estimate, it is over 20,000.

In the past, Shanghai people called the wandering White Russians "Luo Song Ren" (a transliteration of "Russian"), and often added two unpleasant words after that, with a somewhat derogatory meaning. Now, most of the White Russians have acquired Soviet citizenship. The Soviet government has provided various conveniences to naturalize these White Russians. The consulate's regulations for White Russians to obtain citizenship are extremely simple. As long as they provide documents proving that they were previously Russian people, or if they do not have such documents, two Soviet citizens can guarantee that they are Russian people. However, despite this, many White Russians, due to decades of life under the Tsarist regime, have deeply ingrained ideas. They do not agree with the policies of the current government, nor do they want to acquire citizenship.

Therefore, Russian organizations in Shanghai are divided into two distinct camps: the "red" "Soviet Compatriot Association" and the "white" "Russian Emigrant General Association," with a ratio of approximately three to one. The chairman of the former is Zifirov, and the chairman of the latter is Bogolov. There has been sharp conflict between the "red" and "white," especially in the ownership of church property, leadership of religious beliefs, and management of public services, all of which have been openly manifested. From the trend, the White Russians are in decline. Recently, Bogolov announced that his organization does not contain political functions, and is only an organization that unites those Russians who are not accustomed to Soviet legal systems.

The Soviet government does not force naturalized Russian émigrés to return to their country. On the contrary, many people have automatically requested to return to their country because they are finding it difficult to live here, and are in the process of applying for passports. More than a month ago, 59 helpless White Russian children were sent back to Soviet public institutions for care.

The scope of occupations of Soviet and White Russian residents is very broad. Most of them are employed by companies and organizations as engineers, technicians, leather workers, drivers, etc. In addition, there are also many self-employed people such as doctors and nurses, and then there are merchants and small workers. The number of unemployed people is not large. The "Compatriot Association" provides food and clothing assistance to them.

Currently, Soviet community activities are mostly concentrated in the "Compatriot Association" at 801 Avenue Foch, due to the difficulty of finding housing. They also run a primary school there, and recently plan to open a middle school that can accommodate ten classes of students. As for the White Russian side, other than the fact that they can often be seen at the church on the corner of Rue Corneille and Route Lorton, their other activities are very limited.

### A Public Memorial Ceremony Was Held Yesterday at the Lake Society for the Late Senior Member of the Transportation Community, Wei Yifu

Wei Zuomin (Yifu), a senior member of the transportation community, taught for ten years and was involved in politics for thirty years. He encouraged young people and was self-motivated, day after day, for decades. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly at his residence in Nanjing on July 15, 1946, due to overwork. When the news of his death arrived, his students and former colleagues were deeply saddened, and a memorial service was held at the Lake Society yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to express their condolences. Wu Shaoshu, Wang Zhengting, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Yang Xiaotian, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Bozhuang, Zhang Fang, Zhao Zukang, Zhong E, Xu Sizeng, Mao Qingxiang, Gong Xuesui, Wu Yunfu, Zhang Jingli, Tao Yishan, and others served as the presidium, leading the memorial service. The Guard Command Band attended the ceremony to play music. After offering incense and flowers, Qian Gongnan reported on Mr. Wei's life and deeds and read the eulogy. Subsequently, Wang Zhengting, Xu Sizeng, Zhuang Zhongwen, Wang Zhuyi, and others spoke about Mr. Wei's virtue. Among them, it was particularly moving to recall that during the Battle of Changsha, he always remembered the safe evacuation of the national railway personnel who remained in Xujiapeng. Subsequently, public memorial ceremonies were held by various public organizations.

The ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM. (The photo shows a portrait of the late Mr. Wei)

### Dispute Between Chongqing General Labor Union and Labor Association: Gu Zhenggang Sends Personnel for Thorough Investigation; Zhu Xuefan and Others Request Concrete Resolution

Regarding the illegal seizure of the Chongqing Labor Association's facilities, representatives Tao Baichuan, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and their group, who went to Beijing to petition, have returned to Shanghai. Tao departed on the 17th, while Zhu and Zhou returned yesterday morning. Zhu announced the details of their Beijing petition, stating that the central government has taken the matter seriously. The Ministry of Social Affairs will dispatch Bao Huaguo, and the Organization Department will dispatch Peng Erkang, to Chongqing to handle the matter jointly. He expressed hope for a satisfactory resolution of their four demands, especially the immediate release of the arrested members of the Labor Association.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Chongqing General Labor Union's takeover of the Chongqing office and affiliated institutions of the China Labor Association has drawn considerable attention both domestically and internationally. To clarify the truth, this reporter inquired from relevant parties and learned that the China Labor Association is a cultural organization dedicated to studying labor issues and promoting labor welfare. It is not a labor union. It receives annual donations from the American labor sector ranging from US$500,000 to US$700,000, equivalent to tens of billions of Chinese currency. Local labor unions have repeatedly complained that its use of these funds is never made public and that it does not focus exclusively on labor welfare, deviating from the original intent of the donors. This issue was also raised during the National Political Council's general assembly last year, with council members criticizing the association for its opaque finances and activities exceeding its scope. At the recent Third Representative Assembly of the Chongqing General Labor Union, it was unanimously resolved that the Labor Association was using the substantial American donations for private extravagance and other activities, deceiving workers and hindering production. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the court, the General Labor Union also appealed to the municipal government for investigation and simultaneously took over the association's facilities. This is clearly a dispute between organizations. Since returning to Nanjing from Lushan, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs has sent personnel to conduct a fair and thorough investigation and handle the matter in accordance with the law. Regarding the reported arrests of Labor Association staff, it is said to be due to local security concerns, and the relevant authorities have been instructed to investigate and handle the matter promptly. Those who are not involved will be released.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Representatives of the China Labor Association headquarters, Zhu Xuefan, Tao Baichuan, and Zhou Xuexiang, met with Gu Zhenggang on the 17th to request a concrete solution to the Chongqing General Labor Union's takeover of the China Labor Association's Chongqing office and affiliated institutions. Minister Gu told reporters that this matter would be resolved concretely in accordance with the law.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] This reporter met with Tan Zesen, the person in charge of the Chongqing General Labor Union, who stated that the takeover of the labor welfare institutions was at the request of 300,000 workers in Chongqing and based on sufficient legal grounds. If Zhu Xuefan and others attempt to slander or injure the union, the Chongqing General Labor Union and its 300,000 workers will spare no effort to contend with them to the end and await legal resolution.

### Cheap Sugar Sales Cause Widespread Complaints

Regarding the distribution of subsidized sugar by the local dried goods stores, citizens have recently voiced many complaints, mainly because some stores intend to resell part of the sugar on the black market or refuse to sell it at all. According to a reporter from Hu Guang News Agency, most stores set the sales time for the subsidized sugar from 1 PM to 3 PM. In reality, sales often start after 1:30 PM and end around 2 PM, claiming that the "goods are sold out". Some stores delay the sales date, initially claiming the goods have not arrived, and only reluctantly sell a small amount on the afternoon of the final sales day. Many citizens queue up as early as 12 PM to purchase this cheaper sugar, with dozens or even hundreds waiting, but few succeed. The presence of "scalpers" further reduces the chances for ordinary citizens to purchase the sugar. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the authorities to find ways to improve the situation so that all citizens can equally enjoy this right.

### Soldier Kills Squad Leader, Flees with Weapon and Disappears

[Reported by this newspaper] At 2:30 AM yesterday, Li Huanzhang, the squad leader of a special service squad in a certain regiment stationed in Yu Family Temple, Pudong, led four soldiers, Ye Shaolin, Yang Jindou, Li Zeliang, and Li Jintong, on patrol. While passing the corner of Xinma Road's Yu Family Temple deserted pavilion, he was suddenly ambushed and killed by the four soldiers. The bullets entered from his back and exited through his chest. His body lay stiff in a pool of blood. The soldiers fled with their weapons and disappeared. After being discovered by passersby, the incident was reported to Regiment Commander Liu and Bureau Chief Jia of the Yangjing Branch, who immediately dispatched officers to the nearby villages to apprehend the murderers. As of late evening, no arrests had been made.

### Fruit Store Apprentice Killed in Delivery Accident

Zhang Ren, an apprentice at the Shun Kang Fruit Store located at 190 Zhongshan Southeast Road in the South City, was assigned to deliver goods by bicycle to Ningbo Road yesterday morning. Unfortunately, when he reached the intersection of Minguo Road and Yuanchang Lane, a ten-wheel truck, number 36823 of the Yilian Transportation Company, came speeding from behind. Unable to brake in time, the truck struck Zhang Ren, throwing him a considerable distance. He was seriously injured. Nearby officers urgently summoned an ambulance to take Zhang to Renji Hospital for treatment, but his injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The driver of the truck, Zhang Xing, has been detained by the Yupiao Police Station for questioning.

### Baoxing Road Fire Brigade Holds Reinstatement Ceremony

The Shanghai North District is a vast area. The fire-fighting facilities were completely destroyed during the war. Yesterday, it was learned that local industrial tycoon Lu Guanshou and others have launched an initiative to reorganize the former Zhabei Section 4 Fire Brigade into the Shanghai North District Baoxing Road Fire Brigade, which has a total of three fire engines and more than 30 firefighters. One of the fire engines was donated by Mr. Lu. Yesterday was the date of the brigade's reinstatement ceremony, which was held at the brigade's headquarters on West Baoxing Road. In addition to military and police officers who came to guide the ceremony, representatives from fire brigades in various districts also attended.

### Chinese Seamen Receive Widespread Sympathy at International Maritime Conference; Victory Achieved Against Racial Discrimination; Labor Representative Wang Yalen Returns in Triumph

[Special Report from this newspaper] At the recent International Maritime Conference, the Chinese delegation fought against the discrimination suffered by Chinese seamen abroad, and the result was a victory. Chinese labor representative Mr. Wang Yalen recently returned in triumph from the United States. This reporter obtained much valuable information from him.

The 800,000 Chinese seamen are brave and adventurous men who are not afraid of a life at sea. The majority of overseas Chinese are seamen who travel far across the ocean. — "Overseas Chinese and seamen cannot be separated."

During World War II, a considerable number of seamen abroad served in the war. In various parts of Southeast Asia, due to the Japanese invasion, these Chinese seamen directly participated in the Allied operations.

However, our seamen abroad are discriminated against everywhere. This is a form of racial discrimination. With the exception of the United States, which treats our seamen equally, our seamen in England and the Netherlands (whose shipping businesses originally belonged to the British system) are subjected to all kinds of unfair treatment. In maritime conventions, Chinese seamen are openly listed under the special treatment category of "Asians and Africans." However, they cleverly phrase it as "to respect the customs and habits of Asians and Africans." Under such unfair conventions, seamen serving on British and Dutch merchant ships receive a monthly salary of only seven pounds (equivalent to US$28). Furthermore, the living space for Chinese seamen on their ships is only two-thirds that of white seamen. Therefore, some Chinese seamen deserted when British and Dutch merchant ships passed through the United States. This was not desertion, but rather resistance against unreasonable discrimination.

In fact, Chinese seamen are no less capable than their European counterparts. Their shipping company owners once told Mr. Wang Yalen: "Chinese seamen are very smart and hardworking. The only shortcomings are that they are not very obedient and not very cooperative." Mr. Wang replied bluntly: "This is due to your discrimination."

I Represent Justice

At this maritime conference, the Chinese delegation strongly protested against these unequal treatments and the discriminatory wording against colored seamen in maritime conventions. As a result, they achieved a glorious victory. American journalists provided sympathetic support. Newspapers such as the Seattle Star prominently headlined: "Chinese Plan Fight Against Discrimination." The photos of our representatives attending the conference (especially the labor representatives) often appeared in American newspapers, with headlines that were extremely sympathetic to the Chinese seamen's opposition to racial discrimination.

In the conference, naturally there were people who were jealous of us, but this was precisely because our voices were very loud in the meeting.

The full name of the conference is the "International Labor Conference Maritime Session." In terms of organization, it is a remnant of the "deceased" League of Nations, but due to practical needs and the continued vitality of the maritime agency worldwide, it still exists. This was the 28th session. It is said that it will belong to the United Nations Organization (U.N.O) in the future.

This conference held a preparatory meeting in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, in November of last year. Our delegation's fight against racial discrimination had already begun at that time.

The official meeting began on June 10th in Seattle and lasted for three weeks, with many all-night sessions. The United States, as the host, was extremely hospitable, making all the hundreds of delegates very happy.

Decided on Seamen's Treatment

The Chinese delegation consisted of 14 people: Government representatives Bao Yiguo and Li Pingheng, labor representative Wang Yalen (Secretary of the Chinese Seamen's Union), capital representative Yue Zuofu, and the remaining ten were advisors or secretaries.

The conference was divided into many subcommittees. We participated in the wage subcommittee, the ship equipment subcommittee, the seamen's social insurance subcommittee, and the food subcommittee.

As a result, the international minimum standard for seamen's wages has been set at 16 pounds per month. The minimum living space for seamen is 22 square feet per person, not including dining areas. However, regarding wages, representatives from India and Malaya requested that they not be raised too high, because if they were raised, shipping companies would be unwilling to hire Indian and Malay seamen. It is said that their work ability is relatively poor, mainly because they are too lazy.

It is said that the atmosphere at the meeting was very tense, with the British and American sides facing off sharply. They competed fiercely for maritime control. The Chinese representatives, for the sake of the entire country's interests, were united externally, which is commendable. However, one thing made the Chinese representatives seem to be losing value every day at the meeting: the increasing spread of civil war in China. I think overseas Chinese in distant lands must feel the same way.

British and American Seamen's Clubs

In Britain and America, seamen are highly valued because they both value maritime hegemony. Many enthusiastic members of society donate money to build clubs for seamen to enjoy themselves. Because after a long period of seafaring, they should receive some comfort. Secretary Wang Yalen visited the American seamen's welfare services and seamen's education programs and gained many referenceable systems. In the American seamen's clubs, sometimes many women who support seamen's welfare accompany the seamen to dance and drink, but there are fixed times. At the end of the dance, these dance partners or wives leave the seamen first, and once they leave the club, they are no longer responsible for providing comfort and put on a stern face, not recognizing each other. This is very interesting and illustrates the importance that the United States attaches to seamen and its meticulous care for them.

There is a seamen's training school in New York, founded during the war, that trains seamen in stages. The facilities are very complete. In addition, there are official seamen's unions and labor-run unions. The former is the United Seamen's Service (U.S.S), and the latter is the Seamen's Service (S.S). Both institutions are constantly improving the welfare of seamen.

Overseas Chinese Express Dissatisfaction Through Remittances

As mentioned above, "seamen and overseas Chinese cannot be separated." Secretary Wang also conveyed some opinions of overseas Chinese in the United States to the reporter. Currently, overseas Chinese in the United States are in a golden age. The level of prosperity has never been seen before. However, the situation in the country makes them feel depressed at all times. They are not satisfied with the Communist Party's cruelty and recklessness, but they also hope that the government officials' corruption can be eradicated. Their love for their motherland comes from the bottom of their hearts, from sincerity. They are very concerned about the remittance issue because they are very dissatisfied with the Chinese official banks handling overseas remittances. Sometimes the letters arrive, but there is still no news of the remittance. Now many of their funds are transferred through Hong Kong, which is a very regrettable leakage! In fact, the overseas Chinese in the United States today are very wealthy, averaging $200 per person per month, but the government has not handled the procedures for remitting funds back to China properly.

Finally, I will report on the current situation of the Chinese Seamen's Union: Its headquarters are in Shanghai, and it is currently handling the seamen's repatriation work. Abroad, it has eleven branches. The New York branch was originally called only "Association" and was not a formal legal labor organization under American law. After the negotiations by the Chinese labor representatives this time, it has been renamed the New York Office of the Chinese Seamen "Union." In this way, the legal status is very different. Now, many overseas seamen are returning to China. Many of them are returning on the ships that our country recently purchased from the United States. More than 5,000 returning seamen have registered with the General Labor Union, and the Seamen's Union is finding ways to place them in jobs. The union has established a repatriation committee specifically to handle this matter.

People who love freedom love the sea and love the seafaring life. We wish the Chinese seamen who travel across the ocean a bright future!

### Maigen Road Freight Station: Average Daily Throughput Exceeds 4,000 Tons

[Special Report from this newspaper] The Maigen Road Freight Station is the transportation hub for both the Jinghu and Huhang Railways. The authorities of both lines acknowledge this. In fact, no other station on either line is busier than Maigen Road in terms of freight transport. The throughput of the Maigen Road Station is probably one of the highest in the country's railways. Recently, news came that the two railway administrations have drafted a plan to greatly improve the Maigen Road Station and make it a most perfect freight station. This reporter made a special trip to inquire with Mr. Hou Huohua, the Deputy Director and Transportation Director of the Railway Administration. Director Hou was not very clear about the matter. He only knew that six kilometers of track and three "platforms" would be added, at a cost of approximately 110 million yuan. The entire project depends on the bidding situation and may be completed in about three months or by the end of the year. As for other plans, Director Hou said, "They haven't been released yet."

In order to understand the situation of the Maigen Road Freight Station before the improvement, this reporter specially hired a car to go to the station. Because it had just rained that day, there was a large pool of water in front of the gate, making it difficult to walk through the mud. After finally passing through this "swamp," there was a storage yard, which was full of things, but it was surprisingly messy. Rusted and bent steel bars, broken wooden boxes that had been blackened by wind, sun, and rain were piled up everywhere. The traveling crane and some unknown machines were lying irregularly. Bricks and tiles were everywhere. If we were still in wartime, I would definitely think that this place had just been bombed.

The station master's office is located at one end of the only usable platform, number six. Inside, there are nine dilapidated desks. The walls, floor, and ceiling have long been dyed a dark gray by dust. A strange smell greeted me as I entered, and flies flew in swarms. It was dark inside, and the light was too poor. I met the owner here—Station Master Yang Wenbin. Station Master Yang accompanied me on a tour. He said, "The enemy's destruction over the past eight years has been too severe. Now everything feels insufficient. There used to be nine warehouses, but now there is only one. There are still twenty tracks for switching cars, but there is no platform to unload goods, so freight cars are parked randomly everywhere. As long as trucks can drive past, they (referring to the coolies) unload goods anywhere, which makes it particularly messy and irregular." More than a dozen barges were docked in the two rivers (excavated from the Suzhou Creek). The ships were loaded with bundles of relief goods from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), which were being transported ashore. According to Station Master Yang, "On average, more than 1,000 tons of relief materials from CNRRA are shipped out every day."

Since the return to peace, the quantity of freight has been increasing daily. Currently, the Maigen Road Freight Station ships out approximately 1,000 tons of passenger and freight goods daily and ships in approximately 2,000 tons of passenger and freight goods. Adding in the 1,000 tons of relief materials from CNRRA, the average daily throughput is over 4,000 tons. As a result, the warehouse situation is a big problem. Station Master Yang told me that warehouse number one is now occupied by the Jianghai Customs for storing enemy and puppet materials, warehouses number two and three were demolished by the Japanese army, warehouses number four and five are rented to CNRRA to store relief materials, warehouse number seven has also been destroyed, warehouse number eight is now divided into three parts, one part is used to store enemy and puppet materials, one part is rented to CNRRA, and one part is used by the station itself. Warehouse number nine is the largest and is now the material warehouse of the Logistics Department. The only warehouse that the station uses is warehouse number six, which is also a platform, but the lead sheet covering on top has rotted with holes, which can only block the sun. When it rains, it is the same as being outdoors. Station Master Yang also led me to visit a newly built automobile platform, which is only about the size of two double desks. Two sides are made of cement, with a loose layer of coal slag in the middle. When the reporter visited, a transport company happened to drive a three-and-a-half-ton empty Dodge truck, which was to be driven from this platform onto the train. Unexpectedly, when it drove to the middle of the platform, the two rear wheels sank into the coal slag and could not get out. The more the wheels turned, the deeper they sank. It took a long time to back out. Station Master Yang said with a wry smile, "I heard that the construction cost of this platform was more than 10 million yuan?"

There are a total of 136 service personnel at this station, including one station master, three deputy station masters, and one intern station master (a student from Jiaotong University). Under these harsh conditions, they work hard, seeking solutions when there is no solution, and maintaining this daily freight volume of more than 4,000 tons. This spirit is worthy of our commendation.

My visit ended around 6 PM. After shaking hands with the amiable Station Master Yang, I drove out of the messy storage yard and passed through the muddy pool of water. On the way back, I couldn't help but have fluctuating thoughts. I imagined what kind of freight station Shanghai, the largest city in China with the busiest freight transport, should have. But then I thought back to what I had just seen, and I couldn't help but feel lost.

### Navigation Bureau Orders Large Number of Ships from the United States; Opening of North and South Ocean Lines Can Be Realized Soon; Twenty New Ships Have Already Arrived in Shanghai

Yesterday, this reporter visited the person in charge of the local shipping industry to inquire about the current situation of the shipping industry in our country and the announcement of fixed shipping routes. According to him, the original tonnage of ships in our country before the war reached more than 500,000 tons, which were almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppet regimes during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, the government tried its best to order ships from abroad in order to restore the pre-war transportation capacity. At present, private shipping companies have more than 170,000 tons of ships. As of the 13th of this month, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) had a total of ten Liberty ships, sixteen Victory ships, ten N3 ships, five LST landing ships, ten LSM landing ships, six LCT ships, four YF large iron barges, eleven tankers, two escort ships, and one cement pontoon boat, totaling seventy-five ships. These were the ships of the enemy and puppet regimes that were returned to Shanghai after the victory and the surplus ships purchased from the United States. There are still nine passenger and freight river steamers and six tugs and small boats in Sichuan, totaling ninety ships, with a total tonnage of 235,810 tons. It is said that the company also has seven tankers and is selecting surplus ships, barges, pontoons, dredgers, etc. from the United States in the Luzon area, totaling more than one hundred ships. A portion is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next month. The combined tonnage should exceed the pre-war level. However, the reason why the shipping routes in various parts of the country have not yet been fixed and the transportation of passengers and goods cannot be smoothed is because of the busy transportation duties. Recently, private shipping companies have ordered sixty large and small ships from the United States, ranging from 500 tons to 5,000 tons, with a total tonnage of more than 100,000 tons. Twenty of them have already arrived in Shanghai, and the remaining forty are already on their way. Therefore, in a few months, the domestic shipping industry in our country can be greatly improved. As for the fixed domestic shipping routes, only the Hu-Ning, Hu-Wen, and Hu-Tiansheng Port lines are currently available. The reason why the main lines in the North and South Oceans have not been able to designate ships and set shipping dates is, as mentioned earlier, due to the limitations of transportation duties. However, in the future, the ships purchased by private companies from the United States will continue to arrive in Shanghai, and the difficulties in our country's shipping can be easily solved. According to this reporter's inquiry, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) is currently planning to open fixed routes in the North and South Oceans. The South Ocean routes are still waiting for our government to sign a trade and reciprocal treaty with the local governments, so it must wait for a while.

### Many Soldiers Ride Without Tickets; Railway Bureau Loses More Than 200 Million Yuan Monthly; Police Department Begins Investigation and Seeks to Curb the Practice

Today, soldiers riding trains without tickets has become a serious problem on the Beijing-Shanghai railway lines, with 700 to 800 people daily. Assuming 10,000 yuan per person, the railway bureau loses 7 to 8 million yuan daily, totaling over 200 million yuan monthly. Therefore, since the 11th, the police departments of both lines have been dispatching personnel to investigate. The number of soldiers riding without tickets in the past five days is as follows:

(Date) (Soldiers without Tickets) (Number of Tickets Purchased)

11th 701 217

12th 755 267

13th 549 278

14th 1070 407

15th 865 219

Total 3940

Total 1388

Observing the above figures, the extent of soldiers riding without tickets is evident.

### Soldiers Without Tickets Permitted on Slow Trains

A Datong News Agency reporter inquired with the police departments of both railway lines about this matter. According to Commissioner Zhou of the department, the department, considering its responsibilities and in order to reduce the bureau's intangible losses, has decided to strictly curb the practice of soldiers riding without tickets. From now on, regardless of military rank, those who do not comply with the railway bureau's regulations will be asked to take slow trains. If the number of people is too large, the railway bureau can attach carriages for soldiers to ride in, which will provide mutual convenience for both the railway bureau's administration and passenger travel.

### Analysis of Soldiers: Four Categories

Subsequently, the reporter learned the actual situation from other sources. Soldiers riding trains can now be analyzed into (1) active duty soldiers, (2) discharged soldiers, (3) soldiers' dependents, and (4) impostors posing as soldiers. Although a few will purchase tickets after being persuaded, the majority are active duty soldiers. Discharged soldiers, due to their living conditions, often cannot afford to buy tickets and often travel with three or four dependents. They ride not only special express trains but also gasoline trains such as the Shanghai-Hangzhou West Lake train and the Beijing-Shanghai Triumph train, which require assigned seating. This results in regular passengers often having tickets but no seats. This situation should be urgently improved to ensure order.

### Private School Fee Standards; Chairman of the Secondary and Primary School Joint Association Releases Statement

[This Newspaper] Since the Shanghai Private Secondary and Primary School Joint Association recently decided on the tuition and miscellaneous fee standards for this semester, the teachers and staff of various schools generally consider them appropriate, while students' parents have some concerns about their ability to afford them. A reporter visited Jiang Jizhou, the chairman of the association, who released the following statement: "The tuition and miscellaneous fee standards set by the association this time are 80,000 to 120,000 yuan for primary schools, 120,000 to 160,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 160,000 to 200,000 yuan for senior high schools. The following regulations are also in place: (1) Each school's free enrollment quota must not be less than 20% for primary schools and 15% for secondary schools. (2) These tuition and miscellaneous fees include all miscellaneous fees such as books and sports. (3) School office procurement expenses are based on 25% of total income in principle, and must not exceed 30% at most. If each school charges the minimum amount of the above standards (80,000 for primary schools, 110,000 for junior high schools, and 160,000 for senior high schools), and the free enrollment and distribution standards meet the above regulations, and the number of students per grade reaches 45 (according to the Education Bureau's statistics for the last semester, the average number of students per grade was 44.2 for primary schools and 42.1 for secondary schools), with 1.5 teachers and staff per grade for primary schools and 2 teachers and staff per grade for secondary schools, then the monthly salary of teachers would be approximately 240,000 yuan for primary schools, 290,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 350,000 yuan for senior high schools. Although this salary level is slightly higher than that of municipal schools, it is still lower than that of bank and company employees, as well as carpenters, painters, and printing workers. We believe that if we want to improve educational effectiveness and improve the quality of teachers, we must first increase teachers' salaries so that teachers not only have a stable life but also have the surplus to engage in further study and leisure. In reality, the number of students per grade in each school is often less than 45, the free enrollment quota exceeds 20% and 15%, and the repair and procurement costs are also quite large. If we want to maintain the above salary standards for teachers, we must slightly increase the above fees to compensate. Even if a few schools charge the highest amount, and the number of students per grade is still above 45, then the monthly salary of teachers would be around 350,000 yuan for primary schools and 400,000 yuan for secondary schools. For teachers who bear the responsibility of educating the next generation of citizens, this treatment is not excessive. At a time when the social economy is exhausted, there must be many students' parents who cannot afford these tuition and miscellaneous fees. We hope that each school will increase the number of free and reduced-fee enrollments so that no student is denied education due to high fees, which would benefit both teachers and students. Regarding the school's economic disclosure methods, the association already has a resolution from the last semester."

### National Xiamen University to Recruit Overseas Chinese Special Students; Quota Increased from 15 to 60; Application Deadline Extended to September 15

### Dangshan Exam Takers Cannot Return Home

Xuzhou Gentry Meet to Discuss Relief

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou] There are a large number of students from Dangshan who came to Xuzhou to take exams for Jiangsu College and various secondary schools. Because over 20,000 Communist troops besieged Dangshan on the night of the 10th, and the defending troops broke through on the morning of the 12th due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements, Dangshan was captured, and transportation was cut off. The students cannot return home, and the travel expenses they brought have been exhausted, making food and lodging a problem. Some exam takers are temporarily lodging in open freight cars at the North Station every day, a pitiful sight. On the 13th, the local gentry in Xuzhou convened a meeting at the Ninth District Commissioner's Office to discuss emergency relief measures. It was resolved to request the Xuzhou Office of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association to provide prompt relief.

### National Education Conference; In Order to Complete Ministry of Education's Work Plan; Possibly to be Held This Winter or Next Spring

[This Newspaper, Nanjing] The Ministry of Education's various departments are preparing new work plans for all levels of education in the 36th year of the Republic. The Ministry of Education's Vice Ministers have invited section chiefs and above to hold meetings at the ministry in recent days in order to revise and pass them, to serve as the basis for future implementation. This newspaper's reporter recently visited Zhu Jingnong, the Vice Minister of Education, who stated that the education work plans of the Higher Education, Secondary Education, and National Education departments have been discussed in detail. The Social Education work plan and the Mongolian and Tibetan Education plans are currently being discussed. Because these matters relate to the guiding principles for education in the coming year, the discussion is thorough. However, the plans still need to be sorted out by the responsible departments after the meeting and approved by the minister before they can be finalized. The content cannot be revealed at this time. The reporter asked Vice Minister Zhu: Recently, the Higher Education Conference has discussed many important cases. Regarding the reform of all colleges and universities, the previous meeting stated that it was decided by a few people and could not be finalized. It is necessary to gather opinions from all parties, and there is a trend towards convening a National Education Conference. Will the National Education Conference be held this year? Vice Minister Zhu said that it has not been considered yet. If it is necessary, and the restoration of each school is smooth and transportation is unimpeded, it may be convened at the end of this year, but it is too early to say for sure. A reporter asked a certain person in the education sector, who said: After the victory, the Ministry of Education has been working intensely to organize and promote education at all levels. The new education plan for the 36th year must also be finalized and implemented. The administrative organization of universities and the adjustment of departments, and the revision of the curriculum; the separation of secondary education, normal education, and vocational education, and the curriculum standards also need to be revised. Although the five-year plan for national education has been circulated twice for implementation, few provinces and cities have raised funds and implemented it as scheduled. The promotion of social education and the use of radio and television education are the most urgent needs. Physical education, which was delayed during the war, should be specially promoted after the war. Border education needs to be actively promoted after the war. All of these require gathering opinions from all parties to formulate a plan. It is speculated that the National Education Conference may be held this winter or next spring.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urges Various Trade Associations to Report Last Year's Profit and Loss Status in Order to Resolve the Profit Tax Issue; More Than Half of the Associations Have Reported

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request for exemption from the 34th year's first-class profit-making enterprise income tax and the emergency period excessive profit tax, but it was not approved. However, the government has also expressed concern about the difficulties of industry and commerce, so it has simplified the tax collection methods in order to resolve this backlog of cases. The industrial and commercial delegation to Beijing made another appeal, and the competent authorities indicated that they would strive to simplify the procedures, but hoped that industry and commerce would not delay any longer. In order to speed up the inconvenience of the tax collection process, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already been sending letters to various trade associations, starting to investigate the profit and loss status of various factories and firms at the end of last year, planning to compile statistics to see the actual affordability, and preparing to openly discuss with the competent authorities. Since the return of the delegation, the work cannot be delayed, and it has been urging various associations. More than half of the city's 200+ trade associations have already reported the survey forms. According to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, this is purely for the convenience of industry and commerce and to assist the government, and the time cannot be delayed any longer. It will stop collecting forms immediately. If the direct tax bureau sends personnel to conduct on-site audits for those who have not submitted the survey forms, they will have to listen to it. Well-informed sources said that the Direct Taxation Department has never let go of the collection of profit tax for the 34th year. The Municipal Direct Taxation Bureau has been deploying for a long time. After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce completes the investigation work, it will set off for a general survey, so that the trend of tax evasion can be stopped. It also said that the department has sent personnel to Shanghai to supervise the progress.

### World Gold and Silver Issues Price Continues to Rise Due to International Situation

[Reuters, Mumbai, 17th] The Indian government has reduced the import tax on gold and silver to encourage imports.

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Economist wrote that the reduction of the Indian gold and silver import tax will not actually allow more gold and silver to flow into India, because the problem in the past was not a tariff problem. Even after the current tariff is reduced, the silver price in Mumbai is about 80.5 pence per ounce, and the gold price is about 19 pounds per ounce. The price is still so high, so the wartime obstacles are not tariffs, but the export bans and import bans of other countries.

[Reuters, Mumbai, 17th] A major gold broker told Reuters today that the price of gold and silver is constantly rising due to the world situation. At present, countries that can use one-tenth of their gold and silver as their currency reserve are already rare. Currencies are inflating to astronomical figures, and it seems impossible to curb them. Therefore, even if the Indian government uses all means to curb the rise in gold prices, it is still difficult to have any effect.

[Reuters, New York, 17th] Although the estimated demand for silver in the industrial sector this year is as high as 125,000,000 ounces, the Treasury Department has only sold 3,400 ounces so far. The government has 100,000,000 ounces of silver that can be sold, but the result is still so small because the official price sold by the government is 91 cents per ounce, while the market price is 90 3/8 cents. As a result, the government only buys very little and sells nothing.

### Flour and Wheat Loan Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association Contributes Four Opinions

The Municipal Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association, in order to prevent adverse consequences from the wheat loan, yesterday specifically requested the Chamber of Commerce and Bureau to contribute the following four opinions: (1) Uniform loan, insufficient to eliminate the desire to compete for purchases, must organize institutions, uniform purchase, in order to avoid the disadvantages of divergence and competition, (2) Incorporate the purchasing power of wheat merchants into the unified purchase process, so that there is no place for livelihood, and avoid the disadvantages of competition for purchases, (3) Cancel the mortgage method, change to purchase, make reasonable allocation, so that the benefit is in the national treasury and benefits the small people, (4) Consultation should be detailed, the Flour Association is not enough to generalize the whole, this association has the deepest relationship with wheat, and should not be excluded from the research and discussion.

### Brick and Tile Source Sees Smooth

The source of bricks, tiles, and lime is smooth, and the market price is flat and soft. However, the Ma brand bucket head cement has many sales in the inland because the bucket cargo is not damaged during transportation. Also, the various brands of bag head cement are now trending strong due to the lack of arrivals.

### Costs Too High and Transportation Inconvenient Tea Sales Cannot Develop Tea Merchants Hope the Government Will Buy or Subsidize

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, at the tea seminar of the China Export Commodities Exhibition, several tea merchants told reporters that based on the current cost of domestic new tea, it is impossible to promote exports. The market price of tea abroad is about 30-40% lower than the cost price of domestic new tea. Taking Keemun black tea as an example, the current cost of new tea is about 460,000 yuan per dan for high-grade goods and about 350,000 yuan for medium-grade goods. However, the current market price of black tea in this city is about 130,000 yuan per dan for high-grade goods and about 70,000 yuan for low-grade goods. However, this black tea is mostly old goods from 1941 to 1944, which cannot be compared with new tea. Generally, tea farmers believe that the ratio between the price of tea and the price of grain after the war is very different. Therefore, most abandoned tea and planted grain, resulting in a sharp decline in tea production. It is estimated that the current production is less than 40% of the pre-war production. Taking the 7 billion yuan tea loan plan for the Southeast region this time, the output is only 30% of the plan. On the export side, the annual export volume of Chinese tea before the war was about 1 million boxes. However, the total export volume in the first seven months of this year is less than 50,000 boxes. It is said that the demand for tea in Northeast Mongolia is very strong. If transportation is not hindered, the output of this small area in the Southeast region is not enough to cope with domestic sales, so there is no need to rely on exports. However, at present, the cost of the newly made tea is too far from the estimated estimate, so the new tea made by various tea merchants using low-interest tea loans has been shelved. It is heard that tea merchants also requested the government to adopt a subsidy policy to allow Chinese tea to be exported, or to purchase it according to the production cost of new tea when the industrial and commercial delegation went to Beijing this time. The tea merchants also said that the government can currently allocate a part of the profits obtained from imported materials (such as raw cotton) to subsidize the export of tea in order to provide relief.

### Changes in Foreign Exchange After Victory Compiled by the Newspaper Archives

Foreign exchange rates have been newly revised. Our country struggled for eight years in a bitter war, and the people struggled on the line of survival for eight years. Everyone longed for victory and peace. Victory and peace have finally been achieved, but prices have risen even more sharply than during the war, and the suffering of the people has become even heavier. This change in foreign exchange rates will certainly affect prices, because foreign exchange and prices are inseparable.

Since the start of the Pacific War, with the fall of Hong Kong and Shanghai, our country's foreign exchange market also came to a complete standstill. The official rate of the Chongqing Central Bank was initially set at a ratio of one to twenty. Later, it was changed to one to twenty and one to five hundred. However, after the victory, all economic sectors were awaiting recovery, and import and export trade urgently needed to be restored. Naturally, new exchange rates had to be set. The issue of foreign exchange rates temporarily became the focus of discussion in the business community. Chairman Chiang also said at the first meeting of the Supreme Economic Council on November 26th of last year, "To achieve the goals of increasing the production of various industries, as well as other economic construction and development, the most urgent thing is to determine foreign exchange rates to stabilize finance." It can be seen that the government is also very concerned about this issue. However, the foreign exchange problem remained unresolved for a long time, causing many export factories to wait and see, and foreign trade to stagnate.

On February 25th of this year, the Supreme National Defense Council approved the opening of the foreign exchange market. It designated banks to buy and sell foreign exchange, abolished the exchange rate of twenty to one, and authorized the Central Bank to set new exchange rates and, based on the circumstances, supply or purchase foreign exchange, with US$500 million as legal tender reserves. This led everyone to guess the riddle of the new exchange rate. Finally, on March 4th, the Bank of China announced that the telegraphic transfer rate for US dollars was 2020 to one. At this time, the black market price was 2030 yuan, so the decision on the new exchange rate was close to the black market. However, this ratio is not as high as the multiple of prices. According to the price index, taking Chongqing as an example, it was 2373 times that of pre-war levels. The increase in the exchange rate, however, was less than 700 times. Although prices in the United States have also risen compared to pre-war levels, relatively speaking, the external value of the legal tender is higher than its internal value.

After the new exchange rate was announced, many people believed that the ratio was too low. Imports flowed in continuously, while export trade was unable to develop due to increased costs. This hindered the development of domestic industry and created the bad result of strangling the national economy. However, the exchange rate set by the government was not decided rashly; it must have been based on the established national policy. After the war, our country wanted to industrialize and encourage the import of means of production. Setting a low exchange rate could reduce the cost of establishing factories. If the exchange rate were set too high, the cost of importing many machines would increase, and large-scale factories would be unable to open. Although there are many small-scale factories in the country, raising the exchange rate to maintain these many small factories is a short-sighted view. However, after the exchange rate was decided, imports did increase, but they were not means of production such as machinery, but mostly consumer goods. At the same time, export goods stagnated. Domestic factories were unable to open, and prices continued to rise. The government thought very carefully when deciding on the exchange rate, but the result was the opposite, so it had to revise the exchange rate.

Opening the foreign exchange market was the government's first major action regarding economic issues after the war. However, this policy was neither completely laissez-faire, allowing it to develop freely, nor did it peg the fluctuating prices. This was the government's unavoidable method. It only hoped to prevent large fluctuations in the exchange rate through the use of equalization funds, controlling foreign exchange positions, and managing import and export trade through intervention. However, the government cannot completely control import and export trade, because US dollars are circulating in the market and can replace drafts. The number of US dollars in circulation before the war was not large, but after the victory, a large number of American military personnel came to China, bringing many US dollars. Although the amount of US dollars in circulation has increased significantly, many import traders have a large need for them. When the new exchange rate was announced, it was actually more expensive than US dollars, but many imported goods could not be purchased with foreign exchange, so they were paid for in US dollars. The demand for US dollars increased, and the price also rose, exceeding the exchange rate. Although the Central Bank's listed price has always maintained a ratio of 2020, US dollars have risen to over 2600 or 2700 yuan. The financial authorities absorbed US dollars to reduce the amount in circulation in the market, and also requested the US side to pay salaries in legal tender. As a result, the amount of US dollars in circulation in the market has decreased compared to before.

Business Investigation

### The Past and Present of Mint Production and Sales

[Reported by this newspaper] Our country's mint production is only a matter of the last ten years or so. Before the 15th year of the Republic of China [1926], the mint raw materials used in our country's industrial and medical sectors were entirely dependent on Japan. After the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], Taicang and Jiading and other places in our country began to cultivate mint. In the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936], the planting area gradually expanded to Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, Changshu, Hangzhou, Jiangxi, and the suburbs of Shanghai. It is estimated that the highest annual output in the country once reached more than 20,000 dan. Apart from a small portion of this product being sold domestically, nineteen parts of it were exported. The annual export value, in addition to our country's main export products such as tung oil, bristles, raw silk, and tea, etc., mint can rank fifth. From this, it can be seen that mint plays an important role in our country's export trade.

According to people in the mint industry, the period from the 26th to the 30th year of the Republic of China [1937-1941] was the golden age of our country's mint industry. It is said that only China and Japan produce mint in the world. During that stage, our country's labor costs were lower than Japan's, and the quality of our products also improved day by day. Therefore, for foreign sales, the annual export volume of menthol exceeded 2 million pounds at one time. At that time, the export price was about US$9 to US$10 per pound. The purchase price of mint crude oil at that time was about the price of one dan of rice per jin. Farmers were happy to plant and refine because of the generous profits, so production was amazingly high.

With the outbreak of the Pacific War, foreign ships stopped sailing to China, and the export of menthol came to a halt. As a result, market prices plummeted. The price ratio of one jin of mint crude oil to one dan of rice had long been destroyed. Farmers stopped planting one after another. During the four years of enemy and puppet occupation, the menthol suddenly lost its foreign sales market, so although farmers in various places stopped planting one after another, the domestic stock was still quite abundant, and the supply was not felt to be in short supply. Especially after the war, various small and medium-sized new factories, toothpaste and tooth powder factories, etc. were established one after another, so the business of this street became active again, and the annual sales volume has gradually increased to more than 30,000 pounds.

After the victory, with the hope of restoring exports, various oil companies launched purchases of crude oil from various producing areas. Farmers in various producing areas also started planting one after another, but the market price of mint crude oil has recently tended to go downstream. The market price per jin is only 10,000 yuan, which is less than the price of two dou of rice. Moreover, the fuel required for farmers to refine one jin of crude oil costs 6,000 yuan, and the labor cost is 3,000 yuan. However, the price that vendors or manufacturers can pay farmers is only 8,000 yuan per jin, so farmers end up losing money as a result of producing oil. Vendors are also unwilling to transport it because there is no profit to be made. Therefore, the mint industry, which was about to rise, was frustrated again and was dying.

Mint products include menthol and peppermint oil. According to people in the industry, each dan of mint crude oil can extract about 50 pounds of menthol and 50 pounds of peppermint oil. In the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937], menthol was about 15 yuan per pound, and peppermint oil was about 7 yuan per pound. Currently, the market price of menthol is about 16,000 yuan per pound, and peppermint oil is about 7,000 yuan per pound, which is only a thousand times higher than before the war. However, the general price and wage indices have exceeded 5,000 times. Therefore, various mint factories are also suffering from the threat of high prices, high wages, and high interest rates. Among the eight or nine factories currently in operation, all are barely surviving. It is said that the operating rate is far less than 20-30% of pre-war levels. The raw materials currently used by the factories are still the old inventory. The new raw materials are too expensive. In terms of the current market price of menthol and peppermint oil, it is really impossible to adopt them. In terms of exports, several manufacturers and export companies in this city have launched them one after another since the victory. It is reported that after the war, various countries, such as the United Kingdom, India, and the United States, have the most urgent need for menthol. However, as a result of the current high general prices in the country, the proportion of the increase in the domestic market price of menthol is only a thousand times, but the price reflected in the foreign market is still too high. After the victory, the price offered by American importers to order menthol from our country was only US$4.5 per pound. Now, although it has been gradually increased to $8, most manufacturers still feel unable to export it. India's offer is higher, about 19,000 yuan in legal tender per pound. However, each import shipment to India must obtain a British import permit, so the procedures are complicated and time-consuming. The United Kingdom's offer also reaches 18,000 yuan in legal tender per pound. It is estimated that the exported menthol that has been traded successively since the victory has reached more than 600 boxes (60 pounds per box). The average transaction price ranges from 16,000 yuan to 18,000 yuan per pound. Among them, shipments to the United Kingdom and India account for the majority, and Switzerland also accounts for a small part. Compared with the pre-war export volume, it is incomparable.

According to people in the industry, mint is simple in nature. Ordinary menthol with a melting point above 42 degrees Celsius, and peppermint oil with a concentration above 50 degrees and 60 degrees, basically meet the standards of export quality. Therefore, ordinary merchants can operate it. If the government can give it a helping hand at this time, the future of the mint industry will be promising. They pointed out that in the passive aspect, working capital loans can be appropriately released to various mint factories, so that the factories can promote the export of inventory in their hands as much as possible, and also purchase the crude oil inventory in the hands of farmers, and at the same time solve the pain of manufacturers and farmers. In the active aspect, efforts should be made to subsidize the export of menthol. It is estimated that based on the current production cost of crude oil, the menthol export subsidy price should be maintained at least at the price of 50,000 yuan per pound in order to stimulate farmers to reproduce. At the same time, it is hoped that the export tax on menthol will be exempted, and an import and export linkage system will be implemented. The import value will be allocated to the export of menthol in an appropriate ratio. Then, the future of our country's mint industry will be promising. (Canglong)

### Fresh Pork Sources Obstructed, Meat Prices Rise in This City

The bulk of fresh pork sources in this city has always been produced in Huaian and other places in northern Jiangsu. Since the goods from Huaian were cut off for some reason, Xinkou, which belongs to Jingjiang County in northern Jiangsu, is also a concentrated area for fresh pork exports. Recently, it has been obstructed by the Communist army's extortion and harassment, so the arrival of goods in Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce, and the selling price of pork has risen accordingly. Yesterday, Xin Xiaokang, chairman of the pig industry trade association, told reporters that the current price of meat in Shanghai is affected by the above, so the market price of live pigs has suddenly risen from more than 1,300 yuan per kilogram to 2,400 yuan in ten days. Retail sales in butcher shops require more than 3,000 yuan per jin, and the supply still cannot meet the demand. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. The crux of the problem is not only the obstruction of sources, but also the frequent inspections by the military and police along the way, which are a pain in the delay of time. Moreover, the transportation of live pigs is best done quickly. If the time is delayed on the way, and the pigs are suffocated in the cabin, there will be many deaths and heavy losses, so the merchants are afraid to move. At present, the fresh pigs arriving at the Wusong wharf rely only on a small number of pig boats from Zhanghuanggang and Renjiagang to supply the market. Efforts are now being made to reduce obstacles and smooth the sources.

### Taiwan Sugar Corporation Encourages Farmers to Plant Sugarcane, NT$500 Million Loan Established

According to the customs' pre-war import records, the highest annual amount reached about 600,000 tons. Taiwan Sugar Corporation plans to start planting sugarcane this month. After 18 months, Taiwan's total sugar production is expected to increase to 300,000 tons. After this plan is achieved, it will gradually expand. The company plans agricultural goods in advance to encourage sugarcane farmers to promote planting and increase production, and also prepare a confidential opinion, negotiated by Taiwan Bank to hold a loan of NT$500 million. According to reliable sources, this loan has been approved, and its target is for farmers to plant 60,000 jia of sugarcane (each jia is about 1 hectare, equal to 16 mu). The Taiwan Sugar Corporation's farm plans 30,000 jia, and the maximum loan amount per field is NT$9,000. The annual interest rate is only 8%, and the repayment method will be deducted according to the market price when the sugarcane matures next year. Regarding fertilizers, the Taiwan authorities are in talks with the United States to purchase 50,000 tons of ferrous sulfate (worth US$3 million) for shipment to China one after another.

### Handling of Property Rights of Northern Received Mines, Unified Regulations Have Been Established

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] It is learned that the handling of property rights of mines received in the north has many difficulties and disputes. Now, unified regulations have been established. If the mine owner did not cooperate with the enemy and puppets during the war, all property rights will be returned to the original owner after they are cleared. If the capital was increased by the enemy and puppets during the period of occupation, this increased capital will be regarded as the state's equity. The factory owner must convert it into cash according to the price index compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and offer to buy it. If the equipment added by the enemy and puppets is machinery and equipment, its price can be calculated according to the current price minus depreciation, and it must also be purchased by the original owner. If the number of machines and equipment added is too large and the original owner cannot purchase it, then when using the machine, a fixed amount of rent must be paid to the government on a regular basis. In principle, the competent authority can give preferential treatment to industrial mines that have contributed to the war of resistance and restoration.

### Asphalt Sees New Prices Again

Although the use of asphalt soap has come to an end, there are still transactions, but the number is not large. However, the candle market is in full swing, and the weather is still hot, so only high-quality goods can be used. Therefore, the price of Heben is still particularly high. The producing area has already sold it for 100,000 yuan, and the inventory is thin and new production is still far away, so people cannot help but be excited, and it seems that it is just beginning to flourish. However, in Jinlan and other places in eastern Zhejiang, although the number is not large, the price increase is not much. Moreover, the situation in Hankou is still the same. Because of the small number and low price, the market for exclusive use is preferred by the public. Judging from the markets in various places, the most vigorous is the Jiaxing area, where the price is increasing almost every day, which is also caused by the season. The Shanghai spot quotation has been set according to the market. Heben oil is 110,000 yuan, Neiping oil is 98,000 yuan, Duzhi oil is 96,000 yuan, Lian 油 oil is 92,000 yuan, Macheng oil is 90,000 yuan, and slightly less is 86,000 yuan.

### Textile Construction Company Prepares Finished Products, Plans to Exchange Goods in Southeast Asia, Only Awaiting Government Approval

The news that the export of cotton yarn has been lifted is recently very noisy. Regarding this matter, the Textile Construction Company first requested it from the government, and the Shanghai textile industry followed up to support it. The Tianjin textile industry also felt the same way. It is found that Southeast Asia has a great need for yarn and cloth. Lian Yingzhou, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of overseas Chinese in Siam have sent telegrams. If the Southeast Asian market is not seized in time, the Japanese textile industry, which has recently resumed exports, will take the opportunity to take the lead. It is reported that a Dutch merchant ship will sail this month. The Textile Construction Company has prepared a batch of finished products and plans to transport it to Java and other places to exchange for ramie fuel to meet the needs of the Textile Construction Company itself. This method is awaiting government approval. If permission is granted, it will be the prelude to the lifting of the ban on yarn and cloth exports.

### Reviewing Relief Measures for the Housing Shortage, The Current Approach Still Does Not Work, Three Suggestions from the Real Estate Industry

[Reported by this newspaper] The reporter recently asked a person in charge of the Real Estate Trade Association of this city about how to solve the current housing shortage. According to the report, there are three ways to solve the root causes of the current housing shortage: First, landlords repair damaged houses. Second, rent municipal land to build houses. Third, select appropriate open spaces in the city and order the original owners to build houses. Regarding the repair of damaged houses, many houses in Zhabei and Nanshi districts were destroyed by artillery fire and bombing. If the owners repair and rent them out, it can also increase the supply of houses. It is also heard that in order to encourage owners to repair, the rent for the houses supplied after the repair will not be subject to the restriction of the rent standard multiple. However, the restriction in Article 8 of the revised Lease Management Rules, which prohibits the collection of more than one month's rent in advance, will make Article 5 of the same rules a dead letter. Article 5 stipulates that if a bombed or collapsed house can be repaired, the landlord may be ordered to repair and rent it out. According to the report, if the owner invests several million yuan to repair damaged houses, and only collects tens of thousands of yuan in rent per month, then he will lose hundreds of thousands of yuan in interest per month, and even the most foolish will not do it, so there will never be any hope of repairing damaged houses. It is now heard that the Real Estate Association has submitted a request to the municipal government for this matter, requesting that the new rules be revised. Regarding the rental of municipal land to build houses, it is said that the lease term is ten years. After the lease term expires, the buildings on the land will belong to the municipal government. Therefore, in order to encourage owners to build houses, the convenience of collecting rent at one time should be given. Regarding the selection of appropriate open spaces in the city and ordering owners to build houses, the convenience of collecting rent at one time should be given. Regarding the selection of appropriate open spaces in the city and ordering owners to build houses, if the original owner is willing to accept it but lacks funds, the authorities plan to find a way to make it easier to obtain low-interest loans from the Central Bank. Otherwise, the Real Estate Association can also come forward to cooperate in building houses, and the original owner can use his property as shares, sell them after they are built, and recover the cost of building the houses. He said that if the municipal authorities can eliminate various practical obstacles and make the owners interested in investing, then by promoting the above three methods step by step, the housing shortage problem in this city will be easily solved.

According to the person in charge, the biggest problem in the future of the real estate industry in this city is still the lease problem. Generally speaking, the owner is now in a state of having property but no rights, and not being able to control his own business. He has no right to use or profit from his property. And the owner must also bear deed tax, land tax, rental income tax, business income tax, stamp tax, and house tax. Since rights and interests are not protected and the tax burden is heavy, every person in the industry with insight has been throwing out the real estate in his hands as much as possible. It is estimated that since the victory, the market price of real estate in this city has fallen by an average of 40%. In order to revitalize the real estate business, the industry association has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for three points: (1) Organize a land bank as soon as possible. Before the bank is established, please order the four banks to approve mortgage loans. (2) Any rules and regulations that do not fall within the scope of the Land Civil Code and hinder the construction and repair of houses should be abolished as much as possible. (3) The house tax should be borne by the residents.

### The Internationally Renowned Diplomat and Scholar, Wéi Huìqìng: Seventy Years of Experience, Only One Assertion - Studying to Save the Nation, Tranquility Conquers Worry

Photo by Our Newspaper Reporter

Whenever the sun sets and a cool breeze arrives, in Zhaofeng Park or on the quieter western section of Fuxu Road, we often see a tall, slender gentleman with silver hair, leisurely strolling. Sometimes, a naive and elegant young girl quietly accompanies him, happy and peaceful. This old gentleman is none other than Mr. Wéi Jùnrén, a respected elder in the Chinese diplomatic world, renowned internationally.

Shanghai has always been a place where talented people gather, but although Mr. Wéi is from Shanghai, he spent many years abroad. He represented the Republic of China in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and the Soviet Union, promoting international friendship and establishing many historical achievements. After the end of the First World War, he was an advisor to the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. In Geneva, he also exerted his full diplomatic skills at the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations did not take effective sanctions against Japan that year, the efforts of the Chinese delegation were not in vain. Based on the materials we can see now, we can already know that if then-US Secretary of State Stimson and Ambassador to Japan Grew had not still harbored illusions about the Japanese moderates (especially Grew's good friends Makino and Hirota), the League of Nations could have and would have been willing to take fairly severe steps. The few passionate accusations made by the Chinese delegation that year may have planted a seed for the Allies' assistance to us in World War II, and leading this accusation was Mr. Wéi.

In the fields of education and culture, Mr. Wéi's achievements are immortal. Before dedicating himself to the diplomatic world, he was already the "Director-General" (equivalent to the current president) of Tsinghua University. Afterwards, he also served as the chairman of the board of directors of Yenching University, Nankai University, Peking Union Medical College, and St. John's University. His students and protégés are truly spread all over the world! As for his writings, the magnificent English-Chinese Dictionary of the Zhonghua Book Company is also Mr. Wéi's masterpiece.

However, Mr. Wéi was "conferred a Jinshi degree and appointed a compiler in the Hanlin Academy" by the former Qing dynasty. The impression that such a title evokes in most people is usually something like "peacock feather and mandarin square badge," holding prayer beads, and wearing Beijing boots with white soles. How did he leap to become an internationally renowned politician and a most progressive mentor to Chinese youth?

I believe the main reason is that Mr. Wéi is a scholar.

Because even when he was extremely busy with government affairs, he often had a book in his hand, he not only grasped the spirit of the times accurately, but also had an accurate vision of what changes the world would undergo next. Books not only provide "history," but also provide "trends." A politician who can grasp the spirit of the times will not "grow old."

This year, Mr. Wéi is already sixty-nine years old, and he still reads at least one new book a week. I ask, how many of those so-called progressive youths in China who are content with shouting slogans and putting up posters are willing to put in such real effort?

Mr. Wéi once proposed the idea of "studying to save the nation," which is really derived from his decades of experience and is by no means intended to deliberately suppress the patriotism of young people. Before the incident, we were unwilling to put effort into studying Japan, so after today's victory, we feel that there are too few people who understand Japan – if we Chinese were to replace General MacArthur and his subordinates to manage Japan, what would the situation become? Now, how many people are putting effort into studying the Soviet Union? Rather than shouting a hundred slogans and putting up a hundred posters, it is better to read a book. Mr. Wéi's proposition ten years ago is still the most pertinent advice at this time when construction is beginning and materials are urgently needed.

Of course, Mr. Wéi's high character and integrity are also major factors in his success. When the Japanese invaders captured Hong Kong, although he disguised himself as a refugee and was in dire straits, he was still discovered by the Japanese army in Kowloon and immediately arrested. At that time, Lin Baisheng's "Zhonghua Daily" ominously indicated an ominous sign, saying: "These people have no way to go except to repent and participate in the peace movement." Behind this shameless threat was a full indication of the enemy and puppets' quite sinister intentions, but Mr. Wéi always conquered worry with tranquility, and faced the enemy with the spirit of "being unyielding to power," enduring four years of unbearable hardship!

Mr. Wéi was not the only "Hanlin Compiler" who was "conferred a Jinshi degree" by the former Qing Dynasty, but how many others had Mr. Wéi's vision and spirit?

Mr. Wéi will not "grow old"!

### From Department Store Apprentice to Minister of Economic Affairs: Wang Yunwu's Success Story

Mr. Wang Yunwu, who was invited to head the Ministry of Economic Affairs as a non-partisan, non-factional, and socially prominent figure, is a great contributor to the Commercial Press, the creator of the Four-Corner Code Indexing System, and the chief editor of the Wan You Wen Ku (Universal Library). The simplicity and convenience of the Four-Corner Code saves a lot of time in looking up characters, and the compilation and printing of the Wan You Wen Ku enabled the establishment of many small libraries in the impoverished small towns and villages of Chinese society with extremely limited financial resources. These two things alone have left an indelible value in the modern cultural history of China. He is the only self-taught businessman in our country who has succeeded. His success in self-study and the rapid recovery of the Commercial Press after the "January 28th Incident" are both called miracles.

He did not attend middle school or university, and only received three years of old-fashioned education in a private school in his hometown of Guangdong from the age of eleven to fourteen. His father was a small businessman with very low income and could not afford more education for him, so when he left the private school at the age of fourteen, he was sent to work as an apprentice in a small department store. The difficult life of an apprentice stimulated his desire for knowledge. He took advantage of his free time at night to attend a night school and began to learn English. In just a few months, his English became quite impressive. At the age of sixteen, he decided not to waste his precious time doing trivial apprentice work. So he obtained his father's permission, left the small department store, and entered an English school run by a church. This was the only school life he had in his life. But the good times did not last long. After only six months, he left the school for some reason, and his English foundation was laid in this busy, short, and unstable life. At the age of seventeen, he boldly accepted an appointment as an English teacher in a middle school. Since then, he has been constantly self-studying other subjects, and it can be said that he has explored all fields of learning and read all kinds of books. He joined correspondence schools, attended cram schools, natural sciences, social sciences, civil engineering, law, French, and German. He worked hard and had considerable attainments in all of them. Whenever he studied a subject, he must first formulate a plan and purpose, and pay attention to application. He once said: "Studying without a purpose yields little results. Studying with a purpose but without knowing how to apply it in the future still has limited effects. Only by first having a purpose, especially feeling the urgency of the need, will studying in this way often yield unexpected results." This is his honest confession and experiential talk. This is the only way to his success in the future. The position of general manager of the Commercial Press gave him a good opportunity to develop his ambitions. He used his knowledge to match his extraordinary perseverance and implemented "scientific management." The implementation of a new system will always encounter some difficulties. The implementation of scientific management in the Commercial Press also encountered unexpected opposition at the beginning, which almost caused a storm. This was no different from a de facto trial by fire for the newly appointed general manager, but he remained calm and instead withdrew the order. This kind of measure was absolutely inconsistent with his usual strong personality, causing people to think that Wang Yunwu had compromised, softened, and failed. But later facts told us: This was not his failure, but precisely his non-obstinacy and adaptability.

During the "January 28th Incident," the Commercial Press's Zhabei Baoshan Road headquarters was bombed by the Japanese army, almost putting it in a state of decline. Wang used his spirit of never giving up to rebuild the Commercial Press in a short period of time. This is a manifestation of his perseverance. He said at the time: "If the enemy knocks us down and we don't try to rise again, this is a coward. If we fall once and can't get up, it is enough to expose the weakness of the nation. It would be a shame for the nation if a cultural institution claimed to be so." He also often said: "Dealing with difficulties is the greatest gift, and solving difficulties is also the best reward."

After the recent meeting of the National Economic Planning Commission, Minister Wang once told reporters: "We cannot just have plans, but we must implement every word in the plan." Past facts tell us: He is a man who does what he says and does not issue empty checks. Once, he humbly said: "I am now learning new textbooks." Yes, he advocates "learning for application." Then, what he is learning today must be how to reform all the outmoded habits in politics and economics. The reporter here sincerely wishes him good health and looks forward to his greater success in the future!

### Cultural Pioneer: Hu Shi

Carrying the power of a loving mother, carrying the habit of diligence, carrying the tendency to doubt, he stepped onto the ladder of cultural pioneers step by step!

Dr. Hu Shi, the pioneer of the New Culture Movement, despite some people saying that he has too much of a desire for officialdom, has his own historical position and academic achievements.

Hu Shi's father died when he was three years old. If it were not for his mother's virtuous education, it would have been difficult for him to have today's brilliant achievements in his life.

His mother became a bride at the age of seventeen, and became a widow at the age of twenty-three. Since then, she has lived a very painful life for twenty-three years. She placed all her hopes on this only child. She fought for him to have the opportunity to study, she taught him how to be a person, she was his loving mother and strict father, and she was also his benefactor. At that time, Hu Shi was studying in a private school. Other families gave the teacher an annual salary of two silver dollars, but his mother gave six dollars in the first year, and then increased it every year, finally reaching twelve dollars. This increased tuition fee was definitely not a waste, on the contrary, it was a kind of far-sighted "investment." Because at that time, the teaching methods in private schools were all so-called "reading dead books and memorizing dead books," and the teacher never wanted to "explain the books" to the students, but his mother was willing to spend more tuition to ask the teacher to "explain the meaning of each word and the meaning of each sentence." In this way, the explanation word by word and sentence by sentence laid the foundation for Hu Shi's lifelong learning.

Born in Shanghai, he returned to his hometown at the age of five and lived under his mother's teachings for nine years, receiving her great and profound influence. Often at the age of fourteen, Hu Shi left Jixi, Anhui. "A lonely child, all the protective gear he had was a loving mother's love, a little bit of diligence, and a little bit of doubt," Hu Shi finally came to Shanghai.

During the six years in Shanghai, he studied in four schools - Meixi Academy, Chengzhong Academy, China Public School, and China New Public School. He was a good student, and he can also be said to be a "bad" student. He was at the top of his class everywhere, and he was also punished by the school. He caused school unrest, and he also ran a school himself. During this period, like many young people at that time, Liang Qichao's articles gave him great shock and emotion. Especially after he read Mr. Liang's "The General Trend of the Evolution of Chinese Academic Thought," he admired it on the one hand, and felt that there were shortcomings on the other. At that time, he had the ambition to help Liang Rengong supplement it, and this ambition planted the seed for his later masterpiece "A History of Chinese Philosophy." However, the credit for his greatest contribution to the New Culture Movement, the advocacy of vernacular writing, must be attributed to a training period at China Public School. At that time, several of his classmates organized a Jingye Society and ran a "Jingye Xunbao" (Jingye Ten-Day Report) that wrote articles purely in vernacular, and invited Fu Junjian, who was nicknamed Dun Gen, to be the editor. Hu Shi often wrote articles for the Ten-Day Report. Fu Junjian sent him a poem saying, "You and I are heroes in the world, and know each other in writing as friends and teachers," which made Hu Shi feel flattered and received a lot of encouragement. The "Jingye Xunbao" published dozens of issues, which not only gave Hu Shi an opportunity to express and sort out his thoughts, but also gave him more than a year of training in writing vernacular. From then on, vernacular became a new tool for him. This new tool, in his own words, "enabled me to be a road worker in the Chinese literary revolution."

It is rare to have perfect people in the world, and a successful person's life does not necessarily take the right path all the way. Hu Shi is a good example. Some of the students of China Public School, dissatisfied with the school's measures regarding the school badge, agreed to drop out and organize a new China Public School. Hu Shi was also one of those involved. However, the new China Public School lasted for a year and finally dissolved due to the inability to continue financially. Hu Shi's ideals were hit, and at this time, his family's finances also fell into difficulties. In addition to sorrow and depression, under the influence of a group of frivolous friends, he fell. Playing cards, drinking, calling prostitutes, and doing everything in darkness. Fortunately, a turning point came at that time. One night, he was eating and drinking in a "Tangzi" again. He got drunk, sat alone in a rickshaw in the rain, and went back. After going out and getting in the car, he lost consciousness. When he woke up the next day, he saw that he was sleeping in the iron cage of the police station. His old leather robe was completely wet, and there were scars on his face. After asking, he learned that he had injured a policeman on the road after being drunk last night and was caught in the middle of the night. On this day, after Hu Shi was released and returned home, he saw the scars on his face and the mud on his body in the mirror. He couldn't help but feel remorse and remembered the sentence "Heaven gave me talent, which must be used." He thought: Am I, Hu Shi, finished from now on?

Is Hu Shi finished? No, Hu Shi was saved. From then on, he abandoned alcohol and sex and prepared for the government-funded study abroad examination with all his heart. He finally got the economic support of some friends and relatives and went to the United States as a government-funded student in the fifty-fifth place at the age of twenty.

In the United States, it is said that he initially studied agriculture. Probably it was a momentary impulse, and he had no interest in it at all. Later, he studied the fruits produced in California. There were no less than hundreds of species alone. He had to remember the scientific names one by one. Hu Shi finally felt that this did not suit his personality, and he changed his course and studied literature and philosophy. He was talented, had a deep foundation, and was diligent and eager to learn. He finally obtained the honorary title of doctor. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, he returned to China and became a professor at Peking University. This period was the most glorious stage of his life. Like a newborn tiger, he attacked all old culture and morality, setting off a huge wave in Chinese society. He advocated vernacular writing, wrote vernacular poems, and what is most admirable is his fearless spirit of fighting against the old forces. This spirit, several decades later, is certainly no longer manifested in him, but what is most heartbreaking is that the current general youths who are in the so-called era of vigor and strength still lack this spirit of daring to act!

The world is constantly changing, and people's thoughts and actions are also constantly changing. As he got older, Hu Shi gradually became interested in politics. He wrote "Essays on Civil Rights" to scold the government, and therefore lost his position as the principal of China Public School. He also published the anti-Japanese remarks fifty years later and was scolded by others. If Hu Shi is indeed interested in politics, then he has succeeded in this aspect. You think; four years as the ambassador to the United States, isn't that a good example?

This time, Hu Shi has returned to China and has returned to Peking University. He said that he will devote himself to being a teacher and a historian in the future. We also expect him to do so. China is vast, and the people are ignorant. Where is the new generation of "Hu Shi"?

### Chief of Shanghai Branch of the National Relief Commission Liu Hongsheng: A Milestone of Success

Unmatched drive is concentrated within the entire being of Mr. Liu Hongsheng. If he says he'll do it, he does it. What others can do but are unwilling to do, he does. What others cannot do, he also does. Once he starts, he perseveres until completion. Mr. Liu relies on this extraordinary drive, having served as the Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for three years starting in 1931. Now, he shoulders the heavy responsibility of the Shanghai Branch of the "National Relief Commission."

This is truly a burdensome and arduous task. Without administrative funds, without warehouses to store relief supplies, and with concerns about mold, rot, and spoilage, he nevertheless took on the role. He is willing to take responsibility, values pragmatism, and emphasizes doing a little at a time. He demands efficiency and possesses a spirit of continuous improvement. He has experience in managing all kinds of enterprises. His own thriving businesses, both large and small, are milestones of his success.

"I am not holding an official position. I only know how to get things done. If I believe something is 'right,' I implement it immediately. If I believe something is 'wrong,' I oppose it immediately. Right is right, and wrong is wrong. I detest perfunctory actions, following old habits, and ambiguity." He spoke so frankly and directly while reporters and his sons-in-law sat around chatting. "I would rather lose my head or face a lawsuit; I will take responsibility."

Born in Ningbo, Mr. Liu Hongsheng possesses the spirit of enduring hardship and striving for self-improvement common among Ningbo people. His past fifty-nine years have been spent in constant "motion" and continuous progress through struggle. His tall, robust physique, his sharp mind closely aligned with the times, and his wide forehead etched with the wrinkles of vast experience, all reveal the marks of having weathered adversity.

Like every successful person, Mr. Liu's childhood was spent in less-than-luxurious circumstances. His father was an employee on a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ship. A simple family naturally could not afford a lavish university education. Therefore, after completing his freshman year, he left Yenching University and found a job himself.

It was with the Kailan Mining Administration, a British company, when its business had not yet smoothly developed. Mr. Liu initially worked as an ordinary translator at Kailan. He quickly gained the trust of his superiors. Later, the British company leveraged his sales talent and solid credit to establish a Kailan Sales Office with him. Thanks to his efforts, factories and ships of all sizes along the Yangtze River used Kailan coal, and the business established a foothold. With the profits from the coal business, he founded his first factory: the Hongsheng Match Company.

The "Hongsheng Company" incident is a deeply moving scene. At that time, Mr. Liu was only twenty-four or twenty-five years old. From Qingming Bridge in Wuxi to Zhangzhu and Xushe in Yixing, all the brick, tile, and lime kilns in this area had replaced firewood with his inexpensive Kailan coal. However, this caused hardship for the local mountain people who relied on firewood for a living. Anger grew in their hearts. One day, when Mr. Liu was staying in Pushe Town, friends from the distribution point secretly informed him that over a thousand mountain people were coming to surround him, intending to harm him. To avoid implicating his friends, he moved to a teahouse. Early the next morning, forty or fifty angry farmers arrived. They condemned him for taking away their livelihood. Relying on his generous and flexible tactics and quick-witted and persuasive eloquence, Mr. Liu convinced the agitated crowd.

That scene deeply moved him. He realized that a merchant who only knew how to seek personal gain was without the support of the masses and might even become an enemy of the public. "I am determined to take from them and return it to them," he said. "I chose Suzhou, a hub of transportation, and established a match factory to provide a livelihood for the old, the young, the disabled, and the weak. This was my motivation for founding the factory."

For fifty-nine years, this has consistently been his motivation for initiating businesses. New factories and companies spring up like bamboo shoots after the rain. He successively organized the Huadong Mining Company to compete with the British Kailan coal. He accidentally discovered Hongji coal dust in Vietnam and immediately invented machine-made coal briquettes (Dazhonghua Coal Briquette Factory). He founded the Zhanghua Woolen Company, China Merchants Wharf Company, Huashang Shanghai Cement Company, China Enterprise Bank, and so on.

Mr. Liu Hongsheng's businesses are all launched and managed based on outstanding and reliable credit. Financial capital has provided him with significant assistance. The global economic recession that began in 1930 was a major storm for Chinese industry and commerce, and Mr. Liu's businesses were no exception. However, with the support of his limited personal assets, although all the factories and companies were losing money, they stood firm. Because he exchanged credit for cash from the banking sector and then sold his personal assets to support his promise of always honoring his debts. The Belgian Consulate with its lush green trees on Route Pichon was one of the prices paid for supporting his credit more than a decade ago.

To prove his credit with numbers, starting in 1921, he was the first to apply modern accounting methods in various industries, hiring the British accounting firm Creasy, Son & Wickens to audit his accounts. At the same time, he was also the first to apply scientific management (he dared to try anything new).

In the late autumn of 1937, following the government's relocation inland, he went to Hong Kong. At that time, some of his businesses in Shanghai faced a second major crisis, but he was never discouraged or despairing. With a persistent and unyielding fighting spirit, he developed new businesses. In Hong Kong, he established the Great China Match Company with friends in the financial sector. Its products sold well in Southeast Asia and as far as Canada.

In 1939, the enemy's claws tightened their grip on Shanghai. Regardless of the risks, he ordered his fourth son, Nianzhi, in Shanghai to smuggle out the massive machinery of four factories. Via Hong Kong, Haiphong, Yangon, and the Burma Road, overcoming numerous dangers, they arrived in Chongqing. There, he founded the China Wool Textile Factory, Yong'an Battery Factory, and Jianhua Light Bulb Factory. He also jointly established the China Match Raw Material Factory with the Ministry of Finance to produce phosphorus, potassium chlorate, and other chemicals urgently needed for the war effort.

After experiencing the bombing of 1941, material shortages, and transportation difficulties, his businesses remained stable as always. According to people around Mr. Liu, the hardship of the material environment in the Great Rear Area at that time was difficult to imagine without personal experience. Mr. Liu himself even slept with an umbrella because the house was leaking!

Now, after having served as the Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Director-General of the Match Monopoly Bureau, the government has finally invited him to shoulder the heavy responsibility of post-war reconstruction. Recently, the reporter inquired in that high-ceilinged and cool reception room of this successful man, "What is the secret of your success?" While tearing open a new copy of *Factory* (a factory management magazine) that had just arrived from the United States, he said, "Up-to-date." He said to the reporter in a humble but serious tone, "I cannot yet be called successful, so I cannot speak of secrets. It is simply that I like to constantly learn. The big problem with today's scholars is that once they leave school or get a job, they immediately abandon their studies. The world is constantly progressing, and we should constantly strive for progress."

Improving Sanitation in the Yangjing District

Dear Editor: The Yangjing District of Pudong is vast, with a population of 170,708 (statistics from the Civil Affairs Office in May of this year). Since the restoration, the administration of security, education, finance, land, and sanitation in this district has become increasingly standardized. However, based on the current situation, the most urgent and important step in the area of governance is sanitation administration. I will briefly describe the reasons.

Along the Pudong waterfront in this district, factories and warehouses stand in rows, shantytowns are densely packed, bustling markets have blocked ditches, and sewage is overflowing. In the open fields, temporary graves are numerous, garbage is piled up everywhere, and mosquitoes and flies are swarming. Poisonous candies and unclean drinks are hawked along the streets. Conscious patients have no access to medical care, and ignorant families rely on shamans who enter homes. Most pregnant women still rely on traditional midwives for delivery. Citizens disregard sanitation and are generally reckless. The number of patients is increasing daily, and the mortality rate is rising. Therefore, the promotion of sanitation education, the rectification of environmental sanitation, the promotion of maternal and infant hygiene, and the establishment of medical institutions are various aspects of sanitation work that urgently need to be addressed.

Secondly, water is an essential necessity of life and a major vector for spreading infectious diseases. Residents in this district drink unsterilized river and well water. Therefore, every year during the summer and autumn, gastrointestinal diseases are rampant. Cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and malaria are environmental diseases common in this district. The water quality in this district relies on sanitation agencies to find ways to improve it.

Thirdly, countless residents of this district leave early and return late, working on the west bank of the Huangpu River. However, there is no quarantine work at the ports on both sides of the river. If an epidemic occurs in this district, it could spread to the west bank of the Huangpu River in an instant. Therefore, sanitation administration in the Yangjing District should be considered as important as that in the districts of the west bank of the Huangpu River. Only then can the districts of the west bank of the Huangpu River accumulate accomplishments. This cannot be ignored.

Based on the above three points, the citizens of this district should promote the rapid establishment of a sound sanitation administrative organization in the Yangjing District, hoping to improve sanitation within the district and enjoy the necessities of modern science. The governing authorities know that the city treasury is not wealthy and it is difficult to achieve this. However, they should consider the urgency of the situation, decisively overcome difficulties, make the greatest effort, and soon implement the planned program to have the Yangjing District Sanitation Office begin its work. What this writer is deeply worried about is the lack of a location in the area where thirty people can work. This is submitted for public review, hoping that local talents and predecessors can provide assistance to improve the public health of this district. (Pan Guangzhen)

Two Meetings with Chen Guangfu: Talking About the Biggest Turning Point in His Life and Career

Mr. Chen Guangfu's achievements in his own life and career are a living history of success. Mr. Chen received a complete education, is methodical in his approach, and possesses perseverance. His insights are accurate, and his vision is profound. Most importantly, he has been able to apply his correct view of life to his career. All of this has created an unshakable foundation for him in the financial world today.

In order to learn about his experiences in his lifelong pursuit of business, the reporter specifically made two visits during his busiest office hours. He took the time to meet with me. The reporter raised many broad questions that were difficult to answer in an instant, and he answered them one by one without hesitation. His impression is that he is the same as he was fifty years ago. He faithfully and sincerely handed the key to opening this fifty-year history of successful struggle to the reporter within a short ten minutes, so that it could be passed on to every young person who has embarked on or is about to embark on the path of struggle.

Mr. Chen has had too many careers in his life. Here, let's first talk about his most concrete crystallization – the Shanghai Bank, which stands at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road. Therefore, the reporter asked the first question: "Mr. Chen, what was the biggest turning point in your lifelong career?"

Mr. Chen said that in 1911, he was still working at the Jiangsu Bank. Seeing that the financial circle was entirely dominated by foreign forces, he suddenly thought that to develop China's national resources, it was necessary to consolidate China's financial strength. What was urgently needed was a financial institution that could serve the nation and society.

On June 2, 1915, at the current location of the Yongda Bank on Ningbo Road, a sign for the "Shanghai Bank" was suddenly hung up above a two-bay storefront. The capital was only 100,000 yuan, and it specifically promoted small savings deposits. At that time, many people thought this was a risky adventure, an experiment. However, Mr. Chen, who was confident, did not think so. He believed this was the initial realization of his plan.

As time went by, the Shanghai Bank moved forward systematically. It has gone through many economic ups and downs and numerous financial storms. The Shanghai Bank has not only stood firm but its reputation has also grown steadily. Today, the capital of the Shanghai Bank has expanded to 10 million yuan. The original location has expanded into a magnificent seven-story building occupying the entire street front. The total amount of deposits has broken the record of 27 to 28 billion yuan. It has had eighty to ninety branch offices across the country. Now, after the restoration, it has reached more than fifty branch offices. The number of employees has increased to more than 1,500. Today, the Shanghai Bank has clearly stood out and stands at the forefront of modern commercial banks in China.

However, Mr. Chen is not complacent with the achievements of the Shanghai Bank today. He earnestly said that the expansion of banking institutions and the repeated addition of personnel is not a success worth flaunting. Running a bank is a small matter, but the principles of being a person are a big matter. The most important thing in running a bank is credit, and the most important thing in being a person is benevolence and righteousness. The word "benevolence" has the meaning of two people becoming one. This clearly shows that any view cannot be judged subjectively. The main thing is to take into account the views of others. The financial business is a social undertaking. If society feels the need for the financial business, then this financial business can take root. Otherwise, there is no need to talk about finance at all.

When talking about the purpose of life, Mr. Chen believes that it should be to constantly move forward, constantly create, and constantly learn. He said that in the past fifteen years, he has been to the United States four times and Europe twice, receiving help from many friends and predecessors, reading many good books, and adding much new knowledge, which has made him feel that he should have an objective and detached view when dealing with any problem or thing. In particular, when studying financial problems, it is not enough to simply have a lot of contact with the financial sector.

He said that one of the great pleasures of his life is traveling. Precisely because learning has no end, he has the ambition to wander among every famous mountain and river in China and the world, "traveling thousands of miles and reading thousands of books." Cultivating oneself while doing things can reduce the control of the environment. He believes that this is the best way to arrange life. The development of China Travel Service's business today at least reflects Mr. Chen's general purpose in life.

The reporter also inadvertently asked Mr. Chen which contemporary great man he most admired. He unhesitatingly mentioned the late former US President Roosevelt. He said that he had met President Roosevelt four times and felt that President Roosevelt was a scholar-official who could write and do things. He believes that President Roosevelt's greatest success was his unique insights and outstanding talents, which made those who opposed him or agreed with his views willing to devote their loyalty and wisdom to a common cause.

Mr. Chen is now sixty-six years old and his ancestral home is Jiangdang, Zhenjiang. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, he followed the government to the rear. He successively served as an economic envoy for the government several times, negotiating loans in the United States. The most recent time was in October of the year before last, when he attended the International Trade Conference as the chief representative of our country. In addition, during the War of Resistance, his main duties included serving as the Chairman of the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the Chairman of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. Currently, in addition to serving as the Chairman of the Shanghai Bank, he also serves as a trustee of Jinling University, West China University, and China Vocational School, and as a standing director of the Central Bank, a standing director of the Bank of China, and a director of the Communications Bank, China & South Sea Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Yongli Chemical Company, Dasheng Third Factory, China Cement Company, and Baofeng Insurance Company, as well as a standing supervisor of the Central Trust Bureau.

Two Teachers Impart Knowledge Tirelessly in the Park: Wu Jianhong

Giving lectures in parks has been around for a long time. Mr. Zhao Jingzhai, a lecturer in Fuxing Park, and Mr. Lu Buru, a lecturer in Linsen Park, volunteer to lecture to the public on *Guwen Guanzhi* (Anthology of Classical Chinese Prose) and practical writing, without receiving any subsidies or rewards. They get up early every morning from six to seven o'clock to lecture while it doesn't interfere with their jobs, year after year. At first, I had doubts whether there really was this kind of volunteerism and how admirable it could be, especially during the severe cold and hot summer months, they do it every morning and never skip a day. Before, during the enemy-puppet period, they were interrogated, suspected of having a background or playing a role. After several investigations, they were found to be upright and honest, and the doubts were cleared up. Now, even though the weather is hot, those who are listening to the lectures are sweating profusely, and the lecturers' wipes are wet. If it rains, they may get sick. Now, the students who are listening to the lectures plan to ask the authorities to add pavilions. The authorities are promoting literacy campaigns and public education, and park lectures have been beneficial to the public in the past. I hope the authorities will follow public opinion and add park pavilions to meet public needs.

Lost and Found

Seeking Square Wallet: Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, after finishing my work at the United Press, I took a US military vehicle to Jiangwan Airport and discovered that I had lost a square wallet containing my United Press service pass, US military Jiangwan Airport pass, and identification (with photos). It is difficult to reissue this pass. May I borrow a corner of your newspaper to disclose this information? It is useless to others who might pick it up, but it is quite troublesome for me. I hope you will make it convenient for me, and I am deeply grateful! If the person who finds it returns it, I will offer a reward.

Seeking Autograph Book: I lost a red hardcover autograph book around 9:00 PM on the evening of the 4th at the tram stop at North Sichuan Road and Haining Road. The first page has the words "Yuan Yunfen." I was entrusted by a friend to return it to their classmate named Yuan. I accidentally lost it on the way. I hope that the finder will send it to Mr. Zhao Xiaofeng at 8 Sanyuanli, Qiujiang Branch Road, North Sichuan Road (3rd floor) for safekeeping. I will offer a small reward to express my gratitude. Or please send a letter to the above address, and I will personally visit your residence to thank you. Li Wei respectfully, August 6.

Fake Medicine Deceives the World; Fellow Patients Beware

Dear Editor: I suffered from onychomycosis in April and May of this year, infecting three fingers on my right hand. When I first discovered it, I immediately used "Powerful Goose Root" to rub it. After rubbing four bottles in a row, not only did I not see any effect, but it got worse. The nails became hollow and fell off. In this situation, the products of the "XX Pharmaceutical Factory" are purely deceiving the world, which is very painful. I would like to ask you to disclose this in a corner of the social services column of your newspaper to prevent readers from being victimized. Zhushangde, Qintong, Northern Jiangsu

Thank You, Mr. Mingzhi

The other day, while visiting Fuxing Park, I lost my notebook and business cards. There were many memorandums in the notebook. Now, Mr. Mingzhi found it and mailed it back, saving me a lot of trouble. I am deeply grateful. I apologize for not being able to visit because I do not know your address! I hope you will reply to the Hongqiao Sanatorium. Respectfully, Xue Zhi

### Exploring the Battle Situation at Yangzhen Pass - Interview with General Huang Baitao - Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan, Yangzhou Dispatch for This Newspaper, 5th

As the battle situation unfolded favorably, the morale here gradually rose. In particular, the displaced refugees had a sense of joy blossoming in their hearts, telling everyone they met that their hopes of returning home were now within reach.

To express its gratitude for the meritorious service of the 25th Division of the garrison in repelling the Communist army and thwarting its attempt to occupy Yangzhou, the "County Provisional Assembly" of Yangyi specially raised 120,000 National Currency on the 31st of last month to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers of the division, and sent a respectful telegram to General Huang Baitao, the division commander, to pay their respects.

Experienced in Battle, Resourceful and Courageous

To express our respect for General Huang and, at the same time, to explore for the displaced refugees how long it would take in terms of time for the Northern Jiangsu battle situation to have a greater and clearer development, both temporally and practically, yesterday (the 4th), around 3 PM, just as "the scorching sun was like a fiery furnace," the reporter, along with Mr. Hang Zhou, a special correspondent from this newspaper, went to the headquarters of the 25th Division, stationed in the south of the city, to visit General Huang, who had been firmly seated in the central command, directing operations day after day.

Beforehand, I only knew that General Huang was a famous general who had risen through the ranks, having graduated from military academy, and was known for his resourcefulness and courage; he was also an armed comrade valued by Chairman Chiang. Afterward, I came to understand that General Huang was also a military man with a wealth of general knowledge and was very talkative.

Rambling Conversation about National Affairs

The conversation began with national affairs, and it was General Huang who started it. It was very clear that General Huang was a military man, but he was very concerned about the country's politics, education, and even governance. Perhaps because of his concern, he was very worried! He said, "If the Communist Party continues to disregard the interests of the nation and the people, and insists on putting the interests of the party first, hindering all the government's plans to build and revitalize China, then in this state, even if the United States wants to help its friend China, I fear it will ultimately see China as a friend that cannot be helped. For ourselves, we would be a shameful friend!"

Next, he explained that China's education, economy, and other construction, in all aspects, lacked a foundation. For example, he said very clearly, "The educational level of the Chinese people is far too low compared to any strong nation! And education is the foundation of a nation."

Social Darkness, People's Suffering

In this way, he continued, "The entire society is full of darkness. Even relief efforts are rife with corruption. The day before yesterday, the Yangzhou office of the Refugee Relief Association was reported to be preparing to embezzle 200 bags of flour. I received the report and rushed over to investigate, and was shocked and disgusted. I am a 'supervisor' of the Relief Association, and I don't care about anything else; if this kind of thing happens again, I will definitely arrest them and deal with them!" Finally, he added, "Refugees are already suffering in the eighteenth layer of hell, and there are those who want to embezzle from these suffering people. You can see how dark society has become!"

Mr. Hang Zhou then asked, "Is the director of that office surnamed Xie?"

General Huang said, "I heard that this Mr. Xie is alright, but his subordinates are not!"

Mr. Hang Zhou added, "I also heard that there is this phenomenon: one refugee can get more than ten refugee certificates."

Reducing Food Intake for Relief, Refugees' Benefactor

"Yes! The truly poor sometimes don't receive relief, and the Baojia chiefs also engage in embezzlement..." General Huang immediately replied.

As they were talking, I recalled that in June, when the Yangzhou relief organizations were still in the investigation phase for the displaced refugees in Yangzhou, the entire 25th Division had reduced their food intake for several days, and later distributed rice at the county public sports field to provide emergency relief to the refugees. Later, when Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs came to Yangzhou to provide relief, many refugees in the refugee camps rushed forward and called General Huang their "benefactor." I also recalled the newspapers and many enthusiastic people in Shanghai who were worried about raising money for refugee relief every day. If news reporters should publicize the good and expose the bad, or have the right to scold bad people, then I believe that praising good people should also be an obligation. Moreover, if praising good people is the same as scolding bad people, then this piece of writing is not only intended to praise good people, but also to scold bad people.

The Ratio of Three Million People

Next, we talked about the phenomenon that the government is often criticized and attacked by some newspapers, while the Communist Party is understood by some.

I said, "This is because some people who have just returned from the rear do not understand the actual behavior of the Communist Party and its army."

General Huang said, "No, even in Shanghai and Nanjing, looking at those displaced refugees, they should know what the Communist Party is doing!"

From this, we talked about the problem of the three million displaced refugees in northern Jiangsu being a minority of the total population of ten million in northern Jiangsu.

General Huang said, "As far as I know, the Communist Party's recent method of dividing three and a half mu of land to each farmer in northern Jiangsu has not been welcomed. Therefore, in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu, there is a lot of land that no one is willing to cultivate. Because, according to their regulations, the cultivator only gets one or two tenths of the harvest of one season of grain."

Speaking to this point, I don't know how, the topic was turned by General Huang from the suffering of the people to the suffering of the soldiers. He said:

"Hey, you news reporters should go to the lower levels and see our soldiers. Have you been in contact with them? Their lives are really too hard... You should advocate for them!"

I said, "Regarding the suffering of soldiers, this newspaper had a section called 'Voices of Soldiers' in March of this year, which described the suffering of soldiers in great detail. I used to cut out this article and I remember it."

Moving Forward, Obeying Orders

In this way, it seemed to be after everyone had lit their cigarettes for the third time that the conversation finally touched on our "original intention." However, we were somewhat disappointed for the refugees because General Huang said:

"The Nanjing ×× Daily criticized us for giving up Ganquan Mountain after entering it last time, and retreating. According to them, we should move forward. We know this too; the sooner we recover many places, the sooner the refugees can return home. But, first, fighting a war is not like moving into a new house, is it? Second, moving forward is possible, but we must get orders from above."

So, recovering Shaobo Town and Gaoyou County, which everyone is paying attention to, and according to the geographical situation, although the responsibility lies with the 25th Division, if the government does not give it an order, then naturally it cannot be recovered.

It was almost 5 o'clock when the reporter and Mr. Hang Zhou said goodbye to General Ji. On the way back, I initially felt disappointed for the refugees, but then I thought of the issue of secrecy in military affairs. At the same time, because I was walking on the road, I also thought of a saying: "Fighting a war is not as easy as walking."

### Simply Adorned West Lake in Summer

— Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th, Reporter Huang Hangtian

"The lake is beautiful in all seasons, especially when the flowers are in full bloom."

Hangzhou, of course, does not have the coolness of Qingdao, nor the tranquility of Mount Lu, but compared to the annoying Shanghai, Hangzhou is, after all, paradise. Those who bear the burden of life, of course, do not have the fortune to go to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat, but as long as you take the time to go to Lingyin Temple once, and stroll or drink tea under the towering ancient trees, you have reason to compare yourself to someone who has climbed Mount Lu and is walking in the shade of the trees. (The lack of fog is a drawback.)

Yuquan Pool and West Lake Serve as Makeshift Seaside Bathing Beaches

If you are a favored child of summer, a swimming enthusiast, then the Yuquan swimming pool is a good place for you to go, you can compete with the colorful fish in the Yuquan pool of Qinglian Temple. Those friends who do not want to go far, will take the West Lake along Yingbai Road to serve as a seaside bathing beach. Along this area, the bottom of the lake near the shore is made of pebbles, and not the "soft mud made of incense ash" as one might have heard, which will drag your feet (or even your body) into the lake. Therefore, besides not being able to enjoy the olfactory sensation of the sea air, you also have reason to treat it as a seaside bathing beach. Every day after noon, regardless of the fire-like heat of the sun, there are hundreds of men jumping naked into the water, letting the soft lake water caress the soles of their feet, their chests, their cheeks, injecting the tenderness and coolness of the West Lake into every pore of their bodies, washing away the fatigue in their bodies.

A Small Boating Trip on the Lake in June Eliminates All the Summer Heat

If you are a quiet person, then boating on the lake is the best "key." "A small boat on West Lake in June, the person in the boat is an immortal in the water." "Paradise" and "immortals" are originally inseparable. Yang Wanli's words are not excessive. Su Shi had long said: "If you compare West Lake to Xi Shi, it is suitable with or without heavy makeup." The "simply adorned" West Lake in summer is still charming. When the setting sun sets and the afterglow shines on half the sky, the shadows of the mountains flicker, and the water ripples. Nature, with an invisible giant hand, secretly puts on the gauze of twilight, making the quiet lake and mountains suddenly gain a mysterious color. Hire a boatman, abandon the annoyance of the lakeside, go to the heart of the lake, let the late breeze gently caress your hair, fluttering your clothes, take a refreshing breath, and you will realize: "The heat of the human world is like cooking, but once you get on the lake boat, you will not know it." So you let the boat drift with the wind, passing through the White Causeway, boating among the lotus leaves of Inner West Lake, listening to the lotus leaves rustling against the bottom of the boat, as if there was an invisible rain falling. At this time, the bright moon should rise, and you are floating between the moon in the clouds and the moon in the water, picking a lotus fruit at random, gently peeling it open, and tasting its clear, fresh, and tender taste. The feeling of being an "immortal" arises spontaneously.

There are two different ways for the people of Hangzhou to go to the lake: the above is only "touring the lake," and there is also "playing on the lake." Of course, there are more people who "play" than people who "tour." From early evening when the lights come on until one or two o'clock in the morning, this is when most people play. Within these few hours, all six hundred boats on the lake can be dispatched, carrying twos and threes of men and women at a price of 1,500 yuan per hour, swaying with the waves near the Lakeside Park. At this time, you can see the lake view with dotted lights by the moonlight, and you can also see the prosperous modern material civilization along the Lakeside Road. The jazz music coming out of the loudspeakers in the night gardens and cafes, with the breeze, sends sentences of teasing, decadent sounds to the eardrums of the tourists, which seems to show more power of music than the dance halls of Shanghai. There are also boatmen selling songs on the lake. You only need to spend 500 yuan to hear them sing a song or opera that you like to hear. If you are thirsty, the boat has fruit and other things. They can do more than 100,000 yuan in business a night, which is much more fortunate than the vendors on the roadside.

Spending 3,000 Yuan to Be a Water Immortal at Midnight

Some people who are particularly afraid of heat like to spend the night on the lake. After two o'clock in the morning, you can invite three or five friends, spend 3,000 yuan, and you can be a "water immortal" at midnight. At this time, the boatman puts away the oars and paddles, and sits on the stern, letting the small boat drift lightly on the lake with the current. Although the security in the surrounding countryside is very problematic, you can sleep soundly on the lake. The poetic and picturesque scenery is enough to intoxicate you, needless to say.

In addition to touring the lake, drinking tea is also a way to escape the summer heat. There are two types of places to drink tea: one is the ordinary teahouse, which does not require attention to detail. The other is on the mountain, in the villas and night gardens along the lake, which is more "noble." Hangzhou, like Suzhou, is a paradise of water towns, and there are many teahouses on the streets. The people of Hangzhou are not as busy as the people of Shanghai. They take a nap at noon, get up, touch their faces, and drag their shoes to the teahouse. As long as there is a pot in hand, they can talk about everything from the sky to the earth, from flies to the universe. Criticisms of the government are also gathered here. I think this is a good place for the government to collect public opinion and for news reporters to interview local news. They can provide you with a lot of materials for you to dig up.

On the tree-lined road in front of Yunlin Temple, tea seats are set up along the mountain stream with its thin stream. Everything here is quiet, you can hear the babbling of the mountain stream, the cicadas on the trees singing leisurely, facing the cool mountain breeze, and drink a sip of fragrant Longjing tea. You can forget the humid heat and be completely immersed in the embrace of nature. The Jingu, Zhongmei, and China cafes are also full every day. In these places, there are songs and dances, and the eyes and mouth can eat "ice cream" at the same time.

A Wonderful Move by the City Provisional Assembly: Applying to Restore Dance Halls

Hangzhou does not have any dance halls now, and those who have a desire to "dance" have to use listening to songs to pass the time. The City Provisional Assembly has already applied to restore dance halls for those "lovesick men and women." Their restrictions are very simple: no dance hostesses. The Hangzhou newspapers have criticized this "flip-flopping" attitude of the Provisional Assembly, but the middle and upper classes of Hangzhou strongly agree with this proposal.

Although the heat wave is pressing Hangzhou tightly, those who have money to spend do not lack resorts to escape the summer heat. As for those who live with mosquitoes, bed bugs, and smelly sewers, bearing the heavy burden of life, even if "paradise" is close at hand, it is difficult for them to be "celestial beings."

### It's Not Easy to Live in Great Guangzhou

— Guangzhou Air Dispatch, 12th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Since its restoration, Guangzhou has made considerable progress in some areas, but for the average citizen, life is indeed getting harder day by day. There are many factors contributing to this situation, but the most important ones are the weak production, economic decline, and soaring prices since the victory. The salary income of general laborers and people at all levels cannot keep up with the pace of rising prices, like a rickshaw racing against a car. As a result, the lives of citizens are becoming increasingly difficult, and social order is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.

Appealing for the Distribution of Siamese Rice, The Problem Has Yet to Be Solved

At the beginning of the restoration, everything was difficult. Everyone seemed to have put the problem of "clothing" in a secondary position. Everyone was satisfied with just having clothes to cover their bodies, so although an ordinary suit costs 800,000 or 900,000 yuan, ordinary citizens can ignore it and it does not threaten them. However, the problem of "food" is too serious! Here, some people may doubtfully ask: Hasn't the grain shortage in Guangdong Province passed? Isn't the grain price in Guangzhou very stable? Aren't batches of relief rice being shipped in one after another? Yes, these are all facts, but the problem does not lie here, but in the fact that most people simply cannot find food to eat. In the past, an official in charge of grain policy here said the most wonderfully: "It is not that the grain price is too high, but that ordinary citizens are too poor!" This statement may seem a bit ridiculous on the surface, but thinking about it, it also makes sense; because no matter how low the rice price is, if ordinary citizens cannot solve their employment problems, what good is a low rice price? Therefore, the severity of this problem is due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and all industries and businesses are facing a precarious situation due to the impact of imported goods. The unemployed account for two-thirds of the city. In this situation, the difficulty of finding food can be imagined! Recently, there is another measure taken by the authorities that has caused the greatest blow to ordinary poor citizens, that is, the municipal authorities, in order to tidy up the city's appearance, have uniformly prohibited vendors from setting up stalls on the streets. In the authorities' minds, of course, this measure is taken for various problems such as traffic order, but they only have negative sanctions and no positive relief measures. They do not have a public market or anything like that, and they resolutely prohibit them from setting up stalls, which has driven this vast group of vendors to the brink of a life panic; as a result, the number of unemployed poor citizens waiting for relief is increasing day by day!

As for relief rice? According to the report of Li Huahui, the deputy head of the Siamese rice supervision group, at the Guangdong Post-War Relief Review Committee meeting on August 7, the first batch of more than 40,000 bags of Siamese rice to the fifth batch of more than 40,000 bags have all arrived in the provincial capital one after another. This is indeed good news; at the same time, according to the report of Ma Kaiyan, the director of the Storage and Transportation Department: From July 28 to August 3, there were 3,468 bags of rice in the warehouse, equivalent to more than 140 tons, 22,700 tons were received, 20,500 tons were issued, and the warehouse loss was more than 130 tons... According to the latter report, the warehouse loss has reached more than 100 tons, which is enough to shock people, and in the current state of famine, the more than 3,000 bags of Siamese rice stored in the warehouse are not being distributed in time, which is really perplexing! Therefore, the unanimous appeal at present is to immediately distribute Siamese rice so that the poor can benefit sooner, but the appeal is still an appeal, and whether or not it will be distributed remains to be seen next time. Anyway, although dozens of starving people die on the streets every day, as time goes on, everyone seems to be accustomed to it and will no longer be shocked!

Rent Is Surprisingly Expensive, And "Initiation Fees" are Also Demanded

Speaking of the problem of "housing," it is also quite serious. The reason is that after Guangzhou was occupied, the houses damaged by the enemy and puppets amounted to three or four tenths, while the city's population is increasing day by day, and has now reached more than 1.2 million; according to estimates, there are about 100,000 private houses and shops, of which shops account for about half, and on average, each house can accommodate seven or eight people, which can only accommodate 700,000 or 800,000 people; therefore, in this situation of housing panic, the landlords regard the houses as scarce goods! Indeed, in Guangzhou, there are countless people who are homeless and sleeping on the streets. Even if you can afford the rent, it is really not easy to find a house to live in; even if you find one after much hardship, the rent is surprisingly expensive, not to mention that according to the bad example of renting a house in Guangzhou now, in the first month, in addition to the advance rent, there are also a series of so-called "initiation fees," "shoe money," "introduction fees," and "security deposits." In short, in the first month, you have to pay an amount equal to four or five times the rent before you can move in; assuming the rent is 50,000 yuan per month, then you have to pay 200,000 to 250,000 yuan to live in the first month, and that does not include house donation fees, police fees, neighborhood expenses, etc.! This is not all, and some more unconscionable landlords will ask you to move out in less than three months for unreasonable reasons, such as saying that his family members are coming from the countryside, or saying that his house is going to be sold, pulling three and dragging four, and insisting that you move away; because the house is so valuable, as soon as you leave, maybe within an hour, a new tenant will come to fill it, and the landlords can collect a large sum of "initiation fees," "shoe money," etc.!

The Roads Are In Terrible Condition, It's Better Not to Go Out at Night

Speaking of "traveling," after the restoration, transportation outside the city is not a big problem because several important railways and highways have been restored, the air routes and schedules are gradually increasing, and although the sea transport has not been fully restored, it can barely cope. But in the city, one feels that it is not easy to travel! First, the price of rickshaws and public transportation has risen, causing ordinary people to sigh. Second, the roads in Guangzhou are probably the worst in the world; whether it is the busiest area or the most remote area, no road is missing a piece here or broken there: whether you are riding in a rickshaw or a public bus, your butt will be sore non-stop! Third, due to the poor security, robberies often occur in broad daylight, so when walking on the street, even if you have a fountain pen or a watch, you have to be worried: in the evening, then it's even "better not to go out"!

In short, if you want to know the life of ordinary citizens in Guangzhou today, the simple answer is only one word: "difficult." With life so difficult, social order is bound to be chaotic: therefore, the citizens of Guangzhou, especially the poor masses, are all earnestly hoping that the authorities can find a way to solve all their current difficulties as soon as possible.

### Published Every Monday Worker's Summer School

— By Mei Xin

Workers in Various Industries Utilize Vacation Time for Further Education, Curriculum Emphasizes Knowledge of Labor Issues

Many American laborers are spending their summer vacation this year as students in numerous schools and workshops, receiving education and enjoying recreation.

A steelworker from Pennsylvania can spend his two-week summer vacation at a summer camp run by Pennsylvania State University, while autoworkers in the Midwest can pursue further education at a summer school organized by the local branch of the Michigan Industrial Union Council. This school covers 200 acres, is near Lake Huron, and begins on August 4th, located approximately sixty miles from Detroit. Textile workers in the South can spend their summer vacation at North Carolina State University.

Workers in various American industries can use this general vacation time to participate in labor summer camps or courses set up by senior union officials, government labor bureau officials, and university professors. These courses will include labor-management reconciliation procedures and contract negotiation laws, labor convention regulations, world affairs, labor history, and more. Regarding industrial management, participating students can learn about production processes, pricing issues, and the problems capitalists may encounter.

Two Systems

These two-week short courses are set up in two systems: one is the summer camp organized by labor unions, and the other is the labor school. The first type, the summer camp, is organized separately by local unions, and the issues studied are mainly limited to the problems of local union members. The labor school has a broader scope, including cultural subjects in addition to labor issues, and the student body includes not only organized labor but also workers who have not joined unions and even college students who are interested in labor issues.

Since a large number of people regularly desire to gain admission and training opportunities, priority is given to union leaders. Furthermore, there are many teachers willing to serve in these educational groups, and many are waiting for the opportunity to be hired, believing that labor groups are excellent subjects for educational experimentation because these workers have extremely rich practical experience but little theoretical cultivation.

Four Schools

There are four labor schools in the United States: the Hudson Shore Labor School across from Hyde Park in New York, the Workers' School at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, and the Affiliated School for Workers Summer School at Forest Lake, Illinois.

Among these four schools, the Hudson Shore Labor School is the oldest, with a history of 25 years this year. It was originally a summer school for female workers, but later became co-educational. The school's purpose is to make male and female workers understand their own problems, so educators have set up a curriculum that includes economics, English speaking skills, and drama. In addition, there is a factory so that workers can study the most personal problems. The school's plan is supervised by a board of directors consisting of teachers, past students, and representatives elected by labor groups.

Wisconsin's labor school starts in early June and ends in mid-August. It is the only state-supported labor school. In 1925, there were only 34 students, but in 1945, the number had increased to 545, with students from various states and Canada, with an average age of 39. The main purpose of this school is to enable workers to collectively negotiate everything with employers. The school's work is mainly divided into three parts: the most important part is, of course, the summer students, followed by the winter school and service work.

Fundraising

The Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tennessee, now often attracts laborers from Southern states to study. Since 1945, the school has launched a campaign to raise a $70,000 fund in order to accommodate more students and increase the number of teachers and equipment.

Students at the Affiliated School for Workers Summer School include union officials and non-union staff. The school is in session from July 13 to 27. This school was originally initiated by Oberlin College in Ohio in 1933. Since then, it has been held annually on the campus of a university, but the selected location is mostly in the Midwest.

However, these summer schools are not just work and no play. Most summer schools and training courses have well-arranged entertainment programs. For example, the Pennsylvania steelworkers' summer camp stipulates: "Afternoon time can be spent playing golf, tennis, handball, softball, and picnics. There is a small river stocked with salmon next to the camp, so you can also enjoy fishing."

Each person participating in the summer camp spends approximately $25 per week, which includes food and lodging. Some summer workshops charge tuition fees of $10 to $15 per person, which is often paid by the union to which they belong.

These summer schools are just one part of the situation of labor education in the United States. American labor education is now being carried out nationwide, and its purpose is to adapt to the times, so that the labor sector, which is becoming increasingly important, its leaders and members can receive good technical training and be sufficient to solve labor problems.

Labor Relations

Labor relations have now been included in the curriculum of 75 American universities. Renowned universities such as Harvard, Cornell, the University of Chicago, and the state universities of Wisconsin, Rhode Island, Michigan, and North Carolina all teach this subject. Many professors often go to labor venues to participate in labor gatherings while lecturing on issues related to workers' lives. Professors are exposed to a large number of workers through this relationship.

There is a California Labor School in San Francisco that specializes in training students to serve as labor leaders (another similar school is in Los Angeles). This school not only occupies a high position in the labor movement but is also highly respected in academia, and many famous universities such as the University of California and Stanford University have unanimously praised it.

These many different labor education institutions prove that it is generally recognized that labor must have access to inexpensive educational opportunities, and that both unionized and unorganized labor should enjoy educational facilities in the same way as agriculture and commerce.

### Introduction to Business Management

— Xu Baiyi

There are many skilled engineers who can use simple machines to manufacture goods that still meet the highest standards. This is the skill of these engineers and a manifestation of their ability to utilize their knowledge.

B. The relationship to mechanical equipment: Each type of goods requires a different machine. This must be taken into account when designing goods. In the initial launch, there should be several different types of goods (a small number), because after the variety of goods increases, whether the company has sufficient financial resources to cope with the installation of machines is worthy of consideration.

Sometimes, making a product can utilize the same machine, or slightly increase a little equipment. With minimal cost, you can have a by-product, a different product. Therefore, goods are very closely related to mechanical equipment and should be taken into account when designing goods.

C. The durability of machines: After a factory is established, machines cannot be purchased frequently. Therefore, when purchasing machines, you must also consider how many years a machine can be used. Or, to manufacture a product, there are several different methods. If method A is used, the required machine can be used for ten years. If method B is used, the required machine can only be used for five years. Then, it is naturally better to adopt method A. This point should be taken into consideration.

D. Extending the sales period: Many goods can only be sold for a few years. After a few years, there must be new styles, otherwise, they will be outdated. Therefore, you should choose goods that can be sold for a long time, so that the cost of equipment and advertising will not be wasted. Moreover, from the perspective of starting a business, it is also required to be long-lasting. If you only obtain benefits temporarily and do a little speculative business, then it is naturally another matter.

E. The relationship between packaging and transportation: When designing goods, you must consider the issue of packaging and transportation. For example, if a product is most convenient and economical to be packaged in bottles of one ounce each and twelve dozen per box, then do not change the amount per bottle to one-half, which makes packaging and transportation inconvenient. Also, cigarettes are mostly packaged in ten, twenty, or fifty sticks. No manufacturer would package cigarettes in thirty or forty sticks. First, it breaks the long-standing habit and is not easy to sell. Second, packaging and transportation are also inconvenient.

B. Installation of Machines

After the product design is completed, you must purchase machines. After the machines are purchased, they must be installed. When installing, you need to consider the following points:

A. Must be firm: Many heavy machines require a base to be made and buried in concrete to make it very firm and immovable. If the machine is not firmly installed, then accidents will occur. If not, it will be frequently damaged, so it must be absolutely cautious.

B. Must be safe: Running a factory "safety first" This sentence is very worthy of adoption, because when an accident occurs in the factory, it will cause damage to the machine, or casualties to the people, or disasters to the house, or loss of raw materials or finished products. Equipment such as motors, electric wires, and steam boilers must be considered for safety issues when installed.

C. Must be smooth: The machine installation must allow the work to proceed smoothly. It must not suddenly go east, suddenly go west, suddenly go up, and suddenly go down, so that the work cannot proceed in order, because the result of not being able to proceed smoothly in the manufacturing process is to waste labor, lose time, and the raw materials or semi-finished products in manufacturing.

D. Must be spacious: There must be spacious space around the machine so that workers can walk around, and after taking the raw materials, they will not touch the machine. (To be continued)

### Aesthetic Education and Human Peace

— Xu Shiqi

Mencius advocated that human nature is good, while Xunzi, in contrast, advocated that human nature is evil. The debate over whether human nature is good or evil has been going on for thousands of years. What exactly is it all about? The world has already suffered the lessons of two major bloodsheds and should be able to realize something. Educators bear the great mission of transforming human psychology and creating true world peace. However, in ambitious countries, education has become a tool for manufacturing war. How was Japanese elementary school education conducted in the past fifty years? They consistently promoted aggressive ideologies. A teacher would hold an apple and say to the students, "How beautiful and sweet this apple is! Where does it come from? I'll tell you, it comes from Yantai in Shandong Peninsula, China. Do you love to eat it? Grow up and go to China quickly." Frankly speaking, Japan's cultivation of natural science education over the past half-century can be said to be successful. However, its understanding of the historical background and philosophical thought of the East was vague and distorted, leading it astray, and one wrong step can cause a thousand years of regret. Confucius said, "If you want to establish yourself, help others establish themselves; if you want to achieve success, help others achieve success," and "Do not seek to live by harming others; be willing to sacrifice your life to achieve benevolence." This was originally the lofty ideal of Chinese philosophers, but the Japanese never dreamed of it. Educators are like workers managing dyeing vats or artisans making plaster models. They can dye things blue or yellow, create a human form or a beastly shape. A stone, in the hands of Michelangelo or Rodin, can become an extremely valuable work of art for millions to admire. A blank piece of paper, under the brush of Li Sixun or Wang Wei, can depict vast clouds and smoke, the endless miles of the Yangtze River, unprecedented masterpieces. A few plum blossoms, a bundle of withered chrysanthemums, what are they? In the eyes of Lin Bu and Tao Qian, they saw the great life of nature and symbolized the serenity and noble character of the soul.

Humans are not just two arms and a waste-making machine; they possess a spiritual life that other animals do not have. Americans historically looked down on black people, but President Lincoln, who liberated the slaves and sparked the American Civil War, was ultimately a great man. Although black people, in general, have been slow to advance in cultural development or lag behind other ethnic groups, their achievements in music have already demonstrated great genius. Recently, the most popular songs and dances in the United States have been imitating the style of black people everywhere. The author once saw a black female star, Josephine Baker, perform in a theater in Paris, and the box office was breaking all records. When we sailed the Indian Ocean and landed on the island of Ceylon, we immediately saw a group of Indians sitting on the ground and eating with their fingers, which seemed a bit unpleasant. However, when we toured the famous cities of India, visited the major temples, and saw the exquisite carvings and magnificent murals, it proved that Indians have indeed made great achievements in art. And during the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties in China, we were indeed greatly influenced by India in culture. In Buddhist thought, we can see that Indians are a great nation with a transcendent view of life and wisdom!

Bergson said, "Other organisms are mainly controlled by instinct, while humans rely on intelligence to control life." A person's life is nothing more than the activity of will and emotion. The promotion of will and the driving of emotion originate from the cultivation of personality. Therefore, humans can break free from the control of instinct and have the spirit of upward creation. The virtues that humans admire are truth, goodness, and beauty, which is what Mencius advocated as the goodness of human nature. The opposite of truth is hypocrisy, the opposite of goodness is inferiority, and the opposite of beauty is ugliness, which is what is called the evil of human nature. To eliminate evil and promote goodness, we rely on the cultivation of aesthetic education, because aesthetic education has two characteristics: one is universality, and the other is transcendence. The famous mountains and rivers created by nature can be visited by everyone. The setting sun and bright moon can be appreciated by everyone. Everyone laughs heartily when watching a comedy. A sad song brings tears to people's eyes, because aesthetic sense can tear apart people's narrow prejudices and give humanity sympathy, transcending the concept of self-interest. This is clear proof of the universality of beauty.

Wen Tianxiang, imprisoned and humiliated, produced the "Song of Righteousness" in his cell, expressing his great aspirations for the universe and life. Yan Hui, living in a humble alley, was so poor that he could not even make ends meet, but "others cannot bear the sorrow, yet Hui does not diminish his joy." He was able to transmit Confucius's great principles. Wu Xun, who begged for a living, was able to create a great path for popular education. Tolstoy, who sympathized with the suffering of farmers, renounced the honor of the nobility, loved nature, and tilled the fields himself.

The above historical facts prove that this kind of aesthetic sense that transcends self-interest, great and noble behavior, has the spirit of "wealth and honor cannot corrupt, poverty and lowliness cannot move, and power and force cannot subdue." This is a beautiful life, and it is also the great value of life.

In ancient Chinese education, as early as two thousand years ago, they began to advocate aesthetic education and physical education, using ritual, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics as the six arts. Except for mathematics, all contain artistic components. The original meaning of ritual is to abide by rules, to yield and advance, "to revolve within the circle, to turn within the square." Music is pure art. Archery and charioteering seek artistic training and belong to the scope of physical education. Writing is used to record events and is another department of art. Later, such as the literary garden of the Han and Wei dynasties, the sculptures of the Northern and Southern dynasties, the poetry of the Tang dynasty, the lyrics after the Five Dynasties, the paintings of the Song dynasty, and the novels and dramas after the Yuan dynasty, each flourished and grew with the culture of each generation. In terms of education, it must rely on the cultivation of art, instilling spiritual vitality, and then there will be a life rich in content and harmony. Unfortunately, since the Han dynasty, the education system has been replaced by the six classics instead of the six arts. Although the six classics are the legacy of sages and philosophers, reading only the six classics is book knowledge and is divorced from life education. The result is that it flows into the study of sentences and phrases. Furthermore, the imperial examination system is used to select officials, and the eight-legged essay becomes a profession. In general, people only know how to whine and mutter, focusing on trivialities, creating a style of national decline and decline in China for thousands of years.

The purpose of aesthetic education is to cultivate a beautiful outlook on life, hoping to create living people with universality, truth, goodness, and beauty, eliminate all the treacherous, greedy, cruel, and inferior behaviors of struggle in the world, and promote the noble aesthetic sense of human beings. Now all mankind is studying how to consolidate true world peace, then cultivating a beautiful life with aesthetic education should be a great way to world peace!

### Art and National Life

— Translated by Huang Hanqiu. Written by Takamura

Translator's Note: This article was published before our nation's victory. The points it makes are extremely pertinent and can serve as a model for others. Any nation can learn from it, especially our nation after its victory, which is still in an era of imperfection. How can we neglect the core of the entire nation's development?

It goes without saying that these are unprecedented times. To fulfill our nation's mission, our nation is entrusting itself to fate. However, we must resolutely complete this mission, which is more important than anything else. Therefore, if anything happens, the entire nation must cooperate and work together. First, deeply ingrain this point in our hearts, and then consider everything from this perspective. This is the way to guide the people. If the entire nation cannot cooperate and work together, what is the most terrifying thing? It is the desolation of people's hearts caused by the difficulties of extraordinary times in national life—that is, the desolation of the human spirit. This war has lasted for many years, and the scarcity of living materials is a matter of course. In our country, this is the first time we have experienced this. This poverty and hardship in life has had a considerable impact on people's hearts, which is a fact. Even if the war is won, there are many examples in the First World War of falling due to the desolation of people's hearts in the rear. Therefore, nothing is as terrifying as the desolation of people's hearts, because there is no visible boundary between before and after. When it is exhausted to the extreme, there is only one path to destruction. People's hearts cannot be moved by mere reason. Without the nourishment and light that comes from within, people's hearts will not work automatically. I believe that the reason why we must pay attention to art in such extraordinary times is based on this point. Speaking of art, many people say that they are only worried about what to eat every day, so why bother with art. Although that may be true, it is a complete misunderstanding of art. Many people think of art as a luxury, such as the appreciation of calligraphy and painting, antiques, the design of house styles and decorations, and the beautification of clothing. They only think of these things. However, that is wrong. Although those things are undoubtedly a part of art, what I want to emphasize today is the original fundamental question, which is the question of the heart. The heart of art, the artistic heart, or the artistic spirit, is originally a kind of ability that exists in everyone's heart. It gives people a kind of unspeakable nourishment and light from within, and makes people live green and vital.

The Heart of Science

Recently, some people have advocated that the most important thing lacking in the general life of our people is not various kinds of scientific knowledge, but the heart of science. Moreover, the so-called heart of science can be said to begin with an overview of things and a careful observation of objects. In any case, this is the fundamental way of thinking. Similarly, in terms of art, it is not just buying paintings or wearing beautiful clothes, but possessing the heart of art, the artistic heart, and the artistic spirit. So what is the artistic spirit? First, it is the heart that savors things. That is, the heart that loves things, the heart that does not treat things rudely, the heart that discovers the advantages of things, etc. The ambrosia (delicious taste) that one gets from savoring things ecstatically is the beginning of art. In any aspect of life, one must discover its advantages, create its beauty, and explore its meaning, thereby obtaining calmness, nourishment, and light in terms of life. Speaking of the artistic spirit, it is the same as religion, it is to save people. However, it is different from the methods of religion. Religion is to remove the pain of life, to make the painful become painless, to make the hot become not hot. To put it bluntly, fire can also be regarded as cool, which has such an amazing power. The artistic spirit does not necessarily remove the pain of life. But because it savors that pain, it insists on pain as pain on the one hand, and feels pain in one place. For that pain, it has an unyielding power, which is what the artistic spirit gives. The artistic spirit is the expression of not allowing those who live comfortably to fall into idleness, and not allowing those who live in poverty to frequently fall into despair. Those who live in small shacks in slums, or those who live in small attic rooms, can see the world in a pot, which is a person with an artistic spirit. If that kind of person goes to live in a tall garden house, there is also a world in a pot there. If that kind of person becomes a big entrepreneur, there is also a world in a pot there. Once the world's politics are in his hands, there is also a world in a pot there. That is, at any time, he will not be controlled by circumstances, will not be confused by things, will not expect to benefit himself. He can maintain calmness, nourishment, and light in his heart at any time. The so-called artistic spirit is such a spirit.

Artistic Spirit

Originally, people always have some kind of artistic spirit that savors things. From a comprehensive view of our country's ancient literature and art, and considering the general life of the people, it can be understood that our ancestors, regarding the savoring of things, the love of things, were unwilling to handle them roughly, maintained the nourishment of life, did not lose the light that arose from the world in a pot, and constantly followed the path of generation and development. This spirit gives the nation style and taste, as well as elegant interests. Therefore, we always want to make the national character higher than other countries, so as to promote the electrical character to all mankind. Since the Restoration, the material civilization of Europe and the United States has been imported too rapidly, and this character has presented a state of confusion. The standard of beauty has also lost its normality. Therefore, the original rich artistic spirit of the country has been buried in the hearts of the general public, and even what they have has become indifferent, resulting in the current situation. Everywhere, for the sake of utilitarianism, everything is done hastily, everything is done without intimacy, everything becomes a state without love. The hearts of the people simply lack leisure. Talking about the heart that savors things, etc., seems to be outdated and inappropriate. However, that cannot continue. That cannot develop the nation. In today's extraordinary state, if we do not strive to urgently seek the awakening of the artistic spirit, the general desolation of the national life may be unavoidable. This is a very important matter. Fortunately, recently the authorities have realized the importance of culture, and have established the Ministry of Culture and used the most suitable people, so we can finally ease our worries. To awaken the general artistic spirit of the people, we must take all effective means. I will not talk about other cultural aspects for the time being. Regarding the question of art, in short, we must first break the preconceived notion that art has nothing to do with national life.

Things Around Us

In short, art is something close to the people, and we must make them feel that it is in the national life itself. In any case, artistic works are the concrete embodiment of the artistic spirit, and it is easy to make people feel this interest. To give the people the opportunity to have frequent contact with good art, that is, to pay attention to all public buildings, so that the general public naturally utters a sound of admiration, is a method. In this regard, the so-called national common residence problem, etc., is advocated, because the direct impact is great, which is very worthy of review. All things that have been exposed to the eye and are harmful to the national aesthetic sense; for example, advertisements, signs, street lines, etc. with vulgar elements, should be improved, which is also a method. When old-fashioned houses still exist, the progress of artistic decoration in the living room must be encouraged. In the future, based on the meaning of sharing the view with the public and sharing the appreciation with the public, we will greatly promote the commemorative art to create the art of the national beautiful intention. In the aspects that have been constructed in the past, where there are books on elegance, we must now consider and discuss a method on the original site, because the problem of the entire nation is more important than the problem of the individual. Like the exhibition: in the past, it was only engaged in like an arena for artists, a road to fame, etc., which must also be considered and corrected. Moreover, as long as the focus is placed on the nature of the national festival of beauty and opened, it will naturally be reasonable.

Also, Tokyo has the Imperial Museum, the Okura Shukokan, and recently the Nezu Museum has been established. To increase the interest of citizens by using this kind of thing, we still need to take some method and implement it. Just like London is completely a commercial city, but the utilization of art museums is very developed. The artistic spirit is to join hands with religion and science to support the people to obtain the power to develop the nation. Especially now, it is a time when the people urgently need art, so I solemnly put it forward and do not hesitate to talk repeatedly to complete my words.

### Famous Paintings and Famous Artists

— Liu Shi

Da Vinci, the Versatile Genius and His Masterpieces

Da Vinci was an illegitimate child born in Vinci village near Empoli, Florence, Italy. From a young age, his parents were unknown and his surname was not clear. The villagers called him "Da Vinci" (Leonardo de Vinci). It is said that he learned to paint from the sculptor Verrocchio (1435-1488), a friend of his father's acquaintance. Da Vinci's father, what his name was, Fan never told anyone, only said that he was a famous great lawyer. Da Vinci's natural talent, after a few years, finally achieved great success, surpassing his teacher, and finally became an outstanding figure among the world's great men.

He is one of the few technologists. Bridges, city construction, all engineering projects have been created by him with extraordinary results.

He is also a sculptor, and he also produced a lot of exquisite sculptures. He is also a scientist, and he has invented many sciences, airplanes, automobiles, and many weapons have been designed by him accurately, and he has made many contributions to the world's academics. He is also a writer, and he is also a poet and an astronomer. However, in addition to the amazing achievements in the above departments, what is now famous in the world is painting. His paintings occupy a brilliant position in the history of art.

His masterpieces in his life include "Mona Lisa" (Eternal Smile), "The Last Supper", etc. There are many interesting anecdotes about the production of "The Last Supper".

It is said that "The Last Supper" is a mural commissioned by the Santa Maria Monastery to paint. When the production began, it was very smooth. He worked day and night, sometimes forgetting to eat and drink, and he was immersed in his conception. After that, because the appearance of "Jesus" and "Judas" in the painting took a lot of brainpower, and he was not satisfied with the painting, so it was delayed for two years. After the monks repeatedly urged him, Da Vinci could not stand such a blow, and finally said to a monk who came to persecute him in great anger: "In the future, please don't come to persecute me again, I will definitely hand in the paper tomorrow." The next day, it was completed. When the host of the monastery discovered that the appearance of "Judas" in the painting was similar to a monk in the temple, he asked Da Vinci: "What does this mean? Is this person going to be a Judas in the future?" Da Vinci nodded and said, "The reason why I delayed this painting for two years is because I have never seen a person with Judas's character since I was a child. Today, a certain monk in your temple persecutes me every day, with the momentum of nailing me to the cross, so I pretend to be his appearance in the painting to replace Judas." Not a few years later, the host of the monastery was indeed killed by the monk. Before he died, he still told people about this matter, and praised Da Vinci for having the foresight.

He died in 1519, at the age of about fifty-seven or eight years old. He is known as one of the three Italian heroes.

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"If that's all you're worried about, I can offer you two suggestions: First, love is not a terrible thing, unless the man or woman really doesn't understand love and takes lust for love. I read a line of Shakespeare's poetry: "Hope is the lover's staff; gripping it, it helps one walk; waving it, it resists the will to despair." Gu Jun, don't we have a common goal? If we take ten thousand steps back, even if we seriously fall in love with each other, isn't this love a 'staff' that we share?

"Furthermore, I have carefully observed the international situation and see that the ruthless chaos is coming! With our background and mood, can we still steal time to talk about love? Even if there is mutual admiration, or one-sided admiration, at best, it is just a spiritual connection, only 'heart to heart'."

"Gu Jun, your experience and knowledge are countless times greater than mine. Do you think my two assumptions can stand? If so, you don't have to be afraid to meet me."

I had just read to this point when I suddenly heard a rustling sound from the cabinet. He'er and I ran to the edge of the stove at the same time. I opened the cabinet door, put on the headphones, and picked up the microphone. I heard the number called by the Shenyang main station. I matched the secret code with the other party, and heard the other party report "154...14..." This is our special number, indicating that the following is a string of our private password. After listening to this special password, I gave He'er a gesture, and he immediately prepared his pen and paper, and our communication work immediately started.

After the other party finished reporting the special password, I took He'er's record and repeated it as usual to avoid recording errors. After the re-reporting was completed, He'er had already placed a small booklet on the table and carefully translated it.

This small booklet has a total of only 1,450 commonly used Chinese characters: ten characters per line, ten lines per page, so there are only seven or eight leaves in total. Judging from the format, it looks like a small copybook. The arrangement of the words and sentences is like a long song, but some places are not very smooth. There are three tricks in it, and without training, it is impossible to use it no matter what.

These three tricks are all non-organic mixed with organic. For example, the page number and the order number of the words are non-organic; but according to the four six-hour periods of day and night, they are divided into four kinds of changes, and the rotation of 52 weeks a year creates another kind of change. So every week there is a different translation method. When necessary, the person sending the telegram can reverse the seasons at any time, and then the order of the weeks will also be changed accordingly.

The most powerful change in the organic type is that the receiving end can temporarily request to change the reporting order of the password: for example, this password report has a total of 155 characters, and the receiving person first asks for the total number of characters, and then reverses and confuses the order of the entire text. The sending party will tell the word. This move is to prevent someone in the team from stealing the password and selling the message within a short period of time. Because this German wireless telephone is built extremely cleverly, as long as the distance changes, the frequency will also change. That is to say, if the sending and receiving parties have the correct frequency, they can talk to each other. Assuming that a third party also receives this frequency from the sending party, they can only hear the sound of the sending party, and can never hear the sound of the receiving party at the same time; because the location of the third party cannot be exactly in the center point where the distances of both parties are equal; in this way, even if the third party receives this telegram, it will only be a chaotic mess, and it is simply impossible to explore.

What if the communication station loses this booklet? It can be said that it doesn't matter at all; ordinary people think it is a copybook, and if the spy steals it, because there are too many organic changes, it is also impossible to apply it. If a colleague loses it, they must report it immediately. However, in the past ten years, the comrades who were in charge of the radio station cherished this thing as much as their own lives. The loss has never happened, and it has only been destroyed a few times.

### Random Thoughts

— Shao Fu

According to reports, a bizarre fraud occurred in Hankou. An old woman named Zhang Feng, through the method of bidding associations, invited business women to organize bidding association groups, with a total of more than 1,700, absorbing more than 1.3 billion legal currency. She used this to exploit heavy interest, looking like a big rich man.

The election of Shanghai Miss initiated to relieve the refugees in northern Jiangsu mobilized so many people, and the newspapers promoted it every day. There will also be a large-scale garden party, and the goal is only 2 billion yuan.

In contrast, it is more and more believed that it is easy to do evil and difficult to do good.

A friend, originally a civil servant, sent his family back to his recovered hometown after the victory. Another friend started an export merchant house and asked him to help in Shanghai, saying: "You have stuck to your post for eight years, and you can ask yourself without shame. Now it is helping me, and let yourself stretch your waist." The friend agreed. Unexpectedly, for more than half a year, I only saw batches of foreign goods being imported, and exports were simply stagnant. The friend was dumbfounded.

Now the tariff on export goods has been removed. I wish my friend can really stretch his waist.

Yang Wendao's ten years of injustice now have a chance to be overturned.

A new discovery is that the original accuser, Zeng Yuan, was again reported as a traitor.

Originally, viciousness, treachery, meanness, greed, etc. are the "virtues" of some social dregs, but they are also the "virtues" of some henchmen traitors. Is it not appropriate for the dregs of society to be traitors?

### Where is the City Center?

— Yang Mou

Recently, when Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau entertained reporters, he reported that the authorities had decided to implement traffic control measures in the city center area from September 1, and added a note that the so-called city center area refers to the area west of the Bund, east of Tibet Road, north of Zhongzheng East Road, and south of Suzhou Creek. Because of this note, I can't help but have a question, where is the city center area after all.

We all know that Shanghai has a city center area. That was before the war, when the Chinese government, because the concessions had not been recovered, spent a lot of manpower and material resources to build it on its own. Everyone praised the magnificent houses and the neat and flat roads. Unfortunately, although the project has been completed, when the development was not yet sound, the war broke out, and the city center area was of course inevitably doomed.

However, the city center area is of course still the city center area.

After the victory, the concessions have been cancelled. The office address of the municipal government is probably located at the original site of the former British and French Municipal Council, because it is convenient to control the urban area. At first, it seemed that the words "Temporary Office" were painted on it, but later it was erased, with the appearance of dying in this hometown. How it is, of course, non-outsiders can know.

Recent news, but I heard that the Works and Education Bureaus are going to move back to the city center area, then it seems that this ordinary municipal center of gravity still has a day to rely on. After the confusion, this city center area will probably be grateful and tearful.

However, this time the city center area for traffic control is obviously "counterfeit". Since the city center area does not allow opening branches, of course, it does not allow "two suns in the sky".

Moreover, in terms of lively areas, this section may be called the center. In terms of the entire Shanghai city map, the seat of the "city center" is still given to the old brother. Since there is already a city center, this time the area for traffic control should not be confused, I think, at most, it can only be named "urban area"!

### A Sweet Kiss

— Translated by Chen Zhongji from the August Reader's Digest

Time: During World War II.

Place: The moment the Romanian tunnel train passes through the tunnel.

People: A young girl, a Romanian, an old lady, and a German officer.

Plot: The four passengers were sitting very properly when the train did not enter the tunnel; after a while, the train was pitch black, and it turned out that the train had entered the tunnel. At that time, a sweet kiss suddenly came in the dark, followed by the sound of a slap in the face. When the train returned to light, only the German officer's eyelid had a bruise.

The girl thought: Huh, how can there be such a good appetite man, who doesn't love to kiss me, but goes to kiss that old woman!

The old lady thought: This girl is so fierce, she was kissed by a man, and she was so angry that she slapped her in the face.

The German officer thought: Haha, I haven't been slapped by a woman for a long time. It's quite interesting to be slapped by a woman. I have to thank this Romanian who forcibly kissed the girl.

At this time, what was even happier than the German officer was the Romanian, because he kissed the back of his hand, and then slapped the hateful German soldier hard, but there was no trace of it.

### Shanghai Today

— Suo Bei

Today, Shanghai has a surplus of glass, a shortage of books, and even more school shortages. Among these, it is difficult to say in one word, and even if you talk about "One Thousand and One Nights", you can't clear it up.

Today, Shanghai has a surplus of "democratic slogans", a panic of order. Walking on the road, cars and pedestrians only see themselves but not others. People walking see cars rushing around and gnash their teeth. When they sit in the car one day, they blame why there are only annoying pedestrians on the road? People waiting for the tram see the car not stopping at the station and gnash their teeth, but when they get on the tram, they hope to drive straight to their destination. Alas, the flood of freedom has become selfishness!

### Various Difficulties of the Tram Company: An Explanation from Two Ticket Inspectors

(Editor's Note: This article is submitted by Liang Shile and Liang Hebo, ticket inspectors of the tram company. Although they speak from the company's perspective, their points regarding the need for passenger cooperation are worth considering by the public. Therefore, we are publishing it below:)

We now wish to make a small plea for the British-owned tram company, which is currently being criticized by all sectors. Although from our point of view, this is superfluous. We are merely ticket inspectors.

Arriving Late

Waiting for a tram under the scorching sun is an annoying matter, especially when one often waits for more than half an hour and still no tram arrives. Perhaps all passengers already know the reason for this. During the enemy-puppet period, all the company's resources were almost completely taken away, especially the severe shortage of tires. Therefore, trolleybuses such as routes 18 and 20 cannot operate. Furthermore, due to the few trams and many people on routes such as route 16, it is more likely to cause tire damage. But this point can be easily resolved as long as there are tires available.

Why Not Stop

Passengers who have been waiting for a long time suddenly see a tram arriving. Just when they are happy, the tram suddenly drives away without stopping. It is impossible to blame the general passengers for getting angry. Let me explain: the company has strict regulations on the intervals between tram departures. When leaving the depot every morning, the times are arranged in order of departure. In addition, there are outdoor ticket inspectors and ticket writers at both ends of each route who are responsible for supervising the vehicles. Under such strict management, "missing a stop" rarely happened before the war. However, the current situation is different. There are more people and fewer trams. Furthermore, there are many vehicles on the road, blocking the main roads, and accidents occur frequently. Trams are like dragons, running one after another. After it is finally resolved, every stop is bound to be crowded with people. Imagine passengers who have been waiting for a long time at the station seeing a tram arrive. How could they not try desperately to get on? But the tram is already packed. However, passengers only care about squeezing inside. Passengers above cannot get off, and those below are stuck at the tram doors and unable to get on. Deadlocks occur from time to time, which often causes trams to miss their stops even more. When a tram misses a stop, the company colleagues, based on many years of experience and to ensure the safety of passengers, have no choice but to drive away, because the tram behind will be coming. Regarding this point, the problem of traffic order in Shanghai must first be resolved.

Empty Trams Also Do Not Stop

Every day at eight or nine o'clock in the morning when people are going to work, every stop is always crowded with people. Suddenly, a route 2 tram, after dropping off passengers on Yuyuan Road, accelerated and drove straight ahead, without stopping at Jing'an Temple or Hart Road, and possibly not even at Seymour Road. Those abandoned passengers were all furious. I know their hearts are full of hatred. But you are wrong to blame us, because if the tram stops at Jing'an Temple station, it is likely to be crammed full of people. By the time it reaches Hart Road and Seymour Road, it can only pick up a very small number of passengers. Furthermore, sometimes, because the tram is already packed at Jing'an Temple, the driver has the right not to stop at nearby stops. Therefore, based on the ratio of the number of passengers each station can accommodate, we send an empty tram to Hart Road or Seymour Road every few trams. I remember once I saw that Seymour Road was really crowded, so I specifically ordered an empty tram to be sent from Jing'an Temple. At that time, I also went on the tram. Unexpectedly, when the tram arrived at Hart Road, a passenger, seeing that the empty tram did not stop, clung to the iron door and refused to let go. I was afraid of trouble, so I told the driver to stop the tram. Then other passengers swarmed onto the tram. The passengers who got on the tram, without asking questions, spat on my face. I wanted to reason with him, but the other passengers were all aggressive, and no one would sympathize with me. I could only suffer in silence. When the tram arrived at Seymour Road, a group of passengers squeezed onto the tram and happily shouted: "Lucky—Lucky—We even got seats!" However, the price they paid for sitting in these seats was that I had to be spat on.

Queuing to Board

The above three situations often lead to misunderstandings by passengers. We cannot deny that in some situations, we cannot achieve the goal of serving all passengers. We absolutely welcome criticism from all sectors, but we do not welcome hostile abuse. We hope for fair guidance and good ways to improve, but the most important thing is to ask all passengers and our company colleagues to cooperate closely. The simplest and easiest way is to queue to board the tram! Our company colleagues have suffered countless grievances for this point. The company authorities have specifically set up ticket inspectors at each station with many passengers to assist passengers in queuing. Sometimes, it is easy to form a queue, but as soon as the tram arrives, the queue is disrupted again, which is equivalent to queuing up in vain. The young and strong may swarm up, but you should not be happy. You also have elderly parents and petite younger sisters at home. If you maintain this good order, you are also helping your own family.

The above points are our personal opinions and explanations. Our only hope is to ask everyone to cooperate with our company colleagues and to ask newspapers to publish more articles on public morality!

### A Few Suggestions for Hospitals and Doctors

— (35·8·16· Lü Tian)

According to reports, the other day, Chen Xiaomei, a fourteen-year-old female worker at the Hongda Cotton Thread Factory on Fanhuangdu Road, was cleaning cotton yarn when her arm was dragged into the machine by the thread on the roller, severing her arm at the shoulder. The bone and flesh were only connected by a thread of skin, and blood flowed all over the ground. She was sent by ambulance to Tongren Second Hospital on Yidingpan Road for emergency treatment. In order to demand a consultation fee of four thousand yuan and a deposit of five hundred thousand yuan, the factory owner, Shi Meicai, paid ten thousand five thousand yuan first, which was all he had with him. The remaining amount was even guaranteed by a police officer. Zhang Lei, the head of general affairs at the hospital, did not agree to provide emergency treatment first. Even the nurse, Zhu Jingxian, coldly said: "The public has no money to subsidize here. Process the procedures first, then save the person." This caused a delay, causing Chen Xiaomei to lose too much blood. The hospital refused to admit her and had to transfer her to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment, and her life is in danger. Now the hospital director Huang Mingxin and the head of general affairs Zhang Lei have been summoned by the Changning Road Police Station. (August 15, Tiebao) Regarding the legal responsibilities of this case, as well as the fact that a fourteen-year-old child dares to accompany the machine due to the pressure of life and bear the unbearable heavy work, which involves the entire social problem, will be discussed in another article. First, I would like to put forward a few thoughts on the duties of the hospital:

Saving Lives and Helping the World

For twenty years, the government and people of our country have been advocating a public medical system. However, due to the lack of overall planning and determination by the authorities in charge of health administration, private doctors cannot fully take saving lives and helping the world as their duty, resulting in the current situation where doctors use the amount of money as the criterion for the depth of their treatment. As a result, selling fake medicines, exaggerating illnesses, and playing tricks to mislead patients happen frequently. The "rice bowl mentality" of public doctors, perfunctorily dealing with patients as "troublesome customers," is only to cope with the situation for the sake of their jobs, which gives the society a bad impression of distrusting public doctors. It must be known that doctors should take saving lives and helping the world as their duty. Doctors are by no means a free profession, but a cause for human beings to consolidate their groups, benefit the people, and contribute their talents to serve the people. Only when doctors have the determination to recognize medicine as their duty can they study carefully and reduce the suffering of patients. The public medical system is a system to achieve this goal, to make universal use of human resources. That is, all doctors should be hired by the state, assigned to various places throughout the country, and the state should be responsible for their living expenses. Their salaries must be higher than those of general public educators now, enough for their lives, and doctors must contribute their talents to serve the people. Civil servants are the servants of the people, and doctors should be the servants of the people's health.

Serving the Public

Since the medical profession is a career of serving the public, doctors should further demonstrate their service to the public. After some hospital doctors have completed their diagnosis and issued a prescription, they will introduce you to a pharmacy and advise you: This medicine is only available there, or the medicine in that pharmacy is of high quality and accurate in content, or you can get preferential treatment if you buy it with this note. But in the end, the same medicine, following orders to the designated pharmacy, the price is not only not preferential, but will be higher by some amount. It is said that this is the "kickback" from the doctor's introduction. The hospital has a deposit item, so it is not easy for many poor people to seek medical treatment. For acute and poor illnesses, there is simply no hope of treatment. It is said that some hospitals' third-class wards still require acquaintances to run errands and some tips to find a way in. Money, money, money, Shanghai is a world of money, but it is suffering those poor compatriots. Are the poor citizens even deprived of the freedom to get sick and seek medical treatment?

Two Major Demands

Before the establishment of a public medical system, in order to save the current deformed and unreasonable phenomenon, I put forward two requests:

First, in order to maintain business, hospitals must collect consultation fees, but the income and expenditure must be reasonable. The higher fees for first- and second-class wards can be used to subsidize the poor and sick. In the event of an emergency, treatment must be given first, and then the consultation fee can be discussed. In our country's traditional concept, gratitude is deeply rooted. You saved his life; he will never forget you. Your generosity and willingness to save people will deeply touch people, and may even make the patient's family sincerely reward you more.

Unified Drug Names

Second, unify drug names and mark drug prices. Our country has always lacked unity in drug names. For example, the insecticide "Santonin" is translated as "Suo Tuo Ren," and "Penicillin" is translated as "Pan Ni Xi Lin." The same drug has different names, so it can be falsely claimed that this is not that, and tricks can be played. Even changing tablets into powder to deceive patients, just so that those who only seek profit can achieve their tricks. At the same time, doctors issue prescriptions all in Western languages, which makes patients feel as if they are in a fog. When they take it to the pharmacy, they are at a loss and let the pharmacy calculate the profit they want. The author once took the prescription for the same calcium tablet to several pharmacies. The same brand of goods had prices that differed by more than a thousand yuan. Therefore, the responsible health authorities should urgently unify the translation of drug names and standardize prices. At the same time, whether doctors can use Chinese as much as possible in future prescriptions to avoid patients being deceived is also worth studying. Moreover, after using Chinese, the source of the disease, the symptoms, the method of taking the medicine, and the recuperation can all be clear at a glance, without the need for repeated instructions, which saves time and benefits patients. What is not to like? The customs office has now clearly ordered that Chinese should be the main language, so why are doctors so particular about writing in Western languages? Moreover, "German names" and "English names" show people factional views. It is better for Chinese people to use Chinese characters, which are appropriate and do not lose the national spirit. What is the "gimmick" in writing a few lines of "foreign characters"?
