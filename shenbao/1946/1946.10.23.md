### Myriad Homes Light Lamps and Hang Flags to Celebrate, Chairman Inspects Taipei Seaport and Offers Flowers to Martyrs and Zheng Chenggong

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife and Chief Executive Chen and his wife, proceeded from the headquarters to the Taipei Martyrs' Shrine at 3:15 PM on the 22nd to offer flowers and pay respects to the revolutionary martyrs, the military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, and the late Prince Yanping Zheng Chenggong of the Ming Dynasty. On the way from Caoshan to Beitou (both in the northern suburbs of the city), the Chairman and his wife stopped their car by the mountainside to view the panorama of Taipei City. After the memorial ceremony at the Martyrs' Shrine, he inspected the area around for five minutes, and then proceeded to Tamsui, arriving at 4:05 PM. After tea and snacks, the Chairman inspected the ruins of the fort and took a photo with Chief Executive Chen. He then ascended the platform and gazed afar towards overseas, lingering for a long time. After the inspection, he and his wife each planted a camphor tree nearby. In the past, Tamsui was an important seaport in northern Formosa. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Dutch occupied the island by building Fort Santo Domingo here. In 1661 AD, Zheng Chenggong sent troops to conquer it, landing here. The site of Fort Santo Domingo still exists today and is clearly visible. At 5:05 PM, he inspected Tamsui Middle School, where the students cheered "Long live the Chairman!" The Chairman nodded frequently and said, "Good, good, thank you, thank you." As it was already dusk, he returned to the headquarters to rest. Residents along the way hung flags to celebrate, and men, women, old and young, stood respectfully in front of their homes amidst the myriad lights. Furthermore, very few people knew about Chairman Chiang's arrival in Taiwan beforehand. Yesterday, when the Chairman passed through the city by car, some elderly women were so overjoyed at the sight of him that they shed tears. After learning of this news this morning, citizens and shopkeepers automatically hung flags, and the streets instantly became lively.

### Middlemen Mediate for Days, Suggesting a Halt to Propaganda Warfare First

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Tonight's tea party at Sun Ke's residence lasted from 8:00 PM until 11:10 PM. All attendees except the CCP representatives were present and seriously studied various issues. After the meeting, Sun met with reporters and said that the Communist Party representatives and third-party figures had been in Nanjing for two days and were still exchanging views. Furthermore, the third party was heard to be negotiating, conveying the opinions of the CCP and the government, and then deciding on a meeting format. Formal negotiations have not yet begun. What can be reported today is that one opinion from the third party has been accepted by the government. This opinion is that the propaganda of both the government and the Communist Party should be taken seriously, and a "propaganda truce" should be implemented immediately. In the future, any documents and statements that must be published must be agreed upon by everyone. This is a new constraint. After the meeting, Liang Shuming and Luo Longji of the China Democratic League, Mo Dehui, a virtuous social figure, and Chen Qitian of the China Youth Party, went to visit Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village, returning to Lanjiazhuang at 12:00 AM and holding a temporary press conference. Liang announced the progress of today's talks, stating that the opinions on the ceasefire discussed by the third party and the representatives of various parties today have also been recorded and transmitted to the government. The gathering at 8:00 PM was initiated by the third party to explain this to the government representatives, which took a long time. Everyone believes that things can still proceed and should not be viewed pessimistically. However, the most important thing at present is that the propaganda of both sides should not be excessive, so as not to affect the progress of negotiations. From the 23rd, the third party will invite both the KMT and CCP to begin negotiating the implementation of a cessation of propaganda offensives. Those who cherish peace must pay attention to this matter. Finally, Liang solemnly stated that the third party declares as follows: "Unofficial negotiations have been actively underway for days, and all reports of disputes and speeches published by each other do not affect the negotiations. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, the third party will invite representatives from both sides to discuss ways to achieve a propaganda truce."

Zhou Enlai rose and said, "I didn't study science, but I did very well in mathematics in middle school. I believe that small details should be clarified. For example, if X plus Y equals four, if you don't clarify what X is and what Y is, how will you know where the four comes from? Therefore, I believe that problems should be clarified from the small details." Then, Zhang Junmai humorously said, "We are like matchmakers.

### National Army in Northern Henan Enters Northern Hebei, Communist Army on the Outskirts of Southern Baoding Gradually Retreats, National Army in Shanxi Province Enters Xinkou and Yuanping

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] According to sources: The National Army under Liu Ruming in northern Henan has arrived in the Changtai area of southern Hebei, with a tendency to advance towards Handan. The National Army on the Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway is still stationed on the south bank of the Tanhe River, and Liu Bocheng's base in Handan and Xingtai seems to be empty. Furthermore, the National Army has also arrived in Jiyuan on the border between Henan and Shanxi, and the empty Communist Army base in Taihang is feeling threatened.

[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 22nd] The National Army in northern Henan has not shown any signs of crossing the Tanhe River and heading north. Several regiments of the Communist Army concentrated in the southwest of Anyang have launched fierce sabotage offensives along the railway line for days. The National Army launched a large-scale counterattack in separate routes from Anyang and Tangyin on the evening of the 20th. According to the front line, the National Army is pressing towards Liuhegou on one route and Hebi Town on the other, both of which are coal mining areas, and fierce fighting is underway.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The National Army advancing south on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway will soon recover the Beihe Store after pressing on. The authorities have ordered that they must join forces with the National Army in Baoding within three days to open the Pingbao section. Currently, only the three stations of Beihe, Gucheng, and Xushui in northern Baoding are in the hands of the Communist Army, while a unit of the National Army that recovered Dingxing has detoured to the vicinity of Xushui. The two routes from the north and south will join forces in Xushui. Xincheng, which has been besieged for a long time, was relieved yesterday after the arrival of reinforcements, who launched a pincer attack with the defenders from inside and outside. The rumor that Laishui has been recovered has not been confirmed. Road repair work has reached Dingxing, and the Communist Army outside Baoding is gradually retreating.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] Baoding's defense force is gradually strengthening, and the dangerous period has passed. According to Fu Juantu, director of the Hebei Telephone Bureau, who flew from Baoding to Beiping yesterday: Although Baoding only has more than 10,000 defending soldiers, public educators and citizens have been organized, and now one-third of the force can defend the city, while two-thirds of the force can launch attacks. In addition to the citizens who have already completed organization and assisted in the city's defense, more than 1,000 provincial government employees and more than 1,000 students have also formed self-defense forces. Due to the joint efforts of the military and civilians, Baoding City has completed three strong defense lines. The first defense line is the moat, which was originally heavily silted. Now, after four days of efforts by civil servants, the moat has been dredged into a ditch two zhang deep. The second defense line in the suburbs is densely covered with bunkers and machine guns. The third defense line is a battlefield zone. It is rumored that even if the Communist Army has 100,000 troops, it would be quite difficult to attack. Since Baoding was besieged, the provincial political center has invisibly shifted to Beiping. All official documents are handled by the Provincial Government's Beiping Office. Currently, the only Hebei provincial leaders in Baoding are Secretary-General Shi Delin and Director Sun Bang.

### Suspension of UNRRA Aid to China Partially Lifted; Shipments to Resume After US Labor Dispute Resolved

[United Press, Washington, 21st] UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia announced today that the suspension of UNRRA relief supplies to China has been partially lifted. LaGuardia stated: "Chinese ports that can handle relief supplies can now request and receive them." LaGuardia's announcement stated: "The speed of distribution of supplies in Chinese ports has greatly improved... The embargo on supplies to China is hereby lifted, and supplies will be shipped out according to the capacity of the various Chinese ports upon request." LaGuardia said that ships would set sail as soon as the current labor dispute is resolved. He also said that the report on the improvement in the speed of supply distribution in Chinese ports was received from Major General Aagerton, Director of UNRRA's China Office. The announcement was only seventy-three words long and did not explain the detailed plan.

[Our City News] A spokesman for CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) recently commented on the UNRRA Director-General LaGuardia's announcement of the partial lifting of the suspension of supplies to China, stating that this partial lifting was the result of the CNRRA's continuous efforts to clear supplies over the past few months. Considering the current state of CNRRA's supply distribution, UNRRA must immediately fully resume the transportation of supplies to China; otherwise, it may be difficult to coordinate with the CNRRA's future work. It was also stated that since UNRRA announced the suspension order in July of this year, the amount of supplies distributed by the CNRRA to various regions each month has significantly increased. In July, the CNRRA shipped 45,000 tons of supplies to other ports, which increased to 68,000 tons in August and 96,000 tons in September, with a total of 120,000 tons including supplies distributed in Shanghai. The CNRRA's distribution of supplies has been continuously increasing, while UNRRA's transportation has been slow. Taking the most recent week from October 5th to 11th, the CNRRA distributed and shipped a total of 21,958 tons of supplies in and out of Shanghai, while UNRRA only unloaded 14,683 tons in Shanghai during the same week. Currently, there are 115,000 tons of supplies remaining in Shanghai warehouses, of which 65,000 tons need to be processed and modified in Shanghai, so only 5,000 tons of supplies can be transported to other ports for distribution. Adding the 50,000 tons that UNRRA plans to ship to China in the next two months, the total is only 100,000 tons. During the same period, the CNRRA's transportation volume can reach 240,000 tons. I have consulted experts on UNRRA's resumption of transportation, and they all said that even if UNRRA immediately fully resumed transportation, it would take three months to see the effect.

[Our City News] According to China News Agency's East News: Recently, 28 UNRRA giant ships, full of war materials, are sailing to Shanghai and will arrive soon.

### UK Communist Party MP Raises Questions in the House of Commons Regarding UNRRA's Relief Plan for China

[Reuters, London, 21st] Labour MP Williams asked in the House of Commons: "After UNRRA ceases its activities, what will be the plan for relief work in China? Which organization will take over this work? What consideration will be given to UNRRA's experience in China so that past mistakes will not be repeated?" Under-Secretary of State McNeil replied: "UNRRA's plan in China will not be completed on a large scale until the autumn of 1947. In August, the UNRRA conference in Geneva passed a resolution to submit the question of whether various countries still need relief after UNRRA ceases its work to the UN General Assembly for discussion. Therefore, the UN General Assembly should decide how to handle relief work. Before making a decision, it should first examine whether these countries still need external assistance in addition to loans from international banks. This issue is related to the balance of payments of various countries and cannot be accurately estimated in advance, nor is it within the scope of UNRRA's post-war relief. As for UNRRA's experience, it should be provided to any organization undertaking relief work in China. It is said that UNRRA has set up a commissioner to record the activities in China in detail, which will be a very valuable record."

### He Fengshan Reports on Overseas Chinese Affairs: Relief Rice Distributed to Compatriots Who Fled the Dutch East Indies; Overseas Chinese Who Illegally Entered the Philippines Properly Sent Back to China

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to understand the recent situation of our country's protection of overseas Chinese, this reporter specifically visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Director He Fengshan of the Information Department of the Ministry received me and answered the questions as follows:

(Question) It was recently reported that more than 2,000 overseas Chinese fled from the war-torn area of the Dutch East Indies near Panibangan to Gedang Island in British Malaya, and Consul Xu Menghong of our consulate in Kuala Lumpur negotiated relief matters. What is the progress of this matter? (Answer) When Consul Xu learned that the aforementioned refugees had arrived at Gedang Island in his jurisdiction, he immediately requested the local government to issue 600 piculs of low-priced rice for relief. Although the supply of rice in Malaya is currently very difficult, with the assistance of the governor of the province, the welfare department has allocated the full amount for emergency relief. Consul Xu is now trying to transport another 50 tons of rice to Bagan Siapiapi in Sumatra to relieve the refugees there, and is contacting overseas Chinese organizations to launch fundraising for disaster relief.

(Question) It is rumored that dozens of overseas Chinese were arrested by the Philippine authorities for illegally entering the country. What are the details and how has our government handled the situation? (Answer) Recently, more than 60 people from southern Fujian took two steamships from Taiwan to northern Luzon Island and illegally entered the country. They were all arrested by the Philippine military police and escorted to Manila. After we received the report, we immediately asked the Philippine authorities to properly send them back to China. After investigation, it was found that these two groups of travelers were deceived. The owners of the two steamships set up offices in Xiamen and Taiwan, advertising for passengers and claiming to guarantee passage to the Philippines, charging 150,000 yuan per person, resulting in the travelers being deceived and suffering spiritual and financial losses, and affecting the long-standing reputation of our overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Our Ministry has now consulted with relevant agencies to severely punish the operators of the steamships.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] Seventeen hundred overseas Chinese repatriated from Java today submitted a petition to Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi, for forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Mrs. Cripps Flies to Lanzhou Today;盛蓉 and Various Women's Groups Hold Grand Reception

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 21st] Women's groups and representatives of women's schools in the provincial capital held a tea party on the 21st to welcome Mrs. Cripps. More than 100 Chinese and foreign women attended, a rare grand gathering in the women's community. Yang Huilan, the chairman, gave a brief opening speech, followed by a welcome speech by Ms. Hu Yiru, who hoped that Mrs. Cripps' visit would further strengthen the connection between women from both countries, promote friendship, and contribute to world peace. Mrs. Cripps introduced Ms. Miller, Secretary of the United Aid to China Fund, who reported on the organization and work of the United Aid to China Fund and hoped to build a China House in London in the future as a center to promote Sino-British friendship and communication between the two cultures. She then said that although women's rights are developed in the UK, there are no female judges, while China already has a female judge named Li, whom she met in Chongqing, which shows that China's women's rights movement is not lagging behind. (Central News Agency Note: China has more than one female judge.) Subsequently, all the representatives present presented Mrs. Cripps with an autograph book and then had tea and snacks before the meeting adjourned.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd] Mrs. Cripps took a special train to Guanxian at 9:30 this morning to visit the Dujiangyan irrigation project.

### Academia Sinica Council Meeting Discusses Work Guidelines; Passes "Academician" Title and Stipulates Quotas

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The third annual meeting of the second session of the Academia Sinica Council was held in the main hall of the Academia Sinica on the 22nd. Twenty-eight council members including Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Weng Wenhao, Bing Zhi, Hu Shi, and Fu Sinian attended. Chairman Zhu Jiahua presided over the meeting, discussed general work guidelines and the allocation of funds. Wu Youxun, Hu Shi, and Fu Sinian believed that Academia Sinica had not yet achieved the ideal in terms of concentrating talents. Mao Yisheng said: "Academia Sinica itself is a research institution. On the one hand, it should enrich research work, and on the other hand, it should be responsible for guiding the research work of academic institutions across the country." Hu Shi also suggested merging research institutes with similar natures to reduce units, concentrate manpower, and make it easier to show work performance. After the break, the meeting started, and the work reports of the research institutes were reviewed. In order to save time, Fu Sinian, Wu Youxun, Zhu Jingxi, Hu Xianlin, Mao Yisheng, Li Shuhua, and Zhu Kezhen were elected as members of the committee, with Fu Sinian as the convener. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. The meeting started at 3:00 PM to discuss the "Proposal to stipulate the name, establishment, election, and related matters of Menber acadimia sinica." Regarding the naming of Menber of acadima sinica, the council members expressed various opinions. There were various names such as "Academician", "Yuan Ru", "Yuan Lü", "Yuan Zheng", "Yuan Yuan", and "Member." As a result, the name "Academician" was adopted, because among the twenty-two council members present at the time, thirteen expressed their support for the adoption. Another important proposal was: "Please set up the Academia Sinica Academician and revise the organization and tasks of the Council." It was decided that the quota of academicians should be 80 to 100 in the first phase, and at most 10 people should be elected each year thereafter. In the future, the Council will be formed by electing council members from among the academicians. This resolution has been reviewed by the organizing committee consisting of Hu Shi, Fu Sinian, Li Shuhua, Wu Youxun, Sa Bendong, Bing Zhi, and Chen Heng, and Hu Shi was elected as the convener.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The annual meeting of the Academia Sinica Council will hold a group review meeting on the morning of the 23rd. The first group will review the work reports of the various institutes, and the second group will discuss the establishment and election of academicians and related matters. A plenary meeting will be held in the afternoon.

Therefore, they advocated not collecting it.

However, it was resolved that the Provincial Assembly would still request the central government for exemption in the name of the Provincial Assembly.

### 1 Billion Yuan in Agricultural Loans Released in Recovered Areas

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to assist farmers in the recovered areas to quickly resume production, the Four Banks Joint Office formulated the "Implementation Measures for Emergency Relief Agricultural Loans in the Recovered Areas" after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. The national treasury allocated 4 billion yuan to the Farmers Bank of China for loans, with 1 billion yuan each in the first and second phases and 2 billion yuan in the third phase. Later, due to the particularly serious disaster situation in Hunan Province, a special request was made to the national treasury to allocate another 1 billion yuan to the Farmers Bank of China for loans. As of the end of August of this year, the bank had successively loaned a cumulative amount of more than 1.009 billion yuan in the recovered areas of 13 provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. A total of 5,900 social groups borrowed the money, and more than 420,000 farmers borrowed the money, which has been quite effective in providing relief to farmers and restoring agriculture. As for the remaining loan amount, the bank is still continuing to quickly approve and release the loans.

### Restoration Work of the Palace Museum Not Yet Completed

Ma Heng Speaks in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Ma Heng, Director of the National Palace Museum, came to Nanjing to participate in the board meeting of the Palace Museum. The reporter interviewed him and learned that the restoration work of the Palace Museum has not yet been completed. In Beiping, the bronze collection of the German expatriate Yang Ning Shi was received. The oldest items are from the Shang Dynasty, and there are also unearthed items from Anyang, Henan. Before the war, the excavation work in Anyang was the responsibility of the Academia Sinica. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out and Anyang fell into enemy hands, the masses excavated themselves. Occasionally, the items they found were brought to Beiping for sale and were all collected by Yang Ning Shi. Therefore, both the quantity and quality are very impressive. Furthermore, Guo Shiwu, a porcelain collector in Beiping, who was also the designer of the Hongxian Kiln during Yuan Shikai's time, left a will when he passed away, wishing to donate his entire collection to the National Government. At that time, the enemy and puppet forces tried every means to seize it, but Guo's descendants preserved it until now, which was not easy. After the restoration, the Palace Museum received it. The museum has opened special rooms to display these bronzes and porcelains, and they will be open to the public on October 10th. When asked about the relics of Luo Zhenyu of the puppet Manchukuo government, Ma said that Luo had sent his entire collection to the puppet Zhang Chun Museum before his death, and the collection of books was stored in Luo's residence in Lushun. When the Soviet army entered the Northeast, they were all lost, which is a great pity.

### Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense Executes Three Military Criminals; Two are Traitors and One Embezzled Public Property

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense executed two military traitors, Li Ouyi and Dong Xiutian, and Wang Zhongmin, a military officer who embezzled public property. Li Ouyi was originally the Major General Chief of Staff of the Fifth Guerrilla Area Command in Guangdong. In November of the 28th year of the Republic, he responded to the traitor's call to come to Nanjing and successively served as the Education Director of the Guangzhou Branch of the Puppet Central Military Academy, the Lieutenant General Director of the Office of the Puppet Military Commission, and the Puppet Capital Garrison Commander and Police Chief. Dong Xiutian once served as the company commander of the 735th Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the Army. He was captured by the enemy and puppet forces in Suzhou in October of the 27th year of the Republic and served the enemy, successively serving as the captain, battalion commander, adjutant, and regimental commander of the Engineering Team of the First and Second Pacification Area Command of Puppet Zhejiang. Wang Zhongmin was the Colonel Warehouse Director of the 33rd Warehouse of the former Ministry of Military Administration in Suzhou. Between March and April of this year, he took 109 bags of white sugar (each bag weighing 150 catties) stored in the warehouse and sold them to merchant Wang Mingjie through the introduction of Fu Ziben, a captain adjutant of the Suzhou POW Management Office of the Third War Zone, obtaining more than 6 million yuan, which was divided up and spent. The matter was discovered by the former Ministry of Military Administration, which detained Wang Zhongmin and Fu Ziben for questioning. After interrogation, it was found that the above situation was true. Wang Zhongmin was sentenced to death for embezzling public property, and Fu Ziben was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of political rights for helping others embezzle public property.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] A group of 39 Japanese war criminals captured in Qingdao, escorted by Wang Mingzhang, Secretary of the Qingdao Garrison Command, and many military police officers of the 11th Regiment, arrived in Nanjing from Qingdao on the Wanhai ship at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Because the evidence of crimes among this group of war criminals had not yet been fully investigated, the Ministry of National Defense ordered them to be handed over to the Shanghai Military Court for interrogation. Therefore, the group of war criminals was escorted to Shanghai by late train at 11:00 PM on the 22nd. The reporter boarded the ship and saw these 39 demons sharing a cabin, most of them sitting on the floor, dressed in rags. Among them was Lieutenant General Hosokawa Tadayasu, commander of the Shandong Army, who committed many evils in the Qingdao and Jinan areas during our War of Resistance Against Japan. There was also Zhang Zongyuan, a former Lieutenant General of the Puppet Manchukuo Army, who served as the commander of the Japanese "Royal Collaboration Army" and assisted the enemy in abusing people in Shandong. He claimed that he had already become a citizen of our country. When the translator pointed it out to the reporter, the criminal was sitting in a corner of the cabin and greeted the reporter with a fake smile.

Editorial

### Wishing the United Nations General Assembly a Success

The United Nations General Assembly opens in New York today. Political and diplomatic figures from 51 countries around the world are gathering together to begin the arduous task of discussing how to create world peace. The eyes of all mankind are focused on New York, closely watching the development of this international conference. Although most observers still hold pessimistic views about the future of the United Nations General Assembly, the desire of people of all countries for world peace is so urgent today that as long as there is a glimmer of hope, they will feel that there may be a possibility of a sudden breakthrough, and will never express despair. People of all countries still have boundless expectations for the success of the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, the US Undersecretary of State, Acheson, in his speech welcoming representatives from all countries on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, said very frankly and bluntly: "The United States has made supporting the United Nations its consistent foreign policy; and will continue to take this policy bravely forward without the slightest discouragement. The United States government firmly believes that the United Nations will be able to make full progress in the long and difficult journey, and achieve world peace." Although this is just diplomatic rhetoric from an American diplomat, it is enough to increase the confidence of representatives from all countries that the United Nations General Assembly will succeed.

Today, the center of gravity of the world's political situation undoubtedly lies entirely in US-Soviet relations. The key to the success or failure of the United Nations General Assembly also lies here. US Secretary of State Byrnes, who had just returned from Paris, declared when reporting to the people of the country on the proceedings of the 21-nation peace conference: "The most worrying aspect of the current situation is that the tense relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is increasing rather than decreasing, and the United States has reached the end of its concessions to the Soviet Union." However, after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in New York, he gave a speech to the American press, saying: "I believe that sincerity and goodwill will surely lead to mutual understanding; therefore, I also believe that the work that the United Nations General Assembly faces will be completed, and any difficulties can be solved easily. The Soviet delegation will be able to contribute to this United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to be held in early November, so as to complete its work and promote the interests of peace and the welfare of all countries, large and small, in the world." Although this is diplomatic rhetoric, it is enough to make the world's hope for an improvement in US-Soviet relations even stronger. Therefore, on the eve of the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, we saw a peaceful and bright scene in New York, which is really gratifying. We hope that the world situation will be clear from now on, and that the people of the world who yearn for peace will not be disappointed again.

Since we are in this international atmosphere, we should naturally welcome the opening of the United Nations General Assembly with a happy mood, and sincerely wish the United Nations General Assembly a success. However, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, and making a comprehensive analysis of the current international situation, we still feel that the future of the United Nations General Assembly is not to be overestimated, and it still requires the great wisdom and benevolence of politicians from all countries to work hard to overcome all difficulties and open up a broad road to world peace. Based on what we have seen, we would like to offer a word to politicians and diplomats from all countries.

First, when we recall the international situation of the past year and a half, we only see waves rising one after another, and several basic problems have gone around in a big circle and returned to the original starting point, without any solution being obtained. This is really the most discouraging phenomenon after the war. In Europe, it has been a year and a half since Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally and the war ended. In the Far East, it has been more than a year since Japan surrendered. During this period, many political and diplomatic figures have devoted their wisdom and ability to working for peace, but true peace has not yet come to the world. In the international arena, there have been meetings of the five foreign ministers, then meetings of the three foreign ministers, then the United Nations General Assembly, then meetings of the four foreign ministers, then meetings of the four foreign ministers, and now there will be meetings of the four foreign ministers after the United Nations General Assembly. The number of international conferences has created an unprecedented record in human history, but what are the results of these international conferences? Let us make a general clearance. The only achievement is the five peace treaties passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Other important issues could not be resolved by the Foreign Ministers' Conference, so they were transferred to the Paris Peace Conference for processing, but the Paris Peace Conference still failed to reach a solution, and now they have been returned to the Foreign Ministers' Conference for discussion. This cruel fact gives us a valuable lesson: that creating peace is not easy, and that it requires the concerted cooperation of all countries to have a hope of success.

Second, when we study the reasons for the slow progress of peace work, we cannot but attribute it to the fact that the great powers cannot meet each other with sincerity, which leads to mutual suspicion and creates a situation of confrontation between two worlds. In fact, the Soviet Union certainly needs peace and does not want to see war again; the United States also needs peace and hates war. Since the goals of both sides are the same, why can't they cooperate in international conferences? This is obviously due to mutual suspicion between the two sides. There is a common saying in China, "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot meet each other with sincerity, no problem can be solved. On the contrary, if both sides can be open and honest, and there is nothing that cannot be discussed, then any difficulty can be easily solved; as the saying goes, "Where sincerity is, even metal and stone can be opened." Foreign Minister Molotov also made this point in his speech in New York, which makes us believe that representatives from all countries, especially the United States and the Soviet Union, will be able to meet each other with sincerity, abandon all differences of opinion, and reach a completely unanimous agreement in this United Nations General Assembly.

Third, because we hope that the United Nations General Assembly can succeed, we cannot but point out the defects of the United Nations organization. In short, it lacks the spirit of democracy in its organization. The post-war world has entered a new era of peace and democracy, and the present can be regarded as a democratic century. The people of all countries in the world not only demand the democratization of domestic politics, but also demand the democratization of international politics. The politics of power has become a historical relic, and it must not be allowed to revive and reappear on the international stage of the democratic century. If we study the United Nations Charter carefully, we can know that the organization of the United Nations General Assembly, which opens today, has very undemocratic aspects. In its theory, all countries in the United Nations, regardless of size or strength, are equal in law. However, in the Security Council, there is a distinction between permanent member states and non-permanent member states. Furthermore, permanent member states have the special privilege of exercising the veto power over resolutions passed by the Security Council. Any resolution that is approved by all countries cannot be established if one powerful country (permanent member) expresses dissent. What an undemocratic system this is! Therefore, if we want to hope that the United Nations General Assembly can succeed and that it can become the only effective tool for maintaining world peace, then the veto power must be abolished. There has long been a movement to this effect in the United States, and it has been advocated to all countries in the world, and all countries have expressed their approval. The only country that has expressed its opposition is the Soviet Union. Before the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has improved, the Soviet Union holds a dissenting opinion alone. From the perspective of the Soviet Union, it certainly has its reasons; but when all countries meet each other with sincerity and no longer have any fears, the Soviet Union naturally has no reason to insist on maintaining the fatal wound in the United Nations organization.

In short, the problems discussed at this United Nations General Assembly, in addition to the current international disputes, will also discuss various issues that are beneficial to the welfare of mankind. They have a very close relationship to the future of all mankind. Therefore, for the sake of the interests of all countries and for the sake of the future of the world, this meeting is only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail. Let us wish the United Nations General Assembly a success here.

### Bizarre Bleeding Incident in the Waiting Room of the Wuchang Local Court: Yuan Hongsheng's Throat Suddenly Slit Open

[Report from our Hankou Office on the 22nd] A bizarre bleeding incident occurred in the waiting room of the Wuchang Local Court yesterday afternoon. The victim, Yuan Hongsheng, had his throat slit open, and blood gushed out. He immediately fainted. The court has sent someone to send him to the provincial hospital for emergency treatment. He is still in critical condition. According to a post-incident investigation, the victim, Yuan, was being tried in court on suspicion of being a traitor. Later, due to insufficient evidence, he was released on bail. Yesterday afternoon, Yuan invited local Baojia gentry to prove his behavior during the occupation. The court first questioned the Baojia gentry, while Yuan waited alone in the waiting room. There was no one else in the room. When the bailiff returned to summon him, he found Yuan's tragic death. Everyone who heard about it was shocked. A search was conducted in the room, but no murder weapon was left behind, which shows that he was attacked by someone in secret. The court is strictly arresting the murderer.

[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 22nd] The case of the death sentence for a traitor announced by the High Court on the 22nd involved Shi Guanggen, who served as the pseudo-township head of Bupu Township, Chetai County, during the war. During his tenure, he committed all kinds of crimes such as kidnapping and extortion, and had many blood debts. From April to July of the 32nd year of the Republic, he successively arrested Wang Xiaoqin, the principal of a local elementary school, twice, extorting a total of 53,000 yuan. Fearing retaliation, he killed Wang on the evening of July 3 of the same year. After the victory, Wang's family members and other victims reported the case. The Suzhou High Court concluded that although Shi was only a pseudo-township head, his crime was heinous. In addition to the death sentence to uphold the law, all his property was confiscated.

[Report from our Suzhou Office on the 22nd] Lu Qi, a judge of the First Pacification Zone Military Court, arrived in Suzhou from Yu on the morning of the 22nd and went directly to the Suzhou High Court to meet with President Sun for discussions. At 4:00 pm, personnel from the High Court accompanied him to the detention center to interrogate two enemy military police officers from Changshu and Taicang, Lu Shihua and Zheng Fengshi. All personnel were avoided during the interrogation, and the case seemed to be quite serious. The interrogation lasted for more than an hour before it was completed. The reporter later learned that Lu's trip was to collect evidence for the massacre case by the enemy military police officer, Haruki Komura.

### Changyisha Launched Suppression; Another Bandit Leader in Yangcheng District Killed

[Report from our Changshu Office] Changyisha originally belonged to the three counties of Yu, Tong, and Cheng. After the provincial government ordered it to be placed under the jurisdiction of Changshu this time, Tongyi has not yet been handed over. It is reported that the suppression work will not be delayed due to this, and will be implemented quickly. Commander Kong of the Jiangyin Fortress and County Chief Pan here concurrently serve as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. All steps have been arranged. Commander Kong arrived in Yu on the 20th, and Chief of Staff Nie Qi and Military Judge Mao Xueqin of the unit came with him. On the 21st, they went to Changyisha with County Chief Pan and Guo, the captain of the paratrooper battalion stationed there, to inspect and carry out the mission in order to complete it on schedule.

[Report from our Suzhou Office] At about 4:00 pm on the 20th, the Yangcheng District Suppression Headquarters, according to the subordinate 15th platoon of the 3rd Battalion of the Paratrooper Regiment stationed in Xicang Town, Xiyi County, escorted the bandits Qian Xiaodi and Gao Xiaodi and four seized short guns to Suzhou. The reporter happened to be interviewing at the headquarters at the time, and learned the details, which are recorded as follows: At about 10:00 am on the 14th of this month, a case of bandits holding weapons to rob the Suzhou-Ganlu passenger ship occurred in Dongjingqiao. The 6th platoon of paratroopers stationed in Ganlu learned of the incident and immediately set out to search the next day. They also contacted and coordinated with the 15th platoon stationed in Xicang and surrounded them. As expected, bandit traces were found in Xinnan Township, so they rushed to arrest them. However, the bandit leader Li Zaiyang led his troops Mei Baoquan, Gao Jinbao, Qian Xiaodi, Gao Xiaodi, and others to fire their guns and refuse arrest, and a fierce battle broke out. For a time, bullets flew like beads. After a long contact between the two sides, the bandits ran out of ammunition and fled. They were pursued to Tao Fandian Township. The bandit leader Li Zaiyang was shot several times and fell to the ground. He still struggled to jump into the river to escape, but was drowned. The bandit Mei committed suicide with a gun, while the two bandits Qian and Gao were both captured alive. Four short guns were seized at the same time. It was also found that Yao Guilian, the chief of Xinnan Township, was suspected of harboring bandits, and Bao Yunsheng, a villager, was guilty of providing information to the bandits. They were all arrested and sent to the Suzhou Headquarters for interrogation according to law. The reporter also learned that the bandit leader Li Zaiyang was only in his twenties. During the enemy-puppet era, he once turned against the authorities and worked as a secret agent. After the victory, he hid in Shanghai. It is rumored that the robbery case of the Walter & Morsch Bank on the Bund in Shanghai was related to Li. The Shanghai police department searched for him but failed to find him and issued an arrest warrant.

### HaiNing XieQiao Robbery of a Boat

[Report from our Haining Office] Xieqiao Town in this county is located along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and the market is prosperous. On the afternoon of the 19th, Cai, the owner of the Xintong Cloth Shop in the town, hired a boat to go to Haining. Near the Ruyi Bridge, four masked bandits with local accents suddenly ordered the boat to stop. Another person stood on the bridge and illuminated the boat with a flashlight. As the boat approached the shore, they boarded the boat and robbed it. It is estimated that they robbed hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash and several kinds of valuables. After the robbery, they fled west. The police received the report and, because robbery cases often occur in the area, have taken precautions.

The Gambling of Flower Societies is Resurging in the Counties of Taizhou

[Report from our Taizhou Office] The gambling of flower societies has always been prevalent in the counties under the jurisdiction of Taizhou. The Commissioner's Office of the district has previously severely cracked down on it and ordered the county governments and townships to ban it, and the trend has gradually died down. Unexpectedly, recently, gamblers in various counties have resumed setting up flower societies and setting up listening devices everywhere to entice foolish men and women to bet in order to make a profit. They have been found in the villages of Huangyan, Wenling, Linhai, and Xianju. It is hoped that the authorities will strictly prohibit it.

### Second Inspection Committee Arrives in Suzhou to Thoroughly Investigate Corruption in the Reception of Automotive Battalion

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 22nd]  Senator and concurrently member of the Beijing-Suzhou Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Reception and Investigation Team, Wu Cangzhou, recently made a special trip from Beijing to Suzhou and is staying at the Lexiang Hotel.  Our special correspondent in Suzhou visited him on the afternoon of the 22nd to inquire about the mission of this trip.  He said: After returning to Beijing from Suzhou, he received a confidential report alleging that the Second Battalion of the Twenty-fourth Automotive Military Corps stationed in Suzhou had hidden and failed to report enemy and puppet vehicles handed over during the reception process, and instead sold some, loaned out some, and used some for business.  Furthermore, the misappropriation of gasoline by reporting higher quantities than actual was also a blatant and conclusive act of malfeasance.  Therefore, Team Leader Fan Yu dispatched him to Suzhou to thoroughly investigate.  He has already summoned the battalion commander, Jiang Xiaoyi, for questioning, but the latter has avoided meeting him so far. He will conduct the investigation independently, and once the evidence is collected, he will return to Beijing to report and handle the matter according to law.  The reporter inquired about the details and exact amounts involved in this corruption case. Mr. Wu stated that because the investigation is still ongoing, it is difficult to disclose any information at this time.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch]  Senator Zhao Xuefeng of the Third Group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region Reception of Enemy and Puppet Materials Investigation Team stated: The investigation work is now approaching its conclusion, but many cases reported confidentially are being delayed due to excessive involvement. Although the leads in each case are now becoming apparent, they have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In particular, in Bengbu, Anqing, Wuhu, Hefei and other places in Anhui province, there are still several major cases that have not yet come to light. It is necessary to increase work efficiency in order to complete the task as soon as possible. Therefore, it is planned to proceed separately: the central Anhui region will be the responsibility of Ma Jingchang, the southern Anhui region will be the responsibility of Mr. Zhao, and the northern Jiangsu region will be the responsibility of Yang Wenbing. Mr. Ma has already left for central Anhui, and Mr. Zhao will also soon depart for Wuhu.

Hope for Extension of Route 7 Bus

The Route 7 public bus has already been in operation since Double Ten Day. The residents of Hongkou have indeed gained considerable convenience. However, the starting point is at the Wusong Road intersection of Broadway Mansion, and because there is no connection with trams or public buses, we still feel it is somewhat inadequate. Most of us Hongkou residents hope that the Route 7 public bus can be extended further westward along the Suzhou River from Broadway Mansion to Sichuan Road Bridge. This way, after crossing the bridge, there would be access to Route 17 trolleybuses and Route 2 public buses to reach the central district. The transportation authorities would not suffer much loss, or perhaps passenger numbers would increase due to the bus connection, thereby increasing revenue, but we would certainly gain a lot of convenience. We hope that the authorities will reconsider and grant this request. (Cheng Quanlu)

Fruit Vendors Also Need to Live

I am a civil servant. The other day, while passing through the intersection of Simalu and Jiangxi Road, I saw a fruit vendor selling apples and pears there. Suddenly, a vehicle for catching vendors came and took away about seven-tenths of his fruit. The vendor cried and lay on the sidewalk, wishing he were dead! Many people felt sorry for him at that time! I think that those who do small business also seek profit from their capital. Currently, factories are shutting down everywhere, and there are many unemployed people. Even if they start work, they need an introduction. If even small vendors seeking profit from their capital cannot do business, then what are they supposed to do? They also have wives, children, and elderly at home. Are they supposed to watch them starve to death? Therefore, I hope that the enlightened authorities can allow those who do clean small business to temporarily struggle through these hard times, so that they are not deprived of their livelihood! (Chen Wenliang)

Reply to Mr. Lu Liangcai: Regarding your previous letter appealing for improvements in the electricity supply, we have received a reply from the Pudong Electric Power Co., Ltd., stating: "Since the War of Resistance, our company's power generation equipment has been completely dismantled. Currently, the electricity supply is entirely purchased and transferred from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which has recently been severely restricting supply due to insufficient capacity. Therefore, the electricity shortage is becoming increasingly serious. Every evening between 5:30 PM and 9:30 PM, the demand for both lighting and power is increasing. Although our company has already announced to all electricity users that they should cease usage during this time to reduce consumption, customers have failed to strictly comply, leading to a sharp increase in load and frequent faults. The brightness of the lights is inconsistent, and our company's preventative measures are insufficient. We sincerely apologize for this. We have now assigned employees to conduct inspections every evening to improve the situation in the future." We hereby reply.

### UN Opium Committee; Restricts Drug Trafficking

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Mr. May, representative of the United Nations Opium Board, said today that the global anti-drug effort is currently carried out by three bodies: (1) the Advisory Committee on Narcotic Drugs, (2) the Central Opium Board, and (3) the Opium Board's Technical Committee. The latter two organizations will need to be merged in the future. The current work is to determine the amount of opium each country should receive based on statistics and medical needs. If the quantity exceeds the need, the Central Board has the right to request the exporting country to stop transporting to a particular country. Before the war, Japan evaded international control because the Japanese people were encouraged by the government to secretly manufacture heroin and use the drug to traffic into China, undermining the morale of the Chinese people. Germany also had a man-made drug similar to morphine, which was not made from poppy seeds and was difficult to control. The future of international drug control is promising.

### British Naval Commander-in-Chief Speech; Attaches Importance to Defending Sea Communications; Innovate Weapons to Adapt to Modern Warfare

[Reuters, London, 22nd] British Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Cunningham said today at the Trafalgar Day rally that future wars will show that the weapons possessed by warships must have positive reforms. The industrial revolution has made Britain a major manufacturing field for commodities in peacetime and a large arsenal in wartime. However, the continuous production of industry still depends on the constant input of raw materials. If the source of raw materials and food is cut off in a relatively short period, the people of the British Isles will inevitably starve, and industry will inevitably stagnate. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain our sea communication lines. If the communication lines are destroyed, the enemy can defeat Britain without using new weapons such as atomic bombs.

### Foreign Secretary Bevin Attends House of Commons; Explains British Foreign Policy; Agrees that the Saar Region's Economy Should Be Linked to France; Hopes to Establish Lasting Peace with Japan

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 22nd Broadcast London News: The British House of Commons began debating foreign policy issues today. Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to attend and deliver a speech, which will include the following four points: (1) relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, (2) the German issue, (3) the Dardanelles Strait issue, and (4) the negotiations on the British-Egyptian treaty. In addition, the Palestine issue will also be involved.

Another dispatch: Foreign Secretary Bevin said in the House of Commons debate on foreign policy that if we want to avoid new disasters, the world should seek new solutions on a broad basis. He said, "If the United States had also participated in leading the handling of European problems after the First World War, the Second World War could have been avoided." Bevin announced that he had notified the French government and agreed to re-link the Saar region to France economically. French francs can be officially circulated in the Saar to replace German marks, and France can establish a customs union with the Saar. The customs agency should be under the management of the Saar, but France believes that it should be managed solely by France and not under the control of the Berlin Control Commission. The exact terms agreed upon by the British side and whether they contain reservations are not yet known.

Bevin concluded: "The work of dismantling Japan's armaments has been completed. We hope to establish a lasting peace with Japan." Furthermore, the British troops stationed in Indonesia will be officially withdrawn by November 30.

Dardanelles Sovereignty Issue

Bevin then mentioned the Soviet Union's request to Turkey to jointly manage the Dardanelles, saying that this request is essentially an infringement on Turkey's territorial sovereignty.

### The Crux of Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Remains the Sudan Issue

[Reuters, London, 21st] Although Anglo-Egyptian negotiations were held today, neither British Foreign Secretary Bevin nor Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha attended. The Egyptian attendees were Foreign Minister Hafez Ramadan and Ambassador to Britain Amr Pasha. Sidky Pasha has a cold and has been advised by doctors to stay indoors.

[United Press, London, 21st] Egyptian Prime Minister Sidky Pasha came here to revise the Anglo-Egyptian alliance. Today he stated that, so far, his talks with Foreign Secretary Bevin have proceeded smoothly, but government officials say that the negotiations have not come close to resolving the outstanding issues. It is heard that Sidky Pasha reiterated two final positions to Bevin: that British troops must withdraw from Egypt within two years, and that Sudan must be returned to Egyptian rule. Bevin insisted that British troops could not withdraw within three years, and that the future status of Sudan should be decided by the Sudanese people themselves. Therefore, Britain cannot agree to relinquish the current Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. The Sudan issue has always been the biggest obstacle in Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. The Egyptian side anticipates that Sidky Pasha will return to Cairo on the 28th, and his next step may be to submit the Egyptian issue to the United Nations for discussion.

### The Situation in Bombay Remains Tense; Gandhi Says the Muslim League Should Have Strong Control Over Bengal; Nehru, Recovered from His Injuries, Returned to New Delhi Yesterday

[United Press, New Delhi, 22nd] Nehru, the head of the interim government, was injured by Muslims while inspecting the Northwest Frontier Province. After the riots in Calcutta, the situation in Bombay has become even more tense today, with refugees from East Bengal flocking to Calcutta.

[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] Gandhi said here today that the Muslim League has a large number of members in Bengal Province and should have the power to control the province. I am scheduled to go to Bengal next week to inspect and comfort the victims. Gandhi also said, "If British forces can withdraw, the disturbances will end sooner. If British forces continue to exist for a long time, both India and the Muslim League will hope for British power as assistance. I have to admit this point." Gandhi criticized the statement by the new Muslim League cabinet member, Ali, that the Muslim League's participation in the interim government was only to promote the partition of India, saying that this attitude was strange and contradictory. The establishment of the interim government is to deal with general national problems such as hunger, cold, disease, poor transportation, and illiteracy. These problems do not distinguish between Hindus and Muslims.

[United Press, Peshawar, India, 21st] Nehru and his party of four were inspecting the Northwest Frontier Province by car today when they were surrounded by Muslims near the Malakand Fort. The car windows were smashed by stones, and Nehru was injured on his left ear and left cheek. Jafar, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," was injured in the nose. Two British reporters were also slightly injured. Nehru's minor injuries were quickly treated, and he will return to New Delhi tomorrow to handle cabinet affairs.

### Maintain a Tranquil State of Mind, and You Can Live Beyond a Hundred Years

Gandhi Discusses the Secret to Longevity

[United Press, New Delhi, 12th] Mahatma Gandhi, who is already 77 years old, said today that he used to be confident that he could live to 125 years old, but this belief has now been shaken. Recently, friends congratulated him, causing him to eat too much food and lose his previous "tranquility." If one can maintain "tranquility" at all times and be content with oneself, then it is possible to live to 125 years old without illness. Do not be disturbed by anything. Even I myself cannot say that I am completely unaffected by external stimuli.

### "Tokyo Rose" is Innocent

The Federal Bureau of Investigation Will Not Prosecute

[United Press, Los Angeles, 21st] American-born Japanese woman Iva Toguri D'Aquino, born in Los Angeles, studied at the University of California. She returned to Japan in 1941 to visit relatives when the Pacific War broke out and stayed in Japan. During the war, she broadcast under the alias "Tokyo Rose," engaging in propaganda in the South Pacific that was detrimental to the United Nations. She was arrested in Japan after the war. After being interrogated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than a year, it has now been announced that she will not be prosecuted because "Tokyo Rose" is an abstract name, including at least twelve voices, and cannot be held responsible by one person.

### Ho Chi Minh Declares That Vietnam Needs Our Assistance; Agreement on Customs and Gold Between Vietnam and France Determined Not to Hinder the Interests of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Haiphong, 21st] A Central News Agency reporter visited Ho Chi Minh, the chairman of the Vietnamese government who had just returned to Vietnam from France, on the morning of the 21st. Amid the cheers of thousands of people outdoors, Ho Chi Minh spoke to the reporter for ten minutes in a calm manner. Ho Chi Minh first said: This trip to France was to establish a temporary agreement with the French government, with the goal of bringing the relationship between the two countries into normality and promoting cooperation. As for the southern issue, it will be resolved separately. The customs union between Vietnam and the French Federation is determined not to limit the economic interests of overseas Chinese. There is a Chinese saying that "everyone eats together." The Vietnamese government views Chinese business in this way. Finally, Ho Chi Minh said: When he was in France, he told a Central News Agency reporter that Vietnam needs China's help. Today, he is willing to repeat his wishes for China to a Central News Agency reporter in his own country, which is that Vietnam needs China's help and will continue to hold this hope in the future because Vietnam has an inseparable relationship with China.

### Overview of Important Issues at the United Nations General Assembly

[United States Information Service, New York, 21st] The 53 items on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly are mostly issues of striving for a peaceful world and of lasting interest. First, the United Nations General Assembly decided to hold the meeting in London last winter. This decision means that representatives of 51 countries will face various important issues, such as the establishment of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, the Security Council's veto power, and the issues of various member states, etc. United Nations Secretary-General Lie emphasized the importance of the General Assembly's actions in a special United Nations program yesterday, saying that the General Assembly is "an integral part of the United Nations organization's decision-making," and urged all parties to pay attention, saying that the General Assembly can consider all issues within the scope of the United Nations Charter, in addition to the issues already considered by the Security Council. The timetable for considering various issues stipulates that the General Assembly will hold plenary sessions for four days, after which the committees should begin their work, and then hold plenary sessions again to discuss the progress of the committees' work. The opening ceremony on Wednesday and the subsequent plenary sessions will be held at Meadow Park near New York City; the committee meetings will be held at Lake Success, the temporary location of the United Nations. The General Assembly is expected to close in six and a half weeks (or December 7th). During this period, the General Assembly will hold 450 meetings, of which about 30 to 35 will be plenary sessions, 90 will be meetings of major committees, and the remaining meetings will be meetings of other subcommittees. It is expected that 70 percent of the General Assembly's work will be completed at Lake Success. Plenary sessions and committee meetings are scheduled to be held in the mornings and afternoons from Monday to Friday and on Saturday mornings. There will be no meetings on Sundays. The General Assembly has six major committees, also known as plenary committees, because each committee has representatives from 51 countries. The plenary committees are: Political Security, Economic and Financial, Social and Human and Cultural, Trusteeship, Administrative Budget, and Legal Committee. Each committee also has a 14-member steering committee, composed of the chairman, seven vice-chairmen, and the chairmen of the six major committees. One of the most important issues facing the General Assembly is the trusteeship of dependent territories. It is expected that the United Nations Trusteeship Council will be established. To date, France has submitted two agreements regarding French Togoland and French Cameroon in Africa. Britain, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand have also reported plans for trusteeship agreements, while the Union of South Africa has proposed a request to merge the mandated territory of Southwest Africa. The United Nations Charter does not stipulate the number of member states on the Trusteeship Council, but the Council must include the countries administering the trust territories (none of the five major powers are included in this group), plus other necessary temporary member states, so that the number of countries administering trust territories is equal to the number of countries not administering trust territories. The General Assembly will also decide on the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations. If the Security Council's recommendations are followed, the United Nations organization will increase to 54 countries with the addition of Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden; but the Security Council has refused to recommend Albania, South Ireland, the Mongolian People's Republic, Portugal, and Austria, etc. The issue of these countries joining the United Nations may be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. For example, Australia has proposed that the General Assembly should take the first step regarding new member states. One of the early debates at the General Assembly is also expected to be the full report of the Security Council, including the records of the Iran, Greece, Indonesia, Syria and Lebanon, and Franco Spain issues. The General Assembly must also elect non-permanent members of the Security Council for a term of two years to replace the Netherlands, Egypt, and Mexico. Retired member states may not be immediately re-elected. The Economic and Social Council is organized by representatives from 18 countries. This General Assembly should also elect representatives for a term of three years. The retiring representatives are Colombia, Greece, Lebanon, Ukraine, the United States, and Yugoslavia. However, representatives retiring from the Security Council may be re-elected. Several political and security issues also urgently need to be considered by the General Assembly. Australia and Cuba have both raised the issue of the veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Australia has always opposed the veto power and has suggested studying the provisions in the Charter regarding the method of voting in the Security Council. Cuba has proposed two suggestions: one is to convene a General Assembly to abolish the veto power, and the other is to convene a General Assembly to revise the Charter. The General Assembly will also discuss India's appeal and the Soviet Union's proposal that all countries report on the situation of their non-enemy troops stationed abroad. India has filed an appeal, alleging that South Africa is mistreating Indian citizens; the Soviet Union's proposal to report on the situation of stationed troops was rejected by the Security Council. The General Assembly will also consider issues related to the welfare of people's daily lives around the world, including proposals for the reconstruction of destroyed areas in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Far East, and the issue of sending or dealing with displaced persons and refugees. The new International Refugee Organization Charter and its draft budget for the first five years have also been submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. The General Assembly will also receive several reports on the international food situation, including the report of the recent meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organization. The General Assembly will also be invited to approve proposals and take steps to complete the international control of narcotics that was not completed by the former League of Nations. This proposal has rejected the Spanish government's participation in the United Nations narcotics control agency. In addition, the agreements between the United Nations and the following agencies must also be approved by the General Assembly: the International Labor Office, the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Provisional International Civil Aeronautics Organization. The representatives will also consider steps to accelerate the establishment of the World Health Organization and establish an international children's emergency fund. The start of several welfare activities by the United Nations General Administration will also be discussed. The draft declaration on human rights and freedoms submitted by Panama to the first meeting of the General Assembly last winter was limited by time at that time. Action will be taken on it in the future. Finally, the representatives of the General Assembly will consider the finances of the United Nations, and the budgets for 1946 and 1947. This year's budget will be less than 20 million US dollars; the budget for 1947 will increase slightly. The issue of member states sharing the costs of the United Nations will also be discussed.

### Goods Tax Bureau Levies New Taxes on Seven Items Including Cement and Flour

According to Fang Dongtan, Director of the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance: After the bureau was established in Shanghai amidst the destruction caused by the enemy and puppets, a year has passed in the blink of an eye. Although the tax system has been restored to its original state, the preparations and implementation are no different from establishing it from scratch. After repeated reorganizations and improvements, gradual progress has been made, and it is now expected to be brought onto the right track. In total, since the beginning of the year, the amount of tax revenue has been increasing linearly each month. Starting from October, the bureau was ordered to add new taxes on seven items: cement, flour, tea, foil, superstitious paper, beverages, cosmetics, and fur. It should be the bureau's responsibility to increase tax revenue and care for merchants. Although the implementation of various new taxes has not yet reached a full month, the various experiences encountered can be roughly described. For example, tea is currently being promoted for export, so all exported goods are temporarily exempted from taxation to show encouragement. For fur, whether imported from overseas or produced domestically and sold inland, taxes have been paid in accordance with regulations. For goods produced and sold in the city, although merchants have requested a postponement, it has not been approved by the Ministry. The bureau is earnestly urging the Chamber of Commerce to persuade them, and taxes should be levied in accordance with the plan. The other items, such as cement, have also been taxed according to their production and sales situation, either by assigning personnel to be stationed at the factories for collection, or by strictly scrutinizing their transit and circulation to prevent loopholes. The overall goal is to promote the maximum benefit and contribute to the treasury. As for rectifying discipline and encouraging reporting of violations, in addition to publishing public announcements in newspapers, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will supervise it, he said.

### Electricity: The Soul of Shanghai! The Foundation of Shanghai's Prosperity Lies in Industry; Industrial Development Depends on Electricity

The degree of Shanghai's industrialization can be clearly demonstrated by the figures for electricity consumption. The total power generation of the city is 130,000 kilowatts, of which household use accounts for only one-third, and industrial use accounts for two-thirds. Among the industrial electricity consumption, cotton mills consume 42,000 kilowatts, accounting for half of the total. According to Director Zhao Zenggang's estimate, the work efficiency of cotton mills was higher before the war, and the amount of electricity required to produce each bale of yarn was 200 to 250 kilowatt-hours. Now, the efficiency of cotton mills has not fully recovered, and the production of each bale of yarn requires 300 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In addition to cotton mills, various other industries consume one-third of the city's electricity. According to the statistics of the Public Utilities Bureau, the order of electricity consumption for other industries is: (1) weaving industry, (2) flour industry, (3) paper industry, (4) refrigeration industry, (5) rubber industry, (6) machinery industry, (7) wool industry, (8) tobacco industry, (9) silk mills, (10) oil extraction industry. The Public Utilities Bureau has an electricity supply review mechanism to review the needs of each industry for people's livelihood and determine their priority in electricity supply. At present, the need for cotton cloth production is the most urgent, so the amount of electricity used by the cotton mill industry will have to be increased in the future.

Electricity Plants Are Overburdened

Electricity is the mother of industry. The main reason why Shanghai's industrial productivity cannot be brought to its highest level is the lack of electricity. The current electricity plants in Shanghai are already overburdened, which is a sign of illness. Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau explained this situation concretely at a dinner party of the Factory Rehabilitation Association. He said: The service time of the city's electricity plants is the first in the world; in terms of service coefficient, it is above 80 percent. This means that the machines in the power plants are working for more than 80 hours out of 100 hours! Another fact is "overburden." Because the total power generation is 130,000 kilowatts, and the electricity consumption in Shanghai reaches as high as 150,000 kilowatts at two times of the day and night. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict electricity consumption in the future.

Four Ways to Increase Production

As for the future electricity control policy, the Public Utilities Bureau has put forward two slogans: "Save waste and increase production." The plans to cancel neon lights, restrict advertising lights, and reduce household electricity consumption by 30 percent are all based on the principle of saving waste. As for increasing production, the Public Utilities Bureau also has several directions for efforts. The first way is through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). UNRRA has five 2,000-kilowatt generators, and the Bureau hopes that three of them can be used in Shanghai to solve the city's electricity shortage. UNRRA has agreed to leave two, and the Bureau is continuing its efforts. This effort can increase the power by 4,000 to 6,000 kilowatts per month. Secondly, the power generation of the Shanghai Power Company will also increase greatly by next spring. During the enemy and puppet period, the Japanese made efforts to transform it, but the result was damage to the machinery, and the power generation was reduced as a result. After the takeover, the company hired engineers from the United States to thoroughly repair and improve it. It was originally scheduled to be completed in October, but because the repair was thorough, it will not be able to generate electricity until January next year. An important machine was sent to the United States for repair, and it happened to coincide with the major strike in the United States. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, but it must be delayed until February next year before it can be shipped back for power generation. These are all unexpected by the authorities, but it is hoped that it will not fail, because from February next year, the city will be able to obtain 37,000 kilowatts of electricity. The third way is in the Pudong District, where there is a British silk factory that had a 2,000-kilowatt power generation facility before the war. During the war, it was dismantled by the Japanese and moved to a certain place, and it is now being moved back. This factory itself only uses 800 kilowatts of electricity, so after the generator is moved back, there will be surplus electricity to supply the industries in the Pudong District. Fourth, in the Zhabei area, the current power generation is 4,800 kilowatts, and after the machine is repaired, it can be increased to 7,000 kilowatts. Because of these four sources of supply, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau confidently told the factory owners who had returned from the rear that the electricity shortage in the city will improve significantly by next spring.

Warships Help Generate Electricity

One thing can illustrate the Public Utilities Bureau's painstaking efforts on the electricity shortage problem. They are making the greatest efforts and preparing for the worst situation. If the city's electricity shortage reaches a point where there is no solution, the Public Utilities Bureau hopes to borrow electricity from the American warships in the Huangpu River. Their flagship can probably generate more than 4,000 kilowatts, and in addition to its own use, it can have a surplus of 2,000 kilowatts. Of course, this issue is not simple. An American warship supplying electricity to a Chinese city is not something that the commander can decide, and the decision-making power lies with the US Navy Department. In terms of power generation, a large warship is capable of meeting the needs of a city. A naval officer who studied in the United States told me that the power generation of the USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the USS Missouri battleship is several times that of Shanghai's electricity consumption.

Electricity Prices Considered for Increase

From the mouth of the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, it was confirmed the rumors that electricity prices will be increased. He said: The previous electricity price regulations were 50 yuan per degree for small households, 73 yuan per degree for large households, and 84 yuan per degree for industrial use. In fact, this is a losing business. The cost of coal was originally 30,000 yuan per ton, and now it is 80,000 yuan per ton. For cotton mills, the Public Utilities Bureau specifically formulated the "coal-for-electricity" method, which translates to 200 yuan per degree of electricity. The profits from this are used to subsidize the losses of supplying other industries. This is not a sustainable solution. In terms of the raw materials of power plants, coal and diesel are used together. Since the exchange rate adjustment, oil prices have soared, and the cost of electricity has also increased accordingly. The oil used by the Shanghai Power Company is directly shipped from the United States, and the cost is very high. The reason why they have not raised prices immediately is still the result of negotiations by the Public Utilities Bureau. In summary, an increase in electricity prices is necessary; but how much to increase to be reasonable remains to be studied. Objectively speaking, from the perspective of people's welfare, the lower the electricity price, the better; but in today's Shanghai, with electricity prices being too low, there is also a lot of waste among households.

Some industrialists are paying close attention to the coal cost issue. They believe that the reason why Hong Kong's electricity prices are so low today is that local power plants use Annam Hongji coal. They advocate relaxing the standards for coal control and allowing Vietnamese coal to come to China, which will inevitably reduce costs. Another proposal is to explore the potential electricity in the city. For example, the large cotton mills and flour mills now have their own power generation facilities, but because it is cheaper to use public electricity, their own generators are not used. From the perspective of the whole city, this is a considerable loss, especially in today's Shanghai, where one more degree of electricity is equal to one more point of production.

Optimistic About Shanghai's Future

Shanghai is a large industrial and commercial metropolis, and the foundation of Shanghai's prosperity is built on industry. Director Zhao made an optimistic outlook on Shanghai's future. He said that in 25 years, Shanghai will be a world metropolis with 7 million people, not just China's "window." In addition to the existing industrial areas, there should be four new industrial area cities—Zhabei, Nanshi, the city center, and Pudong. A modern port will be built in the Riyuhui Port and Wusongkou area. This beautiful vision of a large industrial metropolis is based on the situation of the Yangtze River Delta; looking even further, it is entrusted to the large-scale Three Gorges hydropower project! Shanghai is the nerve center of China, and "electricity" is the soul of Shanghai!

Now that the city's women's movement work is under the leadership of Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters, I believe that any difficulties can be resolved, which is very comforting to the women's compatriots. I am even more fortunate that the Central Government recently sent Supervisor Fei to Shanghai to guide the city's women's movement work. I hope that the city's women will maintain the spirit of past struggles, and under the leadership of these gentlemen, the city's women's movement will definitely achieve great results.

Committee Member Lu's Speech

Hoping for Women's Unity

Then, Committee Member Lu gave a speech, roughly saying: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Shanghai sisters who have been separated for 18 years. As the national construction work is underway today, I would like to offer four points to all sisters: (1) participate in politics, (2) pay attention to education, (3) increase production, and (4) strive for self-reliance. Finally, I hope that the women of Shanghai will be sincerely united, because only with unity can there be strength, and only with strength can the Shanghai women's movement work be carried out smoothly. Following that, Supervisor Fei gave a speech, roughly outlining the history of the Chinese women's movement over the past 30 years. Upon review, it has achieved great success on the political front, and we should make even greater efforts to strengthen our strength, so that oppressed women can be liberated, and people who are not free can become free. We should strive to engage in production, increase self-education, and improve the education of female workers' children.

Committee Member Fang's Speech

Let the Women's Movement Unleash Its Power

Following that, Committee Member Fang gave a speech, roughly saying: The women's movement is the most important of all social movements. In the future, when the country is successfully built, our women's movement work must unleash its greatest power. I hope that the middle-level female comrades will unite and strive for liberation, and I hope that they will come up with correct ideas to influence their husbands. Only with correct ideas can there be a correct path. Following that, Secretary Xie gave a speech, roughly saying: Respect for women is a characteristic of civilized and progressive countries. China is progressive, and the women's movement should be professionalized and politicized in the future. We must have freedom, democracy, and strive to develop our careers. Finally, Chairman Qian Jianqiu gave a thank-you speech, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 5:00 PM before dispersing.

### Thorough Investigation of the Forcible Occupation of Housing; Special Commissioner Tang Departed Shanghai Yesterday to Return to Nanjing to Execute His Duties; Completion Expected by the End of the Month

General Tang Enbo, acting Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Garrison Commander of Nanjing and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th, having received instructions from the Chairman to thoroughly investigate the forcible occupation of housing by personnel of the Party, government, and military, and to provide guidance for the city's winter defense conference. It is now learned that Tang's mission has been completed, and he has already left Shanghai by train to return to Nanjing. Tang is reportedly satisfied with the results of this investigation and greatly commends the hard work of the personnel involved. Before his departure, Tang stated that as of now, the Garrison Headquarters has received a total of 1,327 written requests for the eviction of military personnel occupying houses. However, according to the investigation, formal cases of military occupation account for only one-quarter of these, and all have been evicted after execution. The nature and handling methods of these 1,327 cases are as follows: (1) 143 cases belong to enemy property occupied by military and civilians. These houses, because they are enemy property, have been forwarded to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. (2) 145 cases belong to civilian housing occupied by government agencies, Party, and troops, and letters have been sent to the respective agencies and troops to handle them legally, with copies sent to the municipal government and the Ministry of National Defense for record. (3) 205 cases involve occupation by Party and government personnel and civilians. As there is no military status involved, the cases have been referred to the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government for handling. (4) 415 cases involve military occupation, and all have been executed with orders to evacuate. (5) 419 cases involve rental disputes, and the parties involved have been instructed to apply directly to the court or the Housing Rental Management Committee for mediation. The above execution work has been ordered to be completed by the 25th of this month. As for the occupation cases still under investigation by the Garrison Headquarters, there are still more than 150 cases, of which more than 130 can be executed immediately, and the entire work is expected to be completed by the end of the month. Furthermore, Tang gave detailed instructions regarding public safety and winter defense in the city, and it is said that he may return to Shanghai again within days after returning to Nanjing this time.

### Soviet Bishop Suspected of Espionage; Military Tribunal Holds First Preliminary Hearing; Soviet Consul's Request for Bail Denied; Reports of Ill-Treatment Absolutely Untrue

Viktor, a Soviet-籍 Greek Orthodox bishop, was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on the 19th on suspicion of espionage. The Soviet Consul in Shanghai, Harin, once went to the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai to request bail, but it was not granted because the matter was of great importance.

On the morning of the 21st, he was transferred from the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters to the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone. At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Procuratorate at Tilanqiao opened the court for preliminary hearing. Viktor wore a light blue cloth suit with a black religious robe over it. Ten minutes before the hearing, the Soviet Ambassador to Shanghai, Harin, waited at the High Procuratorate and wanted to talk to Viktor when he walked out of the prison, but he was unsuccessful. The hearing lasted for one and a half hours, and the content was not disclosed. It is reported that the hearing only inquired about Viktor's background and wartime whereabouts, and the hearing will continue today. He is currently detained in Tilanqiao Prison.

It is reported that the reason for Viktor's arrest this time is that he was used by the Japanese invaders during the war to organize a cavalry team to sabotage China's sacred resistance and engage in espionage for the enemy. He once received the Grand Cordon of the Rising Sun from the Japanese Emperor, and there are photos to prove his assumption of a puppet position. These documents were sent to the Military Tribunal by the Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning. If the investigation confirms the evidence, a public prosecution will be filed for war crimes; otherwise, he should be released. As for the rumors that Viktor is being ill-treated in prison, they are absolutely untrue.

The Soviet expatriates in this city are now actively launching a signature rescue campaign. It is reported that hundreds of people have signed up and will launch petitions and marches to our authorities. As for the Soviet Consulate, it is now making representations to our highest authorities, requesting bail.

### He Yuxiang Martyred for the Nation; Re-examination of an Old Incident Six Years Ago; Trial of the Case of the White Russian Mercenary of the Former Shanghai Volunteer Corps Shooting and Killing Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion Concluded; Squad Leader Testifies to Witnessing the Shooting; Lawyer Argues that the Killing Cannot be Proven

[By Our Correspondent] The court reopened the case of the White Russian mercenary shooting and killing soldiers of the Isolated Battalion at the district court yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m.. Ivanoff (former major and commander of the White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps) and Shi Hongmo, former sergeant squad leader of the Fourth Regiment Isolated Battalion, were brought to testify. After Judge Wu Ronglin, Prosecutor Fang Zheng, and Clerk Xie Yinsheng took their seats, they first asked the defendant, Mitchiakov, how many sentry posts there were next to the Isolated Battalion barracks in September 1940. Mitchiakov answered: There were only seven posts during peacetime, but because the situation was tense at the time, it was increased to thirteen posts. On the day of the incident, Rashidov, from the seventh sentry post, also fired a shot. It is not known who fired the shot that killed He Yuxiang.

White Russian Commander Presents Logbook

The presiding judge then questioned the witness Ivanoff. According to his statement, there were a total of 320 White Russian troops guarding the Isolated Battalion barracks at that time. On September 18, 1940, he was not present at the scene, and he was not in charge of the White Russian unit at that time. After the incident, he only learned from the report that Mitchiakov fired one shot at 12:45 p.m., and 30 seconds later, Rashidov from the seventh sentry post also fired one shot, and the directions were the same. Ivanoff also presented the White Russian unit's "Daily Logbook" to the court as evidence for reference.

A Loud Bang, He Fell to the Ground

Shi Hongmo, the squad leader from the Isolated Battalion, gave a very detailed account of the case, saying: Four days before the incident, an unfortunate event had already occurred. The White Russians used tear gas and water from the water pipes to attack the Isolated Battalion. The Isolated Battalion was unarmed, and five brothers were killed or injured. The names of each person cannot be remembered due to the passage of time. The day of the incident was "September 18th." Early in the morning, people came to the Isolated Battalion barracks to offer condolences, but because the White Russian unit had sealed it off, they could not enter. By 11 o'clock, more and more people had gathered. He (Shi Hongmo referring to himself) was ordered by Regiment Commander Xie to go to the gate to see what was happening, and he stood shoulder to shoulder with the victim He Yuxiang on a long bench, peering out of the wall. The defendant Mitchiakov, who was at the first sentry post, raised his gun and aimed three times. The first two times he did not fire, and the third time he aimed for about a minute. With a loud bang, He Yuxiang fell to the ground. The bullet penetrated He Yuxiang's head and then injured another soldier, Gao Guangyun, in the leg. Because Gao was standing on the wooden washstand behind He Yuxiang, in a very high position, He Yuxiang's death was caused by Mitchiakov's bullet. Although the seventh sentry post also fired a shot, it did not injure anyone. Judge Wu, based on the witness's statement, questioned Mitchiakov again; Mitchiakov denied aiming three times, and said that it was impossible for one shot to injure two people. After the witness made an affirmation, the presiding judge announced the start of the debate. First, the prosecutor stood up and said; The facts of Mitchiakov shooting and killing He Yuxiang have been proven by witnesses, and Mitchiakov has also admitted to firing the shot, so he should be charged with murder.

Lawyer Explains the Circumstances at the Time

Liu Jiangang, the defense lawyer for the defendant, stood up and first explained the circumstances at the time, saying that the Japanese army was showing off its power in the suburbs of Shanghai and repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Concession to take over the Isolated Battalion. The Municipal Council sent the White Russian unit to guard the Isolated Battalion barracks, which was nominally to guard them, but in reality, it was to protect them secretly. He had asked Frankling, the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Council at the time, who told him: On September 14 of that year, because the Isolated Battalion raised the national flag without permission, the British garrison ordered them to lower the flag in three hours. The Isolated Battalion did not comply, and the White Russian unit was ordered to release tear gas and spray water to disperse the Isolated Battalion and lower the national flag, which caused a serious incident and a tense atmosphere. On the day of "September 18th," crowds gathered around the Isolated Battalion barracks, especially around Mitchiakov's first sentry post. Mitchiakov was inevitably panicked under the siege. Six years ago, Mitchiakov was not yet twenty years old, and was in fact an underage child. He had asked Ivanoff why, if the situation was so tense at the time, more sentries were not sent to protect them, but instead an underage child was assigned this important task? Now, although the defendant admits to firing the shot, it cannot be proven that he was the murderer. There are two points to note in this case: (1) The death of He Yuxiang was not thoroughly investigated at the time because Regiment Commander Xie of the Isolated Battalion did not allow the White Russians to enter the barracks. At the same time, Mitchiakov was not the only one who fired the shot. Six years later, it is even more impossible to prove whose bullet killed He Yuxiang. Since the foundation of the crime has not been determined, how can a conviction be made? (2) The act itself: Mitchiakov was surrounded by the crowd on the outside, and the Isolated Battalion responded on the inside, so the situation was very serious. According to the Isolated Battalion barracks guard order, sentries may fire their weapons when threatened or in danger of being disarmed. The defendant, a White Russian, was not well educated and probably did not understand the law very clearly, and this order was issued by the British garrison. The enlistment form of the White Russian unit also stated that they would abide by the rules of the British army, so should the defendant be held legally responsible for firing the shot? He asked the court to decide and requested that the defendant be acquitted or given the lightest possible punishment. At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for 2 p.m. on the 28th, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### Original Verdict Against Yuan Ludeng Revoked; Supreme Court Has Returned It for Retrial

[By Our Correspondent] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders of Shanghai," was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai High Court on charges of being a traitor. It is now learned that the Supreme Court has revoked the original judgment in the case and returned it for retrial.

### The Inside Story of Shanghai Pickpocket Gangs (3)

— Huang Jiamo

Hats in Hand, Gone Without a Trace

"Catching turtles" means snatching hats, especially expensive Western-style felt hats. The Shanghainese commonly call it "throwing the top palace," which has almost become a well-known term, but those in the profession have given up using it. Brothers who are skilled at snatching hats, especially those who are "hard pickpockets," always work in groups of two or three, lingering at tram and bus stops. They first identify the hats worn by passengers near the windows. As soon as the vehicle starts, they snatch them away along the windows. The owner is unable to get off the vehicle immediately, and the carriages are often packed like sardines. By the time the passenger gets off the vehicle, the pickpocket is already gone without a trace. When rickshaws and pedicabs are speeding along, the felt hats of the passengers on those vehicles are also good targets. The pickpocket only needs to reach out an arm like a monkey and snatch the hat. Then, they run wildly in the opposite direction and hand it over to an accomplice. Even if police officers chase after them, they often lose track of them. This kind of "pickpocket gang" also often "catches turtles" on the railway platforms of the two railway bureaus. In recent years, the railway police have been more vigilant, and these people are rarely seen on the platforms.

The "hard pickpocket gang" groups are all controlled by the "uncle gang." The time and location are all predetermined, and outsiders are not allowed to intrude and "steal their business."

They set the time for action in the early morning, at noon, and at dusk. This is because the early morning is when city residents gather at the stations, and noon and evening are when pedestrians are crowded on the streets, which are all conducive to escaping after the act. The locations they choose are all where there are many side streets or alleys. One of the skilled members of the group carries out the snatching and immediately runs away. At this time, the owner will definitely chase and shout after them. Then, accomplices pretend to be unrelated passersby, stop the owner and pretend to ask questions, in order to delay the owner's time and prevent pursuers who see injustice. With this strategy, they improvise according to the situation, allowing the accomplice who snatched the item to escape from the dangerous situation through the side streets and alleys. These accomplices are called "wind blockers."

Sneaky and Cunning, Many Tricks

"Literary tasks" are the second type of "eating bad rice." Unlike the forceful grabbing of the "hard pickpocket" gangs, they engage in sneaky "petty theft." Because their behavior is more refined, it is called "literary tasks." The categories of their activities and the ways they perform are as follows:

(1) "Flipping over the head" - This gang always uses thick ropes or wooden ladders to climb over other people's walls or roofs, enter the house, and then act.

(2) "Prying open the fan" - They use small iron crowbars to pry open doors and enter to steal.

(3) "Running early cleaning" - Most residential houses open their doors in the early morning to empty chamber pots or sweep. Petty thieves take the opportunity to sneak in and steal whatever they can get their hands on.

(4) "Running to the lamp head" - Also known as "crow head." In the evening dusk, residents often leave their back doors ajar, and petty thieves take the opportunity to sneak in and act.

(5) "Going to the sky table" - Residents often hang clothes to dry on the drying platform every day, or sun them in the courtyard, and they are mostly unattended. Petty thieves use long bamboo poles to take the clothes down. Whether they are wet or dry, they sweep them all away and flee.

(6) "Cutting checks" - If a house has its doors locked, it shows that no one is inside. If petty thieves have previously learned that the family is wealthy, they take advantage of the lack of preparation to break the lock and enter the house and steal at their leisure.

(7) "Running the kiln" - This gang of thieves does not specify a time, and their activities are very free. They steal whatever they can get and leave. No matter when, they take advantage of the opportunity to enter. Moreover, they must have the ability to distinguish. They will not take things that are not valuable. For example, when entering a wealthy family, they pay attention to antiques, paintings, clocks, screens, tripods, and other items in the hall.

(8) "Opening the peach blossom spring" - Digging holes in the wall to steal things, also known as "opening the kiln mouth."

(9) "Going up the bolt" - That is, window-prying thieves.

(10) "Going down the bolt" - That is, door-prying thieves.

(11) "Breaking into the kiln" - Using the excuse of asking for directions, they sneak into people's homes to steal.

### "Hardware King" Trial Concluded; Awaiting Sentencing; Zhang Lianfang's Speech of "Grand Principles" Brings Tears to Family Members

[By Our Correspondent] Zhang Shufang, known as the "Hardware King" of Shanghai, was arrested after the victory on charges of being a traitor. After the High Procuratorate concluded its investigation, it filed a public prosecution, listing three charges: (1) serving as the chairman of the puppet Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, (2) serving as the director of the joint office of the puppet Hardware, Steel, and Copper Bar Industries, and (3) serving as the chief of the sixth bao of the second lianbao in the puppet Huangpu District, having engaged in activities such as requisitioning iron for the enemy. The High Court held several court sessions to investigate the case, and the debate court concluded yesterday afternoon, with the sentencing scheduled for the 29th of this month.

Zhang testified in court yesterday that he had resigned from the position of chairman of the association more than 20 times, but all were unsuccessful due to the "support and retention" of the industry. This was purely for the "benefit" of the industry and did not harm the country. As for the Pacific War that broke out on December 8, 1941, the Japanese took planned action and sealed up all the warehouses of the four industries of hardware, copper bars, copper-tin, and steel in the city, ordering that the inventory be registered. Under the circumstances at the time, it was impossible to resist, so a joint office was organized to deal with it. The office only had one secretary and one tea boy, and there were no titles such as committee members or directors. It was only a place for daily gatherings of various industries to seek to rescue materials and protect industry and commerce, in order to preserve a little vitality for the country. After the hardware office was established, it did not provide the enemy with hardware, nor did it plunder for the enemy. Because the industries had already registered their inventory with the enemy, they took as much as they wanted. As a result, the enemy navy took 1,200 tons, and the enemy army took 700 tons, totaling about 2,000 tons. This matter did not go through the joint office, but was done individually by each industry. As for serving as the puppet bao chief, he was forced to take on the position because he had a little status in Shanghai. In 1944, the enemy puppets launched a city-wide baojia iron donation campaign. When the bao chief's conference was convened, he did not attend. As a result, the lianbao chief ordered the bao chiefs to forward the order to the jia chiefs, who then forwarded it to each household, and the households sent the iron directly to the puppet police station, without going through the bao chief's office. Under the circumstances at the time, the citizens were also forced to do so. He was purely a businessman and had no intention of being an enemy. At the beginning of the war of resistance, because he was forced to join the puppet organization by No. 76, he once fled to Hong Kong. Later, he returned to Shanghai at the firm invitation of the industry to maintain the association. Later, he secretly transported materials to the mainland and was discovered by the enemy, and he was captured and tortured. At that time, he only hoped for the day when the sun would shine again, but now he has been detained for more than a year on charges of being a traitor. He is truly extremely wronged. If he willingly surrendered to the enemy, he can be severely punished; otherwise, please consider the facts and acquit him. At this point, his family members who were listening in the audience were already weeping. After the trial, the defendant was still escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

### Shen Fenggang Persistently Prevaricates

Shen Fenggang, a key member of the puppet government's secret service, who successively served as the director of the third department of the puppet secret service headquarters and the captain of the first special task force, and the director of the puppet Jiangsu Province Qingxiang inspection, has been accused of killing many underground comrades. The High Court has held several court sessions to investigate, and he was interrogated again yesterday morning. Shen still did not admit to any of the crimes listed in the indictment. The court adjourned the session and will interrogate him again later.

### Li Zuyu and Wang Hongding Scheduled to be Sentenced on the 29th

The case of Li Zuyu, who successively served as the vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Industry, a political advisor of the puppet National Government, and the director of the planning department of the puppet Trade Control Commission, was concluded yesterday morning, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on the 29th of this month. In addition, the case of the puppet bao chief Wang Hongding is also scheduled to be sentenced on the 29th.

### Li Xibo's Sentence Changed to Two and a Half Years; Feng Guanfu Declared Not Guilty

[By Our Correspondent] Li Xibo, the deputy director of the Special High Branch of the puppet Shanghai Taishan Police Sub-bureau, was previously sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court. After appealing to the Supreme Court, it was returned for retrial. Yesterday, the sentence was changed to two years and six months with a concurrent sentence. In addition, Feng Guanfu, who served as a driver and translator at the enemy's Gongda Yarn Factory, was accused of collaborating with the enemy. After the High Court concluded its trial, it was found that he had not committed any crimes, and the defendant was acquitted yesterday.

### Reports of Reinstating the Curfew Are Inaccurate

[By Our Correspondent] Yesterday, newspapers reported that the military authorities' winter defense and security conference resolved that the city's curfew would be reinstated starting on the first of next month. However, according to reporters' interviews with responsible persons at the police station, the news is definitely inaccurate. The Garrison Headquarters has not yet considered this matter.

Answers to Readers' Legal Inquiries

### Forged Lost Receipt

Yiming asks if I have a few legal questions and I hope you can give a detailed answer: In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, someone named Jia mortgaged two parts of his land to my late father through Yi as an intermediary. After the fall of my hometown in the 29th year, Yi used his evil influence to buy it from Jia. I was not notified at the time (Jia is now deceased). After the victory, I entrusted someone to negotiate with Yi, and Yi colluded with my stepmother to forge a lost receipt, stating that when Jia previously mortgaged the land to my late father, the loan receipt had been lost and the money had been repaid. This lost receipt is the proof, and the lost receipt is stamped with my late father's seal. Now there are several questions, please provide answers. (1) The original intermediary and the buyer were both arranged by Yi, and I was not notified. Can this be denied? (2) Jia is deceased. Can his property be considered my property and can I apply for land registration? (3) Can I sue in court for forging my late father's lost receipt? (4) Can the public announcement of the invalidity of my late father's seal in the newspaper invalidate the lost receipt at the same time?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) No. Because after the owner of real estate establishes a mortgage right, he can transfer the real estate to others, and there is no provision that the intermediary for establishing the mortgage right cannot be the buyer. (2) No. Because the direct transfer of ownership of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee is not permitted by law. (3) If it is indeed forged, you can sue for the crime of forging documents. (4) Announcing its invalidity in the newspaper cannot invalidate a note that was valid before that announcement.

(2) Returning Mortgaged Land

Ren Chengfu asks if my grandfather mortgaged a piece of land with a living contract in the 3rd year of the Republic of China for 60 silver dollars, and built a house on it. The contract clearly stated that the term was five years, and the land could be redeemed upon the expiry of that term. After five years, he added 35 silver dollars and wrote another contract, stating that the entire amount must be returned at the time of redemption, and nothing should be shortchanged. In the 13th year, he borrowed 10 silver dollars with an interest rate of 3% per month. During the Incident, the house was burned down by the enemy. Until the enemy surrendered, I still wanted to build a house on the land, but the mortgagee intended to redeem it. Although I勉强 build the house now, future disputes are inevitable. In legal terms, can the property be redeemed at his will? Please answer in your column.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] According to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 2558, Clause 7, "For pledges established before the implementation of the Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Pledges, if a term has been set, regardless of whether the term has been extended by contract, it may be redeemed within two years after the pledge has been fulfilled for 30 years." The Regulations for Clearing Real Estate Pledges were implemented in the 4th year of the Republic of China, and the pledge in this case was established in the 3rd year of the Republic of China, so it can be handled according to the above interpretation. As for the statutory period for redeeming pledged items, if it cannot be observed due to war, it can still be redeemed within two years after the implementation of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery, as expressly stipulated in Article 7 of the same regulations. Therefore, in legal terms, the pledged item in this case can still be redeemed.

### Wool Yarn Evaluation: Cost Standards Investigated by Subcommittee, Divided into Three Grades, Fine Yarn to Be Determined Separately; Future Delivery Limited to Industry Association Members

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wool Yarn Review Committee established by the Bureau of Social Affairs held its second meeting yesterday afternoon at 10 o'clock. Representatives from the Wool Yarn Industry Association and the Commercial Association, including Chen Qien and Shen Laizhou, as well as representatives from the Bee Factory and Ewo Factory, and others, attended. Representatives from the Municipal Council and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also attended. Director Gu Bingyuan served as the chairman. First, the Industry Association reported on cost calculations, and the Commercial Association reported on recent market conditions. It was found that the market price of wool yarn has fallen by 20% to 30% in the past ten days. Based on the current market price of raw wool and factory payments, it seems to be falling smoothly, which is cause for celebration. However, since the responsibility lies in reviewing standard prices, continued efforts are still required. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to investigate actual costs, with representatives appointed by the Bureau, the Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to be used as a basis. The standard market price of wool yarn is proposed to be divided into three grades for evaluation. The first grade is made from 56 counts or higher, such as Bee, 변猫, Hero, Wind, and Earth brands. The second grade is made from counts below 56, such as Golden Dog and Beauty brands. The third grade is made from counts below 48, such as Scholar and Little Girl brands. The cost investigation will target these grades. However, these three grades are all four-ply coarse yarn. The fine yarn will be priced separately, rising and falling accordingly. Regarding the sale of imported raw wool and yarn to the trade, it should be limited to the wool yarn industry. Those engaged in wool yarn in the market should join the Industry Association. The Industry Association representatives strongly advocated these points, and the principles were approved. It was also decided that future deliveries of wool yarn from factories must be limited to members of the Industry Association to avoid disruption by outsiders.

### Muslin Transactions Listless; China Merchants Evaluation and Apportionment to Be Replicated; Industry Hopes Joint Allocation Will Continue

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 2:30 PM yesterday, Li Shengbo, Deputy Director of the Textile Industry Management Committee, specially convened a discussion meeting at the site of the Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association, inviting key directors of the association to discuss reasonable evaluations and the apportionment of national and private yarn mills in the future distribution of cotton yarn. After three hours of discussion, it was said that it was limited to an exchange of views and no concrete decisions were reached.

According to a certain authority in the local dyeing and weaving industry: The current joint allocation of cotton yarn must continue uninterrupted. All factories should seek solutions in a sincere and open manner regarding the joint allocation policy in order to be effective.

Yesterday, the yarn market softened slightly, and customer sales remained sluggish. Fabric factories also stopped operations due to the sluggish sales of woven products. At the same time, major yarn mills secretly sold off yarn, which led to price fatigue. However, people's hearts were still stable and would not fall sharply. The market was stable yesterday, and customer groups such as the Hankou and Nanjing groups made some transactions, but the appetite was very small. The opening price of Fangjian was newly adjusted, with Blue Chicken at 77,000 yuan, while Xinyang Crane remained at 77,000 yuan. Very few local firms applied. Dyeing factories purchased some yarn due to active sales, but the amount was not large. If the yarn price can be suppressed, the fabric market still looks soft.

### No Regulations on Price or Quantity for Fangjian Buying New Cotton

In order to enrich textile raw materials and maintain the increase in national cotton production, the Textile Company has now decided to start buying as much as possible as new cotton enters the market in various places. The company has ordered offices in various places to start buying, but it does not adopt a price limit system, but determines a reasonable price based on the cost in the producing area. The quantity of purchases is also not regulated. The purchasing areas include Shantou, Xi'an, and Nantong. The newly established Zhengzhou office is also a purchasing area. However, in the areas where the company purchases, all private yarn mills can freely purchase and are not restricted.

### Cotton Bills of Exchange Can Be Used as Collateral

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 22nd] The method of remitting money for cotton transported from producing areas to cotton-using areas this year was previously approved by the Four Joint Treasury with five-price principles. It is now heard that the Treasury is now formulating three supplementary measures: (1) After September 20, the cotton purchased by various factories from producing areas may be applied for as collateral after arriving at the factory site, in accordance with the original principles, for a maximum period not exceeding 45 days; (2) Cotton originally purchased and stored by various factories may not be applied for as collateral; (3) When applying for collateral, various factories should provide the original bills of exchange or equivalent documents for verification, in order to assist in the production and sales of cotton and prevent the弊病 of promoting hoarding during the transportation and sales of cotton. The above measures have recently been telegraphed by the Four Joint Treasury to various general departments and bureaus for compliance, and telegraphed to various branch offices to notify local departments and bureaus to handle the matter.

### Diamond Demand Strongest in China and India

[Reuters London, 21st] The demand for diamonds is very strong in some countries, especially in China and India, because of domestic instability. The purchase of diamonds is still the easiest way to maintain value. Although the price of gemstones is cheaper, it does not affect the market price of rough diamonds. The demand from all parties far exceeds the possible supply. For the needs of the United States and the world as a whole, demand exceeds supply by at least three to one.

### Government Bonds Hover, Foreign Firms Willing to Hold

Government bonds broke the 2,000 yuan mark yesterday, but because foreign firms were willing to hold them, the situation was still hovering. The National C opened at 2,070 yuan yesterday morning, once falling to 1,990 yuan. Before long, foreign firms came in with more than one million yuan, and finally struggled around 2,050 yuan, similar to the previous close. Jia and Yi bonds fell 30 yuan each, and National E bonds rose slightly by 20 yuan. The transaction volume was about 6 million yuan face value.

### Amid Controls: Yarn Factories Hope For Flower Allocation, Uninterrupted Electricity, and No Rigid Price Limits

Mayor Wu, Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, decided the day before yesterday to temporarily allocate 10,529 bales of yarn. The prices and dates will be determined separately. According to the opinions of the yarn factories, it is difficult to achieve fairness and rationality when materials are scarce. The yarn factories, although seemingly prosperous on the outside, are actually just empty shells. For example, the current price limit is 1.55 million yuan per piece. The cost of three loads of cotton is about 1 million yuan, plus electricity, interest, and various expenses, which exceeds the price limit. There was a period when it was slightly better than other industries, but the current situation is extremely difficult. For example, in terms of electricity, not to mention whether there is enough electricity. In terms of electricity prices, one kilowatt-hour of electricity was originally 84 yuan, but since coal was exchanged for electricity, each ton of coal costs 120,000 yuan. In effect, each kilowatt-hour of electricity has risen to 200 yuan. In terms of productivity, in the past, there were two shifts of 12 hours each day. Now there is one shift of 10 hours, with 20 hours a day. In the past, there were six work days in a week. Now there are seven work days, and sometimes there are rotating power outages. Even if the factories want to increase production, they are limited by various facts. Currently, what the yarn factories hope to solve is: (1) Implement flower allocation, the government should try its best to supply cotton raw materials to reduce costs; (2) Supply electricity, the current methods of rotating power outages and sudden power cuts affect the increase in production; (3) Implement evaluation, not rigid price limits.

### American Cotton Fluctuates Greatly

[Reuters New York, 21st] The New York cotton market opened actively, with large fluctuations. At one point, sales were heavy and a limit-down was declared. Later, due to purchases by the industry, prices rose again after falling. Fluctuations were seen throughout the afternoon. The total transaction volume for the day exceeded 600,000 bales. According to the New York Cotton Exchange, as of the end of September, the total amount of various types of cotton stored in the United States was 13,667,000 bales, of which one million bales held by the government have been designated for various projects.

### Gold and Banknotes Firm

The black market gradually firmed, opening at 2.21 million in the morning. The upper market was extremely stable, hovering around 2.21 million. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 130 strips at a price of 2.21 million. There was little change at this time. Later, customer sales were slightly brisk, and credit was loosened. The buying was slightly stronger, and at noon it rose to above 2.23 million. In the afternoon, the spot market was firm and then flat. As a result, it rose 15,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Ornaments, silver dollars, and silver coins remained unchanged. The dark money market was slightly looser, with interest rates from 1.5 to 1.7.

Foreign currencies were calm. The retail price of US dollars was still 3,500 yuan for buying. There was no income, and transactions were still difficult to open. In the black market, it was about 4,050 yuan to 4,150 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to 4,100 yuan to 4,200 yuan, the same as the previous close.

### Banks Should Pay Even If Draft Stub Is Not Received

It is a common practice in Chinese banks that when a remitter remits money from a bank in place A to place B, they hold a demand draft issued by the bank in place A and send it to the payee: when the payee withdraws money from a bank in place B, the bank in place B will usually compare the draft with its stub or counterfoil and only allow payment if they match. If it is a clean draft, the stub will not be compared. However, the Law of Negotiable Instruments does not stipulate that payment should only be made after the stub has been verified, and it stipulates that the holder of the draft should present the draft for payment on or within two days after the due date. If it is more than three days overdue, the payer can legally seek recourse from the bank. The legal provisions are not fully consistent with the customs. The Central Bank recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance via the Four Joint Treasury, instructing that banks should fulfill their payment obligations within the statutory period to maintain credit and facilitate customers. Moreover, the Law of Negotiable Instruments stipulates that payment may be postponed for three days with the consent of the payer, leaving room for maneuver. In addition to verifying the stub, there are other ways to identify the authenticity of the draft. Therefore, it will be much more convenient for payees to withdraw money from banks in the future.

Existing goods in the factory market are very scarce, and the selling price is not easy to lower.

### Professor Ryan of the United States Lectures at the Ministry of Education: Modern Education Trends Break Down Class Boundaries, Coursework Must Be Flexible, and Interpersonal Social Relationships Are the Object of Teaching; the American Federation for Children's Education Recently Established

[This newspaper's Nanjing, 22nd dispatch] The Ministry of Education invited Professor Ryan from the United States to give a lecture at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 21st) in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education. Approximately 400 people attended, including Ministry of Education personnel, teachers from Nanjing middle schools, and normal school students. The lecture title was "Trends in Modern Education." Professor Ryan's lecture was translated by Ms. Xiong Zhi, and recorded by Mr. Ye, an official of the Ministry of Education. The main points of the lecture are summarized as follows: (1) All aspects of education must be considered. (2) Children should receive a complete education, breaking down the class system. Teaching should be tailored to individual aptitudes, adapting to the development of personality and talent by grouping students accordingly. There should be flexibility in the curriculum, not only in elementary schools but also in middle schools. (3) Teaching should be based on environmental circumstances. If only textbooks are used, talking about flowers and birds in the desert, or rivers and seas in the mountains, it is merely empty talk on paper, difficult to achieve practical results. (4) The true meaning of education emphasizes the entirety of life. In addition to knowledge, attention should be paid to the development of emotions. For example, a nurse should not only rely on medicine for treatment but also provide gentle care to patients, comforting them to speed up their recovery. (5) To achieve the goals of new education, it is not just about teaching materials; teachers must have a new perspective, understanding the various relationships between people and between people and society, as the object of teaching. Otherwise, they can only teach books and not educate people. Professor Ryan also stated that this trend of new education is not only in the United States, but also in all countries around the world. Recently, educational professionals from sixteen countries in the United States participated in the establishment of the Federation for Children's Education, issuing a declaration with key points including opening the doors between schools and society to strengthen communication and connections, changing the system of schools overly trusting in grades and dead textbooks, viewing schools as places for training cooperation and equality, and at the same time seeking to ensure the stability of the lives of those engaged in education and encouraging outstanding young people to serve in education and work hard.

### Youlian Women's Volleyball Team Secures Final Spot in Guozhen Cup: Yesterday's Semifinal Sees 3-1 Elimination of Wuben; Men's Match Sees Yuegang Suffer Defeat to Soviet Union

[This newspaper's dispatch] The Guozhen Cup volleyball league featured two semifinals last night, both fiercely contested matches with significant implications for the championship, resulting in intense competition and spectacular plays. In the women's division, Youlian defeated Wuben 3-1 to secure a spot in the final, while in the men's division, Yuegang lost to the Soviet Union 2-3.

Youlian Wins After Hard Battle

Since Wang Wuli transferred from Wuben to Youlian, the latter's strength has increased dramatically, seemingly guaranteeing them the championship. However, Youlian's performance yesterday appeared rusty, with a lack of coordination in various positions. According to Chen Meizhen of Youlian, the team members are limited in their practice due to work and academic commitments, which is undoubtedly a factor. Despite being in a weakened state, Wuben fought hard, posing a significant threat to Youlian. Youlian's victory came with great effort. Now that Youlian has defeated Wuben, they will face Youdui in the final for the championship. Based on yesterday's performance, they still need to put in a lot of effort.

In the women's match between Youlian and Wuben, Youlian's Lu Zhaoshan served first, and Li Bo missed, giving Youlian a point. The Wuben players were cautious, and the score remained close. At the end of the first set, Youlian took the lead with a score of 21-19. In the second set, Youlian once led 7-1, but Wuben chased back and surpassed them 9-8. Youlian attempted to recover, but Lu Cuifang's slow movements revealed a weakness that Wuben exploited, resulting in a 21-14 victory for Wuben, tying the score. In the third set, the competition between the two sides became even more heated, with the score fluctuating back and forth, creating a tense atmosphere. After several ties, Youlian relied on Chen Meizhen's successful spikes to win the set 21-19, giving Youlian the lead again. In the fourth set, Wuben led 11-5, but Youlian chased back to 14-11 and eventually took the lead. In the end, Youlian won with their final effort, defeating Wuben 21-18, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Youlian, eliminating Wuben.

Yuegang Suffers Bitter Elimination

The Soviet Union team was determined to win the championship. Having lost the league, they were even more ambitious for this Guozhen Cup. Yuegang was also determined, but unfortunately, their key player Zheng Yiquan was unable to attend due to illness, resulting in a significant loss. Yuegang's defeat yesterday was primarily due to their weak spikes, while the Soviet Union team used both spikes and blocks, and had more stamina. After the score became 2-2, Yuegang was unable to sustain their performance in the final set.

In the men's semifinal, Yuegang and the Soviet Union took the stage. Yuegang approached the match cautiously, and the score remained tight. At the change of sides, Yuegang led 11-10. In the next phase, the two sides engaged in close combat, and Yuegang eventually won the first set 21-16. In the second set, the Soviet Union team worked hard to recover, accumulating points and tying the score with a 21-12 victory. The competition became even more intense in the third set, with the score fluctuating back and forth. Yuegang narrowed the deficit to 17, creating a dangerous situation. They made a desperate counterattack, tying the score at 20, but ultimately lost the set 21-23. In the fourth set, Yuegang suddenly found their rhythm, taking a 11-6 lead. In the end, Yuegang recovered lost ground with a 21-16 victory, tying the score at 2-2. In the final set, both sides were cautious, making the match even more intense. At 11-8, the Soviet Union became even more ferocious, and Yuegang ultimately suffered a crushing defeat 13-21, resulting in a 3-2 victory for the Soviet Union, eliminating Yuegang.

### Zheng Lun and Huasheng Basketball Charity Match Tonight at 7:00 PM at the City Gymnasium

The Tianjin Huasheng basketball team's third match in Shanghai was originally scheduled to be against the Shantou team today. However, because the Luoyang Zheng Lun basketball team is about to leave Shanghai, the Basketball Committee decided to play against Zheng Lun first. On Huasheng's suggestion, Zheng Lun and the Basketball Committee agreed to change it to a charity match. Tickets are priced at 3,000 yuan for the upper level and 5,000 yuan for the lower level. The ticket revenue will be discussed by the executive directors of the Sports Association to determine the distribution method. Military police are admitted with tickets. During the break, charity balls will be auctioned to increase revenue. The time is 7:00 PM. Huasheng is purely a typical northern school, with a qualified and experienced team. Sha Zhenglong has rushed from Tianjin and is now able to play. Wang Jinliang has also recovered from his illness, which has greatly enhanced the team's strength. A good performance is expected. Zheng Lun has played six matches in Shanghai, with a mixed record of wins and losses. The team's strength is improving, and the entire team has plenty of stamina. Today's match with Huasheng will be a clash of skills, and it is unknown who will emerge victorious. The lineups for both sides are listed below:

(Zheng Lun) Wu Zuoming (Leader), Zhang Yiwen, Luo Houtang (Staff), Wei Lingxiao (Captain), Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, Qian Ruizhang, Zhang Gensheng, Wang Binghuan.

(Huasheng) Li Qing'an (Coach), Yao Enhan (Manager), Liu Xueqi (Captain), Wang Kanruo, Chuan Jinsheng, Wang Hongbin, Wang Jinliang, Guo Jinming, Yin Huanwen, Sha Zhenglong, Wang Youcai, Han Wentian.

### The Thunderous Devastation of Zhangjiakou: A Gourd That Miraculously Escaped Total Destruction—More Like Lamenting Than Visiting!

— Eighteenth Dispatch from Beiping  Our Correspondent Song Shaobo

On the eighteenth, I, as a reporter, accompanied the "Chinese and Foreign Correspondents' Zhangjiakou Visiting Group" from Beiping to Zhangjiakou. It felt more like "lamenting" than "visiting." It is said that the chief officer, in his speech during the Suiyuan Commemoration Week earlier this month, solemnly stated, "Although we won the battle, there is only deep sorrow and no joy, because those who died were all Chinese!" Zhangjiakou has experienced this disaster, and the destruction was entirely the work of our own people and their hard-earned property.

At half past eight in the morning, people boarded the plane. For the convenience of the photographers, the plane circled over Beiping twice before flying northwest. Because it was uphill, it took a few more minutes to circle over Zhangjiakou for an hour. From the plane, Zhangjiakou, surrounded by mountains, looked like a gourd, not a place suitable for defense. Regardless of Zhangbei to its north, Chaigoubu to its west, or Xuanhua to the east and west, once the attacking forces controlled these areas, the defending troops in this "gourd" had to consider withdrawing as early as possible. Zhangjiakou's "gourd" seems to have escaped total destruction due to its terrain.

Zhangjiakou has two airfields. The larger one in Yulinbu has been thoroughly destroyed by the communist army. From the plane, we saw that the concrete runway was riddled with bomb craters. We landed at the smaller Yaoguantun Airfield. We boarded trucks prepared in advance by the Twelfth War Zone to enter the city and saw Zhangjiakou after the calamity along the way.

Citizens Awakening from a Nightmare

As the trucks drove through the streets, we saw rows of welcoming crowds that stretched as far as the eye could see on both sides. The reporters seemed excited, but those sitting on the ground did not stand up, and we didn't hear any cheers. Upon closer inspection, the triangular flags read "Welcoming Chief Chen Who Has Contributed Greatly Through Hard Work." The reporters understood. Those people were all listless and expressionless, showing neither joy nor sorrow, as if they were waking up from a nightmare and hadn't fully recovered. Most of the shops and households had national flags hanging on their doors, but the colors and wrinkles didn't look like they were freshly made. Later, when we asked a merchant, he said that they didn't usually hang them in the past. Many people were also standing at the entrances of the shops, seemingly watching the spectacle without any direction. Except for those clearing the broken tiles and dilapidated walls who had work to do and rows of stalls waiting for soldiers with legal tender to patronize, few people were seen working. Although the small shops were open, they presented a desolate scene. The citizens didn't have legal tender to buy things, and the "border currency" had lost its validity. The slogans had been renewed, and the bulletin boards were posted with "Zhangjiakou Garrison Headquarters Announcements." Every announcement was surrounded by a crowd of people. The plaques of "Liberation Grand Hotel," "Xinhua Bookstore," and "Jin-Cha-Ji..." were still hanging, but some had been scorched by fire. In front of the Qingfeng Grand Theater, a sign read "Performing Today," and the brothels "×× Academy" and "×× Pavilion" were still open as usual. Here, one could no longer see any traces of the "Mongolian Occupation" period. Instead, we replaced it with our own destruction and slaughter.

The Station Was the Most Severely Damaged

The most severely damaged was the station. A long row of buildings was completely burned. The carriages were charred, and the train cars collided head-on. The undamaged machines were pieced together to form a locomotive, which was scheduled to be used today to open traffic between Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou. The power plant was completely destroyed. Electric wires were dragged across the streets, but a small generator had been repaired. The chief officer's office has been restored with electricity since the seventeenth. The automatic telephone exchange was completely burned down. It is said that the restoration of this item is the most difficult. The important parts of the radio station have been taken away, and a small radio station can be restored recently. The most fortunate thing is the water supply, which was saved by the workers of the factory. The fuse leading to the landmine was secretly removed.

Following the entry of the troops, a "Provisional Administrative Committee of the Twelfth War Zone" has been established in Zhangjiakou to handle post-disaster administration. The chairman of the committee is Zhou Jun, deputy director of the political department of the Twelfth War Zone. The urgent tasks of this committee include the following: issues of land ownership, marriage issues, confessions of Communist Party workers, currency consolidation, and emergency relief.

Restoring Land Ownership

Regarding the issue of land ownership, the chief officer has received instructions from the central government. In principle, as long as the owner provides evidence (if the evidence is lost, it can be testified by neighbors), their ownership can be restored regardless of the "struggle" they have gone through. However, in order to consider the losses of the cultivators, the right of use and the right of harvest of the cultivators are also recognized, and the land rent is not allowed to exceed 15% of the total harvest. If it has undergone more than two "struggles," the original cultivator should get 35%, the intermediate cultivator should get 35%, the harvester should get 25%, and the landlord should still get 15%. This is a temporary solution, maintained until the end of this year, and then the "land limitation policy" will be implemented according to the land law. The planned project is about 20 mu per person, and the maximum is not allowed to exceed 200 mu for a family of five. The land rent will be less than the 25% rent reduction method. Based on the actual situation, the standard will be roughly the same as the current transitional method, that is, the land rent should not exceed 15% or 10%. According to Zhou Jun, chairman of the Provisional Administrative Committee, this method of limiting land rent has been implemented in Sui East and Sui West. Sui West is 10%, Sui East is 15%, and about one-third of the areas in the province have implemented it, and there is not much difficulty. However, the difficulty in implementing the land limitation method in Chahar Province in the future is whether the central and local governments can raise enough funds to buy the landlords' land and distribute it to the landless. According to his speculation, the local government can raise 10% or 20%. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether this policy can be effectively implemented next year. However, according to Zhou, in order to practice the Principle of People's Livelihood and resist the Communist Party's set of methods, this is necessary and imminent.

Currency Issues Are Troublesome

The currency issue is also a more troublesome issue at the moment. The "Border Region Currency" issued by the Communist Party has been banned from circulation. What is currently available is the 40 million legal tender that the Twelfth War Zone brought with the army. The lack of small denomination currency also needs to be resolved immediately. Therefore, the Chief Officer's Office has lent 20 million to the Chamber of Commerce and allowed it to issue temporary small denomination circulating notes, which began to be used on the eighteenth. Zhangjiakou's prices have not yet been stimulated. Flour is 400 yuan per catty, rice is 500 yuan, and white cloth is 90,000 yuan per bolt. However, people are afraid of the shocking increase in prices when transportation is restored and there is no shortage of currency, because Zhangjiakou actually has very little left. Someone from the Central Bank arrived in Zhangjiakou on the same plane as the reporters to prepare for the establishment of a branch. Marriage issues are easier to resolve. The principle that has been established is that those without problems are free to do as they please, and those with problems are based on the opinions of the women.

Registering Workers

The unemployed workers in Zhangjiakou have not yet been counted. Including the workers of the Longyan Coal Mine in Xuanhua, there are no less than tens of thousands of people. There are many others who urgently need relief due to the war. For the workers, the Provisional Administrative Committee decided to register them starting today, in order to organize them to repair the damaged factories, and give them 1,000 to 1,500 yuan per day, which is equivalent to using work as relief. In addition, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) also had five people arrive in Zhangjiakou on the same plane as the reporters, bringing 40 million in cash to handle emergency relief.

The Self-Confession Movement is Very Effective. More than 2,500 people have already confessed. The authorities announced that as long as they confess and obtain the guarantee of the Baojia, they will be given a path to self-renewal and will not be held accountable for the past. At the same time, retaliatory actions are prohibited. It has been a week since Zhangjiakou was recovered, and no retaliatory actions have been seen. The general public seems to be very enlightened, which the authorities think is very good.

Panic in Education

Zhangjiakou originally had more than 40 elementary schools with 10,000 students. After this change, they have not suffered too much damage and have all resumed classes. The Chinese Communist Party textbooks have been abolished, but new textbooks have not yet been found, which is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Secondary schools and above previously included municipal middle schools for boys and girls, agricultural vocational schools, commercial vocational schools, railway colleges, medical colleges, industrial colleges, and Hui Muslim middle schools. The Inner Mongolia Military and Political College had 2,000 students. In addition, there was the North China United University (a merger of Yan'an University, Lu Xun Academy of Arts, Foreign Languages ​​College, and Education College), but the number of students is unknown. When the Communist army withdrew, the students from these secondary schools and above all voluntarily or were forced to withdraw with the army. According to Secretary Wang of the Twelfth War Zone Command, about 6,000 students withdrew with the Communist army, 800 of whom were shot on the road in the name of ideological problems. Some of them have now returned one after another. The Communist Party's Jin-Cha-Ji Daily was published the day before the withdrawal. Before leaving, they destroyed one of the three large rotary printing machines left by the Japanese in North China and turned it into scrap iron. The Struggle Daily in Guihua published the Zhangjiakou version three days ago.

Generals' Humble Attitude

In Zhangjiakou, we met General Fu Zuoyi and General Dong Qiwu, who were both wearing grass-green military uniforms identical to those of the soldiers. They did not take victory as glory and were very humble in their attitude. Chief Officer Fu hoped that the reporters would contact anyone at will in order to know the true situation of Zhangjiakou before and after. Mr. Wang Mingde, the secretary-general of Chief Officer Fu, accompanied the reporters for half a day. He said that the spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Twelfth War Zone is "Although the treatment is different, the life must be the same." Small kitchens are not allowed, and officers and soldiers are completely the same in clothing, food, housing, transportation, and operations. The reporters did not see any difference either.

### The Melancholy of Guangxi Women

— Guilin Dispatch on the Eleventh  Our Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

The most mysterious "recruiting son-in-law" situation among the girls in the Zuojiang River area. For the sake of life, many women often fancy some lone guests from other places, and then bring him into their home as a son-in-law, and devote themselves to him (naturally, these women have already accumulated a lot of money from their labor). Occasionally, if the husband misses his hometown very much and wants to return home for a while, this produces the story of "letting the husband go." The wife will try her best to provide the husband with unlimited extravagance and "return in glory," but strictly instruct him on the deadline for his return. If he returns to his wife's home on time, naturally nothing will happen. If he returns past the deadline, nineteen out of ten times, his belly will swell and he will pass away. These fragrant and terrifying legends still circulate in Guangxi today, becoming excellent materials for unofficial history.

The Yao girls in the remote southern country grow up in the Garden of Eden of songs and dances and love. Singing is their spring. Their sweet dreams, the secluded forests and streams in the thousands of valleys and mountains, the fragrant river banks that can be seen for thousands of miles on the plains, are full of different languages and bright songs, which are so gentle, pure, and lovely. Women in the vast mountain villages in southeastern Guangxi always passionately worship a singing goddess, longing for the myth of her singing voice. It is said that the name of the singing immortal is Liu Sanjie, who is from Longshan Township, Guixian County, on the banks of the Yu River (her name is as deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people of Guixian as the eternally shining national hero Prince Yi Shi Dakai, and is regarded as the supreme glory). This beautiful girl from a farming family was born to love singing mountain songs. No matter when she was herding cattle, transplanting rice seedlings, weeding fields, cutting thatch... her charming voice could be heard echoing in the silent sky. A song on the river bridge, a few warbling sounds, intoxicated the strong young men, teased the young men of youth, and brought down the smile of the earth... However, an ugly fate brought her the bullying, torment, and jealousy of a sister-in-law, who was determined to kill this innocent little sister. So, one day, under the pretext of chopping firewood, she took Sanjie to a very steep mountain peak, and then pushed her forward, fully expecting to end Sanjie's life and singing. Who knew that just as Sanjie was falling in the air, she grabbed a ten-year-old vine, swaying in the middle of the deep valley, facing the rushing stream. Sanjie's singing rang out again: "Sister-in-law wants to harm Liu Sanjie, thank you for a thousand-year-old vine." As soon as the song was over, a stone gate on the cliff opened with a "ya" sound. Liu Sanjie took the singing and walked into the cave door, becoming a singing immortal. The story is light and interesting. Liu Sanjie's soul lives forever in the hearts of the sisters. Many people are singing "If you don't believe it, just look at Liu Sanjie, singing should pass nine mountains." Singing not only passes nine mountains, but singing is also the matchmaker for the girls in the mountain countries of free marriage. When the wax is exhausted and the spring surrounds, when the plums are cold and the peaches are beautiful, occasionally a mountain village has an unprecedented program (such as the Spring Festival in the agricultural factory, the Pangu Festival in the Yao area of ​​western Guangxi, the Egg Throwing Festival in the Wanggang area... the men and women of the entire village are completely immersed in crazy songs and dances. The bright moon shines on people, the flowing water plays music, and a gust of mountain wind blows across the plain. The wonderful love reverberates in the deep pine forest. The woman sings: "The stars in the sky disappear and reappear, a Milky Way is desolate and clear. Who can count the stars in the sky, I will spread my wings and fly to the sky." The man answers: "The stars in the sky shine every night, it's not that the brother can't count them clearly, I'm most afraid of counting all the stars in the sky, the sister-in-law won't cross the Milky Way." One song after another, Venus and Cupid's love arrows gently insert into their hearts. When the moon sets, the crows cry, and the dawn urges people, many couples have already walked hand in hand into the girl's father's house, explained it clearly, and then followed a series of betrothal gifts (the Yao people in southwestern Guangxi want a certain number of cattle and white rice, while the Yao area in the Dateng Mountains likes to want hundreds of pieces of snow-white silver dollars. Speaking of the Yao area in the Dateng Mountains, there is still a "prince consort" of the Jinxiu Yao King, who was a popular figure in the former provincial government, but the reason why this prince consort was able to "marry the princess" was not from singing but from appeasement). So, thanks to the legacy of the singing immortal, another pair of lovers became a family. This is the spring of the Yao country, and also a page of poetry in the mountains.

However, the ending of the tragicomedy is often that women suffer the most painful sacrifices. The war and famine of the past two years have devastated the body of Guangxi. More than six million women have endured double the suffering. Grass roots and tree bark have blocked their innocent singing voices. Hunger and poverty are threatening the survival of their husbands and children. Many pure souls have sold their cheap bodies. Many bright pearls on the guide have helplessly become other people's concubines. Infinite sorrow teaches them to shed endless tears like Lin Daiyu, and empty stomachs teach them to live a more tragic life than Zhao Wuniang. What kind of happiness has the sky given to the women of Guangxi?

### Visiting Mr. You Yongchang, Chairman of the China Zhonghe Party

— Guangzhou Dispatch on the Twelfth Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng

The name "China Zhonghe Party" seems to have been rarely seen in the past. I believe many people feel a little unfamiliar with this party. So, when the news of the arrival of the leader of the Zhonghe Party in Guangzhou was revealed in the newspapers here, the citizens speculated and gossiped in the streets: It's probably another new political party that has been established. Even the reporter had the same feeling. So, on a clear autumn afternoon, the reporter, with a curious mood, went to Room 715 of the New Asia Hotel to visit Mr. You Yongchang, the chairman of the party.

Mr. You is now 61 years old. His face is thin, with high cheekbones and sunken cheeks, and his eyes are sunken and his nose is prominent. The white hair on his head and the silver beard hanging from his lips match very harmoniously. When he receives reporters, he always has a kind smile, giving people a feeling of talking to a kind elder.

The Shen, Xian, and You surnames were originally one family.

Mr. You's surname was originally the "尢" character without the dot on top, so many people read it differently. Some people read it as the You character, and some people read it as the Wang character sound. The reporter first asked about this, and he explained the origin of the surname, saying that their ancestor was originally Shen, and later, after a rebellion, the Manchus were scattered, and they were divided into the Shen, Xian, and You surnames. In fact, they are all one family. Their ancestral home was originally Wuxi, Jiangsu, and later the You surname settled in Shunde County, Guangdong. As for this 尢 character, it should be read with the same sound as 注, but everyone calls me Mr. You, so I have to be surnamed "尤." He only explained his surname, and he spoke for several minutes without fear of trouble. From this, it can also be seen that he is a talkative person.

The Zhonghe Party has a history of 60 years

Turning to the main topic, Mr. You gave the following summary to the reporter's inquiries about the history and current situation of the Zhonghe Party:

"The Zhonghe Party was founded by my father, You Lie, in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, and was established on March 19th of the Dingchou year, with a history of 60 years. At that time, it was a political party organized separately with the same doctrine as the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen after the Revive China Society. Mr. Sun and Mr. You were born in the same year, launched uprisings at the same time, and fled to Tokyo and North and South America to persuade people to revolt. At that time, the Qing court called the four major bandits of the revolution Dr. Sun Yat-sen, my father, and Mr. Chen Shaobai and Mr. Yang Heling. For decades, the Zhonghe Party was led by my father, You Lie. After my father passed away, comrades at home and abroad elected me to succeed him. There are currently about 3 million party members, most of whom are overseas workers in the Nanyang Islands. However, there are also many in the country. The provinces north of the Yangtze River account for about 300,000. Although the number of party members in Guangzhou has not been accurately investigated, it is believed that it is always more than 10,000, because most of the Zhonghe Party members are "hereditary," so it will only increase and not decrease. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, I traveled from Hong Kong to Qujiang, Guilin, and other places to mobilize party members to participate in the Anti-Japanese War. There was a time when I lost contact with party members in various places due to the interruption of transportation. Now I am planning to reinvestigate and revitalize the party affairs. At present, the Central Executive Department is located in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and will soon be moved to Shanghai."

The Historic National Seal Will Be Presented to the Government

Mr. You spoke eloquently, and the more he spoke, the more excited he seemed to become, with a very proud look on his face. Then, he said:

"My purpose of this trip is to inspect the Zhonghe Party's affairs in Guangzhou. Soon, I will go to Beijing with the National Assembly representatives of the Zhonghe Party to present the 'Long Live the Republic of China' National Seal to the National Government during the National Assembly. This seal was engraved in the 28th year of Guangxu when Dr. Sun Yat-sen and my father decided on the national name 'Republic of China' in Tokyo. The seal is made of ivory, about one square inch in size, engraved with six seal characters 'Long Live the Republic of China,' and has two lions on top, which are very exquisite. On New Year's Day in 1901, the Zhonghe Party began to use it at the first congress held in Tokyo. Later, it was also used at Chairman Chiang's 51st birthday. Other than that, it is rarely used."

The Delay in Presenting the National Seal is in Accordance with Family Instructions

After he finished this paragraph, the reporter had some doubts. Since this is called the National Seal, why didn't it be presented to the National Government earlier? His answer was this:

"My father had long planned to present this seal to Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that this is a national treasure and instructed my father to hand it over only when the National Revolution is completed and the National Assembly is convened. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Central Government summoned my father to Beijing to discuss national affairs, and my father planned to present it to the National Assembly at that time to show solemnity. However, due to the serious national crisis, the National Assembly was suspended, and my father unfortunately passed away in the capital. While dying, he instructed me to present it when the National Assembly opens, so it has been preserved until now!"

Finally, he said: "My father was a founding father and his revolutionary achievements are outstanding. He was selfless and indifferent to fame and wealth throughout his life. He was very friendly with Mr. Zou Haibin, Mr. Ju Juesheng, and Mr. Dai Jitao during his lifetime. Since his death, he has been buried in Beijing at public expense. Friends also founded the You Lie Memorial Middle School in Hong Kong, and Chairman Chiang inscribed the name of the school. Currently, Guangdong comrades also have plans to establish a branch school here, and I also feel that cultivating talents during the period of national construction is the urgent task at hand!"

When he seemed to say this with emotion, the reporter still wanted to ask questions, but Mr. You already had other social engagements, so the reporter had to leave.

Ten Suggestions on the Current Situation

Finally, the reporter would like to report one thing here. The Zhonghe Party sent a letter of opinion to President Chiang on the current situation on September 9th of this year. Although the content has not been published, the party will publicly announce ten propositions on the current political views, the content of which is that the country and the nation are supreme, reconstruction comes first, internal wars should be stopped immediately, and sincerity and harmony should be directed towards the national cause.

### The Danube River Has Many Troubles: The US-Soviet Struggle for Navigation Rights is Related to European Peace

The United States has recently been advocating in two international conferences for an issue that is critical to European peace: the unrestricted use of the 1,750-mile-long Danube River for international trade. At the Paris Peace Conference, a vague proposal to convene a special conference on the internationalization of the Danube River was passed over Soviet opposition and the withdrawal of various special proposals by the United States. At the same time, at Lake Success, the United Nations Economic and Social Council passed a similar US proposal. However, countries under Soviet control have threatened to refuse to participate in any international conference that opposes their independent management of the Danube River.

Therefore, this issue inevitably arises again, making it difficult for the United Nations to deal with. The following is a dispatch from Vienna by Howard, the Berlin correspondent of the American "Newsweek," detailing the various important factors behind this complex issue.

Viennese have a satirical remark based on Strauss's waltz, called "The Americans Occupy the Vienna Woods, the Soviets Occupy the Blue Danube." The reason is: American officials and their families live in the luxurious houses in the "Vienna Woods" in the American occupation zone of Vienna, while the section of the Danube River and its tributaries from Enns in Upper Austria to the Black Sea are under Soviet control.

### American Control of One-Fifth

— Translated by Zuo Xi

In reality, the United States controls one-fifth of the entire length of the Danube River. This includes a narrow stretch of the upper Danube, from Ulm in the state of Württemberg to Linz within the American occupation zone in Austria. From there, it extends along the southern bank to Enns, where the Soviets have placed underwater cables. Within this section of the river above Linz, the Americans possess one-third of the Danube fleet. This fleet comprises 971 vessels from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, France, Bulgaria, Romania, and other nations. These ships had been used to transport retreating German nationals and supplies in the last months of the war, or had fled upstream after the war to avoid capture by Soviet forces. Among them are 34 passenger ships, 105 tugboats, 55 motor barges, and tankers. The remaining are miscellaneous vessels like ordinary barges, oil barges, and crane ships.

American engineers have cleared the river channel from Linz to Regensburg within Germany and have established three Danube shipping companies to manage navigation on a 296-mile stretch of the river within the American occupation zone. These three companies are the Bavarian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG), the Bavarian Lloyd Shipping Company, and the Comos Shipping Company, owned by Bavaria and chartered by the Netherlands. Of the 971 vessels, 390 belong to the Danube Shipping Company. All ships and equipment belonging to this company within the Soviet occupation zone were confiscated last winter by the Soviets as "German assets" according to the Potsdam Agreement. Consequently, the company has requested that the Americans refrain from allowing the ships to sail until the issue of sovereignty over the Danube Shipping Company is resolved. The company demands that the Soviet side return the dock equipment and 220 vessels confiscated by them. Although the Austrian Parliament has nationalized the company, and it has now become an asset of the Austrian government, the Soviets continue to occupy and operate these ships and equipment under the name of the Danube Shipping Company.

Blue Disappears

There is a Viennese saying that the Danube is always blue in the eyes of a lover. But in reality, this putty-colored river, snaking around Vienna like a dead snake, shows no trace of blue. Seen from the sky, it resembles flypaper, covered with dilapidated docks and warehouses, scattered with collapsed bridges, and the protruding hulls of sunken ships. Viennese people like to gather on the riverbanks, resting and reading under the trees, and even hardy men swim in this river. However, the section from Linz to below Vienna is entirely foul-smelling stagnant water, with no ships sailing on it. The port of Vienna, with its ten miles of docks and wharves, used to handle 1.7 million tons of shipping annually before the war, but now it is silted up and dead.

According to the Soviets, the throat of the Danube is the bridge in Tulln, about fifteen miles from Vienna, which was destroyed by Hitler's guards. All five sections of the bridge are broken and sunk in the river. Retrieving the Tulln bridge from the riverbed requires operating in dangerous rapids and requires specially trained engineers, workers, and underwater equipment, all of which the Soviets lack. Austrian engineers estimate that in normal conditions, with the proper tools and labor, the entire bridge could be retrieved in thirty to forty days. However, the Soviets, using only one crane and a small number of Austrian workers, have only retrieved one section of the bridge in nine months.

Stagnant State

In the second week of July this year, the Soviet Danube Shipping Headquarters in Budapest sent a circular to all shipping companies under Soviet control, announcing that the Danube River from Vienna to the Black Sea was now open. Companies only needed to give twenty-four hours' notice to confirm the weather and river conditions to freely utilize that section of the river. The only shipping company that has accepted this Soviet proposal is the Czech Shipping Company, to transport 2,000 tons of wood pulp from Bulgaria to Bratislava in the Czech Republic.

Below Bratislava, the extent of navigation hazards, tariff regulations, border inspections, various levies, loading and unloading fees, and other practicalities are unclear, and there are various restrictions. Even the extent of Soviet control remains unknown.

There is no regular commercial transport on the Danube. Only about 300 ships operate within Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and about 30 to 50 operate within Hungary. However, due to the danger of mines and obstacles, transport is limited to one-way transactions and involves great risks. British and American officials are well aware that the Soviets currently control the northern estuary leading to the Black Sea, but they admit that they know nothing about the situation in the other two estuaries and the Sulina mouth to the Black Sea.

It is a clear fact that before the Second World War, the Danube was the major trading artery for seven countries in Central Europe, with a total of about 3,000 ships sailing back and forth, handling 3.5 million to 4 million tons of cargo annually. But now it is in a state of stagnation. While Europe is looking forward to a peaceful resolution, these seven countries, which could have rebuilt their collapsed economies through Danube trade, are now barely surviving on UN relief goods and a small amount of freight.

### Potsdam

— Zuo Qi

After Germany's surrender in May 1945, the Big Three powers – Britain (Churchill and Attlee), the United States (Truman), and the Soviet Union (Stalin) – convened in Potsdam in July to lay the groundwork for lasting world peace and jointly plan to intensify the war against Japan. On July 26, with the consent of Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, Churchill and Truman jointly signed and issued the Potsdam Declaration. Before two weeks had passed, Japan accepted the declaration and surrendered. As a result, the term "Potsdam" resonated throughout the world and became a common news term in newspapers.

Potsdam is located about eighteen miles southwest of Berlin, Germany, on the Havel River. The area is scenic and has historically been a royal residence of German emperors, with magnificent buildings. The Potsdam Conference was held in the old palace.

In the preceding period, there were also rumors that the Big Three would meet again in Potsdam to discuss intractable international disputes, but this did not materialize.

Recently, the American Policy Association on China accused the government of having secret agreements concerning China at the Potsdam Conference and demanded their disclosure. However, the U.S. State Department denied the existence of any such agreements.

Current Affairs Commentary

### From Paris to New York, the Center of Gravity Remains with the US and Soviet Union

— Chu Yu

The Paris Peace Conference has ended, and representatives from various countries have returned home. Paris, bustling for two months and eighteen days, has suddenly become quiet. The world's attention has also shifted from Paris to New York, across the Atlantic. Not only is the United Nations General Assembly scheduled to open in New York on the 23rd of this month, but the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is also scheduled to be held in New York on the 4th of next month. The United States is currently experiencing a meat shortage, with the general population "lacking meat." Now, with the arrival of a large number of international dignitaries, the U.S. authorities have to treat them sincerely, providing them with delicacies, which will make the shortage even more severe.

Peace is Not Easy, When Will it Be Achieved?

If we temporarily close our eyes and imagine, we can understand that achieving world peace is not an easy task. The European war ended a year and a half ago, and the Pacific war ended more than a year ago, but true peace has not yet arrived in the world. Political and diplomatic figures from various countries are working hard for peace, holding one international conference after another, trying every possible way to restore the post-war world to a normal state as soon as possible, so that all countries can share peace and no longer face the threat of aggressive wars. However, a year and a half of efforts have only completed draft peace treaties for Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. Other important issues, because they could not be resolved by the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, were handed over to the Paris Peace Conference for discussion. The Paris Peace Conference failed to resolve them and they are now being handed back to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for handling. This is equivalent to going in a big circle, returning to the original starting point. The problems themselves remain the same, and no progress has been made in resolving them. The people of the world, having suffered from the great catastrophe of this war, have learned their lessons and their desire for peace is too urgent. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, they hope that it can suddenly become clear. Initially, they placed all their hopes on the Foreign Ministers Conference. After that hope was shattered, they placed their hopes on the Paris Peace Conference. Now the Paris Peace Conference has once again made the world feel the sadness of disillusionment. But the world's hopes have shifted to the United Nations General Assembly, and even the future Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

The world's attention shifts with hope, but where is peace after all? It remains an incomprehensible enigma.

An Interlude at the End of the Peace Conference

The final session of the Paris Peace Conference was presided over by Guo Taiqi, acting head of the Chinese delegation, who sang the praises of the conference and hoped that all countries would eliminate their prejudices and work for peace. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes also said: "Countries should recognize each other; no one country can win alone in war, and at the same time, no one country can achieve peace alone in peacetime. All countries must work together for the benefit of mankind." Subsequently, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also delivered speeches one after another, and finally French Foreign Minister Bidault gave the closing speech. The conference ended there. However, the representative of Yugoslavia was not seen at the conference session that day. According to his letter to Guo Taiqi, chairman of the final session, Yugoslavia did not approve of the peace treaty with Italy passed by the conference and had decided to withdraw from the conference. The achievements of the Paris Peace Conference were already mediocre enough, but the fact that it exposed a major weakness at the end was truly disappointing.

The Center of Gravity Remains with the US and Soviet Union

The United Nations General Assembly has been decided to open as scheduled, and the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will also be held in New York. Therefore, everyone wants to ask: Will there be good results? Our answer is: "The key to success or failure still lies in US-Soviet relations." Therefore, the world attaches particular importance to the speech delivered by Byrnes on the 18th. The speech contained the following points: (1) The American people are willing to extend a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union; (2) Rumors that the United States is adopting a policy of containment towards the Soviet Union are entirely based on fantasy; (3) Promoting US-Soviet understanding is perhaps the most difficult task for today's political and diplomatic figures; (4) The United States will continue to oppose individual alliance policies; (5) The most worrying aspect of the current international situation is that US-Soviet relations have reached an impasse.

Byrnes's remarks were not only fully agreed upon by President Truman, but even his political rival Wallace expressed satisfaction, believing that Byrnes had made progress, but still hoping that he would continue to improve. Senator Vandenberg also gave a speech in support of Byrnes's policy, saying: "Since the Soviet Union does not want war, and the United States does not want war, I hope that everyone will stop talking about war. The foreign policy of the United States is a policy of peace, and if it is not undermined domestically, it will certainly succeed."

Trade Conference Held in England

The International Trade and Employment Conference initiated by the United States began its preparatory meeting in London on the 15th, discussing the US proposals. Representatives from nineteen countries attended, but the Soviet Union did not participate. US representative Wilcox put forward five basic principles for reviving the world economy: (1) Substantially reduce tariff barriers; (2) Countries should exchange goods with each other; (3) Imports from various countries should not be discriminated against; (4) Countries should maintain a high level of employment; (5) All countries should be equal in the international market.

Our research into the true motive behind the US initiation of this conference is to restore the freedom of post-war international trade. In principle, this is agreed upon by all countries; but in fact, there are still difficulties. The first is the non-participation of the Soviet Union, which inevitably makes the scope of so-called international trade too narrow. The second is that Britain and France cannot temporarily abolish their restrictions on imported goods. The third is that economically backward countries must adopt "moderate protection" in order to implement industrialization. The fourth is that the US promotion of the international free trade movement inevitably carries the color of economic imperialism.

### Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak: A Key Intermediary Among Small Countries

— Translated by Jianan from "World Report Magazine"

Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak is now an important intermediary between large and small countries. He will once again serve as chairman when the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York on October 23. The working principle of this socialist politician is to be pragmatic. In his youth, he was an agitator for social movements, having smashed the windows of conservative newspapers. But age and a sense of responsibility have gradually turned him into a rational figure, advocating reason. For example, at the Paris Peace Conference, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt used straightforward language to force concessions from the Big Four, but Spaak used gentle language and compromise.

The major powers categorically rejected Evatt's demand that a majority vote should be binding on the Big Four. But when Spaak, chairman of the Rules Committee, suggested that the major powers should automatically adopt proposals passed by a two-thirds majority, he received the support of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes.

When Spaak chairs international conferences, he is calm and accurate, truly representing a typical figure of objectivity and impartiality. He represented Belgium in international tennis competitions in 1922. Now, his agility and cleverness in speaking at conferences can be compared to his skill on the court.

Flexible Approach

With Spaak as chairman, debates often do not become deadlocked. When the Big Four face a stalemate, the Belgian Foreign Minister can often propose a flexible solution.

At the Paris Peace Conference, Spaak once told the representatives of various countries that their incessant disputes would make people around the world think that they were not setting terms for the Axis powers, but arguing about the peace issues among themselves.

When Spaak is chairman, he does not allow any representative to be opportunistic. In handling conference affairs, he attaches more importance to the spirit of the rules than to the letter of the rules. He is tolerant of mistakes caused by confusion in the meeting, but he is extremely firm when someone deliberately violates the rules to achieve their own goals.

In his youth, Spaak led socialists to parade through the streets to smash the windows of right-wing newspapers. In his twenties, he became a successful lawyer and first attracted people's attention. He defended communists and wrote fiery pamphlets and speeches for young socialists. But when he became Prime Minister of Belgium at the age of thirty-nine, he was already the leader of the right wing of the Socialist Party and an opponent of the Communist Party.

Outstanding Talent

Spaak is the son of Belgium's first prominent female socialist member of parliament. His father was a poet who wrote the most successful play of the time. In 1938, he became Prime Minister of Belgium.

During World War II, Spaak fled to France and was detained by the Vichy government. He then fled to Spain and was detained by Franco. He broke out of prison, disguised himself as a monk, and traveled through Portugal to London, where he rejoined the Belgian government.

Spaak was first elected to parliament in 1932 and became a cabinet member in 1935, serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs the following year. Since then, he has held this position almost continuously. He is now the foreign minister of the coalition government of the Liberal, Socialist, and Communist parties.

In 1937, Spaak participated in King Leopold's negotiations, which resulted in Belgium breaking away from its military alliance with France and Britain. But isolationism did not prevent Belgium from being invaded, just as neutrality did not save Belgium from crisis in the First World War.

However, unlike King Leopold, Spaak fled abroad and continued to resist. Today, he opposes Leopold's surrender to the Nazis and disapproves of his return to the country. Spaak now advocates close relations with Britain and France and the establishment of a mutual defense agreement, but he insists that this does not mean organizing a "Western bloc."

This policy has led the Soviet Union to oppose his serving as chairman of the United Nations General Assembly. But after seeing Spaak's actual actions, the Soviet side had to admit that he was an excellent chairman.

When the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York on October 23, he will once again appear before the representatives of various countries as an intermediary between large and small countries.

### Reasons for Japan's Defeat: Japanese Journalist Kato Reveals the Truth about the Three Islands Before Surrender

A recent book by Kato, a well-known Japanese journalist and current chief writer for the Kyodo News Agency, entitled "Record of Defeat," has been published. It states that before the atomic bombs fell on Japan, American submarines had already dealt Japan a major blow. A month before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Emperor Hirohito wanted to seek peace through the Soviet Union. Prior to this, Japan was constantly exploring peace with China. Kato writes his articles in the style of ordinary news reports, beginning with this: "Japan had long been struggling in the throes of death. The sudden arrival of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima was merely the final blow that hastened its demise. The world's newest and most powerful weapon emerged from the summer sky, destroying the city with just one blow. However, its appearance did not have much impact on the outcome of the Japanese-American war."

Kato strongly tells UN readers about the errors of Japanese totalitarianism. He recounts the mutual distrust between the Japanese army, navy, and civilians, the mismanagement of Japanese skilled workers, and the poor planning in all aspects of the war. He also harshly criticizes the ridiculous pretense of calm that the Japanese army continued to maintain as Japan was on the verge of collapse. He further narrates the enslavement of Japanese newspapers, which, once they regained their freedom, were at a loss for what to do.

At the historic meeting of the cabinet and other leaders on August 14, the prime minister first reviewed the general situation, after which the chiefs of staff of the army and navy, as well as the minister of the army, urged the emperor to reaffirm the national policy and continue the war. At this point, the cabinet secretary quoted the emperor as saying, "If others have no opinions to express, we will express our opinions. We are determined that you agree to this... We believe that there is only one path left to save Japan."

Kato criticizes the propaganda of both Japan and the United States, saying: "In my personal opinion, Japanese propaganda in the Philippines was the most unsuccessful, while propaganda in Burma was the most successful. Success was mainly due to racial appeals and promises. Failure was due to the inability to replace the British and American trends, and the inability or unwillingness to fulfill promises. Especially in the Philippines, the sudden disruption of the supply of American cars, refrigerators, and modern equipment quickly made the natives lose faith in the Japanese talk of co-prosperity."

Spring and Autumn

### Bernard Shaw

— Zhang Yinhuai

Shaw is ninety years old. July 26 was his birthday. Shaw does not like to celebrate birthdays. Twenty years ago, he swore that he would not celebrate a second one. That was in 1926, when he wrote this: "I can accept all these words of praise for me without shame. But this is my first birthday celebration, and also the last one I intend to celebrate." For this reason, his friends: HG Wells, Professor Murray, Mansfield, Priestley, A. Huxley, and Xiong Shiyi, among others, each wrote a commemorative or research article, compiled into a special collection, to show their respect and love.

This old man is not really old. Although he is a rare antique in the modern literary world who was once a colleague of Victorian writers and has experienced two world wars, few people feel the burden of his age. People only feel that he is a great writer of this century, who has written two modern masterpieces: "Saint Joan" and "Man and Superman"; but they do not know that most of his life has been turned into history. Among the writers who were his contemporaries were Kipling, Hardy, and Wilde. And when his first play (Rhinegold) was published, Tennyson and Browning were still alive.

Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a humorous drunkard; his mother was a highly cultured singer. The family was poor, so his first thirty years were spent in poverty. Throughout his life, he was an intellectual who had not received much formal education; but he had read almost all the famous books on earth. He loved music because his mother was a highly cultured musician, allowing the children to grow up listening to Beethoven and Handel from an early age.

### Shaw (Oil Painting)

— Clare Winsten

In 1876, Shaw went to London with his family. He tried to write over a thousand words every day, toiling for ten years, and completed five novels and hundreds of short articles, yet only sold them for a total of six pounds. In those years, he lived off his mother, thereby gaining leisure for writing.

From the age of twenty-six, he became a vegetarian—partly for humanitarian reasons, partly for health. He despised meat-eaters. It is said that once, he and the meat-loving great sculptor Rodin mutually ridiculed each other because of this. Shaw was not only abstemious in his appetite, but also in his sexual desire; he was a Puritan. Although he had some correspondence flirtations with the then-popular actress Ellen Terry, she remained faithfully in love with his wife, who had died three years prior.

In 1884, Shaw joined the Fabian Society, which had only been founded a year earlier, and enthusiastically campaigned in the streets for the socialist movement. Three years later, he shifted his focus from the working class to intellectuals, and his sharp and quick eloquence conquered many.

Shaw was not only a social critic, but also an authority in the fields of music and drama criticism. He wrote drama reviews for three years for "Saturday Review," edited by his friend Harris. This was a high-end publication in London at the time, and Shaw's position in the literary world had already been firmly established due to his sharp and witty writing style.

George Bernard Shaw's humor and wit are known worldwide, and everyone sees him as a playful and irreverent jester. In reality, he is an idealist wearing a clown's mask. He saw himself as a prophet of the times; whether that is the case, only time will tell.

However, his cold satire and passionate mockery are only a superficial form, a temporary tool—this is true. He himself once said, "If I didn't joke and laugh like this, I'm afraid no one would be able to bear it." Beneath this mask of satire lies an Irishman's passionate heart, a strong love for humanity, and broad sympathy. He constantly sought ways to improve the situation of the working-class poor and often used his own money to help them. As Chesterton said: Comedians are often the most serious people in the world. In public, he was sharp-tongued and fond of mixed laughter and ridicule; in private, he was a quiet, friendly, and gentle gentleman.

Shaw has now established a brilliant position in literary history, and people often compare him to Shakespeare. (Shakespeare was the person he admired most.) Along with honor, of course, came wealth. Plays brought Shaw a great deal of money. For several years, he was the highest-paid playwright in the world; recently, he has become the highest-paid screenwriter for movies. Films based on his plays earn him one-tenth of the total income. Some completed films include "Pygmalion" and "Major Barbara," and recently completed is the new film "Caesar and Cleopatra." Therefore, when the British side wanted to award him the highest honor on one occasion, he simply refused; he believed that the name George Bernard Shaw no longer needed unnecessary embellishment.

Shaw's important plays include the following: "Arms and the Man" (first performed in 1894), "Candida" (1894), "The Devil's Disciple" (1897), "Caesar and Cleopatra" (1898), "Man and Superman" (1903), first performed in November 1905, "Major Barbara" (November 1905). Later, he wrote "Pygmalion" and his last famous play, "Saint Joan" (1923), and wrote several famous works on economics. It is said that he is still writing a play to this day.

### Anecdotes about Shaw

— Huai

George Bernard Shaw's humor is world-renowned. Once, a beautiful actress (not the dancer Duncan) wrote to him proposing marriage. She said, "Your brains plus my figure, we will produce the most perfect child." But Shaw replied, "What if the child inherits my figure and your brains?"

Humor is humor, but most scholars, while admiring Shaw's intellectual brilliance, don't particularly appreciate his clownish facade. He himself is among these people. One evening, after a performance of "Arms and the Man," Shaw was invited to take a bow as the author. At the end of a round of enthusiastic applause, a cold "Boo" suddenly came. Shaw raised both hands to calm the frenzied crowd. Then he turned to face the direction of the booing and said, "I agree with you, my friend. But the opinion of the whole room is exactly the opposite of ours, so what can you and I do?"

In 1925, he refused the Nobel Prize in Literature. His reason for refusing was very interesting: he didn't need the money. The money was about $35,000 US dollars, and he said, "Like a life preserver to a swimmer who has already safely reached the other shore, it is useless."

### Shaw's Daily Life

— Lin

George Bernard Shaw has a three-story villa in Ayot St. Lawrence with twelve comfortable rooms. The garden occupies an area of ​​one hundred acres. He lives here peacefully and leisurely, leading his writing life. He doesn't smoke, doesn't eat meat, has breakfast at nine o'clock every morning, and reads newspapers—from the stubborn London Times to the Communist "Daily Worker." Then he hides in his work shed, writing until one o'clock. He takes a nap after lunch, and returns to the shed around four o'clock. Until seven o'clock for dinner. In the evening, he reads and listens to the radio, and goes to sleep at eleven o'clock.

His wife, Charlotte Payne-Townshend, passed away three years ago. Now he lives alone in Ayot, employing a driver, gardener, housekeeper and maid. Every July, he must go to London to live for a while, so that the servants can have a rest, and the chimneys, etc., can be cleaned once.

### Dedication to Shaw on his Birthday

— Written by Professor Murray, translated by Lan Ning

I am sick, but I cannot be omitted from the group of memorialists for GBS, whom I so admire.

Let me reiterate an old inscription. In my book on Aristophanes, I wrote: "Dedicated to my old friend GBS, a lover of ideals, a hater of cruelty, a man who has filled the world with laughter, and whose courage never disappears—"

"Lover of ideals," although I have been with many cultural workers, I doubt that few have lived a spiritual life as intensely as he does, while rarely caring about the physical aspect. He takes the enjoyment of food surprisingly lightly. Vulgarity and carnality are not found in his overflowing wit. Even trauma doesn't seem to bother him much. Once, he was seriously injured, bandaged all over, fractured bones, and bled a lot. I went to see him, always thinking he was lying in bed, but unexpectedly he told me he was on a high hill in the garden. I went in and didn't see anyone, but I could clearly hear bursts of laughter coming from behind a holly bush. I followed the sound and found him. He didn't notice my arrival, didn't notice his own trauma, and was writing with his unbandaged hand, laughing loudly and happily.

Even as a reformer, what interests him is the ideal. Although he faces and understands worldly affairs, I think his excitement is mainly not out of sympathy for human suffering, but more because of the absurdity of the suffering and the facilities that cause it. He reforms with ridicule and cold logic, more than appealing to emotion.

Of course, one cannot forget his extreme "hatred of cruelty," hatred of cruelty whether to humans or to animals. He seems not to belong to our meat-eating race. This race's main pleasure in life is what we call "sports," that is, "hunting," "shooting," and "fishing," often inflicting death and trauma on almost every living and sentient being. Similarly, he hates the oppression of humanity; it's not that he particularly likes foxes in the city or the poor. It's just that he can't bear to see them mistreated.

Praising him for "filling the world with laughter" is too easy to understand, but two points are worth noting. First, I doubt that there has ever been a great intellectual and satirist in human history like him who never attacked private individuals with malice. He would vehemently attack behaviors or facilities that he considered cruel or unfair. However, he never involved private individuals. Like second-rate satirists, or even great predecessors like Voltaire and Aristophanes, he never thought of hurting others as much as they did. However, like these two, he has a great quality that many satirists lack: he has genuine respect and appreciation for masterpieces of poetry, painting, sound, and music. Among contemporary scholars, few have a deeper knowledge of Shakespeare studies than him. He is always paying attention to the geniuses of his contemporaries (not envy or jealousy); he has rejoiced for Tolstoy, Ibsen, Maeterlinck, and Rodin. He tirelessly gives help to young British writers.

His "courage never disappears." I am not only referring to his fearless attack on all vested beliefs or facilities with privilege and authority. He attacked conservatism and excessive rhetoric, superstition and science, as long as he thought that one of them was too authoritative, he attacked it regardless of everything. He also has a rare quality: the courage of genius, or I might even call it the stubbornness of genius. I still remember when his first play was published, everyone thought it was impossible to put on the stage. Theater managers all said that he had a bit of dramatic talent; as long as he could change his obscure script, or find a writer with quick wit and knowledge of the theater to help him rewrite it, they might be quite worth performing. But twenty years later, he finally persevered and wrote a script that someone dared to perform—"Arms and the Man." It immediately achieved success, and not long after, Shaw gained his current position and became Europe's most famous and widely read playwright.

In addition to all his amazing talents, he is one of the most kind and generous people. I will not call him the smartest person. His practical talent is not constructive, but analytical. Once, he defended several of his works in "Saturday Review," boldly writing, "Who am I, that I should be fair and impartial?" This is an honest defense. It is not his job to weigh the factors of dispute, carefully synthesize them, and point out a proper path. Officials and rulers can do these. Shaw's job is to point out those wrong but unrecognized things; sometimes, he even does so with exaggerated or biased strokes, so that people can face those things that they cannot see or do not want to see.

I never knew what it meant to be busy, what it meant to be tired, but in our Tongxian Provisional Action Headquarters office, apart from other things, just look at the personnel coming and going, reporting, commanding, dispatching; and listen to the ding-a-ling of the telephone, and the faint, secret buzzing of the telegraph machine from the next room, ringing and buzzing non-stop, the captain, holding the earpiece in one hand, receiving telegrams in the other, issuing orders with his mouth, and reading reports with his eyes; all of this and so on, even just sitting there minding your own business, just listening and watching, would make you feel dizzy, headache, and tinnitus.

The head from Peiping is now in the Twelfth Regiment, and has taken office as the provisional chief of staff. In reality, he is monitoring the puppet autonomous army, fearing that it will take overstepping actions. On the one hand, I assist the team leader in handling affairs in the office, and on the other hand, I and Tiger are also responsible for the external liaison work after the launch. This responsibility sounds easy and ordinary, but as long as you close your eyes and imagine it, at that time, inside and outside the city, soldiers and horses galloping, guns and cannons shaking the sky, bullets flying around, people shouting, the whole city will be turned into a pot of boiling water in a killing, and you have to manage the situation in all directions, receive and send reports, and make decisions in this chaotic boiling. One mistake, and you may have to pull out a gun and fight for a while. Thinking about it this way, our job is not very easy.

Like me, Tiger is wearing the uniform of the "Security Team," the only difference is that he has shaved his head into a bald monk, while I still have a boy's haircut. At this time, he was lounging in the office with nothing to do, closing one eye and dozing off, the open eye was probably to pay attention, lest he be left behind when we went out. Because the team leader has teased him several times, saying that he is too young, and afraid that he won't be able to suppress people when he starts working. In private, however, he is praised as being omnipotent.

When things are busy, time passes very quickly, and in a flash it is more than three o'clock. The team leader saw that everyone was a little sleepy, so he called the logistics and ordered them to open a few bottles of wine, and take out some ready-made canned food, biscuits and snacks, etc., to wake everyone up, and at the same time, everyone "Cheers" to pre-celebrate the victory and success. The first person to be alarmed was Tiger, and the one eye that was closed immediately opened.

There is another matter about Tiger that should be reported here. Tiger has been much more silent since he came to Tongxian than before. In the past, in front of a large crowd, he would not often interrupt and speak, unless he felt that this sentence had to be said, then he would open his mouth; but when he was alone with me, he was not very silent, and was very trivial, somewhat like an old woman's nagging. These past two days have been a little different, even when he is with me, he doesn't speak; doesn't ask, doesn't answer; as if he has something big on his mind.

Yesterday was especially special. Early in the morning, he asked me for a hundred dollars, saying that he had met someone from near the village who was going home, and he wanted to ask that person to donate some money to his mother. This amount is quite large (in the past, the most he asked for was one dollar for a haircut, a bath, or to buy some snacks); not to mention that, and at the time I proved that he was lying, because when he lied, his big round eyes would blink at least three or four times in a row, this is always accurate. It wasn't that I couldn't immediately pierce his bubble, but I was curious for a moment, and wanted to see what he was up to.

After he took the money, he immediately smiled, talked about everything, and forced out some words to make me laugh; and asked me for two hours of leave (because in public affairs, he is my assistant, and my subordinate, and he must ask me for leave to go out.) I simply agreed very readily, only telling him to go quickly and come back quickly, and don't delay public affairs. I originally planned to secretly follow him to see where he was going, but unfortunately the team leader asked me to talk, and I didn't have time for a while, and let Tiger slip away. He did come back in less than two hours, and I was too lazy to ask further; because it would be useless to ask, knowing that he had already prepared a set of words to deal with me; so why bother?

These past two days have been so busy, but I have been paying attention to his actions at all times. In addition to being overly silent, he is constantly blinking his eyes, as if he is thinking about something. Even at this time, in the office, although he is sitting in the corner of the room on a soft chair, closing one eye to rest, I don't think he is necessarily sound asleep, he must be planning something there.

### Random Words Under Dim Light

— Shaofu

Happiness

Two things called "happiness" that are not happy now.

One is the dispute between the comedian broadcaster Xiao Kuaihuo and Senator Lu Keming, which makes everyone unhappy; the other is the lawsuit between the "Kuaihuo Lin" weekly magazine and the two road bureau chiefs Chen Bozhuang, which has not yet been resolved.

Mayor's Wisdom

Mayor Wu's chauffeur ignored a red light, and the police first stopped him and then let him go, but the mayor sent his secretary to the police station to order that he himself be punished for violating traffic rules. The mainland newspaper commented:

"Sometimes, Mayor Wu Guozhen will use extremely subtle methods to express his thoughts..."

I think the mayor didn't do a thorough job. In addition to ordering that he himself be punished for violating traffic rules, he should also punish the biased traffic police officer who first stopped and then let him go.

Injections

Traveling requires injections, otherwise you can't buy a boat ticket. Here is a survey form:

From Shanghai to Fujian: cholera, smallpox, plague;

To Tianjin: cholera, smallpox, typhoid;

To Ningbo and Wuhan: cholera;

To Taiwan: smallpox, plague, typhoid;

To Guangdong: smallpox, plague;

In short, every step you take, you have to get an injection. I'm a layman, are these injections to prevent infectious diseases in the places you are going? Or are you afraid that people will bring infectious diseases from Shanghai to those places?

### The Way to Wealth

— S·S

Human·Relations·World·Affairs

I wonder if God and mankind are deliberately joking? Or are they adding many thrilling and bizarre patterns to this vast world? Therefore, since the beginning of history, there have been more poor people than rich people anywhere; it is not surprising that there are more poor people, but the wonderful thing is that they also put a few rich and noble people in the mix, so in this noisy world, the poor people have goals in life, the goal of climbing up; climbing all day, climbing every year, until they can't climb anymore and lie down. Seeing the bustling crowds, lost in the dust, climbing up and falling down, falling down and climbing up again, it is pleasing to the eye and very beautiful!

After thousands of years of climbing, the poor have gradually gained some experience and insight. They understand the method of climbing that doubles their efforts. After doing this for a long time, you can take a breath, stretch your waist, wash off the mud, and be a human being. You must not think of the inferiority and pity in front of other people's feet when you are climbing. You should remember that this climbing method is a dogma that the ancestors have painstakingly left behind from generation to generation, and the descendants must carry on the teachings of their ancestors and carry them forward.

The poor have a sour smell, which is the biggest obstacle when climbing in front of the rich; so you should have self-knowledge, and despite your shabby clothes, you should look cheerful and welcoming, and your conversation should be gentle and flattering, but not cliché; for example, if you know that the master you are flattering is a descendant of the Qing Dynasty, a local gentry, then when you are holding a water pipe and agreeing with his wishes, you should scold science and hate people, but you cannot overly deny science and people, because the old masters are very clear that this time the Japanese were indeed defeated by the atomic bomb; if your master is a person who believes that their ancestors immigrated from Europe or America, then you should boast about how magnificent the Alps are compared to several earthen mounds in northwest China, and emphasize that the Mississippi River is much more majestic than several muddy ditches in southeastern China; in the midst of your conversation, if the master's children "John" and "Little Mary" are eating with ration food boxes, this is another wonderful opportunity; you can start by constantly praising how foreign countries attach importance to and reasonably distribute national nutrition, and then analyze the ignorance, poverty, and poor appearance we showed in this war, and draw the conclusion by depicting the luxurious scene of people throwing surplus materials into the sea; you are barking like a dog and imitating the sound, shrugging your shoulders and pretending, and the masters will also shake their heads and smile without saying a word, and then when he meditates for a while, he pats you on the shoulder and says: "Old brother is really a discerning person!" You must not panic, bow your head and listen, expressing that you have met a patron, you have no regrets even in death, and you are willing to listen to his orders, or do anything to repay his kindness!

And so on, if you happen to meet a master who used to be a traitor, and is now still sitting high above one person and above millions of people somewhere, you must not tell him: the news that a close friend who used to be in the same temple with him has been executed; if you have a master who became rich by "national disaster wealth," "victory wealth," and "reception wealth," and was spared investigation due to his long sleeves and good dancing, you should explain to him: that the wealth that comes without asking is originally the principle of taking it without harming integrity and being generous; if you happen to encounter a master who has just climbed up like you, you should express your understanding and comprehension of his "climbing method," and prostrate yourself, stating "I am born with a humble appearance and cannot reach high," congratulating him on being able to support later generations, which is really the demeanor of an elder and the intention of a benevolent person. You should climb slowly along their feet, and pat their backs lightly, then: the masters will regard you as a close friend, the compatriots will treat you as a slave and a dog, and the group below who also pat your ass will directly regard you as "a lifelong model," then you can be considered to have climbed up a level.

After you have climbed up, although you are still far from the standard of great wealth and honor, you may as well take a small rest and relax your claws that have been exhausted from climbing; at this time, you can brag to the younger generations who are climbing up following your feet, and to the friends who are struggling in the "climbing ranks"; to the former, you should put on a solemn appearance and explain to them the essence and subtlety of the "philosophy of climbing," and to the latter, you should proclaim the logic of "Hu Shih is my friend," and especially introduce your former masters, explaining that these are all relatives, old friends, and fellow villagers; although they feel that your bombastic remarks are overwhelming, they can do nothing about it, and still have to express that I am not as good as you and respect you very much; in this way, you can leave the circle of the poor step by step. However, you also have to pay attention to the timing, and look for a richer master to offer your past skills, flattering as usual, climbing when you are done flattering, and bragging again when you climb up, bragging in all directions, and everyone follows you, and you end up climbing to the "celebrity" throne, you may as well steal some time from your busy schedule and shout a high-pitched "Wealth is like floating clouds to me," and hum a low-pitched "Be grateful for the times and cherish your blessings," and you are guaranteed to be in harmony with a hundred voices and leave a lasting reputation!

The philosophy of "climbing" is like this, I am willing to make it public, the vast world, the sea of suffering is boundless, there are too many poor people, turning back is the shore, may we climb together and reach the Pure Land together! Amitabha.

### Good Words

— Hong Guo

There are two kinds of property that must never be wasted arbitrarily; one is the body, and the other is time. The increase of knowledge and the success of career all depend on this!

Cleverness is a thing that often mixes with laziness.

Courtship and lending money are two difficult problems in life, (but as long as they are not abused, then muster up the courage.

To be a strong person, not a weak person; the so-called strong is to be strong in being able to manage oneself, control oneself, and dominate oneself. And know that; practicing one maxim is stronger than saying a hundred maxims.

### Quasi-Foreigner

— Bi Jun

In a certain church university in Shanghai, nine out of ten of the more than nine hundred students are Chinese, and one out of ten are foreign students. Among the nine-tenths of Chinese students, there are a few who speak foreign languages fluently, wear foreign clothes, and have foreign names. They are practically Chinese people who look like foreigners. These students can never be satisfied with being Chinese, but they claim to be Chinese!

Although not all Chinese people necessarily know Chinese characters, a Chinese person must be able to speak Chinese (unless they are mute). It is truly shameful to discover students who do not know their own national characters, especially in China's highest institutions of learning. This group of Chinese students who cannot speak their own language is simply shameless. Originally, there was a "Chinese" course in the first year of the school, but they were exempted from it, just like the real foreign students. Indeed, they are not much different from foreigners; they speak foreign languages, look like foreigners, and some even have birth certificates from Madagascar, Columbia... They were born in foreign environments, speak foreign languages, are protected by foreigners, and attend schools managed by foreigners. They receive different treatment from Chinese students at school. If you happen to talk to them for a while, they will shamelessly tell you in a foreign language, "I am also Chinese."

They receive preferential treatment at school because the people in charge are foreigners. They can avoid paying tuition and eat without spending money. The expenses of these students with unclear nationalities are entirely made up for by the tuition fees of Chinese students. The fists of these half-foreigners when they are excited are also received by Chinese students. They clearly look down on Chinese people, but they often express in words that they are Chinese!

Seeing that overseas Chinese schools are being banned from teaching Chinese by the authorities, the overseas Chinese are indignantly calling for action. Seeing the slave-like nature of these "quasi-foreigners" makes me want to cry but I can't, and I want to laugh but I can't!

### Turtle King

— Yu Qiang

No matter how high or low the occupation, as long as it is managed properly, you can "excel in any profession." Two brothers in New York's Broadway—Al Gould and Stanton Gould—have become rich by selling painted turtles and can be said to be "top students" outside of the 360 professions.

Eight years ago, the Gould brothers started this novel business. After several years of hard work, the business flourished, and they have become wholesalers of "hard-shelled products." Gift shops and dime stores all over the United States carry these novelties. In addition to the old store on Broadway, they have added several branches in downtown Manhattan.

These "hard-shell products" are turtles painted with various colors, about the size of a pocket watch, and sell for an average of forty-five cents each. Customers can choose a name or a few words to be engraved on the turtle's back in indelible ink. Some people engrave their girlfriend's name, some use them as birthday or wedding gifts, some use them for advertising or display, and some even use them for marriage proposals.

Hollywood star Bing Crosby once ordered a batch of "hard-shelled products" for his four children. Shirley Temple, Deanna Durbin, and other Hollywood stars are fond of these novelties. Even the serious Charlie Chaplin could not "avoid vulgarity." Former British Prime Minister Chamberlain once mail-ordered fifty of them to give to his grandchildren. The package for the turtles is a special box with ventilation holes and lined with damp moss.

There are many reasons to buy these slow-moving animals. Parents often buy two larger turtles to take home and paint for their children. A week later, they buy a smaller one, and after the children go to sleep that night, they put the little turtle with its "parents." The next morning, the children discover this "miracle" and shout with joy, saying that the little turtle was brought by "cranes."

Some people believe that turtles bring good luck, so they buy one for "good luck." Others who are too lazy to reply to letters and feel bad about it send a turtle with the inscription: "My reply is as slow as this guy."

The most interesting customer of the Gould brothers is a father of two children. He bought three turtles and made a fortune. He engraved the names of his two children on two turtles, respectively, and the name of his family's wealthy friend Nana on the other. Later, Nana visited his house and saw her "namesake." She was touched by the gesture of friendship and took out a sum of money to establish an educational fund for the two children.

The Gould brothers have turtle farms in two towns in Louisiana. About 15,000 turtles arrive in New York every week, arranged in rows in boxes filled with moss, most of which come from Louisiana. After arriving in New York, the turtles are placed in large buckets to await "manufacturing." The first step is to apply a layer of protective white to the turtle's shell. Then, these little creatures are clamped up in strings of a dozen at a time with a yardstick, while a skilled female worker brushes them. Then they are placed on a rack to dry. The next step is to add a thick layer of enamel—red, yellow, and blue are the three most popular colors.

If the turtle is large, it is suitable for birthdays or weddings. After the turtles are selected, appropriate pictures are painted on their backs with special pigments. The "finished" turtles are displayed in partially filled buckets of water—the water in the buckets is warm in winter to prevent hibernation, and cool in summer to "relieve the heat."

The Gould brothers sell a special turtle feed containing dried ant eggs and dried flies. The former comes from Finland, and the latter comes from Mexico.

The Gould brothers also sell another novelty: small alligators. However, the "Turtle King" complains that alligators are not very tame, are not easy to obtain year-round, and do not have much appeal. Therefore, from a business standpoint, the Gould brothers still prefer turtles.

### National Treasure · White-Haired Youth: The Witty Mr. Wu Zhihui (Part 1)

— Jifeng

Everyone is familiar with this aloof and witty Mr. Wu Zhihui. When senior officials of the National Government take office, he is the veteran supervisor, and there is always an admonition, with a few witty remarks interspersed in the solemnity. On the 15th of this month, Mr. Fang Zhi, the new chairman of the city party headquarters, was sworn in, and the presiding officer was none other than this 81-year-old Mr. Wu. Recently, Mr. Wu also presided over the National Language Promotion Committee in Shanghai (see this newspaper on the 16th).

Morality and Writing

Mr. Wu is a veteran of the Kuomintang, and his morality and writing are the best of the age. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek respects him as a "national treasure," Feng Yuxiang once called him a "white-haired youth," and Hu Shi praised him as "one of the great thinkers of the last three hundred years." He is extremely aloof, strives to restrain himself, and has always taken not being an official, not riding in rickshaws, and not using servants as his guiding principles in life. In Chongqing, he often wore old cloth clothes, carried a cane, and walked around the streets. The "anti-war house" where he lived had thin tiles and a bamboo-framed roof, and was built of bamboo and mud. The furnishings were very simple, and the room could only accommodate a few people.

Changed His Name to Jingheng

Mr. Wu was originally from Xueyanqiao, Wujin. When he was a boy, he went to Yanghu County (under the jurisdiction of Changzhou Prefecture) to take the children's examination. Because his accent sounded like someone from Wuxi, the other candidates suspected that he was impersonating, and they beat him in a group. Therefore, Mr. Wu Zhihui hated it so much that he considered himself a native of Wuxi for the rest of his life. In the 17th year of Guangxu, he passed the imperial examination. However, he was extremely opposed to feudal ideas. Once, Mr. Wu's clan was compiling the genealogy, and he did not approve of it. He angrily overturned all the character plates, which greatly angered the clan chief and the mediators. He had no choice but to flee his hometown. In the 24th year of Guangxu, he served as the principal of Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, and together with Yuan He Chen Chu-zhi, he agreed not to read thread-bound books again. He also believed that lacking respect and sincerity was not enough to bear the weight of the world," so he changed his name to Jingheng.

In the 10th year of the Republic, he served as the vice-principal of the Sino-French University in Lyon and led a group of students abroad. One day, Mr. Wu picked up a note on the ship, personally washed it clean, and then issued a notice: "A smelly pair of pants was found on the ground and has been washed clean. Whose is it? Please claim it." Sometimes, when students threw melon seeds and nutshells everywhere, Mr. Wu would personally hold a broom and sweep them clean.

Vowed Not to Be an Official

In the 13th year of the Republic, he served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and has been re-elected ever since. As a founding elder of the country, he is the elder of the elders. Moreover, because he vowed not to be an official, he does not hold any other positions except as a member of the Supervisory Committee, and he does not easily participate in important meetings. Therefore, he has also won the only title of "a famous recluse in the court." (To be continued)
