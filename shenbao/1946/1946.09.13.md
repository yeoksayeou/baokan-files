### Mr. Ma and Ambassador Stuart Tirelessly Seek Ways to Resolve the Current Situation; Yesterday They Met Separately with Song Ziwen and Zhou Enlai, and Today They Will Receive Wu Dingchang and Zhang Lisheng

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] Peace talks continued with contacts on the 12th. Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 9:45 AM on the 12th to discuss the situation and sticking points of his meetings with Zhou Enlai over the past few days for an hour and a half. Both men maintained their confidence and resolved to continue their efforts for this major mission of peace. Around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, Ambassador Stuart invited Zhou Enlai by phone to meet at the embassy at 4:00 PM. Zhou arrived as scheduled and left at 5:45 PM. It is reported that during the meeting, Zhou believed that the domestic war was expanding daily, and it was currently necessary to obtain a ceasefire guarantee and an immediate ceasefire in action. As for the informal five-person group meeting proposed by Ma and Stuart two weeks ago, it is currently impossible to realize. An authoritative source also said: This matter is also the same as some past events that could not be resolved and were shelved. Although the five-person group meeting was actually a temporary organization that could solve the problem, it had to be classified as a "deferred" item in the "file." This statement is very meaningful. Ambassador Stuart then left the embassy at 6:45 PM to visit Special Envoy Marshall. The reporter conducted a two-minute interview before his departure. The ambassador was in good spirits. The reporter first asked if there were any new developments in the current situation. He replied, "I think there is hope." When asked again whether he intended to find a new path outside of the five-person group meeting, he replied, "I cannot say now." Finally, when asked whether he would first seek a solution in the military aspect and then discuss politics, he replied, "I must meet with Special Envoy Marshall again before I can say." He smiled and nodded, saying that after meeting with Special Envoy Marshall, there might be a solution. He then took a car to Ninghai Road and returned to the embassy half an hour later to host a banquet.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] According to Chuan Jingbo, private advisor to Ambassador Stuart: The news has been relatively quiet in recent days, but I believe that there will be developments in the next two or three days, with big news. When the reporter asked if it was the big news of Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing, Chuan replied that Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing is certainly big news, and some other things may also develop as a result of the Chairman's return to Nanjing. (For Director Wu Dingchang's talk on the overall situation published in Shanghai, please see page two.)

[United Press Washington, 11th] Washington Post columnist Belang wrote today that Special Envoy Marshall recently reported to the US government on the mediation of peace in China, saying that it had reached the end. The armed conflict between the Chinese government forces and the Chinese Communist forces aided by Moscow is becoming increasingly tense, and it is difficult to expect any decision in the overall situation for the time being. China will increasingly become a battleground for democratic and communist ideas. President Truman may soon choose whether to continue supporting the formal government of China or to succumb to the opposition, withdraw all aid to the Nationalist government, and allow the Soviet Union to fully support Yan'an.

Zhou Enlai Suggests

Resuming the Three-Person Group Talks

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] After Special Envoy Marshall's meeting with Zhou Enlai, the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation said that Zhou believed that the informal five-person group meeting was unnecessary because it could not solve the problem. The most important thing at present is a ceasefire, so he suggested convening a military three-person group meeting to seek a solution. This suggestion will be conveyed by Special Envoy Marshall to the government representatives. If it is agreed, the military three-person group meeting will be reopened. At 7:30 PM on the 12th, Special Envoy Marshall went to President Song's residence for a long talk, which is believed to be related to this matter. Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng will also visit Ambassador Stuart again on the 13th. This frequent contact shows that there is a new turn in the current situation.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] According to a report by United Press Nanjing on the 11th, "Communist spokesman Wang Bingnan said: Chairman Chiang has rejected the guarantee of a ceasefire order and has put forward a counter-proposal that the Communist Party cannot accept. The counter-proposal and rejection letter have been handed over to Zhou Enlai by Special Envoy Marshall during the Ma-Zhou meeting on the 12th." Regarding this matter, the reporter recently visited relevant parties, who said: There is no such thing. Chairman Chiang did not transfer any documents to Zhou. Fan Changjiang, the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation, also said: No documents were handed over to Zhou.

[United Press Nanjing, 12th] The Chinese Communists, having suffered setbacks on the North China battlefield, propose immediately reconvening the military three-person group meeting in an attempt to quickly promote a comprehensive ceasefire. The actions of the Chinese Communists today clearly represent a step back from their original demand for an unconditional ceasefire, and they seem willing to seek a peaceful solution through the three-person group, possibly with conditions attached.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] It is rumored that the Yan'an side has prepared a draft constitution, which will be submitted by the "People's Congress of the Liberated Areas." This draft constitution appeared in the Shanghai-Nanjing area in early September. Relevant parties believe that Yan'an is currently using its so-called "People's Congress" constitution draft for political psychological warfare.

### National Army Continues to Recover Zunhua; Communist Forces in Eastern Hebei Gather in Pinggu and Malanyu; Anti-Communist Work in Southern Hebei Proceeds Smoothly

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] The National Army in eastern Hebei recovered Zunhua, the location of the headquarters of the Communist Eastern Hebei Military Region, yesterday. There are also reports of the recovery of Jixian, but this has not been confirmed. It is reported that since the launch of the anti-Communist campaign in eastern Hebei, there have been no encounters with the main force of the Communist army. The longest battle lasted no more than three hours. Li Yunchang's main force is concentrated in the Pinggu and Malanyu areas on the border between Hebei and Jehol.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] The National Army on the north and south lines of the Pingcheng Railway met at Shixia North at 2:00 PM yesterday. The railway repair work will begin immediately from both ends.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] Baoding Telephone. The anti-Communist work in central and southern Hebei is proceeding smoothly. The National Army south of Baoding recovered Tiangezhuang and is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army in the Libazhuang area. The National Army has recovered twenty-eight villages and towns. The Communist army is retreating towards Lixian and Boye. In order to prevent and contain the National Army's advance, the local Communist army transferred three regiments and more than 2,000 militiamen from the east last night to launch a fierce attack on Daweicun, forty li southwest of Baoding, for seven hours. The National Army east of Baoding recovered Liujiakou, an important road between Gaoyang and Baoding, on the evening of the 10th, and divided its troops to advance towards Anxin. It has encountered the Communist army at Chashang in the county. The Communist army in Gaoyang city is preparing to withdraw and is transporting materials to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

### The Chinese Communist's So-Called Government Formation Is a Political Trick; American Broadcaster Exposes It with One Word

[United States Information Service Washington, 11th] Radio commentator Davis said on the American Broadcasting Corporation yesterday: "The Chinese Communist Party is threatening the Chinese government by establishing another 'autonomous government.' This kind of intimidation is not taken seriously, because this kind of intimidation is just another action in the Chinese political game. In Chinese political games, war and propaganda often go hand in hand." Davis said: "In fact, the Chinese Communists already have a government in various parts of North China. This kind of government is in fact autonomous, but in January of this year, the Chinese Communists agreed that once a united government is established, they will place their autonomous government under the control of the new government. Some people are worried about this kind of change, because this kind of autonomous government is said to be established in northern Manchuria on the border with the Soviet Union. If so, then this kind of autonomous government is temporarily nominally an independent country like Outer Mongolia or Bulgaria, and when the time is ripe, it will be merged into the Soviet Federal Republic.

### Communist Troops Raiding Kangping Fleeing Towards Tongliao

[Central News Agency Yang, 12th] After being counterattacked by the National Army, the Communist troops that raided Kangping from Tongliao and Liaoyuan have fled back the way they came.

### People in Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu Gain True Liberation

[Central News Agency This City] According to visitors from northern Jiangsu: The people in the areas advanced by the National Army have gained the greatest spiritual liberation in two aspects: (1) They can control their own food, and (2) They don't have to attend meetings. Because in the Communist-occupied areas, the common people had to beg the army for food, not the army begging the common people for food. At the same time, regardless of women and children, they had to attend meetings every day. They really had no way to complain, and they couldn't express their suffering. Therefore, once the pressure was relieved, everyone rejoiced endlessly.

### Huang Renlin Flies to Chengde on Behalf of Madam Chiang for Disaster Relief

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] Chengde News. Chengde has been greatly damaged by the Communist army, and the citizens are in urgent need of relief.

In addition, the Rehe Imperial Villa was also damaged by the Communist army, and the entire courtyard was filled with landmines.

[Central News Agency This City] According to Wu Dingchang, Director of the Secretariat, who arrived in Shanghai from Guling a few days ago: The Chairman will descend the mountain soon, first to Nanchang, and then return to Nanjing. Except for the Chairman's attendants and secretaries, the staff of the Secretariat in Guling have all returned to Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper Nanchang, 11th] The enthusiasm of all circles in Nanchang to welcome the Chairman can be described as unprecedented.

### National and Communist Armies Reinforce Continuously; Jining Will Launch a Decisive Battle; Communist Forces Besieging Datong Are Showing Signs of Wavering

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] A major battle is brewing in Jining, and the outcome will affect the entire situation in the Northwest. The National Army in eastern Suiyuan is fighting fiercely with the Communist army today in the Gaodi west of the Six Rooms and Zhao Jiagou southwest of Jining. On the evening of the 10th, the National Army once rushed into Jining. At 5:00 AM on the 11th, the Communist army reinforced with six or seven thousand troops, and at 10:00 AM reinforced with more than ten thousand troops for the second time. A small number of National Army soldiers who entered the city were forced to withdraw, but the city of Jining is still surrounded by the National Army's infantry and cavalry. It is heard that the air force will participate in the battle starting today, and the National Army's follow-up troops are also heading east one after another. The decisive battle between the National and Communist armies will begin soon. According to another related source, the National Army entered Fengzhen last night and completely recovered it this morning and is advancing towards Datong. The National Army in Jining has cleared the city and is also continuing to advance, but this statement seems to be still unconfirmed.

[Central News Agency Gui Sui, 12th] Xue Zhenhai, the company commander of the 8th company, 3rd battalion, 2nd regiment, 1st Brigade of the Communist Army, surrendered to the National Army on the outskirts of Jining on the 10th with his entire company of officers and soldiers, with complete weapons.

[Central News Agency Gui Sui, 11th] The Communist army is sending a large number of reinforcements to Jining to prevent the National Army from rescuing Datong. It is observed that the battle situation may shift to Jining. Jining is located on the PingSui Railway. It is twelve stations west of Gui Sui and eight stations east of Datong. It is surrounded by mountains on all four sides, and the city is located in a basin. The Iron Army Mountain and Wohu Mountain southeast and northeast of the city are extremely dangerous. After the National Army approached the city of Jining, it occupied the two mountains and the strongholds such as Huangjialiang southwest of the city, which are enough to control the entire city. As of the afternoon of the 11th, the two sides were still in fierce fighting.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 12th] The situation in Shanxi is about to change slightly. Outside Yanmen Pass, the area is now under the command of the Twelfth War Zone, Chuan Zuoyi. The military affairs south of the South Korean Houling in Jin are also about to be transferred to Hu Zongnan's command. Hu's army entering Jin will increase from seven divisions to three armies, but Hu has decided not to change any of Yan Xishan's policies in his garrison. Recently, Hu sent a special plane to Taiyuan to welcome Xue Youcheng, an expert in the integration of soldiers and farmers, and Liang Huazhi, the person in charge of the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, to Xi'an to lecture for his cadre training class. Xue Liangdao has now finished lecturing on the integration of soldiers and farmers and other policies and returned to Beijing.

[Central News Agency Taiyuan, 12th] The Communist army besieging Datong is extremely panicked since the Suiyuan National Army recovered Zhuozishan and advanced to Jining. Although its senior officers have strictly ordered and urged the city to be attacked within a time limit, the lower-level officers and soldiers are mostly timid and unwilling to move forward. The number of people who sneak away and surrender to the National Army is increasing day by day. General observation is that the battle situation in Datong will become more stable.

[Central News Agency Taiyuan, 11th] More than a thousand Communist troops窜 from Songjiazhuang, three miles west of Datong, destroyed the blockhouse outside the West Gate on the night of the 9th. Three thousand Communist troops in Baishou City and Wohu Bay, north of the city, have been strengthening their fortifications for days. On the night of the 9th, the Communist army built fortifications near the airport south of the city and were suppressed by the National Army's firepower and fled. Small groups of Communist troops harassed the east and west sides of the city and the station north of the city at the same time and continued to shell and attack the city. The Communist army southwest of the city has retreated to the Zhoujiadian and Qilicun areas.

[United Press Nanjing, 12th] Government forces continued to advance towards Zhangjiakou today, occupying Jining on the west road and passing Kangzhuang on the south road. According to a broadcast by Yan'an Radio, the Eighth Route Army has occupied Xiaoyi, 300 li southwest of Taiyuan, in central Shanxi. According to a report from Datong, the troops guarding the airport have retreated into the city to strengthen defenses. The Communist infantry and artillery teams continued to attack the city, with one group attempting to climb the city wall from the South Gate, but they were repelled after two hours of fierce fighting.

### The Communist Army's Use of Poison Gas in Datong Cannot Be Concealed by Sophistry

The Shanxi Command Headquarters Refutes Yan'an Broadcast

[Central News Agency Taiyuan, 12th] On the 10th, Yan'an Radio's Xinhua News Agency denied that the Communist army in Datong had used poison gas. A spokesman for the Second War Zone Command recently issued a statement stating: Yan'an's broadcast is purely an attempt to deceive oneself and others in order to achieve its goal of launching a civil war. The Communist army used poison gas in the Datong campaign. General Commander Chu Xichun reported in a telegram on September 8th that on September 123, the Communist army fired more than 200 tear-inducing and sneezing poison gas shells at the station and Yan Yue Temple. 342 officers and soldiers of the National Army and 67 civilians were poisoned. The above facts are on record. How can the Communist Party's sophistry conceal it? It only shows that its crimes are an attempt to cover up its guilt.

### Our Financial Situation is Optimistic; Revenue Has Exceeded Expenditure Since June

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 12th] According to sources, the government's current financial revenue and expenditure situation is very optimistic. The total revenue in June accounted for 60% of the total expenditure, the total revenue in July accounted for 40%, and the total revenue in August accounted for 52%. Therefore, there has been no increase in issuance in recent months. Compared with the wartime government's revenue accounting for only 19% of the total, it is a great improvement. According to the reason for the sharp increase in the percentage of fiscal revenue, in addition to the profits of state-owned enterprises such as the China Textile Corporation and the income from the sale of enemy and puppet materials, there are also various relief materials and the transfer of US military materials in China. This huge input is extremely important to our country's balance of payments. It is reported that the government's total expenditure in August was approximately 400 billion.

Declaration in Full

[Central News Agency, Guling, 12th] The Declaration of the Second National Congress of the Three Principles of the People Youth Corps is as follows:

Our Corps was born in Wuchang, the site of the first uprising of the Xinhai Revolution, on March 9, 1938. Subsequently, on March 29, 1943, the anniversary of the Huanghuagang Martyrs, the First National Congress was convened in Chongqing, the wartime capital. Now, on September 1 of this year, the Second National Congress is convened in Lushan, the sacred site where the national policy of 抗战 (Resistance War) was determined. Looking back from its birth to the present, eight years have passed. During these eight years, our country and our nation have truly been at a critical juncture of life and death. With the great inspiration of the Three Principles of the People and the wise leadership of our President, the comrades of our Corps have gloriously participated in the sacred work of the Resistance War. After a long and arduous struggle, we have finally achieved the final victory. We have always regarded safeguarding the country, revitalizing the nation, and realizing the Three Principles of the People as our mission. The number of Corps members has increased to over 1.4 million during this Resistance War, making our Corps the greatest youth organization in our country's history. This makes us even more convinced that our efforts are not in vain, and that the future of the Republic of China will inevitably achieve the goals of equality, freedom, prosperity, strength, and well-being through our continued efforts. We have not lived in vain in this great era, and we must fulfill the mission entrusted to us by this great era. Now, on the closing day of this Congress, we wish to make a frank statement of our views to our compatriots throughout the country and to the youth throughout the country. (1) First of all, we must point out to the youth of our country that the Chinese National Revolution has today entered the darkest and most difficult period before reaching its ultimate success. The unity of the country is threatened by destruction, and the fate of the nation is on the verge of a crisis of weakness. However, our confidence in the revolution should become stronger and stronger, and our efforts to build the country must be redoubled. We firmly believe that with the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father as our guide, the brightness of the future will be even more apparent in this darkness. We firmly believe that with our Corps Leader leading us to work hard for the National Revolution, we will definitely be able to safeguard the unity of the country and complete the mission of building the country. Therefore, we are absolutely optimistic about the future of the revolution, and there is no doubt that the building of the country will be successful. What we are saddened and grieved about today is that at this critical moment of national survival, society lacks a sense of right and wrong, people's hearts are turning to decadence, and even good and evil are reversed, and right and wrong are indistinguishable. The nation's inherent morality has been swept away, and the responsibilities that citizens should have are disregarded. All of these are enough to plunge the country and the nation into chaos and ruin, and are definitely not what should be present during the period of national revival and construction. We, the youth, living in this turbulent and shocking era, must identify our goals, distinguish between right and wrong, correct our direction, and be determined to be the pillars of the country and to save the nation from the brink of collapse, so as to fulfill the responsibilities that our generation should have to the country and the nation. The rise and fall, governance and chaos of the country, and the success or failure, honor or disgrace of the revolution are most closely related to us, the youth, and we, the youth, bear the greatest responsibility. We must not follow others blindly, drift with the tide, or stand by idly and abandon our natural duties. Otherwise, the future generations of the Chinese nation will be reduced to slaves of foreign races, and we, the youth of today, will become sinners for all eternity. In order to understand our responsibilities and missions, we should conduct a serious review of the current international and domestic situation. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Chief Secretary Wu Discusses the Overall Situation; The Government Sincerely Hopes for the Realization of the Five-Person Talks; Zhang Qun's Trip to the United States is Purely for Treating a Malignant Tumor

[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Wu Dingchang, Chief Secretary of the National Government, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Guling on the afternoon of the 9th. Yesterday, reporters specially visited his residence to inquire about his observations on the Five-Person Group Talks. Mr. Wu said: The Five-Person Group was proposed by Special Envoy Marshall, who clearly stated that it was only to discuss the reorganization of the National Government and did not attach any preconditions. After the government is reorganized, other issues will naturally be easily resolved. Therefore, the government expressed its approval. The two conditions recently proposed by the Chinese Communist Party were not known to the government before Special Envoy Marshall went to Lushan seven times. The only expectation of the government at present is that the Five-Person Talks will be realized as soon as possible and achieve complete success. As for the issue of ceasefire, it should be continued to be discussed by the Three-Person Group. Mr. Wu also stated: The government has long had the sincerity to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Chairman Chiang has already explained this in the August 14th 文吿 (Public Statement). The reorganization of the government is only a part of the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. When reporters inquired about whether there was any agreement on the restoration of transportation, Mr. Wu replied: On June 30, both parties reached an agreement on the full restoration of transportation and the withdrawal of the Chinese Communist Party from the Northeast region. However, because the Chinese Communist Party insisted on other conditions, it was not signed. Mr. Wu believes that the overall situation will definitely not be prolonged for long, and there is hope for the realization of peace.

Regarding the trip of Sichuan Chairman Zhang Yuejun to the United States, it is indeed for medical treatment. Two years ago, a small lump appeared behind his ear. Due to busy official duties, he had not had it removed. Recently, on the advice of Doctor Dong Bingqi, he underwent surgery. The situation is good, and the wound is gradually healing. However, after Doctor Dong examined the removed object, he believed that it was a malignant tumor and must be examined for the root cause with deep X-rays as soon as possible. Otherwise, it may become a major problem. There are only two such instruments in our country, one in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai, which has long been abandoned, and one in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beiping. After an electric inquiry, it was found that it was also unusable. Therefore, it was decided to go to the United States for treatment. This news was initially learned by a reporter from the Central News Agency from Doctor Dong. It was transmitted to the capital, and then Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng telegraphed the information to me. I immediately reported it to the Chairman, who initially did not believe it. It was not until the 7th of this month that Zhang sent a telegram to Guling, asking the Chairman for a three-month leave, that it was confirmed.

I immediately came to Shanghai from Guling. The Chairman's letter to Zhang only contained a few words, hoping that he would return to the country immediately after his health recovered. As for the various rumors from the outside world, they are absolutely not true.

### Overview of the Work of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch

Branch Director Reports to Press Corps

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 11th] The Jinghu-Han Press Corps visiting Nanchang attended a press conference of the UNRRA Jiangxi Branch this morning after visiting various organs of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Provincial Party Headquarters, and Municipal Government. Deputy Branch Director Huang Guangdou briefly reported on the general disasters caused by the war in various counties of Jiangxi Province, and then briefly described the branch's business, from passive relief to actively taking post-disaster measures. He also said that the branch had approximately 40,000 buildings in Nanchang before the war, and approximately 30,000 were bombed and burned during the war, so most of the refugees returning to the province had nowhere to live. The branch has now established ten civilian villages and two nurseries. The branch's countermeasure for relieving the disaster-stricken rural areas is that Jiangxi's heavily disaster-stricken villages, such as many villages under the jurisdiction of De'an County on the Nanshun Road, are not only deserted, with no cattle left, but also the houses that farmers must have are mostly in ruins. Farmers have nowhere to live, and the rural workforce will never be able to recover. Therefore, the branch plans to start by building new farmhouses and imitating new farm tools, hoping to address the actual needs of rural disaster areas in Jiangxi, implement post-disaster policies, and seek revival. After Mr. Huang finished speaking, the reporters asked some questions and agreed to visit the civilian villages sponsored by the branch and visit the Jiangxi refugees at a selected time.

Editorial

### The Key to Governance Lies in Implementation!

The Supreme National Defense Council held a regular meeting in the capital the day before yesterday and passed the government's administrative guidelines for the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), of which the three most important are: (1) Implementing constitutional government and promoting democratic politics; (2) Reorganizing the military and ensuring the nationalization of the army; (3) Reforming agricultural land, revitalizing the countryside, and improving the lives of farmers.

Although the above three guidelines are clichés that are well-known and not novel, observing the domestic political situation, what the general public hopes from the government, and what China's politics urgently needs to reform, are nothing more than these three principles. Governance does not require many words; as long as the government can be down-to-earth, sincerely work towards it, and strive for its realization, rather than treating it as mere lip service, then the future of Chinese politics can unfold a bright future.

First, our country is promoting democratic politics. This is not only to adapt to the world trend and to live up to the expectations of friendly countries, but also because the whole country believes that the only way out for Chinese politics is rapid democratization. Because the current political ills lie primarily in the lack of administrative efficiency, the increase in redundant personnel while business declines, and the abundance of discussions with few successes. Secondly, the wind of corruption is deeply entrenched, and the punishment of corruption often starts with great fanfare but ends weakly, with much thunder and little rain. How to improve administrative efficiency? How to cultivate a clean and honest political atmosphere? Only the sincere implementation of democratic politics is the right remedy. Because the above two major abuses are all symptoms of bureaucratic politics, only by allowing the people to directly participate in politics can the abuse of private interests be eliminated, and the chronic diseases of deception and fraud be eradicated. Democratic politics must be from the bottom up, so the most important thing is to establish local public opinion organs in all provinces, cities, and counties as much as possible, and effectively supervise the government. As for the implementation of constitutional government, first, there must be a constitution as a norm for the whole country to abide by, so the issue of the draft constitution should be resolved as soon as possible, and the National Assembly, which is responsible for drafting the constitution, should not be postponed again, since the government has scheduled it to be held on November 12th.

Second, the nationalization of the army is not only urgently needed to ensure national unity and peace, but also for the future of national rejuvenation, it should be promoted as soon as possible. In any democratic country, there is no political party that owns an army, let alone uses force as a tool for political struggle; otherwise, civil war cannot be avoided. The reason why there is a Communist Party border region government in China that is divided and self-reliant is because the Communist Party has its own army, believes in force, and feels that it has nothing to fear, so it can do whatever it wants. Therefore, if the nationalization of the army cannot be realized one day, there will be no guarantee of domestic peace for one day. At the same time, China has undergone eight years of arduous war of resistance, and the material sacrifices and losses can hardly be quantified. After the war, after painful reflection, the army should be reorganized as soon as possible to reduce the country's expenses and concentrate our human and material resources on the great cause of national construction and rejuvenation.

Third, when it comes to revitalizing the countryside, 80% of the Chinese people are farmers. During this war of resistance, they supported the government's national policy of resistance with their vast human and material resources, making the greatest contribution. However, in the technology of agricultural production, they stick to old ways and stand still, so the output has not only not increased, but has gradually decreased. Coupled with natural and man-made disasters, the entire rural society has reached the brink of bankruptcy. Therefore, no one can deny that the focus of national construction and rejuvenation is to revitalize the countryside and improve the lives of the general poor farmers. In addition to cooperating with the United States to improve production technology, we must also consider the environment of rural society, not only must politics be clean and bright, order must be stable, and taxes must be reduced, but also we must quickly plan to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy and promote the land reform policy, so that the general farmers can own their own land and live and work in peace and contentment.

In short, the government's administrative guidelines are correct, and they are not too lofty, but the biggest problem is whether the government has made a great determination to realize the guidelines it has set.

Friendship and Commerce Between China and Britain

The British Goodwill Commercial Delegation, led by Sir Poes, has departed from London for China. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, hosted a farewell banquet in London and gave a speech at the banquet, expressing that the Chinese people have high expectations for the British business community and welcome the delegation to China. He also said that the Chinese market has unlimited potential, and the mutual trust and friendship between the people of China and Britain for centuries cannot be calculated with money. Sir Poes also made a reply speech at the banquet, saying that the purpose of the delegation is to promote friendship and commercial relations between the two countries. It is estimated that the British delegation will arrive in China at the end of this month, and a new page in the relationship between China and Britain will be opened, and trade between the two countries is expected to increase significantly. At the same time, British Ambassador Sir Steven also came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. When he met with people from all walks of life in Shanghai for the first time, he expressed that Britain is willing to assist China in construction and rejuvenation in science, technology, and industry, which shows Ambassador Steven's enthusiasm for China.

The relationship between China and Britain has always been close, and it can be said that it has become a friendship in adversity after this war. The friendship between the two countries should be further consolidated after the baptism of blood. Especially after the war, the Labor Party took over the government after the Conservative Party, and adopted enlightened policies both internally and externally. In today's Britain, both the government and the public are hoping that China can become a strong, unified, and democratic country. Before Ambassador Steven was ordered to come to China, he had already stated: "Britain has no other ambitions in China other than commerce. The British government will do its best to assist China within the greatest possible range to ensure that China becomes a large and unified country." What Britain hopes from China is like this, and what China expects Britain to assist is also only this. Since the opinions of both parties can be the same and mutually understood, it will be easier. Therefore, the future of the relationship between China and Britain has unlimited hope.

All the representatives of the British delegation are magnates in the British business community, and Britain is a modern country that pays attention to industry and commerce, so their words and deeds can not only represent the British business community, but also represent its government. We hope that after the British delegation comes to China, they will conduct on-the-ground investigations and research, and draw up concrete plans for the British government to refer to in order to determine its trade policy towards China, so that it can assist China in construction and rejuvenation with capital and technology as soon as possible, so that both China and Britain can benefit from it.

Investigation and Taxation

Yesterday, this newspaper briefly discussed what the future direction of the Municipal Council should be. It is reported that today's Municipal Council will again discuss whether to participate in the work of the investigation team. Among the various review committees yesterday, the most noteworthy was the municipal budget proposal for the second half of the year and the five proposals on taxation submitted by the municipal government. In general, what the general public is most concerned about at this time is nothing more than two points: (1) Since the Council represents the citizens, and what the citizens have been most dissatisfied with over the years is the "takeover" work, is the Council willing, and does it dare to take responsibility for the investigation? (2) Since the municipal government has no other proposals besides raising taxes, is the Council just acting as a representative for the citizens to approve tax increases?

Let us now briefly describe our humble opinions on these two issues.

First, if there is a problem with the takeover work, the responsibility for the problem lies with the takeover agency, and the takeover agency is government personnel. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with having a public opinion organ conduct an investigation, and it should even be said that it is necessary. It is heard that Team Leader Zhang Zhiben has stated that the investigation work in Shanghai is heavy, and welcomes the Municipal Council to recommend two or three more people to participate, and the investigation time can also be extended as appropriate. In our opinion, the Municipal Council seems unable to refuse again. If it is believed that the participation of a few people is not enough, the Municipal Council can also organize an investigation committee at the same time (the Council Regulations have provisions for establishing various committees) to specialize in investigating all takeover work within the scope of Shanghai in the past year as a backup for the central investigation team. Of course, we may not be able to expect that with the investigation by the Municipal Council, everything can be investigated clearly without any omissions, but the councilors at least claim to come from the people, and if they can conduct careful investigations, there will always be some benefits. If it is ridiculed that the work is not easy to do and it is pushed away, it will be unreasonable.

Second, the municipal government convened a Municipal Council with great solemnity, but the five proposals submitted were only for taxes: (1) Property tax, increase by one to two times to four times in the autumn according to the summer, and each increase by one time in the winter according to the autumn; (2) Municipal tax, also collected according to the current value of the house, from 2/1000 to 3/1000, divided into different grades; (3) Sanitation tax, also collected according to the property tax method, divided into different grades; (4) Municipal tax attached to public utilities, each attached at 10% of the monthly water, electricity, gas, telephone, etc. fees; (5) Restore horse racing and collect taxes. The first four items are expected to increase revenue by 45 billion yuan this year. It is heard that the total budget expenditure of the municipal government for the second half of the year is more than 80 billion yuan, which shows that half of it will rely on these newly added taxes to make up for it. We want to ask the Municipal Council a few questions first: (1) In this meeting, what kind of municipal administration do you want the municipal government to do? (2) What major issues do you plan to discuss besides taxes? (3) Does the municipal government have to report to you first before increasing these taxes on how many roads and bridges will be repaired? How many tons of garbage will be cleaned up? How many drainage pipes will be added? How many more schools will be run? How many more policemen and sanitation workers will be set up? In other words, has a work plan been issued and explained first? (4) The meaning of property tax is originally municipal tax, not housing rental income tax. Now, in addition to property tax, there is also a municipal tax, a sanitation tax, a municipal tax attached to public utilities, etc., which really gives people a sense of "creating names." The municipal government just wants to raise funds anyway. It would be straightforward to have a "one-line whip" and simply collect as much as you want. Why bother with so many taxes and make people unhappy? Otherwise, if sanitation requires a tax, will education require another tax in the future? If public utilities require a tax, will public works require another tax in the future? Police... will they not require even more taxes? In short, if citizens want to run the municipal administration well, they naturally have to pay taxes, and they have to pay full taxes. The municipal councilors are originally representatives of taxpayers, and discussing taxation is also their unshirkable responsibility, but in any case, we must first know the purpose of taxation, and then we must require that the taxes be simple and not involve harshness!

### UN Secretariat Formally Announces General Assembly Postponed to Meet for One Month  Britain and Soviet Union Quarrel in Security Council  Greek-Albanian Border Dispute to be Submitted for Investigation

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 12th Urgent Broadcast: According to news from Lake Success, New York: The United Nations Secretariat announced that the United Nations General Assembly has been officially postponed to October 23rd of this year.

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 11th Broadcast: News from Lake Success, New York: The French representative came up with a compromise, advocating a "fair investigation" of the Greek-Albanian border incident. It is believed that this move will bring an end to the debate in the Security Council. The United States believes that the border conflict involves international relations and is prepared to support the French proposal.

[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] At a meeting of the United Nations Security Council today, Soviet Representative Gromyko and British Representative Jebb once again had a quarrel over the issue of "insulting the Red Army," and finally adjourned the meeting until the 13th. Gromyko firmly opposed the withdrawal of Ukraine's accusations against Britain and Greece. Jebb refuted this, saying that Ukraine openly accused the British army of interfering in Greece. If I accused the Red Army of the same crime, what would the representatives of Ukraine and the Soviet Union think? Gromyko then pointed out that this was an insult to the Red Army. Jebb then re-read the words to prove that they could not be withdrawn.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Soviet Union asked the Security Council to investigate how many troops of the United Nations members are currently stationed outside their great power territories. The United States intends to question the purpose of this move. The Soviet Union's request applies to all territories other than former enemy countries, so according to the Soviet plan, Soviet troops stationed in Hungary and Romania do not need to submit reports. It is expected that this entire issue will be raised in the Security Council soon. US officials believe that the Soviet proposal is intended to put the United States in an embarrassing situation because of its troops stationed in Iceland, etc., and the United Kingdom because of its troops stationed in Greece.

### For the Slavic Group at the Peace Conference, the United States Suddenly Launches a Double Counterattack, Declares Abandonment of Reparation Claims Against Italy, and Demands Disarming of Bulgaria's Southern Border

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The Slavic group attacked Italy and Greece as barriers to the Mediterranean at the peace conference. The United States today suddenly launched a double counterattack, asking the peace conference to at least disarm Bulgaria on the Greek border and pay attention to US aid to Italy, so that it should not be used as reparations for other countries. This statement was made by Jefferson Caffery, the US Ambassador to France, and Sober, an economic expert from the State Department, respectively in the Political and Territorial Committee on the Treaty with Bulgaria and the Economic Committee on the Treaty with Italy. Sober announced that the United States is willing to cancel any compensation claims against Italy for its direct losses of about 20 billion yuan in the two battles in the Mediterranean. The total direct war expenses of the United States are no less than 355 billion yuan, which is equal to the entire national wealth of the United States before the war, but the US government does not want other countries to cancel their compensation claims uniformly. India, Canada, Australia, South Africa and other countries have also abandoned their compensation claims against Italy.

### Our Country's Representatives Hold Fair Views - Former Enemies, Tomorrow's Friends - Claiming Compensation Should Be Based on National Strength

[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th Special Telegram] Our country's representative, Yu Ji, declared in the Italian Economic Committee this afternoon that although Italy had obtained huge reparations from our country after the so-called Boxer Rebellion in 1900, our country is unwilling to claim compensation for this war from Italy. The issue of compensation for our country's losses in the war against Italy will be resolved through negotiations between China and Italy. Yu made a general review of the issue of compensation and appealed to all countries claiming compensation not to make demands that exceed the real and decisive interests of the country being claimed from. Demands that can be met are better than demands that cannot be realized. Yu also asked the representatives of the countries in the Italian Economic Committee to guide their work with a spirit of goodwill, because today's enemy country is tomorrow's friendly country, so it is worthwhile to cultivate their goodwill. Yu concluded by saying that if excessive compensation is claimed from the conquered, it will cause their collapse, which is not the way to world peace. We must have a long-term vision to win peace.

### Italy Demands Relaxation of Land and Naval Limits

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The Peace Conference Military Committee held a meeting today, chaired by Fu Bingchang, the Chinese representative.

Gorati advocated raising the army limit from 22,500 personnel to 35,000 personnel.

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 12th Broadcast: The Military Committee has agreed that the Italian navy may have 46 ships, totaling 67,500 tons.

### Yugoslavia Wants to Negotiate Directly with Italy to Resolve the Border Issue Between the Two Countries

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Yugoslavia seems to want to negotiate directly with Italy to resolve the issue of Trieste and determine the Italian-Yugoslav border. Yugoslavia is exploring whether Italy is willing to establish a condominium-style government in Trieste, so that the area is not directly managed by United Nations agencies. Yugoslavia will then guarantee that Italian residents in Fiume and Gorizia will have some autonomy, and the Pola area will belong to Italy.

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 11th Broadcast: The Economic Committee of the Peace Conference with Italy passed a proposal by the Czech representative to establish a subcommittee to study the Italian-Yugoslav border issue by a vote of eleven to nine.

This civilization has always protected Greece since ancient times, and in the future, it should disarm our country's enemies again and allow us to ensure independence in every aspect. The independence of our country's national policy cannot be obtained by words alone, but only by the stability of our political life. I will do my best to serve the people for this proposition." He has been in exile in London for five years, and this is his first public declaration after the Greek referendum.

[Associated Press, Athens, 11th] The Greek Ministry of Security revealed today that since the referendum on September 1, 83 people have died in conflicts in various parts of Greece, with more casualties on the "bandit side." New conflicts occur every day in the Thessaloniki and Larissa regions.

### British Chief of Staff Arrives in the United States for Consultation to Unify National Defense Control and Study US Military Training for Reference

[US News Service, Washington, 11th] British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery, at the invitation of Eisenhower, arrived in the United States for a visit and paid a visit to President Truman at the White House today.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery recently declared at a press conference that the British government is considering reorganizing British national defense in accordance with US methods. The British and American armies have worked closely together in wartime and cooperated closely. Once a conflict occurs again, the unification of the two countries' armies is sincerely desired by both sides. As for whether ground warfare will become impossible due to the atomic bomb, it cannot be proved at present. The main purpose of my visit to the United States is to study the training methods adopted by US military schools so that the British Army can have a system for rapidly training officers and soldiers after returning home. Speaking of the Soviet Red Army, fighting on the European battlefield is "not to be underestimated." At that time, the Allied forces attacked from the east and west, with the west led by Eisenhower and the east led by Marshal Stalin. When the two armies met, the Allied countries won the victory. It is rumored that I had disagreements with Eisenhower during the war, which is absolutely not true. In addition, it is learned that Montgomery plans to travel to Australia, New Zealand, and other British territories in the Pacific next year.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th United Press] British Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery arrived in the United States and conducted important military consultations with Eisenhower and staff members. He suggested that British and American military plans and equipment should be linked, the organization of each division and corps should be completely consistent, and they should have the same staff organization. Various supplies such as ammunition for tanks and mortars, as well as the caliber of artillery, should be consistent so that either side can use the other's equipment, and soldiers should receive completely comparable training for emergency use.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Field Marshal Montgomery laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery today. When Montgomery's car turned right into the tomb, 17 gun salutes were fired and the band played British and American national anthems. 200 soldiers stood at attention and saluted. Montgomery then drove to the Army Department to address US officers who were under his command during the war.

### The Jewish Question is of Global Significance; Zionist Organizations Arm Themselves; Arabs Claim They Will Adopt Self-Defense Measures

[United Press, London, 11th] The Arab representative stated frankly at the London conference today that he opposes the political status of Jews in Palestine. If unrest occurs again in Palestine, it will cause conflict between Zionists and Arabs. Syrian representative Curry said that the only solution acceptable to the Arabs is to allow Palestine to be independent, in accordance with the democratic principle that favors the Arab majority. Furthermore, no part of it can be cut off for the residence of immigrant groups that share the same religion but not the same ethnicity. The Jewish question is of global concern and therefore requires a global solution. Zionist organizations are arming themselves and implementing terrorism. If British troops cannot stop the unrest, they will force the Arabs to adopt self-defense methods to protect themselves.

[Reuters, London, 11th] The communiqué of the Palestine conference stated that Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech mentioning the international nature of the Palestine issue and asked the conference to adopt a broad perspective. Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, expressed the same opinion. Finally, Hall of the Colonial Office analyzed Britain's partition plan for Palestine.

### Japanese Businessman Makes Shocking Suggestion: Emperor Hirohito Should Personally Go to the Four Allied Nations to Apologize

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] Mr. Takagi, a Japanese vitamin manufacturer, today made a shocking suggestion, advocating that Emperor Hirohito be allowed to fly to the four nations of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China to apologize to President Truman, Prime Minister Attlee, Marshal Stalin, and Chairman Chiang. Once Hirohito returns to Japan, he should be forced to abdicate. According to Takagi's statement to a "Stars and Stripes" reporter, he first conceived of this plan last October and immediately wrote to Prince Higashikuni and Prince Kuni, but Higashikuni ignored him, while Kuni supported Hirohito's visit to the United States. Takagi later wrote an article in the August issue of "News" magazine and distributed 1,000 copies, saying that 800 people who read the proposal expressed their support. Japan's apology to the United States should not be delayed for too long. However, Takagi does not consider the Emperor to be a war criminal, but only recognizes him as the "father" of all Japanese war criminals on trial and responsible for their actions. According to officials at MacArthur's headquarters, Takagi has not yet submitted his plan to MacArthur.

This is a routine cruise exercise, first visiting Shanghai and Qingdao, then coming here, and is scheduled to return to Guam on November 6th.

### Huge State-Owned Enterprise Success Secret: American Grassroots System (Part 2)

— Sent by Our Correspondent Mao Shuqing

The second characteristic of the grassroots system is to strive for development as much as possible.

Unlimited development. The TVA's organization is now more than ten times larger than it was in 1933. Their intention is to expand even further, like the roots of wild grass, extending deep into the soil. However, although they each extend individually, the life of the grass itself is only one. Therefore, there is a division of labor within their connections, and there are also connections within the division of labor. Using the names of Chinese government offices to translate, the Tennessee Valley Authority now has three divisions, nine sections, eight offices, and two departments. At the top is the Board of Directors, and below the Board of Directors is the General Manager. The General Manager has three main divisions: the Power Division, the Water Resources Division, and the Agricultural Land Division. The Power Division has three sections: the Engineering and Construction Section, the Power Management Section, and the Power Usage Section. The Water Resources Division also has three sections: the Design Section, the Construction Section, and the Water Flow Control Section. The Agricultural Land Division also has three sections: the Crop Section, the Forest Section, and the Chemical Engineering Section. In addition, there are eight offices and two departments that report directly to the General Manager: the Personnel Office, the Local Situation Investigation Office, the Property Supply Office, the Local Situation Investigation Office, the Medical Office, the Commercial Office, and the Storage and Management Office. The two departments are the Budget Department and the Information Department. The Information Department includes library materials, film photography, and other reception and publication matters. Such a state-owned enterprise

Such a large organization as a state-owned enterprise like this is easy to divide labor, but difficult to connect. Before the "grassroots system" was implemented, the system of layered responsibility was not implemented. At that time, there was no general manager yet. Therefore, President Roosevelt only appointed a three-person committee (i.e., the later Board of Directors), whose powers and responsibilities were extremely unclear. The Board of Directors had no leader, and the expertise and insights of the three people were different. For example, one of the directors, Morgan, was the president of the University of Tennessee, with a background in entomology. His focus was only on agriculture, not on other aspects. Lilienthal, with a background in law, focused only on the system, organization, and social reaction. As a result, they could not coordinate with each other, and progress was very slow. Five years after the establishment of the TAA, in 1938, Roosevelt decided to implement a system of centralized power for the chairman of the board, but the effectiveness was still limited. Morgan was 71 years old when he became chairman of the board in 1938. It was impossible for such a large enterprise to be fully borne by a 71-year-old man, so the general manager system was later adopted. It was not until Lilienthal became chairman that the entire "grassroots system" of the TAA was established and entered the right track of the administrative system. Here, I should introduce the TVA's

The background and career of the three former and current directors. The first person I should mention is Lilienthal. This young entrepreneur is now the mainstay of the Tennessee Valley Authority. When the TVA was established, Roosevelt sent him to serve as a director. At that time, he was only 33 years old. He is from Illinois and studied in Indiana when he was young. He studied law at Harvard University and did not graduate until 1923. Lilienthal does not have a beautiful resume. If there is one, it is his contribution to the TVA. Since Roosevelt entrusted him with this important mission, this young talent has been working tirelessly in Tennessee. In his book "Democracy on the March," published in 1944, he said, "The TVA has no power, nor does it ever want the power to force farmers to work, to force merchants and landlords to do any work. If it is said that today everyone believes that the TVA has achieved considerable success, then this success should be attributed to the automatic power of the people, to the volunteerism, enthusiasm, and cooperation of democracy." Lilienthal is one who knows how to inspire the enthusiasm of the people and is also one who is good at using the enthusiasm of the people. World War

After the victory, Lilienthal was hired by the State Department to serve as an advisor on atomic energy, but his interest remained in the TVA. I did not see him in Tennessee, but in the reception room, I saw a Chinese painting given to Lilienthal by the China Resources Committee. The second person to introduce is the former chairman of the board, Mr. Morgan, the current director. He is from Ontario, Canada, and Ontario is a famous place for hydroelectric power generation. (The father of the TVA, Norris, gained a lot of experience in Ontario.) After graduating from the University of Ontario, he moved to Louisiana in the southern United States, where he studied horticulture and entomology at the state university and formally applied to join the US nationality. Because of his profound agricultural knowledge, he gradually established a reputation in the American agricultural field. In 1905, Morgan left Louisiana for Tennessee, where he taught at Tennessee State University. In 1913, Morgan was promoted to dean of the agricultural college. In 1919, he was appointed president of the University of Tennessee. Morgan is now 79 years old, and his hair is already bald. During the First World War, he also managed the grain of the entire province of Tennessee. His administrative experience is characterized by fairness and integrity. In academia, he is now a leading figure in American agriculture. He served as the chairman of the board of the local TVA in 1938, but resigned in 1941 due to lack of energy and served as a director.

The third director is Pople. Pople only became a director of the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1939. He is from Louisiana and is 62 years old this year. He was known as an athlete in his youth and was a football player in Louisiana. He studied law at the University of Chicago and later became a lawyer and judge in Idaho. Finally, in 1933, he was elected to the US Senate. In 1939, Roosevelt selected him as a director of the Tennessee Valley Authority. None of the three directors are from Tennessee, which is a characteristic of democratic countries. Currently, less than half of all TVA staff members are local residents of Tennessee. Breaking down regional concepts and boldly employing young people are two successful factors in addition to the "grassroots system." (End)

### City Council Examines Proposals; Conducted in Ten Groups Yesterday; Discussion Focused on Finance; Overturning Increase in Housing Tax

Preliminary Resolution to Levy Municipal Tax; Horse Racing Issue to be Discussed Next Time

[Our Newspaper] This time, the City Council's examination of proposals and policy reports was divided into ten review committees, which were held at three locations yesterday morning and afternoon, for the first and second review meetings. Except for the first group at the Fifth District Office on Popple Road and the fourth group at the Chamber of Commerce, all eight others were held at Myriad Garden. The sixth and seventh groups were set up at Yang He Shang, with seats arranged in a line or a U-shape. The discussions of each review committee were different, with some discussing proposals, some only discussing work reports, and some studying specific regulations. However, most of them did not have many cases that were initially resolved or passed because the review committee still had two more sessions, the proposals were not all printed, and the review time was limited.

Among the review committees, the third group, which reviewed proposals and policy reports on finance and land administration, had the most heated discussion. They also had important preliminary resolutions on the five proposals submitted by the mayor (i.e., (1) increasing housing tax, (2) organizing a municipal tax, (3) levying a cleaning fee, (4) public utilities paying municipal tax, and (5) restoring horse racing). Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, attended the meetings in the morning and afternoon to report and explain the case. Mayor Wu also attended the meeting in the afternoon to explain various issues.

Director Gu stated that the city government's budget for the second half of the year does not reach over 33 billion yuan, and it seems imperative to increase tax revenue. He gave detailed explanations for each case, agreeing to explain the advantages of increasing housing tax in several points: (1) Housing tax is a direct tax, which cannot be transferred to others, and it is not easy to cause abuses. (2) If business tax or banquet tax is increased, it will easily stimulate prices, so it is better to increase housing tax. (3) Tax revenue is stable and reliable. The current valuation method was completed by more than 30 experts over a period of more than two years, so it is extremely accurate, and it can use the old method of calculating the reduction of housing rents in the era of the Public Works Department, and reduce the reality according to the depreciation method of the construction company. According to the actual survey, the municipal tax should be lower than the housing tax. If the housing tax is increased according to the proposal, the city government can have an income of 18 billion yuan in half a year. If the municipal tax is levied, it can increase income by 15 billion yuan in half a year. The cleaning fee is about 8.4 billion yuan in half a year, and the municipal tax levied on public utilities is about 4.02 billion yuan in half a year, and horse racing is about 2.4 billion yuan.

After discussions among the councilors, there were different opinions on whether to support the organization of a municipal tax or increase the housing tax. However, it was resolved that the cleaning fee would not be levied, and a decision would be made on the two items of municipal tax and housing tax. As a result, by a vote of five to four, it was initially resolved to levy a municipal tax and not increase the housing tax, but in the afternoon, the group still had objections to the above two taxes. Mayor Wu also explained that if the municipal tax is levied according to the housing tax method, it is easier, otherwise there are more difficulties. In reality, the actual rent has increased by more than 140 times to 490 times, and the housing item in the cost of living index is determined accordingly.

Zhao Dihua, the convener of the group, believed that this case was very important, and some councilors did not attend the meeting in the morning. After passing the vote, it was decided to submit it for a vote again. As a result, by a vote of seven to six, it was initially resolved to levy a municipal tax, but the method has not yet been determined.

### City Government's Budget for the Second Half of the Year is Compiled Like a Castle in the Air; It is Believed that it is Impossible to Review Before the Plan is Submitted; Auditing the Final Accounts is Proposed to be Handled Separately After the Closing Ceremony

The ninth group audited the city's budget and final accounts. In addition to the councilors attending the group, Min Xiangfan, the chief accountant of the city government, also attended the meeting to report, and Hu Wenyuan, the deputy director of the Finance Bureau, and the chief accountants of various bureaus participated. However, after the report, the councilors all believed that the budget for the second half of the 35th year compiled by the city government was close to a "castle in the air." The budget should be based on various work plans, but now it is being done in reverse, with the budget being set first and then the plan, which is inappropriate. And the work plans of various bureaus have not been formulated, so there is no way to review them. Detailed reports should also be made on the expenses of business and operating organizations. It was resolved: (1) The written work plans of various bureaus should be submitted before the 17th. (2) According to the operating and business organization fees mentioned in the general budget, please also report in detail before the 17th. (3) Due to time constraints, it is recommended that the audit of the final accounts be handled by a standing committee after the closing of the conference. (4) A plenary review meeting will be convened on the morning of the 15th to discuss the budget issue (pending approval by the conference). An additional group meeting will be held on the afternoon of the 15th.

At 3:00 p.m., the ninth group joined the third group for a serious discussion on the budget and financial revenue and expenditure. Xu Yongzuo, the convener of the ninth group, presented several points of opinion to the mayor on behalf of the group: (1) The living allowance of over 44.65 billion yuan listed in the temporary items in the budget, plus others, accounts for seven or eight tenths of the total number of temporary items. It can be seen that the city government's expenditure on "supporting people" is huge, which is very noteworthy. In terms of reducing expenditure, there are too many people employed. Is it possible to use fewer people? (2) On the revenue side: The large revenue of the British and French Public Works Departments and the three municipal government agencies in the past was based on housing and land taxes, which was very large. What is not clear now is why housing taxes are not collected in Zhabei and Nanshi? If we have to wait for another year and a half for investigation and valuation before collecting, wouldn't it be a great loss? If the investigation is not easy, we can temporarily handle it according to the old case. Councilor Xu also suggested that if we want to find ways to increase revenue, we can think about increasing public utilities or issuing public bonds again.

The mayor immediately stated that he admired the points raised by Councilor Xu very much, but he added that the city government was not prepared to tighten up. The current living allowance only accounts for three percent of the total budget compared with the 25th year, which is the lowest administrative expense. The police force in this city is not enough, and many more must be added. If the city government itself reduces (it has already reduced more than 100 people) one or two hundred people, it will not have a big impact on the overall expenditure. In fact, it has been reduced to the lowest limit. As for the expenses of business and administrative affairs, it is fundamentally difficult to divide them. There is no such distinction in foreign budgets. For example, are the police or engineering contracting fees administrative fees or business fees? At the same time, politics is not on the right track, which has a great impact on municipal administration. The city government only requires the minimum tax revenue. What I must apologize to you for is that the preparation of this budget is indeed unsatisfactory. We will explain and plan for various work plans, but I hope you will not make rigid regulations. Wang Nai then raised the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Bank's income of over 800 billion yuan in the business income item, which is actually more than this number, and asked for an explanation. Mayor Wu explained this point, saying that the City Bank is only acting as an agent for the city treasury, and its business is entirely conducted in accordance with provincial and municipal banks. Depositing in the Central Bank is not as profitable as other commercial banks.

The ninth group then held a separate meeting and invited the chief accountants of the Public Utilities, Public Works, and Education Bureaus to verbally report on the concise budget and expenditure items.

### Examination of Specific Regulations

The tenth group examined proposals regarding specific regulations and laws. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the group discussed and passed only two proposals, namely "The proposal to urge the implementation of the writ of habeas corpus to emphasize human rights and maintain law and discipline" proposed by Ma Junshuo et al., and "The proposal to request the judicial organs to promptly try and judge the cases of traitors." The rest were examinations of regulations, and each councilor was responsible for examining various regulations.

The group received a total of 140 kinds of regulations submitted by the city government for examination. Each councilor made a preliminary examination of a part of them yesterday, and will start examining them individually in detail from today. The regulations examined yesterday included: (1) Housing Rental Management Rules, (2) Housing Dispute Resolution Methods, (3) Housing Rent Standards, (4) Provisional Rules for the Collection of Housing Tax, (5) Land Title Methods, (6) Labor Dispute Handling Methods, (7) Rules for Investigation of Opium Addiction, (8) Measures for Violating Dance Hall Registration, (9) Measures for Private Construction of Sheds, (10) Measures for Temporary Construction of Sheds, and many other items. There are also new draft proposals from the city government, such as measures for managing wharves and measures for opening roads, which will be examined after the authorities have established them.

The review committee will strictly review the various regulations, and if there is no legal basis or conflict with the law, restrict the rights of the people, and increase obligations, it must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing.

### Whether Horse Racing Will Take Place; Heated Debate Did Not Lead to Any Conclusion; Mayor Explains That He Will Never Fawn Over Foreigners

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the third group's review meeting in Yiyuan was like a small battlefield. Following the preliminary resolution to levy a municipal tax by a vote of seven to six on finance and taxation, the difficult "horse racing" issue was raised. The third group was the last to adjourn at 6:00 p.m. This case, which is enough to concern all people in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, attracted forty or fifty people in the venue to surround and listen. Even a dozen waiters in Yiyuan widened their curious eyes, staring at each speaker, hoping to find a conclusion. Although the fate of the racecourse was still undecided by the end of the meeting, that fierce scene created its most wonderful scene in the review meetings of various groups yesterday.

Before listening to public opinion, the mayor stood up and gave an explanation. With sincerity and a bit of statement, he said, "I don't want to fawn over foreigners at all. I want to buy all 500 acres of the racecourse land as a gathering place, the council meeting venue. Shanghai is such a big city. Every time there is a big meeting, we have to borrow the Majestic Theater or the Grand Theater, etc. How can this be justified?" Then he said that he planned to buy the land and build a convention center on one side. The first floor would be a grand auditorium, the second floor would be the council meeting venue, and other small rooms would be used as review committee offices. The method of purchasing the land is to "take the wool from the sheep," open horse racing, and use the income as a fund for issuing public bonds. After two years, the entire land can belong to the city government. In this way, not only can the venue be solved, but also roads can be opened up to facilitate traffic. If they are not allowed to race horses, they will request construction, and according to the law, the city government has no way to refuse. In this way, after the houses are built, it will be difficult to recover them later.

Following the mayor's speech, the first to speak was Luo Qinghua. He said: Horse racing exists in any international metropolis. We don't need to take this issue too seriously, and we don't need to pay too much attention to moral concepts and oppose it. We hope that the mayor can do his best. It doesn't have to be after two years. It would be more ideal if we could find a way to recover it around one year. But I don't agree with holding it at the racecourse. Leaving aside everything else, there is one thing that needs to be considered, that is, the traffic problem. Nanjing Road is already extremely congested at present. In addition, with horse racing twice a week, it can simply cut off traffic. Chen Gongda firmly expressed his absolute opposition, feeling that horse racing is gambling. Allowing it to open after we have won is really inappropriate. Zhang Yiqu also opposed horse racing. Since he doesn't agree, he has to come up with a solution. Jia Dechao meant that it might as well buy the land at the old price. Yu Shun advocated exchanging the land in Jiangwan or Yinxiang Port. The mayor further explained: This is a factual issue. If this land is used for citizens to invest in purchases, it can be mortgaged, but if it is used as a public place, no one will invest, and the bank is unwilling to handle it. Speaking of purchasing at the old land price, it cannot be passed in the land law. Furthermore, if we exchange suburban land for them, will people agree? If horse racing is changed to the suburbs, they still want to build houses in the racecourse in the city, which is even more troublesome.

In the end, time ran out again, and no conclusion could be reached after further discussion. Wang Wei then proposed to keep this case for serious study at the next review meeting, and believed that this issue was too big and still had to be submitted to the conference for discussion. As a result, it was passed in this way.

### Regarding Sanitation

The eighth group reviewed proposals and policy reports on sanitation. The committee discussed the proposals yesterday morning, and Zhang Wei, the director of the Sanitation Bureau, attended the meeting to answer the questions raised by the councilors. The group first combined and discussed the proposals in this category one by one, but generally passed them. Because there were not many proposals submitted at present, the review meeting was not held in the afternoon.

### The Public Works and Public Utilities Bureaus Will Report on Their Policies Today

[Our Newspaper] Today is the seventh and eighth meetings of the City Council. In the morning, Zhao Zukang, the director of the Public Works Bureau, will report on the general situation of his policies, and in the afternoon, Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will report. There will also be questions from councilors and reports from the speaker.

[Caption] Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau attended the third group's review meeting in the upper picture, and the tense situation of the seventh group's review meeting in the lower picture (captured by this newspaper).

### Social Relief and Labor Issues

The Seventh Review Committee. Special review of proposals and policy reports regarding social relief and labor. Seventeen people attended. In the morning, eight proposals were reviewed. The first proposal discussed was the one put forward by Chen Gongda, Wu Shaozhu, Zhuang Heren, Cao Jun, and others, stating that curbing inflation is a prerequisite for solving current livelihood problems. The review opinion was that the stabilization of prices should first depend on the availability of materials. If the supply of materials cannot be guaranteed, then prices will inevitably be affected. It was decided to pass the principle and merge it with the proposal put forward by Lao Jingxiu and others regarding the allocation of materials at parity prices based on population. It is currently temporarily reserved.

Subsequently, the Committee reviewed the proposal put forward by Chen Gongda and others to eliminate labor disputes. Senator Tang Shichang stated that the Social Bureau should first provide relevant information before discussing it further. At this time, Pan Gengsheng, a representative of the Social Bureau, stated: The living expenses of workers are now based on the cost of living index as the standard, and judgments are made based on this principle. Senator Jin Hongxiang stated: The government should formulate regulations stipulating that: (1) Those who gather in crowds to surround others will not be mediated; (2) The number of labor and management representatives attending mediation should be equal; (3) Mediators should not be sent with biased views; (4) Factories should not be interfered with in any way when they close. Senator Bao Wenxin advocated that a minimum wage standard should be stipulated. Tang Shichang believed that: (1) Both labor and management should abide by laws and regulations; (2) Open and sincere cooperation between labor and management should be promoted; (3) National industries should be developed. Senator Dong Rengui believed that both labor and management should fulfill their responsibilities in this matter. Management should: (1) Stabilize the lives of workers; (2) Provide labor welfare; (3) Implement factory meetings. Labor should: (1) Improve work efficiency; (2) Comply with labor discipline.

The proposal to reduce interest rates on pawnshops and extend the deadline was passed in principle, and it is proposed to ask the General Assembly to send it to the municipal government for reference.

The review opinion on the proposal submitted by Wei Yunqing and others, stating that compensation should be negotiated for war losses and that victims of disasters should receive full relief to alleviate people's difficulties, was: (1) The principle is passed, and the municipal government is requested to issue a notice to all district and baojia chiefs to conduct a supplementary investigation based on the original household registration books before the war and submit a report within a limited time. (2) Regarding the valuation of losses, the current market price should be used as the standard. The current regulations of the Executive Yuan stipulate that the wartime valuation should be used as the standard, and the municipal government should be requested to forward it to the authorities for correction.

The review opinion on the proposal submitted by Xu Zexiang and others, requesting the municipal government to establish a Shanghai Municipal Vagrant Relief Institute, was to send it to the municipal government for adoption and implementation. When the meeting was held in the afternoon, the review of proposals related to citizen welfare continued, such as establishing a farm, establishing a citizen credit cooperative, and requesting the municipal government to provide relief to unemployed citizens. Regarding women and infants, such as investigating and providing relief to prostitutes, providing relief to infant refugees, etc., all were passed in principle during the review, and the municipal government was requested to transfer and allocate enemy and pseudo-properties for accommodation.

### Site of the Municipal Council. The Former Japanese Resident Group's Shanghai Theater is Favored. The First Review Committee will Submit it to the General Assembly for Discussion Today.

[Our newspaper report] The issue of the location of the Municipal Council, which has not yet been resolved, may be decided today. When the First Review Committee reviewed various proposals yesterday afternoon, numbers 87 and 134 both involved the issue that the Council should have a suitable location. All review committee members absolutely agreed with this proposal. They also discussed the ideal location. As a result, it was considered that the Japanese Resident Group's Hongkou Triangle Market and the Shanghai Theater on North Sichuan Road were the most suitable. The former could be used as the Council's reception center and club, and the latter could be used as the meeting venue. The convener of the First Review Committee will make a temporary motion this morning to request that the above two places be provided for the Council's use. He will also ask the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to visit and report at the afternoon General Assembly.

### Increase the Number of Parks and Strengthen Management

[Our newspaper report] The issue of parks in this city was also hotly debated in the Municipal Council yesterday. Senators Xu Zexiang, Tian Shujun, Wang Naixu, and others proposed that public vacant land should be used to add parks and that they should all be free of charge. However, some senators believed that building houses for civilians should be the first priority in today's severe housing shortage, followed by parks. Some people also believed that the cause of the current chaotic park order should be attributed to the low ticket price (currently only 20 yuan), so to rectify the parks, the ticket price must first be increased to 1,000 yuan. However, the majority believed that parks are parks for the majority of citizens and should not be charged. Therefore, after repeated discussions, the review opinion was that suitable public land should be found to add parks, and it should be allowed to be located in the suburbs, and the management of the parks must be strengthened.

### Regarding Police Affairs

The Second Group reviewed proposals and policy reports regarding police and security. The committee reviewed the police department's work report yesterday morning and afternoon and raised questions about some policies, which were answered by Fang Zhichao, director of the department's administrative division, on behalf of the director. The group will leave the review of the proposals for the next meeting.

### Increase Tram Vehicles and Build the Pudong Bridge. The Fifth Review Committee Passes in Principle.

[Our newspaper report] The Fifth Review Committee reviewed proposals related to public works, which are directly related to the people's livelihood, so the committee members had a heated discussion. The important ones are recorded separately as follows: (1) Gu Baoyu requested the municipal authorities to urge the tram company to quickly increase the number of vehicles, restore the original routes, and strictly train ticket sellers and drivers in order. Seven measures are proposed to improve the situation: 1. Restore the original routes as soon as possible, 2. Increase the number of vehicles as soon as possible, 3. Set up attendants at each station to maintain order, 4. Transfer the ticket sellers on the cars to serve passengers to buy tickets at the stations, and the driver will collect the tickets when they get off the car, 5. The car must stop at the station and can only start after the passengers have finished getting on and off the car, 6. Drivers and ticket sellers should be given strict training so that they have the spirit of correct service, 7. The municipal authorities need to supervise the tram companies to comply separately. As a result of the review, it was agreed in principle to pass it and send it to the Public Works Bureau for reference, and special attention should be paid to the strict training of ticket sellers and drivers. (2) Twenty-three senators, including Chen Peide, proposed building the Pudong Bridge to connect the east-west routes of the Huangpu River and to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods at the docks and warehouses, so that there would be no more accumulation and nowhere to start. According to the plan, the construction of the Pudong Bridge was discussed before the war, but it was suspended due to the war. It is necessary for the east-west average development of the Huangpu River in this city. The proposal is as follows: 1. Where should the Pudong Bridge be located from Pudong to Puxi, 2. The construction project can be contracted by professional talents or foreign merchants, 3. The articles of association of the Shanghai Pudong Bridge Construction Committee will be formulated separately, 4. The funds will be issued by the municipal government as "Shanghai Municipal Construction Pudong Bridge Bonds" (the method is to draw lots to return the principal), 5. The income will be collected by the Public Works Bureau as an incidental car donation, 6. Confiscated materials from enemy overseas Chinese will be appropriated to supplement the funds, 7. In the future, the land price of Pudong will increase due to this construction, and the land tax can also increase income. As a result of the review, it was submitted to the General Assembly and sent to the Urban Planning Committee for implementation of the plan. (3) Zhou Xiangsheng proposed that there are many travelers going up and down at the Mubu North Railway Station, and the traffic is congested. It is proposed to formulate remedial measures and suggest opening a trunk road directly from Tibet Road to the North through Nicheng Bridge to reach the North Railway Station. All the dilapidated houses or grass sheds that pass through it should be demolished, and the residents should be moved to the civilian houses built by the municipal government. The Review Committee considered it necessary and decided to submit it to the General Assembly and send it to the Urban Planning Committee for implementation in advance. (4) Please ask the Public Works Bureau to quickly repair all damaged roads in the urban area to facilitate traffic and rectify the city's appearance. After review and approval, it was submitted to the General Assembly. All damaged roads in the urban area were sent to the Public Works Bureau for repair, and repairs should be expedited at night. (5) If there are poles but no street lights in the urban area, they should be installed as soon as possible. It was decided to submit the proposal to the General Assembly and send it to the Public Works Bureau. Street lights in the suburbs should be installed before winter. (6) Increase the number of ferry boats, improve routes, improve employee management, and various equipment. The original proposer, Zhong Yuliang, painfully described the inconvenience. It was decided to submit it to the General Assembly and send it to the Public Works Bureau for adoption and implementation, and refer to the previous municipal ferry regulations for handling. (7) The third, thirty-first, thirty-sixth, and ninety-ninth proposals related to dredging rivers in the suburbs to facilitate irrigation and transportation were discussed together and sent to the Public Works Bureau for thorough implementation.

### The Demarcation of Provinces and Cities Should be Resolved as Soon as Possible. Local Autonomy Should be Strengthened. Someone Suggested Asking the Mayor to Go to the Countryside.

The First Review Committee held the first and second review meetings at the Fifth District Office on South Huangpi Road. Twenty review committee members attended, and Zhang, the director of the Civil Affairs Office, and Li, the section chief, attended as observers. Zhu Wende chaired the meeting in the morning, and Chen Baotai chaired the meeting in the afternoon. The group reviewed proposals on civil administration and autonomy, policy reports, and other proposals that did not belong to other groups.

After the meeting, the secretary first reported on the focus of the group's review work. Similar proposals will be combined and submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. A total of thirty proposals were reviewed by the First Group, which were divided into eight categories: demarcation of provinces and cities, strengthening autonomous institutions, improving the treatment of public education personnel, local autonomous institutions' houses, electing district chiefs, council, visiting people's privacy, and others.

Regarding the proposal to resolve the demarcation of provinces and cities as soon as possible, the review result was to pass the original proposal and send it to the municipal government for thorough handling. The boundary between provinces and cities had been delineated by the Executive Yuan before the war. Currently, it is only a handover issue. The municipal government has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order Jiangsu Province to hand over as soon as possible. Another proposal was made that the district divisions of the district offices and police stations should be unified to facilitate convenience. The review result was passed and supplemented by saying that the district divisions of the health education and other bureaus should also be consistent with those of the district offices.

Regarding the proposal to strengthen the baojia organization and autonomous institutions, the review result was that the principles of management, education, upbringing, and health should be followed, the household registration should be thoroughly investigated, the public should be actively organized and trained, education should be stepped up, and public security should be strengthened. On average, at least two bao should have a national school, and self-defense groups should be organized in each district.

The review opinions on the proposals to improve the treatment of public education personnel, simplify administrative institutions, and increase administrative efficiency are as follows: increase the welfare of public education personnel, simplify the bureaus in accordance with the special municipal organization law, and thoroughly implement the elimination of redundant and incompetent personnel.

Regarding the election of district chiefs and deputy district chiefs to complete local autonomy, the review committee members believed that the original proposal should be passed and sent to the municipal government to urge the district offices to step up the work of examining candidates for public office. And earnestly hold the election of the civilly elected Jiaobao District Chief, so as to complete the local Bai Zhi in peacetime.

Please ask the Municipal Government and various bureaus to quickly replace the pseudo-officials. The original proposal was passed. Regarding this point, the central government has already given instructions. As for the houses of the district offices, please ask the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Handling Bureau to allocate them from the municipal government's various agencies.

There is also a proposal asking the mayor to go to the countryside to inquire about the people's conditions in the suburbs, and it can also let the villagers have a glimpse of the mayor's demeanor. The review result was to send it to the mayor for reference, and it was also suggested that the heads of the various agencies of the municipal government accompany the mayor to the countryside.

### The Head of the Cleaning Team, Zhang, Expressed His Hope that Members of the Municipal Council Would Participate. Speaker Pan Will Submit it to the General Assembly for Discussion Again Today.

[Our newspaper report] The Municipal Council has discussed twice whether to elect representatives to participate in the Receiving Work Cleaning Team, but it has not yet been decided. The Fifth General Assembly decided to reserve it a few days ago, and after the Head of the Cleaning Team, Zhang, learned about this from Hang Huihu, he will discuss it again. Head Zhang returned to Shanghai from Hang Qianwan the night before. A reporter from this newspaper learned from relevant parties yesterday that Head Zhang had read the Shanghai newspapers' reports on this matter in Hangzhou, so he rushed back to Shanghai first. At 6:00 p.m. yesterday, he met with Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang of the Municipal Council. First of all, he explained that the work of the team was just beginning to clean up the Hangzhou part, so he had submitted a request to the central government for an appropriate extension of time, and said that according to the regulations, two members of the local provincial and municipal councils could be hired as members to participate in the work. Because the scope includes Shanghai and Hangzhou, he requested the Shanghai and Zhejiang Provincial Councils to each send one person. Zhejiang Province has already designated someone, and he hopes that the Shanghai public opinion organization can also have someone to participate together. Secondly, he explained that he previously thought that the Interim Council had ended and the official Council had not yet convened, so he did not send a letter inviting them, which may have caused misunderstandings. In fact, the central government specially organized this Cleaning Team to thoroughly clean up and rectify the officialdom. Therefore, if the local public opinion organizations can send two more people to participate, even if it does not quite conform to the establishment, they will welcome it. Speaker Pan promised to submit a report to the Seventh General Assembly today (13th) and continue to discuss it, hoping to enable the local public opinion organizations and the central supervisory agencies to cooperate with each other and contribute to the cleaning up of the receiving work.

The Work in Hangzhou is Simple. Dinghai Needs to be Inspected.

[Our newspaper report] The head of the group also told reporters: The orderliness of Hangzhou's municipal administration is commendable, and he said that the receiving work in Zhejiang Province is relatively simple, and cleaning up is also easy. And after full preparation in advance, the work is proceeding very smoothly. However, in Dinghai, the navy had a conflict with the police when they received it, and the military discipline seemed to be too bad. It was decided that two members, Zhang Qingzhen and Wu Wangji, would go to the field to investigate the truth and investigate the responsibility. The Cleaning Team inspected three warehouses on the second day of arriving in Hangzhou. The general situation was good, and it is expected that the work in Hangzhou will be completed in one week. As of today, it has been full fifty days since the group started working on July 24. According to the statistics of the group's secretariat, a total of 309 secret reports have been received in Shanghai, all of which have been processed. About 70% have been completed, and about 30% have been processed but not yet completed. The group has received a total of 489 documents in Shanghai, sent out 248 documents, and 111 reports from various receiving agencies. The total number of official documents is 858. The group, in view of the particularly complex cleaning work in Shanghai, has obtained the consent of the Joint Office of the Cleaning Team to extend the deadline to the end of this month. In the next half month, the work in Shanghai will focus on closing the pending cases. However, secret reports with major cases will still be accepted.

### Inspector Cheng's Impressions of this Trip: The Organization of the Cleaning Team Was Delayed.

[Another message] Inspector Cheng Zhonghang returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou last night because of the Cleaning Team. Talking about his impressions of this trip, he said: "The receiving in Hangzhou, to sum it up in one sentence, was heartbreaking to see. Many receiving agencies in Hangzhou now do not have original cleaning books. When asked why they did not have them, they said that when they received them, the first people who received them did not hand over the original cleaning books at all. Most of the warehouses we saw were scrap copper and rotten iron. For those scrap copper and rotten iron, many houses were also occupied and many people were sent to guard them. The Cleaning Team is now receiving various secret reports every day. The organization of the Cleaning Team was too late. The Cleaning Team can only play a role in various places now by relying on public opinion as a backing. When we arrived in Hangzhou, we found that in the hearts of the people of Zhejiang, their "leaving thoughts" from a certain war zone headquarters may not be erased for decades or centuries. The elders of Zhejiang still sigh when they talk about the mahogany furniture and sanitary equipment piled up and transported at the station. The most heartbreaking thing is that there are still many residences that are neither enemy nor pseudo, and are still being occupied."

### Regarding Education and Culture

The Sixth Group reviewed proposals and policy reports on education and culture. The group received many proposals. Yesterday, it only divided the printed proposals into several major categories and combined them, such as national education, secondary education, tuition fees, and school funding issues, totaling more than forty items, which have not yet been formally reviewed and discussed.

### The Aviation Construction Association Branch Actively Seeks Members

[Our newspaper report] The purpose of the China Aviation Construction Association is to arouse public interest in aviation. Chairman Jiang also serves as the president of the general association. Recently, the Shanghai branch has also been established. Mayor Wu serves as the president of the branch and has initiated a movement to seek members. The following is a recruitment notice for permanent membership of the branch: "To establish a modern country, if we do not build aviation and strengthen air defense, it is like building a house on sand. Once a disaster occurs, it will collapse immediately. There are many examples in this war, which can be stated without赘言. China has a vast territory and a long coastline. Aviation is the only way to protect it. Land transportation is difficult and sea transportation is empty. Aviation is the only way to supplement it. Cultural imbalances and rifts between ethnic groups can only be bridged by aviation. The points that China urgently needs to build aviation are too numerous to mention. As the saying goes, don’t forget the past, it is a teacher for the future. The scorched earth in Zhabei on January 28 and the downfall in Southeast Asia on August 13. Is it that the soldiers are not loyal and brave, but the military strength of aviation is not sufficient? Our millions of citizens, after painful reflection, can't we make a plan to mend the fold after the sheep is lost? The purpose of the establishment of the Aviation Construction Association is to arouse the enthusiasm of the public for aviation and assist the government in aviation construction with the power of the whole people. The General Association is located where the government is located, and Chairman Jiang also serves as the president of the General Association. The Shanghai Branch was established with the reconstruction of the country. It has been more than a year from preparation to establishment, and it has a rough scale. Guo Zhen succeeded as the head of the branch. The outline of the work this year, to mention the main points, is to recruit 300,000 members to participate in the aviation construction work, collect membership fees, build a parachute tower in Shanghai, open a flight club, and establish an aviation museum, etc. However, it is a big and costly thing. If you want to succeed, you must rely on the support of all parties and the cooperation of the city. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. The most prosperous humanities. The public is easy to lift. Gathering sand into a tower. The above-mentioned facilities are waiting for the joint advocacy of the wise men from all walks of life. Adding people to the permanent members of the body is a real hope. It is the beginning."

### The Police Bureau Held a Commemorative Meeting Yesterday to Mark the First Anniversary of the Unified Takeover of Municipal Police Power

[Our newspaper report] Yesterday was the first anniversary of the unified takeover of municipal police power in Shanghai. The Police Bureau held a special commemorative meeting at the square on the ground floor of the general bureau on Fuzhou Road. The meeting place was simply and solemnly decorated. At 4:00 p.m., the meeting began. After Director Guan led the ceremony, he made a speech, saying: "The police administration of this city has been controlled by foreigners for more than 100 years. The government's police power only extended to Nanshi, Zhabei, and the suburbs of the city. Since this day last year, police power has been unified. On this historic day of remembrance, it is necessary to review the past work. We should be vigilant and review at any time: (1) We should first unite as one and work hard in our respective positions. I will never want to see some people wearing police uniforms and exercising police powers, but deviating from their police positions and willingly committing illegal and undisciplined acts. (2) Shanghai is an international city. We must not still engage in work with the knowledge and experience we had in the inland areas. In other words, we should strive to improve our technology and make efforts in all aspects in order to adapt to the needs of an international city." Finally, Xuan氏 emphasized that in the future, we should focus on practical work and replace the word "say" with the word "do", and gave the following instructions: "Diligence to make up for clumsiness, frugality to cultivate integrity, impartiality to handle affairs, and sincerity to treat others."

### Wife Was Intimate with Someone, Provoking a Tragic Killing

[Our newspaper report] A Polish man named Xue Kesgai lives in Room 6, Building 12, Lane 833, Linsen Middle Road. Xue is 46 years old and loves to drink. He gets drunk every time he drinks. At 9:30 p.m. on the 11th, Xue returned from outside, already drunk. He stepped into the room and did not see his wife, Ou Qinggu, so he broke into Room 7 and saw the owner of the room, a White Russian named Jie Erbo, and his wife sitting and chatting intimately. He stepped forward and took his wife back to the room without asking why. As soon as Ou Qinggu sat down on the sofa, Xue went out alone again, went to Room 7 and punched Jie Erbo in the face. At that time, Jie Erbo saw that he was carrying an iron bar by his side, so he hid to the side of the bed. At the same time, he grabbed a glass from the table and hit him on the top of his head. After Xue was seriously injured, he fled out and fainted at the gate downstairs, gasping for breath. Later, someone reported it to the Lujiawan Police Station. Police Chief Liu Zhanghua and police officer Chen Shaobai rushed to investigate and took the murderer Jie Erbo to the station for interrogation. The injured person was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and died at 4:00 a.m. the next morning.

### Flatten Black Market High Interest Rates and Save the Industrial and Commercial Crisis: Fourth Review Committee's Review Opinions

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Fourth Review Committee of the First Group Review Committee of the First Shanghai Municipal Assembly held two meetings at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning and afternoon. More than 20 committee members attended, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Land Administration Bureau participated. Chaired by Wang Xianqing, the committee reviewed 20 proposals related to finance, industry and commerce, economy, and food. Similar proposals were combined and provided with review opinions, and some individual cases were also submitted for discussion. The following is a record of the reasons for each proposal and the review opinions reached:

Proposal No. 10: Suggest that the central government send personnel to thoroughly investigate the personnel organization and capital sources of various real estate companies established during the enemy and puppet period.

Review opinion: It is proposed to ask the original proposer to provide facts and supplement the methods for further review. Proposal No. 69: Acquisition of foreign patented business rights.

Review opinion: The city's public utilities should be acquired and managed by the government and implemented one by one. Proposals No. 12, 57, 135, 185, 216, 276, and 354 are all related to saving the industrial and commercial crisis and cracking down on usury. Among them, the reasons for Proposal No. 354 are described in detail. Therefore, it was resolved to use this case as a blueprint and supplement it with three more opinions to be handled together. The reasons for the proposal are to suggest that the government promptly improve financial policies, actively handle production loans and rural loans, flatten black market high interest rates to reduce costs, stabilize prices, and relieve industrial and commercial difficulties to avoid economic collapse. The proposal provides five methods: (1) State-owned specialized banks should investigate the actual capital needs of industrial production of various factories and lend them as much as possible at low interest rates. Their collateral should not be limited to raw materials and finished products, and factory buildings, machinery, real estate, etc. should all be allowed to be provided as collateral. Acceptance and discounting of goods and commodity loans should be actively undertaken to ensure the smooth flow of goods. (2) To prevent excessive currency issuance, in-kind loans can be provided. The government should lend necessary materials, such as production raw materials, fuel, machinery, and equipment, to factories in need to develop their production. (3) The Central Bank should promptly and actively handle re-mortgages and re-discounts, and guide various banks and money shops to be happy to accept production loans, so as to establish a long-term capital supply market. (4) Loans for agricultural products should continue to be actively promoted. Loans for the production and processing of agricultural export products, such as raw silk, tea, and tung oil, should not be suspended. With the autumn harvest in sight, low grain prices are sufficient to harm farmers, and grain loans are expected to be implemented. Cotton will also be on the market soon. To protect the production interests of farmers, it is hoped that methods will be quickly determined and cotton loans will be handled in different regions. (5) The government should quickly formulate methods for land finance and actively implement them to develop agricultural financial undertakings.

The committee members added three supplementary opinions: (1) The government should stipulate that large loans should be lent to the production sector at the lowest possible interest rate and simplify loan procedures to save the industrial and commercial crisis. (2) Regarding loan interest rates, the principle should be to suppress them as much as possible. (3) Commercial banks have a close relationship with the industrial and commercial sector. The government should relax its management methods for commercial banks and effectively support commercial banks to achieve the effect of indirectly supporting industry and commerce.

Review opinion: Combined with Proposal No. 276, which proposes that the China Farmers Bank handle agricultural loans, the review opinion proposes that the Assembly pass it and the municipal government forward it to the central government for prompt and effective implementation.

Proposal No. 272: Proposal No. 19 by Senator Zhou Xuexiang et al. of the former Provisional Municipal Assembly was reviewed and passed by the Provisional Assembly, and it is proposed that the municipal government earnestly handle the case. The proposal calls on the central government to quickly start work on the enemy and puppet factories that have been taken over, encourage the resumption of ethnic factories, accommodate unemployed workers, and increase production. This is an important measure for stabilizing society at present and should be actively promoted and realized as soon as possible.

Review opinion: It is proposed to send the original proposal to the municipal government for recommendation to the central government for approval.

However, if the person assisted in the War of Resistance or engaged in acts beneficial to the people during their tenure in the puppet position, or if their position was a specialized technology, and it is proven to be true, the examination and selection agency may, at its discretion, shorten or exempt their restriction period. (5) Those who knowingly recommend or recruit those who should be restricted under these measures shall be disciplined according to law by the original recommender or the responsible superior officer.

### Wen Lanting Sentenced to Eight Years: Silent and Wordless When Hearing the Sentence; Request for Bail Denied

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following Yuan Ludeng's sentence of life imprisonment and Lin Kanghou's sentence of six years of imprisonment, Wen Lanting was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday morning. Thus, the "Three Elders" who were famous in Shanghai have all been finalized.

At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the Criminal Division 1 courtroom of the Tilanqiao High Court was crowded. The defendant's defense lawyers Jiang Yong, Zhu Fojiu, and Sha Yankai all attended the hearing. Court President Liu Yugui, along with Associate Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huanbing, as well as prosecutors and clerks, ascended to the bench and ordered the bailiffs to bring up Wen Lanting. Wen was still wearing a blue silk long gown, with a white short shirt and pants underneath, light brown silk socks, and white-soled black shoes. He was holding a folding fan and was supported by the bailiffs into the court. His old friends and disciples all stood up from their seats and bowed to greet him. A medical examiner was still in attendance. After standing in the defendant's dock, the presiding judge said: "Wen Chunnan, the son of the defendant Wen Lanting, has filed a petition requesting a reopening of the debate. This court believes that the evidence has been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the collegiate panel has ruled that the application is rejected. The judgment in this case will be pronounced today." He then stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Wen Lanting colluded with an enemy country, plotted to resist this country, and is sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years. All property shall be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members." After reading, he sat down and briefly explained the reasons for the judgment (see the judgment for details). The emotions of the audience were quite tense. Looking back at the defendant himself, he shook his folding fan and remained silent from beginning to end. The presiding judge continued to say to the defendant: "If you are not satisfied, you can apply to the Supreme Court for a review within ten days after receiving the judgment." The defendant remained silent and made no expression. The defense lawyers then stated to the court: "The defendant is old and weak, and his illness is getting worse day by day. He requests to be granted bail for medical treatment." Judge Liu still said: A written petition must be submitted, and the collegiate panel will discuss and decide on it in detail. After speaking, he ordered the defendant to be returned to custody. His old friends and disciples stood up again to see him off, stepped forward to greet him, and bid farewell until the prison gate.

### Reasons Stated in the Judgment

Defendant Wen Lanting, male, 77 years old, from Wujin, residing at No. 3, Lane 375, West Asmus Road, Shanghai.

Appointed defense lawyers Jiang Yong, Zhu Fojiu, and Sha Yankai.

The right defendant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for a traitor case, and this court ruled as follows: (Main text of facts omitted)

(Reasons) In this case, the defendant Wen Lanting in 1942, conceived the idea of surrendering to the puppet regime, joined the puppet Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, served as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, and later successively served as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Puppet National Commercial Control Committee, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Cotton Control Committee, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association. He has admitted this in this court.

It is consistent with his statements during interrogation by the Military Statistics Bureau and in the investigation by the prosecutor of this court, as well as the records in the attached confession. There are also records of the puppet Commercial Control Committee meetings that have been retrieved as evidence. There is no doubt about the facts. What should be investigated is whether the crime of colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist this country should be established. The puppet Commercial Control Committee was initially affiliated to the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce and later transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the puppet Executive Yuan. It was the puppet government's general organization that implemented its so-called new economic policy and intensified the control of materials under the instructions of the enemy. This can be seen in Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations of the Puppet Commercial Control Committee, which stipulates that "The National Commercial Control Committee aims to assist the government in implementing policies and handle material control matters under the orders of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other competent departments," and Article 4, which stipulates that "The National Commercial Control Committee shall, under the orders of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other competent departments, supervise and direct its members to handle: (1) the purchase and distribution of materials related to control—(5) the procurement of military supplies, (6) matters designated or entrusted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other competent departments." The puppet Cotton Control Committee is an external agency of the puppet Commercial Control Committee and the highest authority for controlling cotton. Its scope of work is the purchase and distribution of cotton produced in Central China, the supply of enemy and puppet military needs and exported cotton, and the examination and issuance of cotton transportation permits. This is also clearly recorded in the puppet Shen Bao Yearbook (see page 733 of the original book). The defendant held important positions such as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chairman of the Committee in this puppet organization's affiliated

economic control institutions. Judging from the nature of its tasks and the means of execution, it is naturally beneficial to the enemy and the puppet regime and detrimental to this country. According to Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, he should be held responsible for the crime of colluding with an enemy country and plotting to resist this country in Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the same regulations, which is unavoidable. Although the defense claimed that he had served in Shanghai for more than 50 years and had a good reputation. He had to serve in the puppet regime to cover himself, and he had no intention of colluding with the enemy and plotting to resist this country. The confession and statements in the Military Statistics Bureau were made under environmental pressure and should be considered invalid as a basis for exemption from liability. However, if the defendant was indeed serving in the puppet regime for cover, then the Shanghai position he held in 1942 would have been sufficient to achieve this purpose. Why did he later serve as Chairman of the Board of Supervisors and Chairman of the Committee of the Puppet Commercial Control Committee, and Chairman of the Puppet Committee? His actions have clearly gone beyond the scope of cover and are aligned with the enemy and puppet regime.

colluding with each other

cannot be denied. Moreover, at the welcome ceremony for the new and old Japanese ambassadors, the defendant gave a speech as chairman, stating: Shanghai is the center of economy and culture, and its position is important. If handled properly, it can contribute to the war effort and promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, fulfilling its responsibility as an important rear base (see the puppet New China Daily, November 25, 1942). He also said in a speech commemorating the fifth anniversary of the puppet government's return to the capital: "After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the government, based on the determination to live and die together, cooperated with friendly countries to participate in the war, pooling efforts and rising up together...to enable the cooperative government to seek final victory" (see the puppet Shen Bao, March 3, 1945). The defendant did not deny the records of these newspapers when questioned by this court. He has shown his agreement with the enemy and the puppet regime in his words. It is self-deception to say that there was no intention of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country, and who can believe it. As for the confession attached to the file, it was handwritten by the defendant. The interrogation records of the Military Statistics Bureau were subsequently signed by the defendant each time and are inherently undeniable. Moreover, the defendant has admitted them in the prosecutor's investigation (see the transcript of April 10 of this year). There was no mention of "should be considered invalid," but in the trial of this case, he suddenly said that it was due to environmental pressure, especially the Department of Transportation certificate that failed to show how he was pressured.

### Xie Guansheng Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing to Inspect Various Judicial Agencies; It is Said that Zhou Fohai, Xi Mocun, and Others Will be Sent to Nanjing for Trial

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xie Guansheng, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, accompanied by Chen Gemin, Chief Counselor of the Ministry, and Counselor Ni Zhengqi, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last for his first inspection since the victory. At 10 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Guo Yunguan, President of the Shanghai High Court, Cha Liangjian, President of the District Court, and Huang Liang, Chief Prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, he inspected the High Court and the District Court on North Zhejiang Road and gave many instructions. At 11 a.m., he convened a meeting in the High Court auditorium to instruct all personnel, urging three points: (1) The knowledge of the new judicial personnel should be renewed daily and constantly seek improvement. They should not be satisfied with what they know now. (2) Speed—the general public criticizes the courts for being too slow in handling cases. Efforts should be made to correct this in the future. (3) Substance—cases should not be handled carelessly. Those who rush through things believe that their task is completed, but the disputes between litigants have not been resolved. Therefore, they should do things in a substantial and responsible manner. Finally, Xie also showed that judicial personnel should have the spirit of enduring hard work and complaints.

At 10 a.m. this morning, Minister Xie will go to the High Procuratorate on West Asmus Road, the District Procuratorate on Xuehuali Road, and the Masnan Road Detention Center for inspection. At 3 p.m., he will inspect the Tilan Bridge High Court, the High Procuratorate temporary office, and the Shanghai Prison. He will stay in Shanghai for several days and then travel to Suzhou and other places for inspection.

[Additional News] Minister Xie met with reporters from various newspapers in the District Court office yesterday morning and answered various inquiries, saying: (1) Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and other five people will be sent from Chongqing to Nanjing for public trial soon. (2) Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over the grain loan fraud case, the judicial organs have not abandoned their responsibilities, and the District Procuratorate is conducting an in-depth investigation. (3) Regarding the issue of prosecutor reform, some people in the Chongqing Senate advocated expansion, while others advocated abolition, and opinions were obviously different and still need to be carefully studied. (4) Regarding the deadline for reporting traitors, there are original regulations on the statute of limitations for crimes in criminal law, which are currently being studied. (5) The treatment of judicial personnel has been decided by the Executive Yuan to be improved. Judges in the Shanghai area receive an additional subsidy of 50,000 yuan per month compared to administrative personnel of the same level, while judges in other areas receive 25,000 yuan more. (6) The National Judicial Administration Conference will be held in January next year if there are no obstacles. Xie expressed regret over the continuous stream of corruption cases across the country. However, the judicial organs can only punish after the fact and have no right to prevent it in advance.

evasive remarks

are not credible. Comprehensive investigation of various defenses is still difficult to recognize as legitimate. However, the prosecutor's indictment also mentions Article 2, Paragraph 1, Items 4 and 5 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, but the section on supplying the enemy with military rice and gauze should not be blamed on the defendant (refer to the judgments of Yuan Ludeng and Tang Shoumin by this court). Furthermore, the portion of the indictment regarding the puppet Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association's fundraising for air defense donations concerns relief for air raid casualties and cannot prove any harm to the country or the people and can be disregarded. Second, the defendant served in the business community before the war and had a good reputation, and he was noticed by the enemy and the puppet regime early on. The Shanghai market fell into aging decline, and he failed to retreat in time. His participation in the puppet regime was due to the difficulty of the situation, which led to his accomplishment. Compared with ordinary people who willingly surrendered to the enemy for profit, there is a difference. Moreover, the defendant usually engaged in social charity. At the beginning of the Shanghai occupation, he managed hospitals for wounded soldiers and refugee shelters, saving many lives. This has been stated in court by witnesses Huang Hanzhi and Zhu Kuichen. After serving in the puppet regime,

he served as a defector and collected intelligence, and a secret radio station was set up in his home to communicate with the rear. There are also official letters from the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and certificates from Central Committee member Li Mingyang for verification. As for the central underground workers and loyal gentry who were rescued or sheltered by him, such as Yu Xiangqin, Qi Zaiyu, Wu Shiyi, Zhang Shutung, Mi Jifang, Chen Lengseng, Lu Huimin, Zhang Shuwei, etc., dozens of them have competed to go to court or provide written testimony. Other facts, such as the preservation of large yarn factories due to negotiation and the delay of various parties, the fact that small yarn factories were not eliminated, the obstruction of the dedication of ingot tributes, and the cultivation of textile talents, have been presented in evidence by Shen Boqin of Yushan Textile Company, Wu Kunsheng of Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9, and dozens of other companies. In summary, his acts of assisting the War of Resistance and benefiting the people are numerous. Weighing against the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, it is indeed in conformity, and should be reduced in accordance with the law.

mitigate the original punishment in order to show fairness. All property will be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for family members. Based on the above arguments, in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 3, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 19 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, Article 2, Paragraph 1, Proviso, Article 28, Article 64, Paragraph 2, Article 65, Paragraph 2, Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Ye Yushao attended court to perform his duties in this case.

### First Day of Food Box Distribution: Public School Teachers All Return Fully Loaded. Next Distribution Will Be of Poplin, Shirting, Etc. Many Elementary School Teachers Did Not Come in Vain.

[Special Report by This Newspaper] Yesterday marked the start of the distribution of goods to public school teachers and civil servants in this city. Our reporter made a special inspection of the distribution point yesterday evening and found the order to be very good. Because yesterday was the first day of distribution, the authorities, fearing that unfamiliar procedures would cause excessive congestion, only notified sixteen units under the city government to collect first. Of the total distribution of five hundred people, in addition to civil servants, there were also elementary school teachers who rushed from Zhabei, Hongkou, and other places. Because they were unaware of the distribution procedures, they eagerly came from afar on the first day the distribution news spread. Although the distribution point knew that they did not meet the procedures, in order to avoid letting them come in vain, they still distributed to them as well, so that everyone returned fully loaded.

The distributed items included nine boxes each of K and D food boxes, all of which were surplus supplies from the U.S. military. The K-type food box was divided into three categories – breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast contained 3.75 ounces of diced meat stewed with egg, four crackers, one packet of coffee, four sugar cubes, one piece of fruit jelly, one piece of chewing gum, one portion of wheat paste, four cigarettes, and a bundle of cleaning paper. Lunch contained four ounces of cheese, eight crackers, one piece of chocolate fudge, seven grams of fruit juice, 1.2 ounces of carob sugar, four cigarettes, one piece of chewing gum, and one box of matches. Dinner contained four ounces of braised meat, four crackers, ten grams of beef juice, eight milk candies, one packet of coffee, 23 grams of carob sugar, four cigarettes, and one piece of chewing gum. The D-type food box contained a large piece of chocolate mixed candy, which contained seven nutrients such as cocoa powder, flour essence, sugar, milk, starch, and Vitamin B. Each public school teacher and civil servant could get nine boxes of D-type food, and K-type food - three boxes each of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

According to Yin Tiyang, the director of the Goods Distribution Office, who told the reporter: There are a total of 120,000 registered public school teachers and civil servants in this city, and 50,000 have already been issued distribution certificates, with the remainder being distributed continuously. The first phase of food distribution will be completed by the end of this month. The second phase of distribution has been set as cotton cloth, including Indanthrene blue, poplin, fine cloth, etc., with an average of one bolt of cloth for every four people. Distribution can begin from the 25th of this month. There is also good news to report to the public school teachers and civil servants in this city: the Goods Distribution Office has signed a long-term contract with the Materials Supply Bureau, so that daily necessities and other items can be supplied continuously. Because there are many types of daily necessities, and various different daily necessities may not be able to supply enough for the 120,000 people in this city to distribute. To solve this difficulty, the Distribution Office has decided to set up several retail stores throughout the city for public sale. Public school teachers and civil servants can go to any store and choose at will with their ration cards. The office has now printed special light blue ration cards, with characters printed according to the Thousand Character Classic, such as "Heaven, Earth, Yuan, Yellow, Universe, Flood, Desolate," and so on. The "Heaven" card has been designated for food boxes, the "Earth" card will be designated for cotton cloth, and the "Yuan" card has a good chance of buying daily necessities. The section chief said that if there are enough items to distribute to all 120,000 people in the future, they will all be distributed equally. If there are not enough various items to distribute, then individual purchases will be adopted.

Regarding the food boxes distributed this time, it was widely rumored in the newspapers the day before yesterday that most of them were moldy, but according to the section chief, this is not true. Surplus supplies from the U.S. military are protected layer upon layer with wax paper, so even if a long time has passed, they should not be moldy. However, perhaps there are a few food boxes among them, which, after a long journey of transportation, have wax surfaces that have fallen off. If they have been in the warehouse for a long time, and are invaded by the surrounding heat, then the phenomenon of mold may not be entirely impossible. But this is a very small number. There may not be one box in nine boxes. Moreover, the Materials Supply Bureau has promised that any moldy boxes can be exchanged. However, according to the results of the Health Bureau's investigation, even a small amount of moldy food can still be eaten after cooking, and retains all the vitamins it contains.

Also, in order to explain the distribution procedures and make the situation of the office clear to all sectors, the Public School Teachers and Civil Servants Goods Distribution Office is scheduled to host the city's press at the City Hall Auditorium at 2:00 p.m. today.

### "Pickpocket Brigade" to be Sent to Court Tomorrow

[Special Report by This Newspaper] A "pickpocket brigade" composed of five to six hundred men, women, old and young, will be escorted under strict police guard to the District Court tomorrow (the 14th)!

The police bureau has made a great determination to eliminate all pickpockets in the city. The bureau has issued orders, strictly ordering each branch bureau to effectively arrest all thieves within its jurisdiction. This "general cleaning" started on the 9th of this month and is scheduled to be completed on the 14th, when all arrestees will be concentrated at the General Bureau. Each branch bureau has already begun to execute these orders; the New City Branch Bureau has caught eighty people, the General Bureau has caught more than forty people, and other branch bureaus have caught thirty or twenty people. The current estimate is that even though these pickpockets have already begun to "avoid the limelight," by the time the deadline arrives, the total number arrested will not be less than five or six hundred!

The police bureau plans to send all these people to the District Court according to law. After they are sent there, several of those with more serious circumstances may be sentenced to one or two months in prison. After one or two months, they will be released after serving their sentences.

What about after their release?

Find a job and start a new life - I am afraid that there will not be many companies or businesses willing to take in people with this kind of past history. The Caohejing Relief Center and Refugee Shelter run by the Social Bureau are already overcrowded. Go to work? The current situation of factories is really not prosperous. If they could find wages based on the cost of living standard, they would not have been forced onto this last road long ago.

Eight or nine out of ten of them will return to their "old profession." What the one-month confinement has given them may only be more "research" and improvement of skills: the "beginners" become "old hands," and the timid gain courage.

Among those recently caught in the General Bureau who are so-called "defeated on the battlefield," one is a boy surnamed Wang who is just ten years old. He fled from northern Jiangsu. His parents are teetering on the brink of starvation, and this child can only find a way to survive on his own.

He is hungry. Seeing someone carrying rice passing by, he went up and grabbed the rice. Unexpectedly, the rice was still in his hand and had not reached his mouth when he was slapped hard in the face. The person who hit him was not the waiter carrying the rice, but another slightly older "gangster." He wanted to fight back, but he shrank back. He could not beat that gangster. There are many new-style cars coming and going on the Bund, and he can only stand there, starving.

Suddenly, someone waved to him. This person was also a gangster, but he kindly called him over, gave him money, and told him to buy a bowl of plain noodles. That person told the boy surnamed Wang to go with him, but there was one condition: the child had to be his "target receiver."

What is a "target receiver"? This gangster is a pickpocket. After he steals something, to avoid attracting attention, he gives the thing to the child first, tells him to keep it temporarily, and then returns it to him when the owner is not paying attention.

The child happily agreed. He was hungry; moreover, there were so many people in Shanghai, and he was so small, and what he had to do seemed so easy.

Slowly, he also started to try to steal himself. One day, he stole a chicken at the pier. Suddenly, a big hand landed on his shoulder. Turning his head, he saw a policeman.

In the police station, he said innocently that stealing chickens was not the first time. Sometimes, he just stole one and ran away, but the chicken was snatched away by another gangster. When he was lucky, the stolen goods were sold smoothly, and he could get two or three thousand yuan and eat a few more bowls of plain noodles.

He said that what he envied most were those primary school students who were neatly dressed and went to school. What he feared most was what he was most used to—hunger!

"King" Arrested at the Gaofeng Ballroom

[Report from This Newspaper] Sun Hao, a staff member of the Penglai Branch Bureau in Nanshi, received a tip last night that a large number of pickpockets were dancing at the Gaofeng Ballroom in the Great World. At around 10 p.m. last night, Staff Member Sun led armed police officers and brought the informant there. After the informant correctly identified him, they arrested Shao Xingbao (23 years old, from Ningbo), the "Pickpocket King," on the spot. At the time, the suspect was trying to escape. The police officers drew their guns and chased him, causing chaos in the ballroom and damaging many tables, chairs, and glass displays. It also disturbed the Great World amusement park, and the authorities temporarily closed the iron gates. In the end, the suspect was arrested and taken back for investigation.

### Raping, Plundering, Kidnapping, Extorting, Massacring the People, and Committing All Kinds of Evil: Liu Xun, a Demon in Lianshi Town, Sentenced to Death

[Report from This Newspaper] Liu Xun, the supplementary captain of the 3rd Company of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade stationed in Lianshi Town, Wuxing County, abused his power during his tenure and committed all kinds of evil in Jibu Township, Yu'ao Township, Lianshi Town, Wulong Township, Liren Township, and other places in the county, including raping, plundering, kidnapping, extorting, massacring the people. The local people all hated him to the bone. After the victory, the township heads and the Sanminzhuyi Youth League and others reported him. He was arrested in this city and imprisoned in the Shanghai Prison on December 15 last year. After the High Court concluded its trial, it sentenced the defendant to death, deprived him of his civil rights for life, and confiscated all of his property except for what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of his family at ten o'clock this morning in the Second Criminal Court.

Liu was wearing a plain outfit, had a flat-top haircut, and wore bare feet and cloth shoes. His eyes were sinister and his face was full of murderous intent. When he heard the death sentence, he immediately said, "Reporting, sir, I am really wronged. They have no evidence to accuse me. Heaven knows this." The presiding judge told him, "This court still wants to apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial for you." Upon hearing this, the defendant arrogantly replied, "I will appeal myself." After speaking, he was escorted back to prison by bailiffs.

According to reports, Liu Xun, also known as Liu Liben, was 42 years old and from Pingjiang, Hunan. He once participated in the War of Resistance. In April of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was captured by the enemy army in Wuxing County. After investigation, his documents showed that he had previously served in the guerrilla隊. Later, he was guaranteed by Cheng Wanjun, the division commander of the Pseudo-Army Fifth Division, and released in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943] and served in Cheng's 部. Later, it was reorganized and downsized, so he lived in Lianshi Town, Wuxing County, at his wife Shen Wenying's mother's house. Later, because He Jianzhang, the captain of the 3rd Company of the Pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Security Brigade, led his troops to garrison the town, Brigade Commander He Jingsheng appointed Liu as the supplementary captain under He Jianzhang's command. After being stationed there for several months, he abused his power. In the spring of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he kidnapped Chen Quanmao, the deputy township head, in the 11th Bao of Jibu Township, Wuxing County. Township office staff Xu Yan, the Bao chief Shen Yuanchang, and others were redeemed with huge sums of money. In the same year, he organized a pseudo-police team in Yu'ao Township, armed with weapons, and committed violent acts of rape, plunder, kidnapping, extortion, and murder. He raped and extorted in Lianshi Town, and went down to the countryside to rob and kill those who resisted the war. In June of the same year, he accused Shen Yuxin, a villager in Wulong Township, of being an intelligence agent for our side. Because the extortion failed, he killed him. In January of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], he led a team to ransack Kandi, a Taoist in the 7th Bao of the township, and Liuzi River in the 9th Bao, etc. In September of the same year, he captured villagers Xu Fuyuan and others in Liren Township and secretly imprisoned them in the team headquarters, demanding rice for ransom, and shot and killed Shen Ruilin, the township head of the township, on the spot. Although the defendant quibbled and denied the aforementioned evils, Qiu Miaoxian, the township head of Jibu Township, Wu Benli, the town head of Lianshi Town, Lan Benying, the township head of Yu'ao Township, Niu Bingfa, the township head of Wulong Township, and Shi Damin, the township head of Liren Township, all detailed their accounts and testified on the record. The High Court considered that his crimes were unforgivable, so it sentenced him to death.

### Four Petty Traitors Sentenced in Various Places

On the same day, several suspected traitors were also sentenced, including Wu Binglin, the pseudo-Bao chief, and Gui Henghai, the translator, each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, and Shang A'er, the foreman, sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment.

Also, Liu Zhaoding was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. The defendant, with a sad face and tears, pleaded to the court, "Sir! Can't you lighten the sentence a little more? I'm really wronged." The presiding judge told him that he could apply for a retrial. Liu then nodded and followed the bailiff back to prison.

### Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang Scheduled to be Sentenced on the 19th

On the same day, the trial of Yuan Shixiang and Chen Huichang, the managers of the Laoda Hua Ballroom and the Venus Cafe, on suspicion of being traitors, was concluded and scheduled to be sentenced on the 19th of this month. In addition, the three cases of Wang Qiugen, Shen Sanlang, and Wu Wenmao will be investigated again at a later date.

Also, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit against Sun Zhonghe, Zhang A'wu, Huang Heting, and others on suspicion of being traitors. Xu Jinrong and others were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.

He took a plane to Hong Kong and then to Russia that day. The Universal Wireless Telegraph Company hosted a farewell banquet at the American Club the night before.

### Huo Mulin Dies in Shanghai, The Engineering Community Mourns

Huo Mulin (see picture), a native of Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, was a Bachelor of Engineering from Fudan University and a Master of Civil Engineering from Cornell University in the United States. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he made many contributions to the railway engineering on various fronts in the rear. After the victory, he came to Shanghai in April of the 35th year of the Republic [1946] and served as the chief engineer and engineering section chief of the Jinghu District Railway Engineering Office. He achieved outstanding performance in his management. Unfortunately, he died on September 5th and was cremated on the 8th. The engineering community mourned him greatly.

### Another Hai Su Ship Arrives in Shanghai, China Merchants Bureau Prepares to Take Over, One U.S. Cruiser Leaves Shanghai

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shengli Ship, which was previously purchased by the China Merchants Bureau from the United States, has been renamed the Hai Su. The ship is currently being repaired at the Ruirong Shipyard. Yesterday morning, another Hai Su Ship arrived in Shanghai, which was the agency of the Foreign Department of Jardine Matheson. It is said that the ship is also one of the four ships purchased by the China Merchants Bureau in the United States. It was loaded with more than 1,000 tons of flour in Vancouver and came to Shanghai. It is now moored on the Pujiang River surface in Nanshi at buoy numbers nine and ten. As soon as the goods are unloaded, it will be handed over to the China Merchants Bureau. It is heard that the first Hai Rong Ship will arrive in Shanghai on the 18th. The ship has a large number of railway sleepers loaded. The third Hai Heng Ship will come to Shanghai on the 26th. The fourth ship will arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. All of them will be gradually taken over by the Bureau.

[Report from This Newspaper] The U.S. 10,000-ton cruiser No. 87, the USS Thuras, came to Shanghai at the beginning of last month and was moored in front of the Jianghai Customs Office on the Pujiang River surface at the U.S. Navy pontoon. It left Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and its destination is unknown.

### Female Hostesses to Obtain Occupational Certificates, Police Bureau to Start Processing Immediately

[Report from This Newspaper] In principle, female hostesses in bars and cafes should absolutely not dance with guests. However, many female hostesses in this city also engage in dancing.

### Introducing "Soviet Light" Is a Sports Film

The Shanghai Light Grand Theater recently showed a Soviet film, whose Chinese name is "Soviet Light". The content is all about the recent Soviet Sports Games, which is extremely exciting. Those in our country who care about sports should watch it. The writer solemnly introduces it, hoping that people in the sports world will pay attention. Don't think that "Soviet Light" is a film of another nature. In fact, this is exactly the valuable film that our sports world wants to see. All in five colors, the colors are beautiful, and the film shows thousands of male and female athletes from various Soviet federations gathering in Moscow to open the sports games. The film is full of performances of various group exercises, accompanied by music, with neat movements, novel programs, and a great scene. The whole film lasts more than an hour, which shows its length. The sports world, sports instructors, and sports teachers should all watch it to broaden their horizons. The staff who translated the film title seem to be responsible for causing misunderstanding. The original name of the film was "The March of Sports in Moscow", but it was translated into "Soviet Light". It is unknown what this light word does, and it is unknown whether the translator deliberately mystified it. If so, it would be counterproductive.

### To Increase the Speed of Soccer Games; Famous British Soccer Team Proposes Modifying Soccer Rules; Free Kick to Replace Throw-in

[Reuters, London, 9th] Norman Baucet, manager of the British Albin soccer team and sixteen-time selection for the British international soccer team, suggested that the soccer rules of the British Football Association be modified. Albin argued that when the ball goes out of bounds, the current throw-in should be changed to a free kick by the other side, which can also increase the speed of the game. Baucet recorded a record in a game last season, where a total of ninety minutes were spent on out-of-bounds balls, totaling thirty-five minutes. Baucet argued that the free kick in this new rule cannot directly shoot the ball into the goal. The British Football Association has designated two teams to try the new rules at the Birmingham Club's stadium today. Many people support Baucet's proposal, and many people in the British Football Association also agree.

### More Yarn Numbers Are Sold Off; Matching Yarn Emphasizes Actual Users; Textile Construction Opens 36 Types of Fine Cloth

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the yarn market fluctuated slightly. In the early morning, 42-count yarn was once quoted at 1.9 million yuan. Because Textile Construction unexpectedly allocated all yarn numbers to general applications the day before, most yarn merchants were not prepared for loans. Due to financial constraints, many were willing to sell off their yarn. Later, some people took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the price continued to rise. At noon, 42-count yarn was traded at 2.24 million yuan. 20-count Alliance Phoenix, Shanghai warehouse receipt, was 1.34 million, a decrease of 40,000 from the previous day. 20-count 　Year was quoted at 1.2 million, but there was very little spot stock. Double Horse initially shouted 1.45 to 1.46 million and then rose to 1.5 million, with the highest transaction at 1.51 million. However, sales were not as brisk as the previous week. Textile Construction participated in the Joint Committee of Private Yarn Factories and supplied as much cotton yarn as possible to the group. The price of futures for Shu Yue Shuang Xian fell sharply. Originally quoted at 1.9 million, some people were selling at 1.95 million in the market because they could not afford to pay for the goods. General observation suggests that the yarn price will not rise exorbitantly in the near future. Today's allocation is still for general actual users.

The Second Phase of Yarn Allocation Remains at 30,000 Bales

The survey department of Textile Construction announced that the company's purpose for this cotton yarn price suppression and establishment of an allocation system is to distribute a total of 30,000 bales in the first batch. Among them, 20,000 bales allocated to private factories were fully allocated yesterday. Starting today, the company will begin allocating its own 10,000 bales. If this allocation result fails to suppress black market prices, the company will adhere to its original intention and continue to hold a second allocation, with the quantity determined to be 30,000 bales as the standard.

Yarn Numbers Plead for Restoration of Allocation

There are more than 400 cotton yarn firms in this city. Zeng Zu established the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Commercial Guild, with Tang Zhiliang as the chairman. The guild stated that Textile Construction recently did not allocate cotton yarn to cotton yarn firms with more than 80 years of history, but directly allocated it to middleman dealers and duplicating merchants, namely dyeing and weaving factories, underwear factories, towel and bedding factories, handkerchief factories, knitting and cotton weaving factories, and other five groups. The reason given was the suspicion that dealers were manipulating prices and hoarding. Therefore, there has been no allocation in the past three weeks, which is considered a mistake. According to Shen Boqin of the guild, in the late Qing Dynasty, the industry had no organization and only produced domestic yarn. Subsequently, India and Japan successively imported cotton yarn, commonly known as "foreign yarn". Later, British merchants such as Jardine Matheson and Laogongmao and others set up textile factories by themselves, which increased year by year. To date, state-owned yarn factories have 1.2 million spindles. Cotton yarn firms have been freely buying and selling on behalf of customers for more than 40 years. Initially, there was no guild at the Qingliang Pavilion tea house, followed by the establishment of exchanges such as the Japanese Exchange, which bought and sold short, speculated, and hoarded. Later, the central government ordered the establishment of an industry guild. Before the war, members of yarn firms bought and sold with duplicating merchants. Now, members are instead purchasing surplus cotton yarn from duplicating merchants at high prices. After members of yarn firms purchase it, they resell it to small industrial manufacturers, with the "Real Boat Brand Warehouse Receipt" of Zhongfang Company sold by Tongfengxiang Yihua as proof. Members of the industry guild not only do not raise prices and sell, but also duplicating merchants have the right to sell to yarn firms. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the guild held a tea party for the local press at 4 Ningbo Road, Tongheli, to report the history of the guild, the past situation of middleman sales, and the current plight of each member firm without yarn to operate. It is hoped that Textile Construction will understand the guild's history and restore the allocation of cotton yarn in the future to maintain business.

The Method of Ordering Payments Is Intended to Prevent Fraudulent Claims

The business office of Textile Construction stated that recently, there are many customers purchasing goods, and payments are crowded. To facilitate verification, it is stipulated that starting today, each customer's payment is limited to one bank note (bank or money shop crossed check), and the amount should match the total amount of the purchase order. All bank notes made up of odd numbers will not be accepted, and purchase orders with different account names may not be combined for payment to avoid errors. To prevent customers from buying and selling purchase orders, the company also learned that recently, when distributing purchase orders, various factories and firms often fraudulently claim payments. If this is discovered in the future, in addition to stopping the issuance of warehouse receipts, the payment will not be refunded.

Currently, 70% of Factories Are Operating, and Two Factories Have Shut Down

According to the person in charge of the business office of the company, due to the impact of electricity saving, two factories, Tongxing and Dafeng, have declared shutdowns, but the remaining factories are operating day and night. The original spindle count was 800,000, and the current operating spindle count has reached 620,000, with an operating rate of 70%. The daily cotton cloth production reaches 16,000 pieces, and the daily cotton yarn production reaches 900 pieces.

Cotton Cloth Is Still Stable, and Textile Construction Follows the Original Price

The cotton cloth market price is flat. Blue V-shape initially opened at 62,000 yuan and then fell to 61,500 yuan for transactions. Serge was quoted at 63,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Unbranded fine cloth was quoted at 53,500 yuan, and most buyers were for spot goods, while warehouse receipt goods were 500 yuan less. Various colored cloths were generally flat. Mainland 190 Shilin was 95,000 yuan, Jiuru Deep Shilin was 94,000 yuan, Shuanglu Yuan fine cloth was 66,000 yuan, twill was 65,500 yuan. Textile Construction opened 36 types of its own brand fine cloth, etc., still at the original price. 3A color ball was 53,000 yuan, and unbranded fine cloth was 52,500 yuan. 19 types of American-Mexican printed cloth were also opened.

### Loan Handling Fees

The Ministry of Finance Orders Strict Investigation

"Our Dispatch" The interest rate on bank loans should be based on the local central bank's announced rate, as stipulated. However, local banks often exceed the central bank's announced rate and convert the excess portion into handling fees, etc. Whether this is legal and whether it should be investigated. The Four Joint Offices has received a letter from the Ministry of Finance Jingqian Gengzi No. 1686, deeming it inappropriate and ordering strict investigation. It is reported that the Four Joint Offices has notified the six general banks and bureaus.

### Market Practice Gradually Improves; Stock Exchange Expected to Open Trading on Monday; Brokers Whose Initial Review Was Not Approved Re-submit Supplementary Documents to the Ministry for Review

In addition, regarding the two points that the Stock Exchange had previously requested instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance: (1) Promulgate the transaction tax collection method as soon as possible. (2) Determine the regulations for the substitute portion of the margin as soon as possible.

After the completion, various committee affairs will be handed over to the Stock Exchange Board of Directors for handling.

### Raw Sugar Falls Below Allocation Price; Sugar Market Gradually Changes

Yesterday, the sugar market weakened because the company opened the 13th phase. The price of medium sugar was 140,000 yuan per plate, and the price of raw sugar was 120,000 yuan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan. Therefore, the market was extremely weak. The minimum price set by the guild fell below the company's opening price, especially for raw sugar. The spot price of medium white sugar was 144,000 to 145,000 yuan, the price for delivery at the pier was 142,000 to 143,000 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was 139,000 to 140,000 yuan.

### Sichuan Medicinal Materials Strive for Export; Set Up Test Site to Seek Alternative Export Routes

[Our Dispatch, Chongqing, 11th] In order to develop the export of Sichuan medicinal materials, the Sichuan Provincial Government has decided to collect existing medicinal materials from Sichuan to conduct variety comparison tests and further compare them with important foreign drugs. It has been designated to establish medicinal material test sites in Guanxian and Emei to study packaging, storage, transportation, and production costs of medicinal materials. It is reported that the current exports of Sichuan medicinal materials are mainly angelica, fritillaria, and ephedra, and currently, they are all exported via Shanghai. If the facts permit, highway transportation will be increased in the future, and exported from the southwest.

### Large Quantities of American Flour Arrive at the Port

[Our Dispatch] The Tianting Shipping Company manager, Fu Tuo Axue, brought more than 8,000 tons of flour from Vancouver on the "Huboni". It is currently berthed at floating docks 40 and 41 for unloading. The China Merchants Bureau's new ship, Haisu, managed by the Foreign Department of Jardine Matheson, brought 1,200 tons of flour from Vancouver, purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. It was imported yesterday afternoon. The export ship Haimin will sail to Qingdao today, carrying more than 800 bags of beans and about 700 tons of groceries. The ship, Yanyue, will sail to Guangdong this afternoon. Because the yarn market is prohibited from being transported to Fujian and Guangdong, it will only load more than 2,000 tons of groceries, mainly medicinal materials.

### Business Tax Collected in Different Levels; This City Can Order Separate Regulations; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the City Council to Make Proposals

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce recently approved a letter from the Municipal Chemical Raw Materials Commercial Guild and specially suggested to the Municipal Council of this city to revise the separate regulations for the collection of business tax in this city, referring to the pre-war successful cases. The original letter briefly stated: In addition to handling business tax in accordance with the Business Tax Law resolved by the Legislative Yuan in June 1931, most of them have separate regulations within the scope of the tax law, based on local conditions, in order to suit local conditions. During the Anti-Japanese War, the government assigned business tax to the central government in order to enrich military needs. The methods of implementation of only tax methods in various provinces and cities have been abolished. The method of taxation has lost its flexibility, and the burden on merchants has inevitably been heavy. Although the association has repeatedly presented it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to restore the above-mentioned method, the reply has always been based on the tax law, and it has not been allowed to change. Now that business tax has restored the pre-war system, it will soon be reassigned to the municipal government for collection. The Business Tax Law Implementation Rules amended and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on August 16th this year do not restrict provinces from enacting their own separate regulations. The association suggests that the three items from the previous method should be restored. It is planned to ask your council to suggest that the municipal government, referring to the separate regulations and tax rate classification table for the collection of business tax in this city in 1932, have the Finance Bureau make a draft and submit it to the council for review and approval for implementation.

### Government Bonds Hover

Government bonds are still fluctuating. Most transactions across different issues are sporadic, with large investors waiting for opportunities. Unified Bonds opened at 2250 yuan in the morning, rising to 2380 yuan after opening, with some remaining long positions being closed. The price fell to 2150 yuan midway through the session, hovering around 2250 yuan near the close. As a result, the price rose slightly by 100 yuan compared to the previous close. Unified Bonds D remained stable, while Bonds A, B, and E fell by 50 yuan, continuing the uncertain trend.

### Gold and Paper Money Both Decline Slightly

Smelted gold was very stable yesterday. Opening at 2,165,000, there was slight pressure, and it slightly decreased, retreating to around 2,160,000. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 53 bars at a price of 2,157,500. Afterward, it briefly fell to 2,150,000 before recovering. At noon, it hovered around 2,155,000. In the afternoon, forward contracts continued to decline slightly, resulting in a drop of about 10,000 compared to the previous close. Ornament gold was 22,900. Sycee silver and silver dollars remained unchanged. Unofficial interest rates were stable, with interest rates around 1.5%.

Foreign currencies did not perform well. American dollars opened at 3420 yuan in the morning with sellers, but demand was low, and buyers were scarce. At noon, it retreated to around 3380 yuan. In the afternoon, it remained weak, falling further to around 3360 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, it fell by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange rate against gold widened to 638 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars were very volatile, returning to a little over ten yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 685 yuan, and Indian remittances were 825 yuan, both with transactions.

Zhen Zhen Mei and Keemun black tea have very firm bases. According to industry sources, an African company recently telephoned a tea company in the city, requesting the packing of Chen Chou Zhen, but the offered price was very tight. It is heard that the order has already been signed and is expected to be exported soon. As for B.OP mark Taiwan fine black tea, which is in short supply, Indian firms have strong demand and are willing to pay a good price. Therefore, industry insiders are consulting with the production areas. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, local tea firms and the areas of Suzhou and Wuxi are not showing weakness.

### Silk Firms Obtain Rations; Artificial Silk Prices Fall

Yesterday, the China Textile Company continued to ration artificial silk to silk firms at similar prices to the previous period, leading to a collapse in the black market. 120 count Tianqiao Youguang silk opened low, falling from 2,650,000 to close at 630,000. In the afternoon, buyers disappeared, and it plummeted to 560,000, a decrease of 120,000 compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brands such as Youguang and Banguang also fell by more than 100,000. The silk market was strong, with active sales, but Huajin silk fell by 50 yuan due to a drop in raw material prices.

### Yong Yuan Securities Firm Opens

### Raw Materials and Finished Products are Taxed; Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Nanjing for Wool Textile Industry

[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Wool Textile Industry Association, listed four points regarding the current difficulties of the industry that are worth considering, requesting assistance in appealing for a delay in the collection of the wool textile goods tax. A special telegram was sent to the Nanjing Executive Yuan, requesting approval for a temporary suspension of the tax. The original telegram stated: "The industry is suffering from the pressure of foreign goods, high raw material prices, and increased wages, and 30% of businesses have already closed. Now there is a tax on wool yarn and another tax on wool textiles, which is essentially double taxation on the same item, adding insult to injury. This is not in line with the national policy of protecting industry. Therefore, it is necessary to temporarily suspend the collection of the industry's goods tax."

### Ten Thousand People Vie to See the Zhejiang Tide

— Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 7th, Chu Yusheng

The Qiantang River's tidal bore has always been famous. As far back as the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, many high-ranking officials came to Qiantang to watch the tide every year on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month. During the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong sent representatives to Haining twice to observe the tide and spent a great amount of national funds to rebuild the Sea God Temple, showing that repairing the stone seawall was indeed the emperor's accomplishment. However, the emperor was the "son of heaven," and the emperor's respect for the Sea God also required the common people to piously worship, and this worship was to make the common people believe in the emperor and prevent anyone from seizing the emperor's position.

Recently, the number of people coming to Hangzhou from Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places to watch the tide has been increasing day by day. All the hotels are fully booked, and all vehicles going to Haining have been reserved. Hangzhou is full of accents from the Shanghai-Nanjing line, and restaurants, entertainment venues, and fruit stalls are thriving three times as much as usual. It is expected that on the 13th (i.e., the 18th day of the eighth lunar month), 40,000 people will go to Haining to watch the tide.

### Twenty Thousand People from Nanjing-Shanghai Area Want to See the Tide

Since the Republic of China, there have been even more tide watchers after the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. From Qibao in Hangzhou to Chenwengang in Haining and beyond, the sea wall is filled with spectators. Nanjing and Shanghai both have special trains to Hangzhou, or transfers to Haining from Chang'an. On the long seawall from Qibao to Haining, many people set up stands, food stalls, and even temporary Chinese and Western restaurants. Haining is even more crowded, with all the hotels, large and small, fully booked. Even just a spot on the floor in an inn can be sold at a high price. In the middle of the night, some people waiting for the tide, not sleeping, suddenly shout, "The tide is coming!" The guests hurriedly dress and rush to see the annual Qiantang River tide. Although everyone has been fooled, they still smile and have no complaints.

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Hangzhou and Haining were successively occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese were most afraid of our guerrilla teams and did not allow people to gather. The tide came with great force, but without the cheering from the people on the shore, it quietly left, and the stone seawall collapsed quite a bit.

Last year (the 34th year of the Republic of China), the enemy had just surrendered. Although the tide could be watched, everyone had no mood or courage to watch it because it was not known whether the road was easy to travel. This year (the 35th year of the Republic of China) in July, the Nanjing-Shanghai area has already been brewing the organization of "tide-watching groups." Although in the early part of the eighth lunar month, the two railway bureaus said that the road surface of Changning Road was uneven and no special trains would be opened, the people watching the tide were still preparing. According to my knowledge, at least 20,000 people from the Nanjing-Shanghai area are going to watch the tide. Just taking Hangzhou as an example, people from large and small organizations and groups are preparing to watch the tide, and even more from the business community. Some have already chartered cars, and some are already in contact with transportation. China Travel Service and several car companies have formed tide-watching groups to watch the tide. I believe that on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, if the weather is clear, Hangzhou will definitely become a city of empty streets.

### Haining Shops Are All Decorating and Arranging

On the Haining side, the seaside park is being cleaned up, stands are being built, and each store is decorating and arranging. Some families are specially vacating their houses to be used as inns and restaurants. These many stores are competing with each other, trying to outdo each other, and striving to do business. It is just that the Sea God Temple has collapsed beyond recognition, and the city appearance has been destroyed beyond all standards. They can only build some sheds on the ruins of broken walls as a base for doing business, and hang high gasoline lamps as a symbol to attract customers.

Why is the 18th day of the eighth lunar month particularly lively? In the past, according to the emperor's regulations, this day was the birthday of the Tide God (that is, the Sea God). Many farmers did go to worship because of the tide, and many fashionable people also went to join in the fun and burn incense at the Sea God Temple. Of course, their main purpose was still to watch the tide.

According to scientific research: the factors that form the tide are the radiation and attraction relationship of sunlight and moonlight. When radiation reaches a certain level, tides occur. Because the moon is closer to the earth, the tides are often determined by the movement of the moon. Our lunar calendar is based on the moon, so the tide must be large on the 15th day of each lunar month, and especially large from the 15th to the 18th day of the eighth lunar month.

From the perspective of the entire earth, there are only two pieces of land and a large peninsula in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Southern Hemisphere can be said to be a vast ocean. It is illuminated by moonlight, so the tide is a common thing. However, this tide is a primitive tide, with a difference of only one foot between high and low tide. The ocean flows from the south to the edge of the vast plains in the north. Because the coastline has different widths, it creates relatively high waves. Tidal bores like the Qiantang River are not unique in the world. The tide between Newfoundland, Canada, also has a difference of 50 feet between high and low tide. The Haizhou Bay in our country also has a difference of two zhang between high and low tide, but it takes six hours for the tide to rise and six hours for the tide to recede, unlike the Qiantang River tidal bore, which rises and falls so quickly.

The fame of the Qiantang River tide lies in having a "tidal head" Tidal of Bore; that is, the tide rises suddenly within one-fifth of the time of rising tide, and then rises again after forty minutes, thus creating a spectacular phenomenon of rushing and surging, like thousands of troops and horses swarming. Therefore, many hydrologists from around the world come to Zhejiang to study it.

We Chinese people often only know how to watch the tide, but do not know the origin of the tide, and where the strangeness of the Zhejiang tide lies. Some people even think that the real Sea God is playing tricks, the Sea God is showing his power, and the Sea God is appearing.

### Qiantang River Tides Always Bring Comfort

According to science, to measure the time the tide comes, the 15th day of the lunar month will be around 12:15 (the time for the following sections is the same), the 16th day at 13:00, the 17th day at 13:45, and the 18th day at 14:30. Afterwards, the tide arrival time decreases by forty-eight minutes each day, and the tide also gradually decreases because it has reached its peak; it gradually increases from the tenth of each month.

We should not just ignorantly worship the "tide" and let it go, because this kind of worship cannot stop it from destroying your dikes and your homes. We should not passively defend it, because passive defense is indefensible. Military strategy once said: "Prepare for future troubles, prepare for past troubles, be prepared for everything, and there will be no troubles." Therefore, the most proactive and best method is to guide it and use it to our advantage.

Many water conservancy engineering experts told me: "If we want to harness the Qiantang River, we must plan the riverbed so that the water has a certain channel, so that it does not flow east and west. When the tide comes, we can use it for hydroelectric power generation, and this powerful electricity can be accumulated and used." Yes, this plan still needs to be studied and worked on, but if we have ideals, we will succeed, and if we work hard, we will eventually achieve results.

We firmly oppose the past ignorant worship of the Tide God. We are the people of the twentieth century. We must stand up and fight the sea tide. As long as those of us who passively enjoy watching the tide and the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang make sustained efforts, the tides on the banks of the Qiantang River will one day bring us infinite comfort.

### Four Philanthropists Cooperate to Donate a Large Sum of Money; Emergency Loan to Proceed Soon; Decide to Formulate Regulations, Appoint Special Hospitals, and Handle with Caution; Set up a Committee to be Responsible for the Custody of Funds and Distribution for Use

To the Editor: Reading the community service column of your esteemed newspaper, I learned that an anonymous person initiated a temporary emergency loan fund. This matter is beneficial to the poor and sick and is truly significant. For the sake of supporting its early realization, Zhaolin and others have specially collected 15 million yuan, specifically for the use of this loan. We hope that your newspaper will handle it as soon as possible for the benefit of society. We eagerly await its success. Respectfully, to the Shen Bao (Also, if the funds can be stored in a bank, we request the bank to particularly increase the deposit interest rate, so that more emergency cases can be helped).

Respectfully, Zou Zhaolin, Jiang Xuexi, and Ye Desheng, September 12th

[Editor's Note] This letter and donation were delivered personally by an old clerk, roughly fifty years old, at 2:30 PM yesterday. At that time, besides asking him to convey my thanks, I inquired about the donors' backgrounds, occupations, and motives for donating…etc. He said that the donors instructed "doing good does not require much talk," and requested that the letter be published to inspire the compassion of people in society and to jointly promote righteous deeds. These few words are enough to show the benevolence and world-saving hearts of Mr. Zou, Jiang, and Ye, which are sure to achieve the noble ideal of "doing good is the greatest joy."

This good news had just spread throughout our colleagues when another pleasant report arrived, saying that the "anonymous" Mr. who first proposed the "emergency loan" in the letter the day before yesterday had sent an additional 3 million yuan, combining with the already donated 2 million, making it 5 million yuan. Thanks to the cooperation of the four benevolent philanthropists, it happens to be the whole number of the 12 million yuan that we proposed for the "emergency fund." It is predicted that emergency patients at sea will be spared from endless suffering and disaster due to the cooperative donation of these four benevolent philanthropists, achieving immeasurable happiness of "stability and well-being in all directions." This is such a fortunate omen. The original letter from the "anonymous" benefactor is recorded below:

To the Editor: Reading your esteemed newspaper's community service section on the 10th, I am deeply grateful that my request has been accepted! It also indicates that if the basic amount cannot be raised to 20 million yuan, it would be difficult to start, which is indeed a fact. However, I find it difficult to increase the amount by 18 million yuan all at once. However, I believe that there must be many worthy people in society who agree with this cause. To the best of my ability, I am sending another 3 million yuan. There is still a shortage of funds, and I think that in the short term, there will definitely be generous people who will respond enthusiastically. I am sending this special letter to express my gratitude. Respectfully, to the Shen Bao Anonymous, September 12th

### Married in Shanghai, Coming from Nanjing; Zhuang Xinzhou's Residence in Nanjing Burglarized and Recovered

— Report from our reporter in Nanjing

The Hunan Road Police Station under the jurisdiction of the Capital Northern District Police Department reported on the 6th of this month that a leather suitcase was found on the lawn of the High Gate Building. It contained clothing of considerable value. After inspection, it was learned that it belonged to Mr. Zhuang Xinzhou of No. 15 High Gate Chess. It is presumed that the thief stole it from Mr. Zhuang's residence, but abandoned it there because he could not bear the weight.

### Public Utility Prices Should Not Be Too High; Suggest Municipal Council Approve Reasonable Standards

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau of our city is actively increasing the number of public buses operated by the bureau and opening new routes for the development of public transportation in our city, which is praised by all citizens. However, the fare for the routes opened by the bureau recently is too high, which is not in line with the purpose of facilitating citizen transportation, and its excessive profits should also be corrected by our citizens at any time.

It is found that the bureau started operating route 6 public buses from Caojiadu to Laoximen in early September, and its fares are divided into five types: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 yuan. However, when the prices of various public utilities were adjusted in the spring of this year, the bureau stipulated that the maximum price of public buses should not exceed 300 yuan. Therefore, the current maximum fare for the bureau's route 3 and the French-owned tram company's route 22 public buses is 300 yuan. It is found that the distance of route 6 public buses is not longer than that of route 3 public buses, but the difference in the maximum fare reaches 200 yuan, which is a ratio of five to three. Even in terms of the same mileage, the fare for route 6 is at least one-third higher than that for route 3, because the fare for route 3 public buses is only divided into five types: 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 yuan. Therefore, the fare for route 6 public buses is an example of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau raising the prices of its own public utilities.

The reasons why the citizens of this city object to this measure by the Public Utilities Bureau are as follows:

(1) It is estimated that the fare for route 6 public buses is approximately 4,000 times higher than the fare for public buses of the same mileage before the war. Its multiple is close to the city government's announced August worker living index of more than 4,500 times. The reason why the living index announced by the city government in this high-price environment is only this number is because the calculation of the index for some living expenses such as water and electricity public transportation is relatively low. Therefore, how can the price of public utilities rise as much as the living index, especially the business run by the Public Utilities Bureau itself?

(2) Currently, among the various public utilities in this city, the public transportation business has the highest profits, and among the transportation businesses, public buses are the most profitable. This is because passengers are currently very crowded, gasoline is cheap, but the fare has increased many times. (For example, electricity fees have only increased by more than 500 times, while public buses have increased by 3,000 times.) The operation of route 3 public buses, etc., of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and the red public buses of the French-owned company, not only will not lose money, but will also obtain amazing profits. This point can be known by asking the Municipal Council to investigate. The current fare already has very high profits, so why did the newly opened route 6 public buses of the Public Utilities Bureau drastically increase the fare, increasing the burden on citizens, as if under the guise of a trust, forcing citizens to comply.

The reasons why the citizens of this city want to ask the Municipal Council and public opinion to pay attention to this matter are as follows:

(1) Public transportation in this city urgently needs to be developed. The Public Utilities Bureau and the French-owned tram company are both preparing to increase routes in the near future. If increasing routes means increasing fares and attempting to obtain excessive profits, it is not in line with the principles of public utilities. Therefore, for the sake of the welfare of citizens now and in the future, the Municipal Council and all citizens cannot ignore this measure by the Public Utilities Bureau.

(2) The price increases of public utilities in this city are all approved by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. However, who approves the fares of the public buses run by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau? It cannot be decided by the Public Utilities Bureau itself. Therefore, I propose that the prices of public utilities run by the Public Utilities Bureau should be decided by the citizens, that is, approved by the Municipal Council. (Zhang Meng)

Is the Tax Collection Actually Handled This Way?

Dear Editor: I am a Hengjing person living in Suzhou. My family of several people relies solely on the ancestral farmland, which is insufficient to maintain our livelihood. This year, the government issued an order to pre-borrow tax grains, which is universal. And the newspapers stipulated 400 yuan per mu for managed land and 800 yuan per mu for self-operated land. The national tax, the people should of course bear, there is no need to hide it. However, the apportionment in my area of Hengjing is too unfair, and there are unexpected things. The largest self-operated land is apportioned to 5, 6, or 7 sheng per mu, so the content of such an apportionment method cannot be known. However, borrowing before not borrowing after, is still secondary. Even more chilling is that borrowing grain must be converted into cash, and grain will not be accepted, or directly sent to the county, etc. The price is set at 50,000 yuan (at that time, the market price of brown rice was about 40,000 yuan). In the past, the price of brown rice was used as the standard for paying taxes. Why this year for the pre-borrowing of land tax, it is necessary to change to collecting rice money? The government has clearly ordered tax grains to be collected, and the owners, etc., have paid grain, why is it refused? Not paying is as urgent as fire, which makes the common people flustered and unable to appeal! After paying, there is no evidence, only relying on one person making the register, how to deduct and reconcile later, the imperial national tax, the procedure is so simple, it is too understated. Not only can it not gain the trust of the people, it actually damages the country's prestige. Now I hear that the money received (50,000 yuan per shi converted price money) will be used to purchase indica rice in various villages (price about 35,000 yuan). It is said that each shi can earn more than 10,000 yuan. It is heard that the entire area has borrowed several hundred shi. With one turn of the hand, hundreds of millions of yuan can be easily obtained. If this is the case, how will you face the country and the people! (Concerned Person)

Speaking Up for Private School Teachers

Dear Editor: I recently saw the salary issued by the Education Bureau for private school teachers, which is 70% of the fees, and the remaining 30% is for school expenses. This is good news for poor teachers. But recently, a private elementary school in the western district of Shanghai. Its tuition fees are an average of 100,000 yuan per student, and there are about 300 students, but the salaries of the ten teachers are a base salary of 150 yuan per month, calculated at 720 times, and other allowances are completely cancelled. May I ask if this is what the Education Bureau stipulates? Can the Education Bureau manage and punish private schools? I am a fifth-grade student, and I am speaking up for the teachers!

### Modern Views on Tuberculosis Prevention (Part 1)

— Wu Shaoqing

A few years ago, although Japanese and Nazi militarism posed a great threat to human security, the danger of tuberculosis actually exceeded it. During our country's eight-year war of resistance, the officially announced number of military and civilian deaths totaled 3.1 million, while the estimated number of deaths due to tuberculosis alone in the past year was about 4.5 million. The situation in the United States was similar. In the first year after the United States entered World War II, 17,000 soldiers died in battle. During the same period, the total number of deaths in the United States due to tuberculosis exceeded 70,000. Tangible enemies are certainly fierce, but tuberculosis bacteria, invisible to the naked eye, are even more terrifying and dangerous. Taking Shanghai as an example, the rampant spread of tuberculosis is appalling. In the first six months of 1942, the number of tuberculosis deaths among residents of the British and French concessions was 2,269, while the total number of deaths from seven legally defined infectious diseases was only 1,002. This means that the mortality rate of tuberculosis exceeded the total mortality rate of the seven infectious diseases by 141.6%. Now, although the Japanese army has been driven out of the country, an even fiercer enemy still lurks in our families, organizations, groups, factories, schools, and the entire society and country, allowing it to spread and grow, killing 4 to 5 million innocent people every year, and causing perhaps ten times that number to be bedridden until death. Its rampant nature is of great importance to the health of the nation. Moreover, most of those who suffer from this disease are between the ages of 20 and 45, and their prime years are wasted in sickbeds, year after year, until their lives are cut short. The loss of human and material resources is incalculable. If Shanghai is like this, how can other provinces and cities be any different? A brief list of the drawbacks is provided for the reference of the public.

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease

Infectious diseases and hereditary diseases are two different things. If Person A has pulmonary tuberculosis and transmits it to Person B through contact, it is "infection." If parents have a disease that is transmitted to the fetus through the blood, it is "heredity." Pulmonary tuberculosis is an infectious disease, so it has significance in public health. This is because one person's illness can affect the whole family; a staff member's illness can endanger the group. Harmful elements cannot but be controlled, and thus, measures for tuberculosis prevention arise. In Europe and the United States, tuberculosis is considered one of the legally defined infectious diseases, and laws stipulate that all patients must be isolated and treated. In the United States, if a tuberculosis patient endangers the safety of others, after being reported, the police will arrest the patient and send them to a hospital for mandatory isolation. Even if a patient's condition shows signs of recovery after a period of hospitalization, but their sputum still inevitably contains tuberculosis bacteria, if the patient requests to be discharged, the doctor has the right to refuse. If they disobey the doctor's orders and leave the hospital without permission, the doctor can report to the health authorities for intervention, ordering them to return to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment, striving to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria from the sputum completely before allowing them to leave the hospital. It can be seen that tuberculosis prevention is the responsibility of health administration, in other words, it is the business that national health institutions should have. This is the meaning from the standpoint of the word "prevention."

Work that should be done for tuberculosis prevention

Our country's science is backward, and there are no unified prevention and control facilities for tuberculosis. Even if there are some people enthusiastic about social undertakings who establish tuberculosis prevention associations and general tuberculosis hospitals, they mostly focus on treatment. It must be known that prevention and treatment must go hand in hand. Preventing without treating cannot improve the condition; treating without preventing is not enough to stop the source. Treating tuberculosis that has already developed is like putting out a prairie fire; even if it can be extinguished, the losses have already been immeasurable. Preventing tuberculosis that has not yet developed is like bending the chimney and moving the firewood away; with a little attention, a major disaster can be avoided. Therefore, tuberculosis prevention and treatment are closely related; neither can be emphasized at the expense of the other, and both must be developed in a balanced way to achieve maximum efficiency.

Since prevention and treatment cannot be separated, a comprehensive work plan can be roughly divided into the following items:

(1) Health education,

(2) Early diagnosis,

(3) Establishment of public health nurses,

(4) Tuberculosis clinics,

(5) Well-equipped tuberculosis sanatoriums,

(6) Improvement of patients' occupations and post-rehabilitation facilities.

The above six items are not necessarily new. People of insight in our country have mentioned them before, but they have not been realized due to a lack of modern scientific equipment and methods. Today, the tuberculosis mortality rate in the United States is 80% lower than it was 50 years ago. The reason for this great achievement is none other than the implementation of this comprehensive prevention and control work. The above six tasks will be explained separately or summarized below.

(1) Health education... This is the main task in tuberculosis prevention. If tuberculosis prevention can be achieved through educational methods, the cost is limited, and the results are significant. The general habits of our country are too unhygienic. To this day, we are still stuck at the stage of publicizing "prohibition of spitting," and knowledge of other tuberculosis prevention and control is even more rudimentary. The low level of hygiene is evident here. And the urgent need for education is even more obvious. There are many types of education methods, but in general, appropriate and effective methods should be adopted according to the level of the target audience. For example, general broadcasts of sound films, as well as other "audiovisual education" methods. Strive to make everyone understand, so that those who are not sick know how to prevent it, and those who are sick know where to seek medical treatment. Its great effect cannot be measured by numbers.

### Symptoms of Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Jin Baoshan

The symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are extremely complex. For the sake of convenient description, they are divided into initial symptoms, general symptoms, and local symptoms.

(A) The initial symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are extremely inconsistent. The most common are weight loss, extreme fatigue, weakness, indigestion, menstrual irregularities, anemia, and difficulty concentrating. After several weeks or months, regular symptoms such as afternoon fever, cough with phlegm, and night sweats follow one after another. Sometimes the initial condition resembles the flu, with symptoms such as fever, weakness in the limbs, and body aches. The symptoms disappear after one or two weeks, only to recur several weeks later. Sometimes the patient's first conscious symptom is blood-streaked sputum or hemoptysis. Sometimes pleurisy is the initial symptom of pulmonary tuberculosis, with symptoms such as chest pain, which can be exacerbated by deep breathing and exercise, fever, and difficulty breathing. It is rare for the initial stage of pulmonary tuberculosis to resemble lobar pneumonia, and is only seen in young patients and elderly, frail patients. The symptoms are the same as those of lobar pneumonia, but the duration of the illness is longer, the sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria, and the formation of cavities can be used for identification. There are also patients who are found to have pulmonary tuberculosis during lung examination due to hoarseness, anal fistula, anal swelling, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck.

(B) General Symptoms

(1) Fever: In most patients, the body temperature is often normal in the morning and gradually increases in the afternoon, reaching its highest point between 4 PM and 8 PM. In chronic and mild cases, the fever gradually decreases and returns to normal after resting or after the condition is brought under control. If the condition is severe or spreading, the fever will continue unabated, presenting various types of fever. If the initial stage resembles lobar pneumonia and pleurisy, or there are other complications, the fever continues unabated, with the afternoon temperature higher than the morning temperature, which can last for many days and gradually change to a mild fever, extending for several weeks. Early-stage patients and early-stage relapsed patients with pulmonary tuberculosis often have a mild afternoon fever after extreme exercise, but it returns to normal after resting. In severe chronic patients, the fever is sometimes very high in the morning and lower in the afternoon, which is the opposite of the common fever pattern of pulmonary tuberculosis.

(2) Night sweats: Night sweats are rarely seen in patients in the afebrile period and in the early stages. Night sweats are common in acute and chronic severe cases. Night sweats are most common at night, most often at dawn.

(3) Weight loss: The extent of weight loss varies depending on the severity of the condition. Acute patients lose weight very quickly, while chronic patients lose weight more slowly. If a pulmonary tuberculosis patient continues to lose weight despite proper care, the prognosis is often poor.

(4) Fatigue and weakness: Early-stage patients often feel tired and weak after daily work. If the condition worsens, the patient feels lazy and weak in the morning and has a depressed mood.

(5) Pallor and anemia: These symptoms are more common in severe patients. If the patient also has intestinal tuberculosis, the symptoms of anemia are more pronounced.

(6) Patients often have indigestion, loss of appetite, occasional nausea and vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. If there is frequent intestinal colic in the abdomen, abnormal bowel movements, sometimes constipation, sometimes diarrhea, it is an indication of intestinal tuberculosis.

(7) Women patients have menstrual irregularities, initially irregular, followed by decreased menstrual flow, or even amenorrhea. If the patient's condition improves, menstruation can return to normal.

(C) Local Symptoms

(1) Cough: This is one of the main local symptoms. Patients often seek medical treatment because of coughing. The cough of early-stage patients is often a mild dry cough, which becomes more severe as the condition worsens. If tuberculosis also occurs in the throat and trachea, the cough is very painful and extremely distressing, sometimes with stridor.

(2) Sputum: Coughing and sputum are often linked. Early-stage patients have very little sputum, sometimes with very little clear, mucous-like sputum. In the later stages of pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum is a common symptom. If cavities form, the amount of sputum increases. The sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients has no special characteristics, and the color is also inconsistent.

(3) Hemoptysis (spitting blood): About half of pulmonary tuberculosis patients have hemoptysis. The degree of hemoptysis varies. It is usually blood-streaked sputum or blood clots. Sometimes the amount of blood is greater, and the sputum is reddish-brown. Massive hemoptysis is commonly seen in patients with cavities. Massive hemoptysis often has no warning, only a salty or hot sensation in the throat before hemoptysis. Sometimes patients feel chest tightness before hemoptysis. Massive hemoptysis can cause patients to suffocate and die within minutes. Sometimes tuberculous pneumonia occurs after hemoptysis, causing the condition to spread, and the prognosis is often poor. In general, hemoptysis will stop on its own, but there is a risk of recurrence, so patients with hemoptysis symptoms must pay close attention to diet, avoid excessive labor, and avoid catching a cold to prevent recurrence.

(4) Chest pain: If pulmonary tuberculosis involves the pleura and pleurisy occurs, patients often complain of chest pain, which may be very mild, with only a feeling of tightness, or a sharp, stabbing pain, which is worse on cloudy days and when tired.

(5) Hoarseness: Frequent coughing can lead to hoarseness. Persistent hoarseness is often caused by laryngeal tuberculosis.

(6) Difficulty breathing: Patients often complain of difficulty breathing when they have a fever and when their condition is severe. If difficulty breathing occurs suddenly, attention should be paid to the occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax and exudative pleurisy.

### What We Should Know About Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Cui Xiangbin

(1) Pulmonary tuberculosis and age

Ordinary people believe that pulmonary tuberculosis is a disease that is most easily contracted by young people and those in their adolescence. After the age of 30, it is believed that one will no longer be infected with pulmonary tuberculosis; even if one unfortunately contracts pulmonary tuberculosis after the age of 30, the condition will definitely be milder than the general condition contracted in adolescence, and it will never be fatal. In fact, this is a misconception. It must be known that the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis is not selective of age. There are countless cases of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis that begin after the age of 30. Although the condition of these patients may be milder than pulmonary tuberculosis contracted in adolescence, if attention and medical treatment are not given immediately after discovery, the condition will also deteriorate and spread as rapidly as pulmonary tuberculosis contracted by young people. According to the 1940 US tuberculosis mortality statistics, 43% of tuberculosis deaths occurred in patients after the age of 45. This further proves the misconception that pulmonary tuberculosis is not fatal in patients after the age of 30.

(2) Dietary restrictions

The most prominent example of needing to avoid certain foods due to a certain disease is that patients with nephritis should avoid salty foods. The increase of salt in the blood easily causes local or systemic edema. In addition, patients with diabetes should have a certain amount of carbohydrates in their diet; and the ratio of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins should also have a certain formula, otherwise it can cause various misfortunes. The dietary restrictions for patients with the above two diseases are implemented based on actual or theoretical grounds. However, it is often believed that patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis also need to avoid meat for a certain period of time. The dietary restrictions for these patients are incomprehensible. Currently, there is no specific drug for pulmonary tuberculosis. The only way is to pay attention to nutrition and strengthen the patient's resistance to tuberculosis. The only way to strengthen the patient's resistance is to increase daily nutrition and eat easily digestible and nutritious foods, such as eggs, milk, fish, and meat. If these kinds of meat are abandoned by pulmonary tuberculosis patients, then they can only limit themselves to beans and vegetables every day. After two or three months, the patient's physical strength will not only fail to increase, but will become weaker day by day, and then the tuberculosis bacteria in the body will take the opportunity to move around and spread everywhere. Therefore, it is advised that general tuberculosis patients, except when they have high and persistent fever or other complications, should eat more vegetarian food to aid digestion. Otherwise, it is always reasonable to eat more foods with calories and oil.

(3) Discharging pulmonary tuberculosis

"Discharging pulmonary tuberculosis, success is guaranteed" is a common slogan. As long as passersby read it once, their children's colds will be cured. Although the slogan of selling pulmonary tuberculosis has not been officially publicized, some people with pulmonary tuberculosis deeply believe that if they can transmit their tuberculosis bacteria to others, their own illness will not be cured, but at least it can be greatly reduced. Therefore, these patients intentionally sleep in the same bed and eat from the same bowl with innocent children; they even want their family members to eat all the food they have left over. And the people who are close to them have no choice but to follow the patient's wishes and do the same. Family members also cannot bear to separate bowls and chopsticks from the patient. There are also people who believe that tuberculosis can be sold, and they are afraid of not being infected early, hoping that the patient's tuberculosis will be discharged as soon as possible. This kind of thing of course happens in families with no knowledge. It is absolutely harmful to others and not beneficial to oneself for the patient; and it is also a fantasy for those who hope to be infected in order to alleviate the patient's pain. The result is nothing more than adding another tuberculosis patient to the family.

(4) Dry blood tuberculosis

The condition of women who have menstrual irregularities and call it dry blood tuberculosis is definitely not because tuberculosis bacteria have occupied the ovaries or other reproductive organs. Menstrual irregularities are one of the common symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. If the condition improves, menstruation will also gradually return to normal. There is no such thing as dry blood tuberculosis being incurable, as generally believed.

### The Problem of Specific Medicines for Tuberculosis

— Zhang Changshao

Tuberculosis, one of humanity's greatest disasters, shortens the lives of heroes, dooms beautiful women, cuts short the lives of geniuses, and causes doctors to shake their heads. It is a major enemy of human health and a major problem in medicine and health.

For centuries, people have been constantly striving to find a specific medicine for tuberculosis, but whether it is a superstitious fairy prescription, a folk-tested single prescription, or a product of the laboratory, none can withstand the strict scrutiny of science. Many so-called specific medicines for tuberculosis, when they first appeared, were all publicized with great fanfare, with their effects described as absolutely true, but in the end, they proved to be worthless and useless. A bucket of cold water poured on them caused doctors and patients to both cry out that they had been fooled and feel disappointed.

Before the War of Resistance, those so-called specific medicines for tuberculosis that were often advertised in newspapers, such as those slippery medicines with names like "grass something" and "star something," were obviously unscientific or pseudo-scientific. Anyway, their purpose was to cheat money and should be included in the government's crackdown. They will not be discussed here for the time being. Even drugs that have undergone scientific research, such as Sanocrysin, Lopion, and other gold preparations, and various Tuberculin preparations, cannot withstand the elimination of the times. Except for a very small number of cases where they may be worth a try, they are now rarely used.

In recent years, the era-making success of sulfonamide drugs (Sulfonamices) in treating various bacterial infections has rekindled our hope for a specific treatment for tuberculosis. And this new hope is built on a solid foundation of scientific experimentation. Although there is still no truly satisfactory specific medicine for tuberculosis, it is indeed a great step forward compared to those previous drugs.

Between 1939 and 1940, test-tube experiments proved that sulfonamides can inhibit the growth of tubercle bacilli (i.e., tuberculosis bacteria); animal experiments also proved that these drugs can delay the progression of tuberculous lesions, but cannot completely stop them.

Sulfone drugs, which are similar to sulfonamides, such as Promin, Diasone, and Promisole, have a much stronger inhibitory effect on tubercle bacilli than sulfonamides. They can indeed inhibit the progression of tuberculosis in animals and keep it in a quiescent phase. For a time, newspapers and magazines in various countries could not wait for the completion of strict clinical trials, and they rushed to report and publicize the invention of a specific medicine for tuberculosis, making countless patients overjoyed, inquiring everywhere, and expecting the arrival of these miraculous drugs, so that they could quickly recover from their chronic illnesses and regain their health.

However, animal experiments are ultimately animal experiments, and their results often cannot be completely applied to human diseases. When these drugs were rigorously tested on tuberculosis patients, it was found that their toxicity to humans was too strong. When safe doses were used, they had no definite therapeutic effect on tuberculosis. They may be helpful for a very small number of special cases, but they are not of much value for most cases.

Next, penicillin was discovered, and its legendary efficacy even more captivated the world. Many people asked: Is penicillin useful for tuberculosis? All experiments undoubtedly proved its uselessness. However, in China, some people were unwilling to let desperate, dying tuberculosis patients pass away peacefully and insisted on giving them a few injections of penicillin "just to see," which is not only the opposite of science, but also the opposite of love.

However, among the antibiotic substances similar to penicillin, there are several that do have anti-tuberculosis efficacy. According to current reports from various sources, the most promising one is Streptomycin, which is a substance produced in the culture of a chain-like bacterium called Strcjtomyces griceus. Whether in test-tube experiments or animal experiments, the anti-tuberculosis effect of streptomycin is much better than that of sulfonamide drugs, and its toxicity to humans is also much lower. It is now being actively tested on patients. Although there have already been a few isolated clinical reports saying that it may have good effects on several types of tuberculosis, let us not repeat the mistakes of the past and make unwarranted speculations and unscientific reports before the systematic clinical trials are completed. At the same time, I advise tuberculosis patients not to wait for a rabbit to fall into a trap before a reliable specific medicine is invented. They must not relax or neglect the standard treatment that is currently being announced for a single day.

### Style and Personality

— Shusun Ruying

Every work of art has its unique style. Style is not the nature that directs the artwork, but rather the expression of the artist's personality in the artwork. Therefore, in the West there is the saying that "style is the man." The writer's personality directly affects the value of the artwork, and even more directly affects the style of the artwork.

Nevertheless, when we study the style of an artwork, we certainly need to engage in the study of the artist's personality, but more importantly, we need to focus on the artwork itself, analyze it, study it, and seek the style from this artwork, which is to seek the artist's personality from the artwork. For example, if you want to study the style of Tolstoy's works as a writer, it is best not to study his biography for the time being. You should take all or most of his works and study and analyze them. You should read "Resurrection," "War and Peace," and "Anna Karenina," and you will understand the themes that Tolstoy is accustomed to using, the characters he often writes about, and his views and attitudes towards those themes and characters. Furthermore, you should pay attention to Tolstoy's method and tone of narrating stories, how he arranges the structure, how he introduces characters, and how he tells you stories while also preaching to you. All of this is Tolstoy's style, and it is also one aspect of his personality. Of course, you may also want to read Tolstoy's biography and the history of Russian culture to help you further understand why Tolstoy has such a style. However, you should understand that Tolstoy is not only a person as an artist, he is also a typical example of an awakened landlord, as well as a writer who is a saintly figure promoting humanism. Therefore, his personality is by no means completely equal to his artistic style.

Although style is not equal to personality, style and personality must be unified and consistent. Because Tolstoy is a humanist, he always understands the world with a benevolent eye. He sympathizes with everyone because he believes that everyone has humanity, even murderers are no exception. Therefore, his works are all so sincere, serious, and devoid of any humorous or satirical meaning. Molière sees everyone as a clown, and he himself serves the French court as a clown. Therefore, he always uses a sarcastic approach to create plays, and any dignified character becomes ridiculous and laughable in his pen. This is proof of the unity of style and personality.

However, it is also worth noting that a person's personality is not fixed, but changing and developing, and an artist's style is also changing and developing. Zhou Zuoren was only a proponent of bitter tea in his early years, but he transformed into a traitor. You cannot arbitrarily assert that Zhou Zuoren had traitorous thoughts in his early years, but as he developed later, he had no choice but to become a traitor. Therefore, when we talk about the unity of personality and style, we must pay more attention to the unity of the times. In the same era, a writer's personality and the style of his artistic works must be unified, but if you use the style of Zhou Zuoren's early works to discuss the unity with Zhou Zuoren's personality in his later years, you are ignoring the conditions for the unity of the times and committing an error in logic.

In short, style is not equal to personality, but style must be unified with personality.

### Nietzsche and Guyau

— Hua Lin

Modern literary trends, like the international situation, form two major barriers: the free world and the structured world! These two worlds, in European literature and art, represent two kinds of thought, namely the German Nietzsche and the French Guyau. Nitzsche et Guyau – one is individualism, which can also be said to be dictatorial despotism; the other is socialism, which can also be said to be freedom and egalitarianism!

These two thinkers have had a great influence on European literature and art. Since Rousseau advocated the social contract theory, these two can be said to be outstanding figures! From the perspective of cultural exchange, all different ideas can help and promote each other. The starry sky at night will never be overshadowed by the flight of a swan, and the raging waves will not change their tides because of something [missing text].

Nietzsche was born in 1844 in Rocken, Germany. His father was a pastor and his family was poor. He studied hard, and when he grew up, he met the musician Wagner. Later, he traveled to Switzerland and Italy, engaged in literary and philosophical research, and was particularly interested in ancient Greek culture. In 1872, his first work, "The Birth of Tragedy," was born. At the same time, he was fascinated by Schopenhauer's thought. After 1876, his health gradually deteriorated, and his life and thought also changed. Sometimes he went to the mountains of Italy or Switzerland to recuperate, and sometimes he taught at universities and engaged in writing. Life became more and more painful and lonely, but his spirit resisted and new works were constantly born!

The only important thing in Nietzsche's thought is the "master"! He structures himself with a strong will, just as he structures the world. He transcends freedom, transcends the world, resists the unfortunate fate, advocates the philosophy of the Superman, and is dissatisfied with Wagner and Schopenhauer. He [missing text] wrote "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" to heal tragic philosophy, [missing text] war, constantly strives and struggles, and adds to his own strength. For him, life is always "affirmative," "positive," and "creative." To know the greatest happiness, one must know the greatest pain! And before the extreme pain, one will also encounter extremely extraordinary new hope!

Life is painful, but you must know that pain can purify life! Therefore, Nietzsche sings the praises of pain and praises pain. He traveled all over the world, experienced all kinds of hardships, and finally found himself and knew himself! His thought and that of the French philosopher Guyau both take the development of life as their principle, but Nietzsche's life is war and control! Guyau's life is love and the interconnected relationship of society!

Guyau was born in Laval, France in 1854. He received a good maternal education from the beginning. His father died early, and later his mother married Fouillée. Fouillée was also a contemporary philosopher and Guyau's stepfather. As a child, he liked to study Greek philosophy, and later became a middle school teacher. Unfortunately, he was often ill and often went to the famous Mediterranean city of Nice to recuperate. In 1888, when there was a major earthquake on the Mediterranean coast, Guyau was bedridden for many days, and moved to a small, damp house. He caught a cold, and his lungs became inflamed. From then on, he became seriously ill and died in bed. The short-lived creator passed away at the age of only thirty-three!

He wrote many works on philosophy, education, religion, morality, and aesthetics, and made amazing discoveries. At that time, Nietzsche and Guyau were both spending the winter near "Nice," but they did not know each other. Nietzsche also read Guyau's works, and his stepfather often compared their thoughts and wrote a special treatise on them. In terms of literature and art, there are "Modern Aesthetic Problems" and "On Art from a Social Point of View." Guyau believes that life itself has infinite power to survive and develop. Life is like a flower, taking shape on its own. The world is like a festival of competitions, and all kinds of performances are the glory of life! Great artists live in the hearts of everyone. Their life is the life of the whole world, so their rich and fulfilling creation is by no means a small personal life. They unite the universe through great sympathy and become one with me! Love is indivisible, life is for others, and happiness cannot be enjoyed alone! The source of art lies in the deep hearts of all mankind. The emotion of beauty arises from social sympathy. The "heart" is always young, and always retains a fresh feeling for the world. He discovered that reality is not vulgar. The further you look, the more beautiful it becomes. Broaden and extend the boundaries of life, connect with the new society of the future, and make our lives richer and more active!

True poets and artists, they know that the light of the sun warms our hearts, they also know that the bright moon shines on the dark fragrance in the long night, we should understand that in spring, many butterflies linger on the fragrance of flowers, we should also be happy to see swallows building their spring nests. This is the harmony of the universe, and no one can claim it as their own! The most foolish and empty egoism in the world will not be established in the world of beauty and goodness! Guyau's philosophy eventually seeks the highest sympathy and a life united with the universe!

I admire these two lines of philosophers, and at the same time they are poets! They all went from admiring Greek culture to the road of modern new life, and they all actively sang the praises of the most beautiful life! But the two have different destinations. One is the same as one person, almost destroying the world and creating it anew; the other is the same as society, intoxicated in vast love, warming this painful life. It is a pity that Guyau died early, otherwise his discoveries would have been even greater! As for Nietzsche, how could he not have compassion? In his later years, in a city in northern Italy, he saw a weak horse pulling a heavy cart, suffering from the pain of the whip. He hugged the horse's head and cried bitterly, and from then on he spent his days in an asylum! However, the social customs of Germany and France are different, and everyone's experiences are very different. It can be seen that passion can produce great thinkers, and passion can also solidify prejudice and lead to another extreme path. If the two of them could have seen the silver waves rising from the clear water on the beautiful coast of Nice, and the seagulls soaring in the air like musical notes, they might have been able to converge at one source when they talked about the depths of their hearts!

### Fantasy

— Zi Rong

Literary and Artistic Terminology Series 3

The English term is "Imagination." It is a special kind of representative thinking. Thinking that does not exist or is impossible to exist in reality is called fantasy. However, fantasy based on past experience or with a realistic foundation is realistic fantasy. In the process of artistic creation, fantasy is the most important factor. With fantasy, artistic life can move freely. The so-called creative fantasy in art is the center of activity.

### Fifteenth Century Journey

Literary and Artistic Terminology Series 4

The Italian term is "Quattrocento." It is a general term for the literature and art of the fifteenth century in Italy. That is, the early Renaissance. The literature and art of the Renaissance period are collectively referred to as the "Sixteenth Century School."

### Old Farmer

— Ye Fei (engraving)

### Whip

— Xiao Feng

On the northern wilderness, I was riding in a horse-drawn carriage, rushing along an ancient road of yellow sand. The sound of the wheels and the hooves of the horse played a monotonous music. The sky was as blue as the sea, and the sunlight was as red and hot as fire. Sweat flowed on people's bodies and on the horse's body. A gust of wind blew over, rolling up a vast expanse of yellow sand, like a mist, spreading across the wilderness, passing over the carriage canopy, and blowing to a more distant place.

In the wind and sand, the horse was panting urgently, and the hazy sand and stones sprinkled on its body.

"Drive on!" The coachman waved the whip in his hand, heavily lashing it, driving it forward in the wind-swept wilderness.

In the wilderness at dusk, the autumn wind was blowing. The farmer carried his plow on his back, returning from the fields. On the small path where the green grass was like smoke, an old ox was slowly stepping forward, walking towards the road home. The farmer raised his long whip and ruthlessly lashed it on the old ox's body, cursing the old ox's uselessness with a rough voice. In the painful whipping, the old ox lowered its head and walked into the vast night.

Four years ago, on a winter evening, I would also hold a tenacious whip and follow behind the calf, in the mill, under the dim light, and I and the calf would be circling around the stone mill. Mother stood in the middle of the stone mill, slowly turning over the unhulled rice grains. At this time, I waved the tenacious whip and kept lashing the calf, driving it to spin around endlessly in this small circle.

Whose sorrow does the distant stone mill sound lament for?

In the vast sea of people, I saw thousands of people leaping and moving. In this complex crowd, many people were holding a cruel whip, lashing it on the bodies of oxen and horses, driving them forward; lashing it on the bodies of others, treating them as slaves, arbitrarily driving them, driving them onto the road of war, driving them into the dark depths.

For the past three or four years, I have been constantly whipped by this invisible whip, causing me to leave my hometown and walk to a more distant place. In the quiet of the night, I remembered the coachman on the ancient road of yellow sand whipping the tired horse with the whip in his hand; I remembered the farmer in the wilderness at dusk raising his long whip and driving the old ox into the vast night; I remembered even more the winter night four years ago when I waved the tenacious whip and constantly drove the calf; I thought of the many people in this vast sea of people who were waving their cruel whips, ruthlessly lashing them on the bodies of others. They laughed, they laughed so cruelly!

But the invisible whip was heavily falling on their bodies.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 31

Mr. W said, "I can offer a few more examples of this kind... It can be seen that 'integrity' is a very important condition."...

Little Tiger was always in a state of "training," concentrating and calming his mind, sitting upright, with his hands resting on his knees, his back straight, his lips pursed tightly, and his round eyes wide open; as if he were having a "pass" photo taken.

(Later, Ji Yaoqun told me that when Little Tiger was about to leave, his mother had told him a few words, "...Child, you are not very old, but you are not young either; you have been practicing this skill since you were in my womb (referring to martial arts), although it is not worth much, it is also your grandfather's hard work, can it be wasted? ...What are you going to do this time, passing through checkpoints, what is it for? You must put in some effort and earn a small amount of food, so that your grandfather, your father, your uncle, and your great-uncle can breathe a sigh of relief...Child, no matter what, I am your mother, and you must listen to me; you go with your Aunt Ji, and in the future, you will probably have to meet officials, you must stand with a standing posture, and sit with a sitting posture...")

I think he was probably thinking about the "sit with a sitting posture" that he was told before leaving.

"I heard that your martial arts are not bad," Mr. W said everything that should be said, and temporarily turned his attention to Little Tiger, "Mr. Yue told me some things about you. When we who have not practiced martial arts hear it, it is simply a miracle! It's like foreigners listening to the Chinese 'Classic of Mountains and Seas'!"

Little Tiger probably thought that Mr. W was going to give him an official position, so he quickly stood up and straightened his small body. He probably didn't understand what a miracle or the Classic of Mountains and Seas was, so he didn't dare to ask. He just stole a glance at me and Yaoqun with his big eyes, like a flash of lightning.

"But," Mr. W said very cautiously, "I have one thing to say, and you must remember it. Our martial arts in China are good, and they should be vigorously promoted; but we cannot just take this thing as a tool for performing tasks. Our tool is to obey orders, cooperate with comrades, and cooperate with various front lines, advancing when we should advance, and retreating when we should retreat. If you think you have a special ability and act alone, that will ruin things..." When Mr. W said this, he probably realized that Little Tiger could not understand this point very well, so he looked at Yaoqun.

"Yes." "Yaoqun then agreed that he would explain it carefully to Brother Tiger later, so that he would understand thoroughly."

"Excellent." Mr. W nodded to Yaoqun and looked back at Little Tiger; "Let me tell you another trick, for example, if you use your finger that has practiced Kung Fu to deal with someone, in the eyes of the other party, it is a special event, a kind of trace that is very worthy of study. People with a natural tendency to make a fuss, of course, will make a mountain out of a molehill. If it comes to this point, even with our ordinary dialectical methods, it is very easy to find out who is the master of this disposal. At the very least, they can prove that the person who did this is from that side...right?

"If things get to this point, it's not good. Why? Because there are many things that we do, but we don't want anyone to know that we did them. Please think, if the things we do leave traces of your special technique, wouldn't it be like stamping a trademark, clearly admitting that the master of this matter is us?...

But I don't want to discourage you and say that this kind of technique is completely useless. You have put in a lot of hard work to learn these techniques, how can you waste them in vain? However, as long as you see the situation clearly, you can use them if you can, and if you can't, you would rather use ordinary methods; just like the several methods we are already using now--all of which can leave no special traces..."

I can't guarantee how many sentences Little Tiger understood in this long passage. Fortunately, Yaoqun explained it in their jargon. A smart child like Little Tiger would understand it.

The Question of Whether or Not to Open Horse Racing

Thank you to our enthusiastic readers. After two solicitations in our magazine asking for everyone's opinions on opening horse racing or not, as of now, in the short four days, we have received 4,463 letters. This shows the readers' concern about this issue, and it shows that readers love this newspaper and are willing to cooperate with the newspaper.

Faced with these letters from all corners of Shanghai, piled up a foot or two high on the table, we specially temporarily transferred four people to assist in opening, sorting, classifying, and counting them. Although we were extremely busy, we felt an indescribable sense of emotion. We deeply understand the emotions of each writer. In this environment where life is tense and gold dollars have blurred people's eyes and minds, our enthusiastic readers can take the trouble to cut out that ticket, fill in their own opinions, put it in an envelope, affix a stamp, and mail it out. This spirit, interest, and trust are by no means ordinary. We cherish this friendship of mutual understanding and unity, and we are proud of it! We will have more courage to move forward because we have a vast readership supporting us behind us!

The number 4,463, although less than one-fortieth of the newspaper's circulation, we know that even in the United States, the Gallup poll, which has a history of several years, is not 100%. Such a number is not bad.

Now, we have found 1,235 votes in these letters that are filled in according to our requests, and together with the original envelopes with complete postmarks, we have decided to send them to Councilor Zeng of the Municipal Council tomorrow to provide the Municipal Council with a reference for discussing this case. As for the statistics of gender, occupation, approval, and opposition, they will be officially announced the day after tomorrow.

Finally, let us thank the readers again for the cooperation they have given us!

### Appeal to Mr. Rong — The Voice of Poor Youth

— Jiang Xinming

I am a student on a student loan.

During the period when the enemy and puppet forces occupied Shanghai, I applied for student loans one after another. Fortunately, I was approved and was able to continue my studies and get through this long night. I was full of hope that after the victory, our lives would be stable; that prices would fall, that every person would have a job, and that every student would have a book to read. However, since the victory, my father has remained unemployed, the family's financial situation has become increasingly strained, and my tuition fees have naturally fallen through. Before the start of the last semester, there were no student loans in Shanghai. This [missing text] was like a bolt from the blue. Which poor student would not be heartbroken by this? However, in a desperate situation, the Municipal Education Association of this city held an educational loan, and many poor students once again obtained the opportunity to seek knowledge for a semester, and I am one of them. In the blink of an eye, the school is on vacation again, and now the long summer vacation has also passed. These past two days, students from wealthy families have been preparing to buy books and pay tuition to go to school.

But I, this poor student, am worried again. How can I cope with such expensive tuition fees? Although I am still applying for an educational loan. But I heard that the amount of money raised this time and the funds obtained from the patriotic goods market charity sale are far from the target, and there are more than 10,000 students applying. There is too little porridge and too many monks, and the number of people who will be eliminated will definitely be quite a few. Therefore, I am trembling every day, fearing that I will be eliminated. If I am eliminated, then I can forget about going to school and can only be excluded. I think: many poor students besides me also have the same feeling, right?

Therefore, I am using a corner of this magazine to appeal to people in the community, hoping that those who have money will contribute money, and those who have strength will contribute strength, to throw a brick to attract jade, do what is right, and save out-of-school youth!

Especially our old gentleman Rong Desheng, this time he was able to escape unharmed, he is truly blessed by heaven. And this huge amount of stolen money has already been claimed by the Rong family. In the short term, I hope that there will be an appropriate disposal and a clear expression. According to the reports in the newspaper these days: The Rong family is indeed willing to donate it for various charitable purposes. Part of it will also be used for educational loans, so I once again ask Mr. Rong to quickly give us, these poor students waiting to be fed, some good news. Although you may not get any results now, ten years later, twenty years later...when the students you have cultivated are all over the country and abroad, serving the society and serving the country; everywhere they will praise your deeds and praise your virtues! This is your harvest and success. Please forgive my impudent words, Mr. Rong!

### Idle Talk About Going Abroad

— Xiao Yi

Recently, everyone has been busy going abroad. Some are going abroad for inspection, some are commissioners and representatives, and some are accepting materials. All kinds of names are readily available. Of course, there are also many students seeking further education. In the past, people [missing text] satirized students studying abroad as gilded, meaning that they were beautiful on the outside but rotten on the inside, good-looking but useless. Now people say that going abroad is to see the atomic bomb, because the atomic bomb is a world-shaking thing, so going abroad naturally seems to have unlimited potential.

A friend of mine has been unable to solve the problem of going abroad for the past six months, and has been suffering from lack of food and sleep; the examiner's fee, his learning is not willing to help him pay for it himself, calculated according to "3350", he really can't afford it, so he begged around, and after four months of effort, he actually achieved his goal. A certain company funded him to go abroad to inspect commercial conditions. Recently, he left on the General Meigs, and we all sighed with envy!

Another medical student was also running around for the passport problem to study abroad, feeling uneasy. Later, a certain coal mine company was blessed and asked him to go to the United States as a representative to accept a ship. The road is not bad!

There have been interesting stories about going abroad in ancient and modern times. I remember that in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, there was a Chinese ambassador to the United States. Every time he returned to China and then went to the United States, he would bring more than 20 attendants. After arriving at the shore, these attendants would leave one after another for trivial reasons. Once, when the ambassador arrived at the embassy, he still had two attendants with him. The next morning, the two quarreled over sweeping the floor and even scolded the ambassador. Immediately, the ambassador himself came out to question the two and immediately dismissed them. Afterwards, others asked them why they were so rude. They smiled and replied: "This is our perfect plan. If we don't quarrel, he will have no reason to make us leave." When asked the reason, it turned out that the ambassador's side business was smuggling immigrants, one thousand yuan per person, imported in the name of his attendants, without leaving any traces.

There was also an official who specialized in passports who sold passports in the name of commissioners or experts for 500 US dollars each. Many people who wanted to drink foreign water flocked to him. Later, some people with the "special" character went to foreign countries and did not know a single word of English, and their true colors were seen through. From then on, foreigners added many difficulties to the signing of passports, adding infinite troubles to those who went abroad later.

Talking about it in a disorganized way is just some trivial things that I thought of because of going abroad. I believe and hope that these trivial things will not have a satirical effect on the handling of going abroad today.

### The Dead End of the Pawnshop Industry

— Yu Ren

—Shanghai Trends—

According to recent reports: There are more than 900 legally registered pawnshops in this city. The current interest rate for ordinary pawnshops is 46%, such a high interest rate naturally tempts people with idle funds to try.

However, the large number of pawnshops does not indicate the development of the pawnshop industry. On the contrary, the existing ordinary pawnshops all have capital of less than one million yuan, and have suffered a serious blow since the war due to changes in the currency system and rising prices. At present, each pawnshop is deserted, and there are only a few businesses coming to the door every day. Some even sit at the counter all day without a single customer. People who eat pawnshop food are feeling "tasteless," but only those outsiders are thinking about how to "manage it"?

In the past, the pawnshop industry also had a "brilliant" history—but in our poor people's eyes, it was not "brilliant." It was "miserable"!—At that time, prices were stable and interest rates were good. Many families wanted to send their children to pawnshops as apprentices. After the war broke out, the business of huge profits became increasingly downstream, and the trend of speculation and hoarding grew day by day. Under rising prices, the pawnshop industry was in a slump. On the one hand, illegal pawns appeared, and interest rates rose to 50% or 60%, and the time limit was even only 20 days or one month. After the victory, the pawnshops and loan shops merged and established the "Pawnshop Industry Association," but to this day, it is still in a slump.

I heard that horse racing is about to resume, and when ordinary gamblers are completely penniless, pawnshops may increase some business!

### New DDT

— Rong

Last week, the American chemical industry invented a new type of insecticide that is more effective than DDT and has fewer adverse reactions. This new agent not only kills insects but also repels other insects for a week to ten days. Its name is "NMRI——448." During the war, the Naval Medical Research Institute tested 3,000 chemical compounds until the 448th time before inventing this new insecticide. According to tests, in tropical regions, this agent is six times more effective than other drugs, and in temperate regions, it is at least twice as effective.

This agent can kill mosquitoes, flies, sand fleas, bed bugs, and "silverfish," etc. Its advantages over DDT are: (1) it kills insects faster, (2) its effectiveness lasts longer, (3) it does not irritate the skin or cause other adverse reactions, while repeated use of DDT is enough to cause chronic poisoning. If six drops of "448" are applied to the hands, feet, and face, it can repel insects for six to ten hours. This new insecticide is now on sale in the United States, priced at 75 cents per two-ounce bottle. (Translated from Newsweek)

### Low Profile

— San Gong

According to the General Relief Administration's statistics, 12% of Shanghai citizens suffer from venereal diseases. It's a pity that this occupational census didn't accurately count the number of "prostitutes." Otherwise, we could calculate the percentage of prostitutes and venereal disease patients, wouldn't that be an interesting statistic?

Huang Zhaochuan and Yu Jishan, section chiefs of the Suzhou branch of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration, abused their power and engaged in corruption, leading to the death of a young girl, Chang Dong'e. Now, Huang and Yu have only been sentenced to three and a half years and one year and nine months in prison, respectively. Chang's family is reportedly dissatisfied, perhaps because they feel the sentences are too light!?

When reporting on a task, the heads of general organizations often outline several principles, departments, and key points...; this is like the "four cold dishes, eight hot stir-fries, six main courses, and two desserts" of the Ma Le Ji Fuxing Garden-style kitchen in classified ads.

Typhoons are really strange things. If you predict they will come, they often don't. If you predict they won't come, they might suddenly appear. Some people are wondering, "How can we predict them?" I say that because the weather is unpredictable, there's "no way to predict it." "Predicting what can be predicted, and not predicting what cannot be predicted, that is prediction."

### Difficult to Enter This Door

### Iron General Zhang Fakui

— Chong Zhen

Zhang Fakui, once known as the commander of the "Iron Army" Fourth Army, is now a nationally renowned second-level general in China.

General Zhang, courtesy name Xianghua, was born in 1895 in Shixing, Guangdong. His family was poor, and he lost his father at a young age. Fortunately, his mother farmed and weaved, managing the household frugally, which allowed the General to continue his studies.

Alone to Guangzhou

At the age of fourteen, his young mind was stirred by revolutionary ideas. He secretly went to Guangzhou alone, wanting to join the revolution. However, due to his young age and unfamiliarity with the area, he couldn't get involved in the secret revolutionary work. He was in a dilemma and didn't dare to go home. He had a firm will, and wouldn't return home if he didn't succeed, preferring a wandering life. Soon, he temporarily became an apprentice in a Guangzhou factory, living a life of struggle.

After work, he focused on reading, and because the books he read were mostly banned at the time, he often read them secretly late at night, hiding revolutionary books between his bedding. At the time of the Huanghuagang Uprising of the Seventy-Two Martyrs, he wanted to participate but didn't get his wish. Soon after Guangzhou was restored, the revolution initially succeeded, and he felt he couldn't wait any longer and bravely joined the army.

In the second year of the Republic of China, he was admitted to the sixth term of the Huangpu Military Elementary School, joined the Kuomintang, and became a formal party member. Around the second or third year of the Republic of China, he and his classmate Xue Yue secretly plotted to assassinate Prince Wu Yue, the Jiwei General conferred by Yuan Shikai, who controlled the military and political power in Guangdong. Unexpectedly, the plot was leaked, and they were arrested and imprisoned. Fortunately, Fang Shengtao and Zhang Kairu led the Tian Army to drive away the old Long [Jiguang], which saved him and Xue Yue.

At the age of eighteen, he was promoted to the Second Reserve Military Academy in Wuchang, diligently studying for two years. He then fled after an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Wang Zhanyuan, the military governor of Hubei. Soon after, he was admitted to the Baoding Military Officer School. After graduation, he was the fastest-promoted among the Baoding students, jumping from major adjutant to army commander.

The Great Victory at Qujiang

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the battle of Qujiang began. The enemy advanced in two routes, crossed Shakou in three days, converged at Wushi, and attacked Qujiang directly. General Yu Hanmou, the commander of the front line in northern Guangdong, repeatedly telegraphed the headquarters for urgent assistance, but received no response. In fact, after Wushi was occupied by the enemy, it was only forty kilometers away from Qujiang, and the road from Zhaoqing to Qujiang was cut off in disguise. How should General Zhang respond?

Unexpectedly, he boldly passed through the enemy's defense line and returned to Qujiang from Zhaoqing. It is said that when the General heard that Qujiang was in danger, he led more than ten of his entourage along a small road overnight to return to Qujiang. When passing through Wushi, he was only dozens of meters away from the enemy's position. Fortunately, he was not discovered by the enemy sentries, otherwise, the General might not be here today.

When he returned to Qujiang, the situation was extremely tense, and people were in chaos. He stabilized the people's hearts on the one hand and launched a counterattack on the other. After three days and nights of bloody battle, the enemy collapsed and retreated, creating a glorious page in the "Great Victory of Qujiang" in the war history of the Battle of Northern Guangdong.

The General is of medium height, with a strong build. When he speaks, his voice is extremely loud. When he issues orders, his eyes are awe-inspiring. However, in peacetime, you would see him as gentle and elegant, thinking he is a "scholar-general."

The General's Life

The key to his success in life is, in private, intelligence, a love of learning, and strong heroic ideals. In public, he loves his soldiers like sons and loves the people like sons, with clear rewards and punishments, and extremely strict military discipline.

I remember once, when a subordinate unintentionally insulted a young girl, he shot five people. Another time, a special agent chief embezzled seventy-odd dollars, and he was executed on the spot.

Another time, one of his platoon leaders fired a cook. The cook was very sad and reluctant to leave, which happened to be seen by the General, who asked him, "Why are you sad?"

"Reporting to the commander, I was fired!" The cook replied sadly.

"I didn't fire you, who fired you?"

Answer: "The platoon leader."

The General immediately called the platoon leader, and after finding out the truth, the cook was still "reinstated." The cook was so touched by the unexpected care that he always remembered General Zhang's love for his subordinates. He always wanted to repay him, but the General refused several times when he sent gifts. The cook had no way to repay him, and cried bitterly, which even moved the platoon leader, who reported it on his behalf. The General called the cook, not only did not accept his presents, but gave him a dozen dollars.

Zhang has no hobbies. He once liked alcohol and tobacco but later quit. His only pastime is riding horses. Every morning, he always rides a good horse to the countryside for a ride. This is the true color of a hero inseparable from his horse. Now he is a fifty-two-year-old general, but he is still busy working for the public. Recently, he went to Hainan Island to inspect security. He is, of course, still extremely concerned about post-war stability and construction, just like the enthusiasm he had when he went to Guangzhou alone to participate in the revolution.
