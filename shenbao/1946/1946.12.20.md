### President Truman Issues Statement: U.S. Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged; Condemns Communist Party for Undermining Peace Negotiations

U.S. President Truman issued a careful statement of 3,500 words at a press conference in Washington on the 18th, reiterating the U.S. policy toward China. The main points are as follows:

(1) The United States supports the position of the Chinese National Government, and the statement issued last December remains valid.

(2) U.S. troops stationed in China will be reduced to 12,000 in the short term, and their mission is only to assist China in repatriating Japanese nationals and protecting transportation lines.

(3) Special Envoy Marshall has achieved considerable success in China in promoting Chinese unity and peace, and his presence in China will greatly assist in resolving China's domestic difficulties.

(4) The Political Consultative Conference of various parties and factions in China was undermined by the Communist Party's cessation of consultations. Special Envoy Marshall, feeling the seriousness of the problem and the importance of peace, remains stationed in China.

(5) The ceasefire agreement was undermined by the incessant conflicts, culminating in the Communist Party's occupation of Changchun.

(6) The Export-Import Bank will lend another $500 million to China. Whether this loan can be allocated will depend on the policy clarified by the U.S. government last December.

(7) The United States is prepared to assist China in restoring peace and achieving political democratization. However, the United States has no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs.

### Full Text of the Statement

[United States Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman issued a statement on China today, the full text of which is as follows:

In December of last year, I issued a statement outlining the views of this government on China. At that time (as it is now), we believed that a united and democratic China was extremely important to world peace. Expanding the foundation of the National Government so that it can represent the people of the five nations will accelerate China's progress towards this goal, and China has an obvious responsibility to other United Nations, that is, to stop military conflicts within its territory, because this conflict is a major threat to world stability and peace. The three foreign ministers in Moscow last year also clarified that our allies, Britain and the Soviet Union, also agreed with this view. On December 27 last year, Byrnes, Molotov, and Bevin issued a statement, which stated:

"The three foreign ministers have exchanged views on the situation in China and believe that there must be a united and democratic China under the leadership of the National Government. A National Government that broadly accommodates democrats and a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs."

### Promoting Unity and Democracy is China's Own Task

In my statement last December, I also clarified the policy of this government. We recognize the National Government of the Republic of China as the legitimate government, and we are determined to assist the Chinese government in handling post-war recovery areas and disarming and repatriating Japanese aggressors. In addition, if China moves along the above-mentioned path towards peace and unity, we are prepared to provide economic and other assistance to China.

I urged General Marshall to go to China on my behalf. His implementation plan will be based on my statement on China. He fully knows how to carry out his mission. He knows that stopping the civil war, expanding the foundation of the Chinese government, and promoting a united and democratic China are the work of the Chinese people themselves. He went to China as a great American, contributing his outstanding talents to assist the Chinese people.

During the war, the Chinese and American governments signed an agreement on training and equipping a special army (totaling 39 divisions). This training work finally ended on the day of victory over Japan. When Marshal arrived in China, the work of equipping and transferring had also been largely completed.

The United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union also took it upon themselves to liberate China (including the return of "Manchuria" to China). The U.S. government agreed to assist the Chinese government in recovering the areas liberated from the Japanese army, including Manchuria. Because China lacked ships and transport planes, the U.S. assisted in sending National troops to Central China, Taiwan, North China, and "Manchuria," including three armies transported by air and one army transported by sea. Most of this troop movement was completed or started before Marshall arrived in China.

Repatriating Japanese Troops is Related to Peace

The work of resolving armaments and building and sending Japanese troops has progressed too slowly. We believe that assisting China in this regard is extremely important to the future peace and balance of China and the entire East Asia. There are as many as three million Japanese troops and Japanese administrative personnel, technicians, and high-level personnel in China who have surrendered but have not yet been defeated. These must be repatriated under difficult circumstances. At the request of the Chinese government, we stationed some American troops in China. When the day of victory over Japan arrived, we immediately dispatched Marine Corps to land in North China. The main task of this team was to assist in the repatriation of Japanese people. When Marshall arrived in China, only about 200,000 Japanese people had been repatriated.

When he arrived in China, Marshall also faced extremely bad internal situation. Due to the war and the civil war that has occurred since then, the country's transportation has been severely damaged. This damage has prevented the revival of China's economy and the distribution of relief supplies, and has made the deportation of Japanese expatriates a slow and difficult process. The destruction of wartime factories, the inflation caused by the war, the economic blockade actions taken by the Japanese in the occupied areas after the victory over Japan, and the traffic obstructions that have brought the economic life of the entire China to a standstill have brought indescribable suffering to millions of people and deprived the victory of its importance to the majority of the Chinese people, greatly increasing internal tensions and disputes in China.

Executive Headquarters Promotes Work

It is extremely important for China to resolve its domestic difficulties on its own and accelerate the completion of this plan. We have a promise to assist the Chinese government in completing this plan. Marshall's experience and wisdom will greatly assist China in resolving its domestic difficulties.

After Marshall arrived in China, the situation changed rapidly. Following the unanimous adoption of his selfless advice by various parties and factions, the agreement on a comprehensive ceasefire was announced on January 10. The characteristic of the agreement was the establishment of the Peiping Executive Headquarters. All parties believed that due to inconvenient transportation and the lack of integration of the sentiments of the front-line troops in various places, the orders to stop conflicts and retreat to the original defenses could hardly be implemented unless a joint executive agency trusted by both parties could carry out its tasks under any circumstances in various places.

The headquarters is working under the leadership of three committees: one is an American, serving as chairman, one is a representative of the Chinese government, and the other is a representative of the Chinese Communist Party. Robertson, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, served as chairman until his return to the country in the autumn of this year. In order to carry out work in various places, the headquarters also established executive committees in various places. Each group was presided over by one American, government, and CCP official. They rushed to all dangerous places where fighting had not stopped or where there was a stalemate, trying to implement the ceasefire order. They often carried out their work under extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances. The degree of cooperation between government and CCP officials in the headquarters and the team is a great proof, showing that although the KMT-CCP dispute has lasted for 20 years, there is still the possibility of cooperation between the two parties.

Political Progress Has Also Been Made

The same progress has also been made in the political field. On January 10, the Political Consultative Conference was unveiled, with representatives from the KMT, the CCP, and several small political parties attending the meeting. In the three weeks of direct discussions, the PCC reached a series of political agreements on important political and military issues. The agreement stipulates the organization of a transitional coalition government, inviting various parties and factions to participate, and stipulates that before the convocation of the National Assembly, the constitution will be revised along the democratic path, and the KMT and CCP troops will be reduced in order to merge into a small-scale, modernized national army responsible to the government representing the people. In March, General Marshall returned to the United States. He reported that after these agreements were reached, the Chinese people had made important progress in peace and unity. He also pointed out that unless China's economic decline is immediately stopped, especially the restoration of the transportation system, these agreements cannot be smoothly implemented. Political unity cannot be built on a chaotic economy. This government has approved several small loans to the Chinese government in order to meet emergency post-war needs. This action is the same as that taken by the United States in other war-torn areas of the world. A total of 66 million U.S. dollars were borrowed for six plans, mainly for the purchase of cotton, ships, and materials for repairing railways, but these emergency measures were not sufficient. After China made important progress in accordance with the agreement (according to Marshall's report), the Export-Import Bank separately allocated 500 million U.S. dollars as a possible additional loan, which was granted to Chinese government agencies and private enterprises in accordance with the principle of individual plans. Whether this loan can actually be allocated will obviously depend on the policy clarified by this government on July 15, 1945. Up to now, this 500 million U.S. dollar loan has not been changed, but it has not been allocated. (The following is transferred to the second page)

### The Yenan Side Will Officially Respond to the U.S. Statement

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] CCP spokesman Wang Bingnan recently issued a statement saying: Yenan will officially respond to President Truman's statement.

### Minister Peng Talks Denies Issuance of New Banknotes

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Minister Peng solemnly denied the rumor that the government will issue new currencies such as Sun Yat-sen banknotes at a press conference on the afternoon of the 19th. According to him, this statement is "groundless and completely untrue."

### China Will Not Have Positive or Negative Response to the U.S. President's Statement; Indicates That the U.S. Procedure Towards China Will Not Change

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 19th] The Chinese government will not have an official response to President Truman's statement, because senior leaders believe that the President's words were aimed at the various debates on his China policy over the past year, and not aimed at China. Government officials are clearly satisfied with the President's statement, believing that the President's words are tantamount to endorsing President Chiang's actions to move towards democracy. Although neutral observers believe that the President's document does not support the National Government, they believe that it can at least indicate that the procedure formulated by the President and implemented under the leadership of Marshal Marshall will not change drastically in the short term.

### Results of Comprehensive Review of the Constitution; National Assembly Scheduled to Discuss Tomorrow; General Assembly Continued to Hear Reports Yesterday

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The 21st meeting of the Presidium was held at 4 pm on the 19th, chaired by Huang Yun. The meeting discussed the procedure for discussion after the review was completed and decided to hold the 11th General Assembly at 9 am on the 20th. The Comprehensive Review Committee will report on the results of the review and will not conduct discussions for the time being. There will be no meeting in the afternoon. The 12th General Assembly will begin discussions on the 21st. In addition, the chairman of the General Assembly on the 20th will be Cheng, and Chen Cheng will report on the comprehensive meeting.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The 11th meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 am on the 19th, with 1,190 representatives attending. The conveners of the various constitution review committees continued to report on the review process. The second group of the presidium was on duty, chaired by Tian Jiongjin. After the secretariat reported, the secretary-general read the report of the presidium: (1) The session of the General Assembly was previously decided to be extended until the 19th. It is now found that the comprehensive review work has not yet been completed, and the General Assembly still has the procedures of the second and third readings. Therefore, it has been decided to extend it for another two days, until the 21st. (2) The First Review Committee of the Constitution stated in a letter: "When the Review Committee reviewed Chapter 12 on elections, women representatives proposed adding a clause to Chapter 12; that is, in accordance with Proposal No. 234, add the following item after Article 130 of the Constitution: "Various elections should stipulate quota for elected officials, at least 20 percent of which shall be determined by law." The review committee unanimously passed it and has included it in the review report. However, in the tenth general assembly, the written report separately prepared by the review committee was omitted. Please supplement the report to the general assembly." The discussion items were to continue listening to the reports of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th review committees. At this point, the review report work came to an end. The chairman announced that after the comprehensive review report was submitted, further discussions would be held. The meeting adjourned at 11:45 am, and the general assembly stopped holding meetings in the afternoon.

### Comprehensive Review Committee Ends

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Comprehensive Review Committee was held at 4:15 pm on the 19th, chaired by Chen Cheng, with 135 representatives attending. The discussion items were as follows: (1) The number of people during the Legislative Yuan's reconsideration, (2) The number of legislators, (3) The issue of adding clauses on the autonomous system of Mongolia and Tibet in Chapter 11, (4) The issue of adding clauses on the division of provinces and regions in Chapter 11, (5) The election chapter, (6) The division of chapters on basic national policies, (7) The issue of adding a marriage clause to basic national policies, (8) In the education clause of basic national policies, stipulating that students must exceed party affiliation, (9) The definition of law, (10) The interpretation of the constitution, (11) The establishment of the constitution implementation procedures, (12) Adding the issue of supervising and promoting the implementation of the constitution. All discussions were completed, and the meeting adjourned at 6:20 pm. The review work has come to an end. The discussion process is recorded as follows:

(1) The issue of the number of people during the Legislative Yuan's reconsideration. The Organizing Committee believed that in accordance with the opinions of the Third Review Committee, Article 58 should be revised to state that the Executive Yuan has the responsibility to submit policy guidelines and policy reports to the Legislative Yuan, and legislators have the right to question the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan during the meeting. The words "all" in the second and third items were changed to "attendance." The chairman reported that the last discussion result was to decide to pass the principle and hand it over to the Organizing Committee. The result of the discussion on the number of people was two opinions: one was three-quarters of attendance and two-thirds of passage, and the other was two-thirds of attendance and two-thirds of agreement. Subsequently, Shi Shangkuan stood up and stated that the principle decided last time was three-quarters of attendance and two-thirds of passage. This principle has already been passed, and the Organizing Committee cannot change it in principle. Zeng Qi also said that Representative Pan Gongzhan had proposed the opinion of three-quarters attendance and two-thirds passage last time, and it had been passed. Even if it cannot be so, it can be two-thirds attendance and three-quarters passage, because it must have a majority vote.

Wang Xiuqing said that the reason why the number of people for reconsideration must be large is because if the Legislative Yuan passes it, the President of the Executive Yuan will inevitably resign. If it is passed rashly with a small number of people, it will cause the political situation to fluctuate from time to time. Therefore, I believe that it should be negotiated and then handed over to the General Assembly. Pan Gongzhan said: In principle, it has been passed. Today, one of the following two methods should be adopted: one is to formally propose reconsideration, and the other is not to propose reconsideration, that is, to negotiate again. Subsequently, Chen Kan made a statement saying: Three-quarters attendance and two-thirds passage seem to be a compromise, but it is not. Because the number of three-quarters attendance is too large, it will not be easy for the President of the Executive Yuan to change, and the Executive Yuan can be irresponsible to the Legislative Yuan. Later, the chairman made a statement saying: This issue is not worth paying too much attention to. From the party's standpoint, it is the minority party arguing for the majority party. In addition, if three-quarters is the attendance standard, the minority party can not attend. Therefore, if it is stipulated to be more than the majority party, it is not necessarily beneficial. This is not a party issue. At the same time, if the President of the Executive Yuan is indeed not good, whoever supports him is whoever is not good. If the Legislative Yuan has something that is too much for the Executive Yuan, it can be passed with a small number of people attending the meeting, but this case must still be submitted to the President. Therefore, if the parties attach importance to this case, they can try to urge their own people to participate more in advance. I believe that the spirit of this comprehensive meeting is very good, and there is no need to argue over this point.

(2) The issue of the number of legislators. Lei Zhen reported that in the original draft Article 65, some people believed that the first item on the total number was unsatisfactory, and the second was the separate listing of merchants, Tibetans, and Mongolians, because there were already special provisions. The rest were completely the same as the spirit of the original case. Therefore, there was no objection to passing the organizing committee's views. (To be continued)

### Central Standing Committee of the Democratic League to be Held Soon

Luo Longji Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Tonight

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Luo Longji of the Democratic League had a long talk with Zhou Enlai on the evening of the 18th, and visited Zhang Qun again at 2 pm on the 19th. The plan to go to Shanghai on the 19th was postponed and changed to the night train on the 20th. Some people believe that his contact is related to peace talks.

[Central News Agency, This City] After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, has been informally exchanging opinions with League members for several days. Yesterday, the reporter asked Mr. Shen Junru about the date of the Democratic League's Standing Committee meeting and whether Zhang Junmai of the Social Democratic Party was invited to attend. He said: The date has not yet been decided, but it will probably be held recently. In addition, the Democratic League does not plan to notify Mr. Zhang Junmai to participate.

### Minister Peng Tells Reporters Not to be Fooled by Rumors

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Minister Peng announced on the 19th that "according to the report on those who abducted our people, a certain party is planning to spread rumors and slander the Youth Party, the Social Democratic Party, and some National Assembly representatives, with the aim of making people dissatisfied with the National Assembly. I urge the press not to be fooled by it and lightly spread or forward it. We deeply know the importance of freedom of the press, but slander is not freedom of speech. Improper slander against a certain party is also contrary to the purpose of freedom of speech and violates the ethics of journalists."

### Ma Zhanshan Flies to Nanjing

Visits the Chairman to Report on the Northeast Issue

[This newspaper, Peiping, 19th] Ma Zhanshan, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security, flew to Nanjing by special plane at 9:30 am on the 19th to visit Chairman Chiang and report on the Northeast issue. He will return to Peiping in two weeks. Whether Ma will take office in the Northeast will depend on the decision of this trip. Ma's troops have stopped downsizing since the tension in Datong, and still maintain the Northeast Advance Army designation. They are currently stationed on the railway line east of Datong.

### Foreign Minister Wang Attends Reception and Answers Questions on Constitution-Making and Diplomacy; Government to be Reorganized Immediately After National Assembly Closes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Chinese and foreign press conference of the Central Propaganda Department was held at 2 pm on the 19th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was invited to attend and answer questions on constitution-making and diplomacy. Wang said that he firmly believed that the principles and spirit of the constitution draft proposed by the government would be accepted by the National Assembly. Wang also praised the spirit of tolerance of the National Assembly representatives, believing that this conference fully demonstrated the restoration of the Chinese people's confidence in democracy and representative politics. When Wang expressed his personal views on the issue of constitution-making in the National Assembly, he said: The constitution-making work of the National Assembly has made extremely important progress. I am telling you today that I now firmly believe that the principles and spirit of the constitution draft will be accepted by the National Assembly. The General Assembly will definitely make some revisions, so that the amendments passed in the future will not, on the whole, discount the original draft, but improve it. There are several reasons for this development. The most important reason is that the National Assembly representatives have a spirit of tolerance. The spirit of tolerance is the first condition for the success of democratic politics. The majority should understand the views of the opponents with an open mind. It is not enough to just be open-minded, but also to have a spirit of tolerance. The Kuomintang members' promotion of the spirit of tolerance may be thanks to the Chinese Communist Party. We hope that the Chinese Communist Party will also learn a lesson. This conference fully demonstrates that the Chinese people have restored their confidence in democracy and representative politics. The failure of parliamentary politics in the early years of the Republic of China caused the general Chinese people to lose confidence in democracy. This was still the case before the War of Resistance. The restoration of confidence today is due to more than one reason, but I believe that the actual achievements of the National Political Council in the past eight years are a major reason for promoting this restoration of confidence. The powers of the Political Council were indeed not large enough, but the level of ability and political morality shown by the Political Council were not low. His eight years of hard work have gradually made people feel that democracy and representative politics are feasible in China. The failure in the early years of the Republic of China does not need to be repeated. I hope and believe that the constitution passed by this National Assembly can truly represent the will of the Chinese people and is the result of our thirty-five years of hard experience.

### General Assembly to Decide on Constitution Implementation Procedures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After expressing his personal views, Wang answered reporters' questions. Regarding the procedures for formulating the constitution, Wang said: The Comprehensive Review Committee is currently reviewing the opinions of the review results of each group separately, and then submitting them to the General Assembly for a vote item by item. After the General Assembly passes the entire draft constitution, it is still difficult to estimate when the General Assembly will complete this task. Personally, I estimate that it will take five days to a week to complete. Regarding the question of whether it is still possible to discuss when the amendments to the constitution draft are submitted for a vote, Minister Wang replied: The presidium is considering this matter. The reporter continued to ask how the status of the National Political Council would be after the National Assembly. Wang said: I am currently unable to answer. I am afraid that the government or the reorganized government will decide after the National Assembly closes. Regarding the order of government reorganization and government sending personnel to Yenan, Wang said: The reorganization of the government will begin after the National Assembly closes. Regarding sending personnel to Yenan, the government is considering it and has not made any decision. Wang continued to answer the question of constitution implementation, saying: He believed that the constitution implementation procedures should be decided at the General Assembly. Wang also said that the General Assembly seemed to be making a decision. The reporter continued to ask Wang, if some representatives were dissatisfied with the passed constitution and withdrew from the meeting, would the constitution itself be affected? Wang said: He believed that there would not be a withdrawal or a withdrawal of a majority of representatives. Even if a few withdrew, the constitution would not be affected. Finally, Wang answered the reporter's question about his personal opinion on including "Comply with the United Nations Charter" in the basic national policy, saying that he personally agreed to include it.

### Understanding Between the Chinese and Soviet Governments Has Indeed Progressed

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] The following foreign minister said about Sino-Soviet relations: "Over the past year, the Chinese and Soviet governments have indeed made progress in understanding each other's attitudes."

### International Monetary Fund Announces Legal Exchange Rates of Thirty Countries; Eight Countries Including China and Poland Are Permitted to Postpone Submitting

[United Press, London, 18th] The International Monetary Fund announced tonight: Transactions will begin at the exchange rates of various countries on March 1 of next year. Among the 39 member countries of the fund, 30 countries have submitted legal exchange rates. Eight countries, including Brazil, China, the Dominican Republic, Greece, Poland, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, and East India, have applied for postponement of submission and have been approved. The significance of Uruguay also awaiting parliamentary approval before it can submit is not only that various countries announce their exchange rates, but also that the participating countries have established an agency to stabilize exchange rates. Except in accordance with the fund agreement, the legal exchange rates of their currencies cannot be changed, and this assistance will be used to complete the common purpose of the currency fund agreement. Various

Belgian Franc: 43.8275 francs equal to one U.S. dollar.

Canadian Dollar: One dollar equals one U.S. dollar.

French Franc: 119.201 francs equal to one U.S. dollar. Dutch Guilder: 2.5528 guilders equal to one U.S. dollar. British and South African Commonwealth Gold Pound: 8.6545 pounds equal to one ounce of gold. 4.0258159 pounds equal to one U.S. dollar. Indian Rupee: 125.798 rupees equal to one ounce of gold, 3.30852 rupees equal to one U.S. dollar. These legal parities are based on current exchange rates, but the fund's acceptance of these exchange rates cannot be considered a guarantee that they will not change again.

### The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Extends Relief Supplies to China until Next September, with One Hundred Ships En Route

[Our Dispatch] The sixth session of the UNRRA General Assembly concluded successfully in Washington last week. It is reported that the General Assembly unanimously approved the extension of UNRRA's relief supplies to China until next September. However, it stipulates that UNRRA's procurement of supplies in China should end by the end of next June, and in Europe by the end of March. If it cannot be completed by then, negotiations can be held with the respective countries to continue.

Furthermore, UNRRA is quite satisfied with the performance of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) in supplying materials to the Communist-controlled areas in the past two months. However, it still hopes to increase supply and transportation to achieve UNRRA's goal of fair distribution. UNRRA authorities also stated that they will continue to retain experienced technical personnel in China, Washington, and the respective European branches to assist in completing the transportation of supplies to China.

The last General Assembly meeting is scheduled to be held before the end of next June. If the members of the General Assembly deem it unnecessary at that time, it can also be canceled.

[French News Agency, Washington, 18th] The new Director-General of UNRRA, Rooks, recently addressed UNRRA staff, stating that if UNRRA wants to complete its supply plan within the specified period, all staff must redouble their efforts to expedite the shipment of relief supplies that have not yet been shipped abroad. The total value of these relief supplies is between 600 million and 1 billion US dollars.

[Our City Dispatch] UNRRA announced that as of the 13th of this month, a total of 1,320,896 tons of supplies had been shipped to China. Last week, one ship unloaded 2,248 tons in Shanghai. This week, there are nine UNRRA ships, four in Shanghai, two in Hong Kong, two in Shantou, and one in Dagu, unloading cargo, totaling 19,408 tons. In addition, one hundred UNRRA ships are en route to China, of which ninety-one are carrying 223,794 tons of cargo, and the tonnage of the remaining nine is unknown.

Furthermore, according to CRRRA's announcement, in the week from December 7th to 13th, this agency transported a total of 3,703 tons of supplies to other locations. Food and industrial equipment still account for the majority, with the two items accounting for 82% of the total. This week, 3,784.40 tons of supplies were distributed locally in Shanghai, and a total of 7,488.20 tons were transported to other locations. The breakdown of supplies transported to other locations this week is as follows: Food: 1,833.76 tons, Clothing: 559.46 tons, Industrial Equipment: 885.45 tons, Agricultural Equipment: 133.92 tons, Medical Equipment: 301.21 tons, Total: 3,703.80 tons.

[Our Dispatch from Guilin, 19th] The Guilin CRRRA branch transferred all 1.2 billion yuan of its eighth-term operating funds for other uses. The various counties and cities telegraphed requesting emergency allocations, but the branch refused and stated that it would not respond. The number of starving people dying in various places is increasing daily.

### To Have Peace in the Pacific, Assistance is Needed for Eastern Countries; American Branch of the Pacific Society Pays Attention to China

[United Press, San Francisco, 18th] The American branch of the Pacific Society held a regional conference near Monterey, California, last weekend. No less than 150 representatives participated, mostly educators, writers, and business people. Repeated discussions during the conference gave listeners the feeling that if peace is desired in the Pacific, Eastern countries must first be assisted to become self-sufficient, so that their people's lives can be improved and they will no longer want war. The United States seems to have a better understanding of the general situation in China than in other Eastern countries, and all debates often concluded with China. Although the situation in India is more complex, it received little attention. Someone suggested that the Chinese civil war be submitted to the United Nations for discussion. Shen Jianhong, director of the San Francisco office of the International Publicity Department of the Central Propaganda Department, immediately refuted this, stating that the economic imbalance and production stagnation in the United States could equally be submitted to the United Nations for review. Is it more tragic for people to die from civil war than to die from not being able to obtain food due to strikes in the American shipping and coal mining industries? This is a question. His stated opinions are as follows:

(1) Events occurring in any place are related to other parts of the world.

(2) The world cannot have peace if the East is turbulent and restless.

(3) Eastern countries cannot stabilize without outside assistance.

(4) According to the natural situation, most of this assistance should come from the United States. If the United States cannot maintain its own domestic security and production, where will the assistance come from? All parties agreed that no foreign country can help other nations improve their lives without first stabilizing its own domestic politics. The conference discussed the political struggles in various Far Eastern countries, and frequently mentioned the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union in their wake, especially in China, Korea, and Japan. However, although the Soviet Union is a Pacific country, this fundamental issue was never discussed in detail.

### Seventy Thousand Taels of Mexican Gold Arrive in Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th] Seventy thousand taels of Mexican gold arrived in Hong Kong via an American vessel. Previously, the amount of Mexican gold shipped to Hong Kong at any one time was no more than 40,000 taels. The large amount this time is due to the slight fluctuations in the price of gold in Hong Kong and various parts of the country. The cost of Mexican gold is more than 270 Hong Kong dollars per tael. According to the current market price here, it can be sold in Hong Kong for a profit of more than 30 Hong Kong dollars per tael. Therefore, the financial community is competing to telegraph orders. It is estimated that in the past three months, an average of 100,000 taels of Mexican gold have been shipped to Hong Kong each month. Hong Kong has not digested much, and it is all being smuggled to various parts of the country for profit.

### On the Issue of Smuggling

Customs Trade Statistics are No Longer Accurate

[United Press, Hong Kong, 19th] The Far Eastern Economic Review reported today that smuggling in China is rampant, and customs statistics are no longer reliable as a basis for analyzing China's trade. The customs' prevention plans are no match for highly efficient smuggling organizations, and the ever-increasing regulations and restrictions only serve to bother legitimate merchants. The report cited the Macau customs as an example, stating that the trade between China and Portugal that the local customs can register is less than 20% of the actual figures, and there are hundreds of armed smuggling motorboats. The article also stated that although the import of cosmetics was banned nine months ago, the amount of inventory smuggled in is still enough to supply the Shanghai market for several years.

### China and Argentina Negotiating a Trade Agreement

Signing Possible in January or February Next Year

[Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 18th, United Press] He Molin, a representative of the Chinese government, recently met with Argentine Foreign Minister Primo Graga to discuss matters related to trade. It is widely believed that the agreement will be signed in January or February of next year. Ambassador Chen Jie accompanied He Molin and actively participated in the work.

### The Philippines' Market Filipinization Act: China Formally Lodges a Protest, China-Philippines Trade Agreement to be Signed Before Christmas

[United Press, Manila, 19th] According to an official announcement today, Chen Zhiping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, recently submitted a formal letter of protest from the Chinese government to President Roxas, protesting the Philippine government's law giving Filipinos priority in setting up stalls in the Manila market (i.e., the Market Filipinization Act). The law will be implemented starting next year, affecting 1,045 Chinese vendors in the city's eleven markets. Chen strongly argued that the law is a discriminatory measure specifically aimed at the Chinese in Manila, because only the Chinese set up stalls in the market among foreigners.

[Our Dispatch] The quantity of petroleum self-made and refined in our country next year will be greatly increased. This is because the Northeast Oil Refinery in Jinzhou will start construction next spring.

It is hoped that crude oil will be obtained from Iran, and negotiations have been going on for a long time; it is now learned that agreement has been reached in principle, and only the transportation problem remains to be discussed in detail. The decision on the petroleum import quota will largely refer to the customs import figures in the past year, and the China Petroleum Corporation has also contributed its opinions on this issue. In general, there will be considerable flexibility in the quota for oil for special purposes. Among the three major companies currently supplying petroleum to our country, Texaco is in the leading position.

Editorial

### Reaffirmation of America's China Policy

President Truman made a statement on the 18th, reiterating that the U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged and that the declaration on China policy issued on December 15th of last year remains in effect. He solemnly declared the following: (1) U.S. troops are stationed in China at the request of the National Government to assist China in repatriating Japanese residents and prisoners of war and in restoring domestic peace and order. The number of U.S. troops has been reduced from 113,000 to 12,000. (2) Recognizing China as an autonomous and independent country and recognizing the National Government as the sole legitimate government of China, the United States should support it. Once domestic peace is restored in China, the United States will intensify its assistance to China's economic recovery and reform to promote Sino-U.S. business relations. (3) Special Envoy Marshall's mediation of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been quite successful. Although the KMT-CPC negotiations have now broken down, it is still necessary for Special Envoy Marshall to remain in China. (4) While the U.S. position in China must avoid being drawn into the vortex of China's internal strife, it must still maintain its policy of assisting the Chinese people in restoring domestic peace and reviving the economy. (5) The United States will not interfere in China's internal affairs. (6) He expressed approval of the political negotiation resolutions and the military reorganization plan but expressed regret that China had failed to achieve the goal of political and military unification through peaceful means. (7) He urged China to stop the civil war, believing that a unified and peaceful China is of utmost importance to world peace. Therefore, China has a responsibility to other United Nations members to stop its internal strife and hopes that the Chinese government can find a peaceful solution to the KMT-CPC dispute.

President Truman's lengthy statement should be regarded as a declaration that the U.S. policy toward China remains unchanged, which can have a clarifying effect on public opinion circles in both China and the United States. Especially in the United States, two or three months ago, there was a "U.S. Withdrawal from China" propaganda week, which made a great deal of noise, saying that the presence of U.S. troops in China would only fuel China's internal strife. Recently, Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the U.S. State Department, also issued a statement advising Americans not to invest in China. The day before yesterday, two senators jointly requested the government to stop its efforts to mediate China's internal strife alone and advocated convening a conference of the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, to implement what they called "joint mediation." The complexity of opinions in American public opinion circles can be seen from this. However, most Americans have always believed that the United States has a significant responsibility for world peace and an unshirkable responsibility for the creation of peace in the Far East. In particular, it should fulfill the promises it made to China during the war and actively assist China in becoming a strong, unified, and democratic country. President Truman's statement was aimed at these complex opinions and will enable the American people to fully understand what policy the United States should adopt toward China. In a nutshell, the United States should continue to adopt its active and realistic China policy. This simple, clear, and straightforward expression should make those self-proclaimed "Far East experts" think less and offer fewer "timely suggestions."

At the same time, it can also have a clarifying effect in China, enough to awaken those who fantasize that the U.S. policy toward China is about to change from their daydreams. Since June of this year, the Chinese Communist Party has continuously launched anti-American propaganda in newspapers, in writing, and in action, in an attempt to cause misperceptions in American public opinion circles and force the government to change its policy toward China. Although it failed, it still harbors considerable hope. As long as the American people have any proposals, it is overjoyed, especially regarding the suggestions of U.S. Senators Wiley and Flanders, expressing great importance to them. Little do they know that these are the private views of the two senators and are not enough to represent the views of the U.S. government and the public. After reading the full text of President Truman's statement, it can be known that one should not harbor any illusions about American policy.

Leaving aside all other factors, just in terms of the wishes of the people of China and the United States, the U.S. policy toward China will not change. What the United States expects of China is to become a strong, unified, and democratic country, becoming the only stable element in the Far East. President Truman said, "I believe that the wishes of the American people for China are exactly the same as the urgent hopes of the Chinese people themselves." This well-reasoned saying is truly worth our deep thought and understanding.

During China's War of Resistance against Japan, the United States not only expressed sympathy in spirit for China's arduous resistance but also provided material assistance at the earliest stage. In the end, China and the United States fought side by side, fighting to the end with the aggressor Japanese imperialism. Therefore, China's military turnaround from defeat to victory must be said to have relied on the strength of the United States. But why was the United States willing to assist China with all its strength to resist Japanese aggression? This is due to the common wish that the American people have for China. Everyone believes that China is a peace-loving country and should be the cornerstone of peace in the Far East. During the War of Resistance, China should be assisted at any cost to defeat the aggressors who disrupt peace in the Far East. After the victory of the War of Resistance, China should also be assisted in achieving peace and stability and embarking on the path of unification, peace, and democracy. The stationing of U.S. troops in China certainly held this mission, and Special Envoy Marshall's visit to China to mediate the KMT-CPC issue was even more to achieve this goal. In China, after eight years of arduous resistance, it was already exhausted and desperately needed to recuperate and devote itself to national construction and reconstruction in an atmosphere of peace after the victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, there is no one in the country who does not long for peace or unification. At the same time, in order to permanently eliminate internal strife, there is no one who does not hope for "political democratization" and "nationalization of the military." This expression of public opinion finally led to the success of the Political Consultative Conference, which not only passed the "Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction" but also established a military reorganization plan. Originally, after the ceasefire order was issued, China's future was full of infinite new hopes. However, the Chinese Communist Party, which had other intentions, did not hesitate to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and violate the military reorganization plan, making it impossible to achieve domestic peace. Although peace talks were still conducted afterward, they failed to achieve success, not only causing pain and suffering to the Chinese people but also greatly disappointing the people of the United States. Therefore, President Truman had no choice but to attribute the responsibility for the breakdown of the peace talks to the Chinese Communist Party.

The KMT-CPC issue is China's own business and should be resolved by its own means. However, because the wishes of the American people for China are exactly the same as the expectations of the Chinese people for themselves, we request the stationing of U.S. troops in China and welcome Mediator Marshall to travel around China for peace. Conversely, if someone advocates convening an international conference to resolve China's internal strife, not only is this suggestion untimely and impractical, but it also carries the suspicion of international interference and is by no means acceptable to the people of an independent and self-reliant country.

In short, President Truman's statement that U.S. policy toward China is still based on the declaration of December 15 of last year is not only welcomed by the Chinese people under the current international environment but also welcomed by Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. We only hope that China's political situation can also improve as the international situation improves.

### Full Text of Truman's Statement The above article continues from the first edition

At a time when large-scale aid was being delayed, this government completed its wartime lend-lease commitments to China. Lend-lease aid was given to China to help it fight the Japanese and later to help China recover Japanese-occupied territories. The aid included goods, equipment, and services, half of which were services, such as air and sea transportation of troops.

According to recent figures, the total value of lend-lease aid from the United States to China up to Victory over Japan Day was $870,000,000. From Victory over Japan Day to the end of February (shortly after Marshall arrived in China), the total was $602,000,000, most of which was used for transportation costs. Since then, the lend-lease program has been reduced, limited to completing unfinished tasks, but most of them have been discontinued later.

Disposal of Surplus Materials Completed

As a result of the disposal of surplus materials under the agreement we reached with China, a large number of civilian materials have been prepared. This has allowed us to clear many accounts and dispose of a lot of surplus materials.

During the war, the Chinese government provided U.S. troops with national currency for construction, equipment, troop support, and other uses. At the end of the war, the debt in this regard reached 150,000,000,000 Chinese national currency. Because of the incessant Chinese currency inflation, we cannot accurately determine the value of this figure in U.S. dollars.

China agreed to purchase all U.S. surplus materials (with a few exceptions) within China and on seventeen islands and bases in the Pacific. The agreement to purchase surplus materials was finally signed in August, after six months of negotiations. It was particularly urgent to complete this work in the Pacific, especially since materials in open-air warehouses in tropical climates are easily damaged, and the Chinese people are in great need of these surplus materials. U.S. aircraft outside China, all non-demilitarized combat materials, and fixed equipment were not included in the purchase, so the agreement should not allow any weapons to flow into the civil war.

In addition to $300 million, the Chinese government wrote off all of our debt for misappropriating its national currency and agreed to allocate funds equivalent to $35 million for the use of the U.S. government within China and for the acquisition or improvement of buildings and assets needed for our diplomatic and consular affairs. Another $20 million was allocated for the implementation of cultural education programs.

KMT-CPC Negotiations Disappointing

Before Marshall's second arrival in China in April, there were signs that the ceasefire agreement had been flouted. The sincere and unremitting efforts of the Executive Headquarters and its teams resulted in the cessation of local conflicts in many places, and countless lives were spared. However, new conflicts continued to occur. After the communist army occupied Changchun, the Northeast also fell into a crisis of chaos, and the National Government did not fully agree to send an executive team to Changchun.

The political situation has also changed, which is equally disappointing. Negotiations between the KMT and the Communist Party have reopened time and again, but they have often broken down. Although the final hope of successful negotiations has not completely disappeared, the agreements reached in January and February have not been implemented, and several Chinese parties have failed to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in a timely manner.

Task of Repatriating Japanese Completed

In other areas, there has also been exciting progress, especially in clearing out the Japanese in China. In accordance with the Allied agreement, China was responsible for disarming all Japanese military personnel and repatriating Japanese residents and military personnel from China, Taiwan, and Vietnam (north of latitude 16 degrees). Our government allowed China to assist in this task. The scope of this work was extreme, with a total of three million Japanese waiting to be evacuated, half of whom were naval and army personnel. Maritime and rail transport was destroyed or stalled, port facilities were also heavily damaged, and there was an excessive amount of relief and other materials. The Japanese had to be disarmed, concentrated, and then sent to the nearest port. In some cases, the distances were very far. At the ports, the Japanese were individually screened and given physical examinations, and they were vaccinated. Isolation hospitals were established at the ports to deal with infectious diseases, such as Asian cholera. Finally, all three million people had to be transported back to Japan by sea.

U.S. troops helped to disarm the Japanese army. The Executive Headquarters and its teams completed complex procedures to allow the Japanese army to pass through and move from the civil war zone to the embarkation port. U.S. teams also participated in port inspections, and U.S. medical units guided all vaccinations and other medical work. Finally, U.S. and Japanese ships belonging to the Seventh Fleet transported this large number of people to Japanese ports. At the end of last year, 200,000 Japanese were repatriated, leaving Chinese ports at a rate of 2,500 per day. In March of this year, due to the rapid and expanded efforts of the U.S. military and Chinese authorities, the rate of Japanese leaving China increased to 20,000 per day. By October, 2,986,438 Japanese had been repatriated, and this plan was considered to have come to an end. Except for an unknown number of Japanese in some locations in Manchuria, the remaining Japanese were only some war criminals and technicians retained by the Chinese government. Under the conditions of civil war, transportation destruction, and other difficulties, this great task was finally completed, becoming an outstanding example of Sino-U.S. cooperation for a common goal.

Number of U.S. Troops in China Greatly Reduced

There have been many criticisms of the U.S. military presence in China last year. In the autumn of last year, the number of U.S. troops stationed in China was quite large, and it should have been quite large. No one dared to predict the extent to which the Japanese army in China would obey the surrender terms. We should have sent troops to help China in times of difficulty. When it became clear that the Chinese army could deal with the surrendered Japanese army, the U.S. military in China immediately began to demobilize.

The main responsibility of the U.S. military was to assist in the evacuation of the Japanese, a task that was prolonged due to local environmental problems. The Executive Headquarters and the ceasefire teams also needed a large number of Americans, especially because the important radio and other transportation work was almost entirely maintained by the U.S. The Executive Headquarters was located in Beiping, only a hundred miles from the coast, and the city was prone to local conflicts. Therefore, another responsibility of the U.S. was to protect the supply lines of the Executive Headquarters. Another task of the U.S. military after the Japanese surrender was to provide the necessary protection to ensure that the coal produced by the large coal mines northeast of Tianjin could reach the seaports to supply the cities and railways in central China. This coal was necessary to prevent the collapse of the industrial zone in central China. Our Marines completed this task in September. The task of other U.S. troops was to find the remains and graves of U.S. soldiers who died in China during the war against Japan. There were also other U.S. troops who had to guard U.S. equipment and equipment storage facilities and find ways to transport them back or sell them as surplus materials.

The maximum strength of U.S. troops stationed in China a year ago was 113,000. Today, this number has begun to decrease to less than 12,000, including 2,000 U.S. troops directly related to the Executive Headquarters. This number will be further reduced until the minimum number required by the Executive Headquarters and the U.S. military in Qingdao to maintain supply and security is reached.

Therefore, in the past year, we have made a lot of progress in helping China repatriate the Japanese and have been able to withdraw most of the troops stationed abroad. We have also done a considerable amount of work in helping China receive the recovered areas. We have taken some emergency steps of economic assistance to prevent the Chinese economy from collapsing and have cleared up our own wartime financial accounts in China.

No Intention of Interfering in China's Internal Affairs

It is a great pity that China has so far failed to find a way to unite and achieve peace. Because Marshall understands the seriousness of the problem and the importance of finding a solution, he remains at his post, even in the case where negotiations have been interrupted by the CCP. We will continue to assist China in moving towards peace and a truly democratic government.

The views expressed by this government a year ago remain true today. The political unity plan agreed to in February is sound. The fighting since April has made the military unity plan of February difficult to implement, but the general principles within the plan are sound. China is a sovereign and complete country. We recognize this fact, and we also recognize the National Government of China. We continue to hope that the government will find a peaceful solution. We have no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs. Our position is clear. While avoiding being drawn into internal strife, we will maintain our policy of assisting the Chinese people in their quest for national peace and economic revival.

We are giving careful and sympathetic consideration to the methods and tools of creative assistance to China. The recent agricultural mission to China is one example of this assistance. The U.S. agricultural mission to China was led by Hutchinson of the University of California, and China organized a joint Sino-U.S. Agricultural Cooperation Committee, of which the Hutchinson Mission is a part. The country's proposals have been provided to the Chinese government, and we are prepared to assist China in implementing these proposals. As the situation in China improves, we are prepared to consider assisting in the implementation of other plans unrelated to internal strife. This plan will encourage China's economic reconstruction and reform, thereby increasing Sino-U.S. business relations.

We believe that our hopes for China are fully in line with the most ardent wishes of the Chinese people themselves. Therefore, we will continue our active and practical policy towards China. This policy is still based on full respect for its national sovereignty and our traditional friendship with the Chinese people. The goal of this policy is to promote international peace.

### Seriously Ill Traitor Ma Liang Carried into Court, Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for 21st Afternoon

[Our Jinan News] Ma Liang (Zi Zizhen), who once served as the puppet Shandong Provincial Governor and puppet North China Political Affairs Committee Member, was publicly tried in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court at 3 PM on the 16th of this month. The news spread, and many people went to attend the hearing. Traitor Ma, due to illness, could not walk and was carried into the court on a bamboo bed. Five of his family members followed him. When the court opened, Traitor Ma was still lying down. His wife, Ma Dang, and his son, Ma Zuozhang, stood on either side of the bed. Presiding Judge Li Faxian asked him his name, but he pretended to be deaf and mute, not saying a word. His son, Ma Zuozhang, then requested to act as an assistant to defend him. Prosecutor Li Huangeng stood up and accused him of his crimes, stating that after Jinan fell, Traitor Ma was the first to initiate the organization of the Maintenance Association, serving as its chairman. He was extremely flattering to the enemy. Then, in the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he organized the puppet Shandong Provincial Government, serving as the Provincial Governor, and concurrently served as a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he resigned from his position as the puppet Provincial Governor and went to Beiping to serve exclusively as a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. Traitor Ma remained in the puppet government until two years before the victory. During his time in the puppet government, Traitor Ma established a puppet government and promoted enemy and puppet political orders, which were beneficial to the enemy country and detrimental to our own country. The court is requested to investigate and handle the case according to law. Then, Judge Li questioned him in detail. Ma Zuozhang's answers to the court's questions about the crimes were like reciting a formula, all claiming that they were orders from the provisional government and forced by Japanese advisors. Finally, the defendant's lawyer, Hou Hanqing, defended him for three hours. The interrogation ended at 6 PM, and the sentencing was scheduled for 2 PM on the 21st of this month.

### Famous People on Trial Creates a Sensation in Suzhou City; Fan Junbo and Others' Extortion and Fraud Case Investigated, Courtroom Extremely Polite and Accommodating

[Our Suzhou, 19th Telegram] The Wudi District Court Prosecutor's Office investigated the sensational extortion and fraud case involving local figures Fan Junbo and others for the tenth time on the 19th. At 9 AM sharp, reporters from various local and foreign newspapers gathered at the District Court, competing to cover this rarely seen news.

After reporting to the bailiffs' office, they all retreated to the Shengyanglou teahouse next to the District Court to rest. Fan, Lu Shaofen, and Lu Wang Wu sat at one square table, sampling tea and talking cordially. The other nine gathered at a long table. At 9:30, Prosecutor Xiao Qi took the bench in the Second Investigative Court and ordered the bailiffs to summon Fan and others for questioning. The thirteen people then entered the court at the same time. Except for Fan Junbo, who entered the court first, the other twelve did not go to the waiting room. The bailiffs politely directed them to the Joint Court-Prosecutor's Club, where they sat and waited to be summoned. The servants provided tea attentively and were very respectful, which was different from the treatment of ordinary defendants. Reporters from various newspapers were scattered around the investigative court, hoping to hear some of the inside story of the investigation through cracks in the walls and windows, but the answers were barely audible. After about forty minutes, the court ordered the twelve people, including Lu Tiesun, to be questioned in turn. However, although they were questioned individually, they did not leave the court individually after being questioned, and they all waited in the court. The investigation came to an end at 12:30. The court ordered Fan Junbo to provide two reliable shopkeepers as guarantors, and Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang to each provide one shopkeeper as guarantor pending further investigation. The other nine, including Lu Shaofen, were ordered to return. After leaving the court, Fan and others returned to their residences for lunch without completing the procedures. The guarantor matters will be supplemented in the afternoon. This is also an unusual example, because Fan Junbo and others are Suzhou's most prestigious merchants and gentry. After the adjournment, our reporter inquired about the investigation from all sides. It is reported that Fan claimed that the original statement was inaccurate and argued that the six million yuan was privately requested by Li Zhenji Tailor Shop, which undertook the production of uniforms around the Double Tenth Festival [October 10th], because it lacked sewing cloth fees. Lu Tiesun and others agreed to provide the loan, but they did not know that it was an average fundraising. Moreover, the funds had been returned earlier because Li Zhenji no longer needed them. The Suzhou community is closely watching the development of this case.

### Iranian Government Willing to Fulfill Promise, Oil Rights for Five Northern Provinces Granted to Soviet Union, National General Election Scheduled for This Sunday

[United Press, Tehran, 18th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultaneh stated today that he will fulfill his promise to the Soviet Union and submit a bill to parliament to grant the Soviet Union oil exploration rights in the five northern provinces of Iran. Sultaneh also stated that the national election is expected to be held this Sunday. The government party recently reorganized into the Democratic Party and is gaining momentum, while the leftist Workers' Party is weakening. The Democratic Party of Azerbaijan Province has ceased to exist. The new parliamentary election may take three months to complete. The original plan to complete it by the 21st of this month was delayed because the Azerbaijan provincial government defied orders and refused to allow government troops to enter to supervise the election, leading to repeated clashes. Sultaneh believes that Azerbaijan Governor Bishivari has fled to the Soviet Union with other personnel, and whether to request extradition has not been decided.

[United Press, London, 19th] Moscow Radio announced today that Iranian government troops massacred hundreds of residents in Azerbaijan province and incited "attacks" on Soviet nationals residing in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan. The Iranian government has violated its agreement with the Azerbaijan authorities that government troops should enter the province peacefully. In the past few days, sixty Azerbaijani democrats have been assassinated, and three hundred have been arrested in Tabriz. Instigated by anti-Soviet elements and with the tacit approval of the Iranian government military authorities, bandits have looted Soviet institutions and attacked Soviet citizens.

### Security Council Discusses Greek Complaint, US Representative Proposes Forming a Seven-Member Team for On-Site Investigation

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 19th Broadcasting: An hour ago, the Security Council convened a meeting to discuss the proposal to send a delegation to the Greek border for investigation. It is expected that if the Soviet representative does not use the veto power, the US proposal will be passed. Also, a few hours before the Security Council meeting, Greece submitted a large number of documentary evidence to the Council, accusing South, Bulgaria and Albania of assisting guerrillas.

[Reuters, New York, 18th] The Security Council today continued to debate Greece's complaint against South, Bulgaria, and Albania for assisting Greek guerrillas. The South Korean Ambassador to the United States, Cassanovi, directly pointed out that the guerrillas were concentrated in Greece and armed to disrupt the security of the Balkans. He said that Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris believed that the best way to promote good relations between Greece and South Korea was to concentrate and arm the war criminals and traitors of Yugoslavia to disrupt the peace of the Balkans. Tsaldaris's ability to come to power was due to the support of the United Kingdom. Therefore, this phenomenon not only harms the Greek people, but also harms the reputation of the United Kingdom, and it is necessary to investigate the domestic situation in Greece. US Representative Johnson then proposed a resolution asking the Security Council to send five permanent directors, plus Poland and Brazil, to form an investigation team to go to the investigation before January 15. If necessary, they should investigate the kingdom of the four countries of Greece, South Korea, and Albania, and submit a report to the Security Council as soon as possible. US Representative Johnson said that this trial should be handled by the Security Council, and its results are of great importance to the future of the United Nations organization. Similar border encroachment cases must not be ignored by the Security Council. In order to clarify the truth, the Security Council should conduct an investigation immediately. British Representative Jaddigan also believed that the situation in the area where the four countries border was dangerous, and the spark of fire could become a prairie fire, so the Security Council should conduct an investigation first to make a decision. Representatives from Australia and Brazil also expressed their support. It is understood that Bulgaria and Albania, although not members of the United Nations, have agreed to accept the Security Council's ruling in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. Today's meeting was adjourned to tomorrow at the insistence of Soviet Representative Gromyko. Johnson requested that the meeting continue in the afternoon, but Gromyko replied that he was inconvenient.

In the next twenty years, tariff preferences will gradually decrease and tax rates will gradually increase until 1974, when this preference will be completely cancelled and both countries can levy normal tariffs. The main purpose of this method is to restore the economy of the Philippine Islands, which has been destroyed by the war, so that the trade relations between the two countries can be smoothly adjusted.

### First Meeting of the Legal Council Passes Strong Measures

New and Old Foreign Ministers Hold Handover Ceremony

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The Blum cabinet held its first formal meeting today and passed several strong measures. One of these measures prohibits any government personnel or military-political employees from holding press conferences, meeting with reporters, or broadcasting on the radio without permission.

Other measures passed include lowering prices and rents, and reducing the number of civil servants.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] Today, people in the parliament lounge were widely discussing the fact that the Blum cabinet received a vote of confidence yesterday.

### International Changes: Talking About the Soviet Union

The Soviet Union's attitude has recently become more moderate. Whether this will last is difficult to say at this time. The first test will be at the Atomic Energy Commission meeting in a few weeks.

[Associated Press, New York, 18th] The Council of Foreign Ministers and the United Nations institutions in the past "nine hundred and forty-six, ten months, and three weeks have only been pessimistic; every step forward is followed by a step back. The Soviet Union seems determined to turn international conferences into propaganda forums. British Prime Minister Attlee made a final effort to go to Paris this summer, hoping for Soviet cooperation, but its effectiveness seems minimal. The Paris Conference and the first five weeks of the New York Conference seem to have only strengthened the division between the Soviet Union and the English-speaking countries? Until four weeks ago, the Soviet Union gradually showed softening, and once an agreement was reached on the troop reduction plan, it no longer demanded veto power over the decision on the implementation mechanism. It also showed compromise on issues such as the Trieste port issue and free navigation on the Danube River, and after proposing universal disarmament, it began to demobilize its large army stationed in the occupied areas of Europe. The Soviet Union has also admitted some failures, such as saying that all members of the United Nations cut off diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government and investigated foreign troops stationed in various countries. Its attitude has been better than before, and it has not angrily walked out of the meeting. The Soviet Union has also expressed its willingness to lose its political position in Iranian Azerbaijan Province rather than cause another dispute. The Delhi government was determined to take strong action. Within a few days, without a major war, it eliminated the Azerbaijan provincial government supported by the Soviet Union, reopening a province that had been virtually isolated from the rest of Iran for a long time. The reasons for the Soviet Union's change of attitude and whether it will last have naturally aroused much speculation. Some representatives of the United Nations General Assembly pointed out that the Soviet Union's farms and factories need its army, which serves as a backing for military diplomacy, to return home to work. The implementation of the five-year plan requires foreign economic assistance, and it feels that its previous attitude has aroused resentment in various countries and is of no benefit to itself. Some people also hope that Soviet diplomats will gradually feel that Western countries are more trustworthy after working together for a long time. As for whether the Soviet Union's new attitude will last, this question largely depends on the value of other developments during the New York Conference, the most important of which is the universal disarmament plan. The General Assembly has asked the Security Council to decide how to establish control and inspection agencies and establish United Nations peacekeeping forces. The Soviet Union can recognize the guarantees that the United States must obtain before disclosing atomic energy secrets, or the Soviet Union attaches too much importance to its sovereignty, is too afraid of foreign supervision, and is too confident that the United States will never use atomic bombs against it in the foreseeable future, thereby hindering all necessary actions. The first test will be at the Atomic Energy Commission meeting in a few weeks. At the same time, the pessimism deeply hidden at the opening of the New York Conference has changed to hope, although it is still inevitably subject to limitations.

US-Soviet Signature

### Agreement to Repatriate Japanese People Stipulates That 50,000 People Will Be Sent to Soviet Territory Each Month, the Total Number Being About 1.5 Million

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] MacArthur's headquarters today signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to return 50,000 Japanese people from the Soviet Union each month. There are currently 1.5 million Japanese people in the Soviet occupation zone.

MacArthur's headquarters established a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union last month to repatriate Japanese people from Siberia, Dalian, and Korea. So far, 17,000 people have returned home. Repatriated Japanese people are only allowed to carry personal belongings permitted by customs regulations, not exceeding 100 kilograms per person.

The Allied occupation authorities should also encourage trade unions to participate in democratization plans and various measures to achieve occupation goals, such as eliminating warlords and financial cliques. U.S. officials said this expands the U.S. government's previous instructions to MacArthur, but there is no major discrepancy with U.S. policy. The U.S.'s previous instructions to MacArthur did not mention trade union political activities, but in accordance with civil rights, Japanese trade unions can engage in political activities. The Far East Commission also stated that the occupying authorities may only prohibit strikes when they directly hinder the goals of the occupation or are otherwise necessary. Employers may not refuse to give work to trade union members, and employers may not participate in the organization and actions of trade unions.

### Municipal Construction Donation: Intended for Long-Term Collection Will be Proposed at the Municipal Affairs Meeting This Morning

[This newspaper] The municipal construction donation currently collected in the city is temporary in nature. The First Senate decided in the meeting that if the city's financial situation improves in the next year, it must find other ways to increase revenue and abolish the municipal construction donation. According to reporters' investigations with relevant parties: the Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the city's economic situation may not be sufficient for a while, so it intends to include the municipal construction donation in the special tax revenue item in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, so that it can be collected for a long time to maintain municipal administration. It is heard that the Finance Bureau will put forward this proposal at this morning's municipal affairs meeting. After it is passed, it will be submitted to the Second Municipal Senate for deliberation.

According to reliable information: Because a large amount of business tax has been leaked recently, the Finance Bureau intends to uniformly print invoices and order all stores in the city to adopt them. It is heard that the Finance Bureau will also put forward this method at this morning's municipal affairs meeting. If this new facility can be passed, tax revenue can increase by a huge amount.

Difficult Birth of City Government Budget

[This newspaper] The problem of preparing the city government's budget for the second half of the year was originally scheduled to be finally decided at this morning's municipal affairs meeting.

### Qian Tianhe Returns to Shanghai from the United States, Talks About the World Food Bureau, I Also Welcome the Wheat Conference

Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Qian Tianhe was sent abroad in mid-May this year to attend the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Conference, the Emergency Food Conference held in Washington on May 19, and the Second Annual Meeting held in Denmark on September 2. Afterwards, he traveled all over Europe and the United States to investigate post-war production and recovery. Qian returned to Shanghai by plane from the United States the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he met with reporters at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Talking about his trip and feelings, he said: When I arrived in London, I met with John Boyd Orr, the director-general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Orr immediately urged our country's directors to set off early to attend the meeting. When I returned to Washington, I happened to be invited by the United Nations Agriculture Organization to hold a meeting of representatives from various countries to discuss the establishment of the World Food Bureau. The significance of the establishment of the bureau is that world food-producing countries can be divided into two types: surplus and insufficient. The former believes that although there is a general shortage of supply at present, world food may have a surplus trend in two or three years. At that time, food prices will fall and become competitive factors. With this organization, it can prevent catastrophic drops in food prices. At the same time, the bureau helps food-deficient countries to produce food and improve the nutritional level of their people. If there is a world food surplus, the bureau allocates funds to purchase and store grain, and when food prices rise, it sells the stored grain to suppress prices. This can stabilize food prices without the drawbacks of soaring and plummeting. Food-deficient countries can also receive continuous assistance without fear of famine. Its intention is good and appeals to many grain-producing countries. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina are not interested in this because they believe that the scope of the above organization is too broad and they would rather organize each grain individually because they believe it is more appropriate. For example, the World Wheat Conference was recently held in Washington. The method is for member countries to jointly agree on the highest and lowest market prices of world wheat in the next four years. Once the agreement is established, the purchase and sale of world wheat in these four years shall not exceed the range of the highest and lowest prices, so that exporting countries can obtain sales targets when wheat is surplus in the future, and food-deficient countries will not be short of food. And the organization of the association is simple and easy to achieve results. Therefore, the above-mentioned grain exporting countries and major grain importing countries attach more importance to this organization than the former, and even oppose the organization of the World Food greed. However, from the perspective of our country, we welcome the wheat conference and also place great hopes on the establishment of the World Food Bureau, because the establishment of the bureau will greatly help our country's entire agricultural construction.

It is also reported that Vice Minister Qian is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Jinjing at 1 pm today to report to the authorities.

### Sino-American Hospital Labor Strike: Hospital Director Issues Statement on Events; Work Stoppage Occurs; Dispute Remains Unresolved

[Our Report] The Sino-American Hospital, managed by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, was returned to Tongji University this autumn upon the personal order of Chairman Chiang. Subsequently, Tongji University and the Sino-American Hospital authorities held discussions and signed an agreement on November 28 to commence the takeover. As the takeover was underway, the hospital's workers presented five demands to the hospital administration and initiated a full-scale work slowdown on the 16th of this month. The hospital director, Shen Xianshu, held a press conference yesterday to report on the takeover process and the events of the recent work slowdown. The content of his statement is as follows: After Chairman Chiang personally ordered the return of the Sino-American Hospital to Tongji University, the hospital, previously managed by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, was converted into an affiliated hospital of Tongji University. However, at the inception of the Sino-American Hospital, the Sino-American Cooperative Organization invested a substantial amount of capital in renovations and remodeling. Therefore, after this takeover, all outstanding payments and bank overdrafts are to be the responsibility of Tongji University. The existing physicians at the hospital will have their contracts expire in June of next year. To facilitate clinical practice for students of Tongji University, the university intends to appoint professors and lecturers from the school as physicians at the hospital. The existing physicians will be given three months' salary as severance pay upon termination of their contracts. Furthermore, the takeover of a hospital is different from the takeover of ordinary institutions. Normal services must be maintained for patients in the hospital. Moreover, after this hospital reorganization, the hospital has lost its original independence, and all financial arrangements and personnel changes must be submitted to Tongji University for approval before implementation. It was at this juncture that the workers presented five demands to the hospital administration: (1) Adjust wages to provide a base salary of 32 yuan according to the cost of living index. (2) Guarantee workers' livelihoods and prevent unwarranted dismissals. (3) Provide winter uniforms. (4) Improve food and lodging. (5) Provide double pay at the end of the year. The hospital administration considered that the workers' demands had not been presented through proper channels and informed the workers that they should send official representatives to negotiate. The submitted demands could then be forwarded to Tongji University for approval or denial. After receiving this response, the workers did not send representatives but instead initiated a work slowdown on the 16th, shutting down the elevators, refusing to deliver meals to patients, and posting slogans on the walls and hospital vehicles. They also attempted to drive the vehicles out of the hospital. The hospital administration then locked the hospital gates, prohibiting entry and exit. During the work slowdown, the hospital received letters from thirteen hospitals, including Tongde, Nanyang, and Shanghai Epidemic Hospitals, urging that the workers' demands be approved so that the labor unrest could be resolved quickly to prevent similar incidents from affecting other hospitals. The hospital administration responded that since the Sino-American Hospital was now an affiliated hospital of Tongji University, everything had to await approval from Tongji University. Moreover, the workers' compensation at the hospital, totaling 120,000 yuan, including meals and lodging, was already generous compared to other hospitals. Compared to the employees of Tongji University, the difference was even greater. Therefore, the workers' demands would have to wait until the president of Tongji University returned to Shanghai before a decision could be made.

Yesterday, a request was made to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.

According to the Dagong News Agency, the labor unrest at the Sino-American Hospital has been ongoing for four days without resolution. After a brief work stoppage on the morning of the 16th, work resumed. However, the hospital administration has yet to respond to the four demands made by the 118 employees. On the morning of the 16th, the employees' union sent four representatives to see Director Shen to request a response, but the director refused to meet with them. Instead, the administrative director, Wu Songmao, conveyed a verbal response, stating that the first demand to raise the base salary to 32 yuan could not be met because Tongji University employees only received 66,000 yuan, while Sino-American Hospital employees already received 120,000 yuan. Regarding the second demand to improve food and lodging, the previous director, Ding Boxiong, had promised the employees to find a way to improve the situation this winter. However, due to the reorganization, the demand was resubmitted to the new director. The hospital administration's response was that there was not enough space, so the demand could not be met. Regarding the food, it might be possible to improve it through personal connections. Regarding the first demand to provide winter uniforms, it could not be done due to financial constraints. The fourth demand for job security could be met. At the time, all the employees felt that this was still unsatisfactory, so they briefly went on strike. However, after the police department sent personnel to explain that they should consider the patients, they resumed work and continued negotiations. Yesterday, the employees submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. As of last night, the issue remained unresolved. It is reported that this morning, representatives from all seventeen hospitals in the city have decided to petition the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Representative of Private Newspapers Heads to Beijing Yesterday

### Still Many Japanese Prisoners of War in Shanghai
### Not Only Cannot They All Be Sent Back Home, but a Batch Has Arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong

[Our Report] As of recently, there are reportedly still over seven hundred Japanese prisoners of war housed at the Jiangwan National Defense Ministry's Prisoner of War Management Office. The office originally planned to complete their repatriation by the end of the year, but due to time-consuming investigations and a lack of ships, as well as continuous arrivals from various parts of the country, the original plan could not be completed. Yesterday, another 150 prisoners of war were escorted to Shanghai from Guangzhou.

Furthermore, the Prisoner of War Management Office previously believed that many of the Japanese residents remaining in the city had no need to stay and some even changed their names with ulterior motives. Therefore, it began an investigation and discovered over thirty people who have already been repatriated. As for the Japanese residents currently remaining in Shanghai, it is reported that they all hold approved employment certificates from various agencies recognized by the Executive Yuan. Although many of them currently do not have work to do, the Prisoner of War Management Office is not in a position to repatriate them. As for the total number of Japanese residents, according to the household registration investigation by the security authorities, there are a total of 1,796 people, including 739 employed, 689 unemployed (family members, etc.), 73 unemployed, and 295 under the age of twelve.

[Further News] According to a responsible official of the municipal government, the repatriation of the second batch of German residents will be delayed until mid-February of next year.

### Defendant in Ohad Bureau Case Presents Letter from U.S. Ambassador as Evidence
### Mueller Denies Engaging in Intelligence Work

[Our Report] Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., the U.S. military court continued the trial of the Ohad Bureau case. The defense attorney for the defendant Heisch presented a letter from U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, to the Chinese authorities responsible for the repatriation of German residents. The letter stated that when he was serving as the president of Yenching University, he had hired Heisch as a library consultant and requested that he be exempted from repatriation. The defense attorney further stated that the Mongolian expert, Lattimore, had also entrusted Heisch to be his agent for purchasing Mongolian goods.

Another defendant being tried yesterday was Dr. Mueller, the 61-year-old head of the German news agency in Beiping. He denied that his news agency had any relationship with the Ohad Bureau and claimed that he had never engaged in any intelligence work before or after the German surrender. He dissolved his organization immediately after the German surrender and established another news agency, but all news released was subject to censorship by the then-puppet government.

### Former Police Officers of the Public Concession Request Prompt Payment of Pension
### Xue Zhiliang and Others Report on Progress

[Our Report] The 4,615 former police officers of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the former Public Concession, regarding the matter of pension savings, have specifically submitted a request to the Liquidation Committee for Official Assets and Official Debt of the Former Public Concession of Shanghai and the French Concession, requesting prompt allocation of funds to maintain their livelihoods. They also elected representatives to host a press conference yesterday afternoon. Xue Zhiliang, the former assistant commissioner of the police department, reported on the progress, stating: The employees formerly serving in the police department of the Municipal Council were required by the council in 1931 to contribute 5% of their annual salary. Those who had served for 20 years or more would receive a retirement payment equivalent to one year's salary upon retirement. In 1942, the pension was changed to a savings plan, stipulating that those with a base salary of 35 or more would contribute 15% of their annual salary, with 10% contributed by the council and 5% deducted from their salary. Later, in view of the fluctuating economic situation, in order to safeguard the rights of the savings recipients, it was further stipulated that the amount would be calculated with an additional percentage, depending on the cost of living when the savings were paid out. When the Japanese invaded the concession, the customs were occupied, and the pension savings were ignored. By the time the British and Americans were detained in internment camps in February 1943, the accumulated savings totaled 5 million legal tender. With the victory of the Resistance War and the recovery of the concession, the employment relationship with the Municipal Council also ceased. Due to their difficult living conditions, these pension savings, accumulated from years of hard work, should be distributed. Therefore, colleagues in Shanghai and those reachable by mail from other cities were gathered, and a list of 4,615 names was compiled and sent to the Provisional Office of the former Municipal Council for verification and transfer to the relevant authorities for processing. It is estimated that there are about 500-600 other employees who have not registered. However, since the list was submitted, there has been no news. Until last month, it was learned that the Executive Yuan had established the Liquidation Committee for Official Assets and Official Debt of the Former Public Concession of Shanghai and the French Concession. A request was submitted to the committee to distribute the pension savings to the employees and to maintain the original regulations of the former Municipal Council, increasing the payment according to the rising cost of living.

### Land Bureau Simplifies Land Transfer Registration Procedures

[Our Report] Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, recognizing that land transactions in the city are frequent and that the time-consuming process of right-of-way transfer registration greatly affects land transactions and finance, has proposed a simplified procedure for land right-of-way transfer registration. For land right-of-way transfers, except in cases of doubt, dispute, or division/merger requiring measurement and mapping, a designated reviewer will verify the seal and signature and, if correct, instruct the applicant to pay the fee, issue a receipt, and return the original document with an endorsement and seal. This procedure can be completed within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the responsible person will fill out a form daily to notify the relevant units to complete other internal administrative procedures. The registration fee is only one-thousandth of the land value. This simplified procedure is even simpler than the deed transfer procedure during the concession era, and the fees are even lower.

### Relief for Impoverished People: Methods to Be Determined; Distribution of Goods to Be the Principle

Currently, it has provided shelter for the destitute and homeless on the streets at the Tongzhou Road shelter. There are two other efforts currently underway: (1) relief for impoverished people, and (2) relief for the poor. The methods have already been drafted and will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the committee for decision tomorrow, after which they will be announced. According to reporter inquiries, the methods for relieving impoverished people are roughly as follows: (A) Scope of impoverished people: (1) families of soldiers in the Anti-Japanese War and families of martyred comrades, (2) families with five or more members and no fixed income, and (3) widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless with young children are all eligible to apply for relief. (B) Relief measures: According to their impoverished condition, they will be divided into three categories: A, B, and C. The principle is to distribute goods. Category A will receive goods worth 150,000 yuan, Category B will receive goods worth 100,000 yuan, and Category C will receive goods worth 50,000 yuan, consisting of flour, white rice, or soybean powder. (C) Application procedure: To benefit those receiving relief, the procedure will be extremely simple. Applicants only need to fill out an application form and have it certified by the local baojia head, then submit it to the Winter Relief Committee. The committee will then forward it to the district office for review before issuing the relief goods. Regarding the relief for the poor, it will be carried out in five districts: Xujiahui, Caojiadu, Hongkou, and Zhabei. The principle is also to distribute goods. It is reported that each person will receive one or one and a half catties of flour per day. The distribution procedure will involve preliminary investigations, followed by entrusting private charitable organizations to handle the distribution.

### Director of Jiangsu Provincial Information Office, Zhang Yulin, Discusses Recent Situation

Chairman Wang Maogong will be stationed in Huaiyin and will travel to the recovered counties for inspection to appease refugees and stabilize the people's hearts. In the future, the province will focus its efforts on northern Jiangsu while not neglecting southern Jiangsu. Currently, it is focusing on "restoring order and establishing security," using politics in conjunction with military affairs to actively carry out pacification work. Appropriate measures have been established for the facilities of education, the organization of land administration, and the promotion of health administration in northern Jiangsu, which will be implemented in order. The military and civilian highways throughout the province are also being actively expanded. The collection of land taxes in kind is going well. The county magistrate examination is scheduled to be held on the 20th, and there are many enthusiastic candidates. Chairman Wang has recently transferred from Huaiyin to Beijing to personally preside over the examination. As for the local security situation, it is much better than in the past, but the most difficult problem is the imbalance between revenue and expenditure in finance. The provincial and county local budgets are being actively compiled. In general, the politics of Jiangsu Province is gradually getting on the right track.

### Protecting Domestic Cement Industry to Prevent Dumping of Foreign Goods: Ministry of Economic Affairs Has Taken Effective Measures

[Report from our newspaper] During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's cement industry was forcibly occupied and destroyed by the enemy, resulting in severe losses. After the victory, due to factors such as lack of capital, high costs, transportation difficulties, and dumping of foreign goods, production and sales fell into difficulties. A month ago, the China Cement Industry Federation repeatedly appealed to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and other agencies for relief. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, after investigating the details, has taken effective measures to protect the domestic cement industry. The detailed methods are as follows: (1) Requesting the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all agencies to use domestic cement for all construction needs and to prohibit the purchase of foreign goods. (2) Consulting the Ministry of Transportation to provide special assistance and improvements for the transportation and sales of domestic cement. (3) For situations such as worker absenteeism, strikes, and interference with factory management rights, the competent authorities will strictly prohibit them. Workers' base salaries shall not be arbitrarily increased without the approval of the competent authority. (4) In order to prevent the dumping of foreign goods, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the National Tariff Commission to consider increasing and modifying the import tariff rate for cement. (5) The Coal Committee will continue to allocate the coal needed by the cement industry at the original price to reduce costs. (6) The loans needed by the cement industry can be applied for from the nearest branch of the Four Banks Joint Office in accordance with the revised investment and loan guidelines of the Joint Treasury.

Import of Foreign Goods · Request for Prohibition

If these measures can be effectively implemented, the situation of the cement industry will naturally be greatly improved. However, because the industry believes that the dumping of foreign goods is the most serious problem, it has further applied to the Temporary Import Management Committee to prohibit the import of foreign cement, because the quality of domestic cement has always been no less than that of foreign goods, and it is estimated that the current production capacity of cement factories across the country can reach more than 21 million barrels per year, which is more than enough to meet all domestic needs. In addition, the Goods Tax Bureau stipulates that a tax stamp must be affixed to each bag of cement sold domestically, which is difficult to implement. The industry association has repeatedly telegraphed the Tax Administration to request exemption from stamping, and it is now learned that the legislative bill has been passed.

Cement Factories · Ordering New Machines

According to the current situation, except for the Shanghai Cement Company, which has concentrated on suspension of work, the remaining Qixin Yanghui Company, China Cement Company, Huaxin Cement Company, North China Cement Company, Xicun Cement Factory, Taiyuan Cement Factory, Sichuan Cement Company, and the Taiwan Cement Company established by the Resources Committee after taking over enemy property, as well as the cement factories in the nine northeastern provinces, are all actively seeking development. Huaxin Cement Factory plans to order the latest machinery with 60 billion yuan of national currency, and the Jiangnan Cement Company in Nanjing also plans to order the latest machinery with US$1.62 million.

It is also learned that in recent months, the selling price of domestic cement has also increased slightly due to increased costs. As for American cement, imports have been less due to the seamen's strike, but 310,000 bags have been shipped after the labor dispute was resolved and have now arrived outside Wusongkou and will soon be imported.

### Sales Department No. 3 of Public and Education Personnel Distribution Office Opens Tomorrow

Blankets at 45,500 yuan

In order to improve the distribution business and facilitate the purchase of goods by public and education personnel, the Shanghai Public and Education Personnel Goods Distribution Office has specially established the No. 1 Sales Department at No. 200 Fuzhou Road, specializing in the sale of various daily necessities supplied by the Materials Supply Bureau. The No. 2 Sales Department is located at No. 355 Zha Pu Road, and the No. 3 Sales Department is located at No. 1-10 Jiangxi Road in the Duchen Hotel, selling general retail daily necessities. All are scheduled to open for business tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the office: public and education personnel who hold a purchase permit must first go to each sales department with the purchase permit to obtain a sales department distribution registration form for transactions. As for blankets, the No. 1 Sales Department will directly distribute them. Public and education personnel can bring the purchase permit and the "Zhou" character purchase ticket (the number must be filled in and the seal affixed on the back of the ticket) to purchase. The price is set at 45,500 yuan per piece, and they will be sold in order until they are sold out.

### Private Farms Can Apply for Low-Interest Loans After Registration

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Wei Yuxu, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters: The Social Affairs Bureau previously announced a deadline for the registration of private farms in the city. Later, because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry revised the previously promulgated Farm Registration Regulations, the Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the order, drafted a Farm Registration Instructions and printed all the forms separately. It is stipulated that from New Year's Day to the end of January next year, it will be the registration period for established private farms, and no supplementary registrations will be accepted after this period. For private farms themselves, there are two major benefits after registration: (1) They can apply for low-interest loans from the China Farmers Bank, with an interest rate of only 4%, and the time limit depends on the nature of the farm. (2) They can obtain technical guidance and material assistance from the government. For example, the Social Affairs Bureau has been allocated American vegetable seeds, but because the farms are not registered, they cannot be distributed. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been allocated American insecticide equipment, which is of great benefit to the prevention of insect pests on farms. Currently, operating a farm is quite profitable. For example, planting vegetables, cultivating flowers, and raising livestock are all profitable. However, there are also two prerequisites: one is that whether you are planting flowers or raising chickens, you must choose good varieties, as there is not much demand for ordinary ones. The second is that the operation of the farm must be based on modern management, and this is also a prerequisite for borrowing from the China Farmers Bank.

He was tried at the High Court yesterday morning. After questioning, the court ordered a retrial at a later date.

[Another Report] Wang Jinfa, who was accused of keeping the enemy's East Asia Automobile Company's property, was previously sentenced to three years in prison. The defendant refused to accept the sentence and applied for a retrial. The Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial. Yesterday afternoon, Zhou Anbang, the accuser, was first summoned to testify at the High Court, followed by the defendant, who claimed that the plaintiff, Zhou Anbang, had another Victory Automobile Company that was not doing well and that he was falsely accused out of jealousy. Later, Gu Sanbao, a plainclothes policeman from the police station, testified that the shops in Pudong had jointly guaranteed Wang Jinfa, and that Wang was indeed a nominal secret agent. Finally, Mr. Weng, who had worked underground in a military organization, testified that Wang Jinfa had used his car to transport firearms and radio equipment for the organization. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the retrial. The defendant was returned to custody.

Around 10 o'clock, it hovered around 3.37 million. Later, speculative funds from the securities sector came to hype it up again. The supply of funds temporarily stopped, and it broke through 3.4 million, rising again to 3.43 million before it hovered under the supply of the Central Bank.

### Large Investors Took the Opportunity to Sell; China Stocks Wanted to Rise But Stopped

China stocks wanted to rise again yesterday, but stopped. When the high price of American Asia reached the daily limit, large investors took the opportunity to sell, so the market on the table suddenly loosened, and the market situation was doubled in confusion. The opening in the morning was still flat. Although No. 212 and others came to buy after the opening, No. 180, No. 105, No. 71, No. 160, No. 197, No. 215, No. 186 and others successively offered for sale, and gradually went downstream.

There were many ups and downs in the middle, but the thin code was loose, and it was easy to fall and difficult to rise. No. 76, No. 198, No. 106, and No. 36 repeatedly sold out. At noon, it became tired again, but the asking price rose after closing. As a result, Deyong Yarn, Xinnuo, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Huafeng all fell, Qin Xing and American Asia rose slightly, and the cold stock matches fell by 10%. The rest rose and fell differently. The interbank Deyong Yarn, Xinnuo, and Xinguang Huafeng fell slightly, and American Asia rose slightly. In the afternoon, continuing the momentum after the previous closing, the market immediately competed to buy, opening more than ten yuan higher.

No. 198, No. 38, No. 89, and No. 177 sold from time to time, and No. 89 and No. 162 even sold Deyong Yarn on the spot. After struggling until 3 o'clock, it began to feel sluggish and once fell back to the closing price at noon.

As a result, Deyong Yarn, American Asia, and Qin Xing rose slightly from the previous closing, Xinnuo and Jingfu were flat, Xinguang Huafeng fell slightly, the cold stock matches fell by 10%, and the underwear Xin Asia rose by about 10%.

### Silk Prices Continued to Rise

The silk market was active, and people were excited. Holders all looked high and raised prices, so yesterday's D-grade level was 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Ordinary silk also rose accordingly. The dry warp market was still stable yesterday, staying at the original level. The rayon market fell yesterday because there was more supply than demand in the market. No. 120 Youguang Laozhuang Tianqiao was sold for 3.95 million yuan, which caused the new equipment to be reduced by 50,000 yuan. Dongyang brand was 3.38 million yuan, 50,000 yuan less than the previous day. Gaoshan brand was 350,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan less than the previous day. The remaining half yuan and No. 150 Youguang were firm in price due to the scarcity of goods. Among the silk goods, the Ge Shibi crepe was the most popular, with transactions at 8,400 yuan. The quilt cover was still asking for 850,000 yuan, but there was a lack of buyers. Sheng goods also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per piece yesterday.

### New Banking Law to Be Announced in Spring

It was previously reported that the government would announce the new banking regulations in January 36. It is learned that the Legislative Yuan has not yet completed the整理手續 of the draft law.

The date of announcement will be in the spring.

### Tea Market Weak Externally and Strong Internally

In the foreign tea market, Chen Qimen's market continued to be quiet, but Ping Shui's top-grade Chen Zhucha was in great demand by export firms, especially Wu Chang Tea Company, which did not refuse anyone. Unfortunately, the inventory in the market was very scarce, so the selling price was extremely firm. It is also learned that Wang Yutai Tea Company is also searching for fried green tea to reproduce export tea.

### Sales Tax on Native Cloth Exempted from Next Year

In order to encourage the production of native cloth, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that from January 36, the sales tax on native cloth will be exempted, except for sales merchants.

### Only Retail Sales of Woolen Cloth

Recently, the woolen cloth market has been suffering from high interest rates. Customers and ports have continued to close down and account for facts. In addition, the end of the lunar year is approaching in the blink of an eye. Both buyers and sellers have become wary. At the same time, imported goods are arriving in Shanghai one after another, and people's hearts are therefore tired. All standards have always been flat and tired. There are only sporadic sales in the market and general wholesale houses. Except for American Melton goods, there are very few original boxes of whole pieces of business.

### Social Affairs Bureau and Brunner Mond Are in Negotiations to Stabilize the Market Price of Caustic Soda

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Steer, the business manager of Brunner Mond, went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to discuss the issue of selling off stored alkali and stabilizing market prices with Section Chief Zhao of the Economic Administration Department. Regarding the various inquiries from the Social Affairs Bureau, the company plans to submit a formal written reply next Monday. According to the British side's opinion, Brunner Mond does not occupy a pivotal position in the supply of caustic soda in this city. According to the statistics it has collected, within this year, Brunner Mond imported 3,500 tons, Hong Kong imported 1,196 tons, the Philippines shipped 1,518 tons, and the United States shipped 3,688 tons. Therefore, Brunner Mond's supply only accounts for slightly more than one-third. As for the trend of chemical raw material prices, relevant people pointed out that the current market price fluctuations are due to insufficient supply, and the various restrictions on import trade are also related to this. For example, a batch of chemical raw materials arrived at the port nearly a month ago, but because the application for import has not been approved, it has not been able to be declared and unloaded. However, the increase in the price of chemical raw materials has its own limit, otherwise substitutes will be forced to be used. For example, in terms of caustic soda, pure alkali can replace it.

### Sharp Rise in Red Alum and Sodium Silicate

Although the United States previously banned the export of red alum, the inventory in this city is very thick, so the price has not fluctuated for half a year. Now that the stocks of potassium red alum and sodium red alum have become thin, and red alum is an indispensable main raw material for manufacturing aniline oil, and aniline oil has not been imported for a long time, it is currently relying entirely on domestic products for supply. In addition, dyeing factories have been searching for it recently, so red alum is extraordinarily popular, and the prices of potassium red alum and sodium red alum have also risen accordingly. The price of potassium red alum has risen from 2,400 yuan per pound to 4,700 yuan, and the price of sodium red alum has risen from 800 yuan per pound to 4,200 yuan. In addition, sodium silicate (also known as sodium silicate) has been strongly sought after by soap factories recently, and the price per pound has risen from 140 yuan to 350 yuan. There is no stock available. It is found that sodium silicate is manufactured by Dahua and other factories in this city. In the past, due to the import of American goods, the quality was good and the price was low, and the price could not maintain the cost. (It is found that the cost of domestic sodium silicate is 450 yuan per pound, while American goods are only 150 yuan), it has long been discontinued, and the stock of American goods has been emptied. Various parties are making great efforts to purchase it, so the rising trend is very unstoppable.

### Sharp Rise in Foreign Pine

In the timber market, foreign pine rose because Fangzi had a lot of actual sales and the inventory was also thin. When gold banknotes rose, it took advantage of the opportunity, and the market price has exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark. The prices of other timbers are also firm.

### Rice Market Initially Rises, Then Falls Back; Oil Cakes and Coarse Grains Show Strength

Over 9,000 stones of rice arrived from both the north and south, with brisk sales in the morning market. However, activity slowed down in the afternoon, resulting in an initial rise followed by a pullback. Consequently, both northern and southern japonica rice saw prices increase by 1,000 yuan per shi (unit of measure). White rice for congee (thin rice porridge) was selling well, continuing to rise by 2,000 yuan. Indica rice remained stable. Wheat flour saw sluggish sales for clear stock but acceptable demand for bean products, and prices remained firm, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Bran also increased by 100 yuan. Soybeans continued to trend flat and weak, with sluggish sales in other areas and little interest from oil mills. Green beans from Southeast Asia were scarce, keeping the market firm. Black-eyed peas for oil extraction continued to advance, rising another 1,000 yuan. High-quality red beans were in demand on the local market, rising slightly by 300 to 400 yuan, while medium and lower grades remained flat. Corn from Qingdao continued to be in demand, with arrivals failing to keep pace with sales, pushing prices gradually higher, adding another 1,000+ yuan. Soybean cakes for Southeast Asia were fully booked, resulting in a market slowdown, pulling prices back down by 100 yuan. Wheat supplies were running low, resulting in a brisk market, pushing prices up by 1,000 yuan. The oil market saw improved sales, with raw oil rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil also increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame oil saw some gains. However, factories were eager to sell off refined oil, pulling prices back down by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

### Yarn Market Plummets as Bundled Goods are Sold at a Loss

Yesterday, the yarn market plummeted. Due to sluggish inland sales and weak prices, buyers were largely inactive. Furthermore, the Yarn Control Committee's allocation of yarn to replica factories and retailers was being sold off at discounted prices in large quantities on the market, resulting in an oversupply of goods and weak sentiment. 20-count Shuang Ma brand (Double Horse Brand) cotton bales were priced at only 2 million yuan, while Jin Cheng brand was only 2.04 to 2.05 million yuan, down 50,000 to 100,000 yuan from the previous day. The previously scarce 42-count, two-ply Qian (Money) brand was also being sold off privately by weaving factories that had received allocations, resulting in lower prices, with the already limited supply dropping by over 100,000 yuan.

### Yarn Control Committee Exchanges Ideas; New Plan Not Yet Finalized

[Report from our newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee convened a regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room, adjourning at approximately 6:00 PM. During the meeting, members exchanged detailed views on the six-point plan for handling cotton yarn provided by the government (the three most important points were published in yesterday's edition of this newspaper). According to Wu Guozhen, the concurrently serving Chairman, after the meeting, no definitive conclusions were reached. While some points of agreement were reached in principle, technical details and specifics still need to be studied. The final decision will be submitted to President Song for approval before it can be implemented.

It is also learned that the government's proposed six-point plan was the result of extensive discussions and consultations between President Song and relevant parties, gathering diverse opinions. The six-point plan is said to be a compromise from President Song's initial proposal.

### Sugar Prices Remain Firm

Yesterday, sugar prices remained firm due to optimistic sentiment and increased buying. Despite the company's auction period, the rising trend did not weaken. However, the auction price remained unchanged. The guild's spot price for medium-grade white sugar was 147,000 yuan, up over 2,000 yuan. Raw sugar was at 127,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Guang Bang's Runde Qing also rebounded by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, to a high of 97,000 to 98,000 yuan, with the final price being 94,000 to 96,000 yuan. Thin-sliced Qing was at 85,000 to 86,000 yuan, with over a thousand transactions. Xinghua Bang's Kai Gong powdered white sugar was at 148,000 to 155,000 yuan, with the ordinary grade at 137,000 to 138,000 yuan, with an increase of nearly 10,000 yuan. Ming Jing red sugar was at 145,000 to 142,000 to 143,000 yuan, with 140,000 yuan, with over two thousand basket transactions. Diao Qing was sporadically offered at 100,500 yuan, up 5,000 yuan.

### Sharp Increase in Foreign Paper Prices

Foreign paper prices have risen sharply in the past week, with an average increase of over 30%. Transparent paper, in particular, has nearly doubled in price. This is due to strong demand from cigarette factories. This type of paper is considered a luxury item, and imports are difficult, making the price increase seem unstoppable.

### Import/Export Business Group Studies Allocation of Import Goods

The city's Import and Export Business Association has divided into forty subgroups to discuss issues such as import quotas. These subgroups have been conducting individual studies since the beginning of this week, meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association at 3:00 PM each afternoon. It is reported that these subgroup meetings will take a month to complete. The plan is to submit a written report on all the difficult issues arising from each meeting to the Import/Export Control Committee for assistance.

### Coal Prices Remain High

Coal market prices for various types of bituminous coal remain high, but supplies are slow to move. Lump coal from Jiaozuo is selling well, and market sentiment is firm. Raw materials for coal briquettes have arrived, and factories will receive their allocations. Market conditions are expected to ease, but previous market trends do not support price reductions. Firewood and charcoal are also priced high, resulting in sluggish sales for shops. Market prices are said to be high.

### List of Approved Import Merchants to be Released Next Week

Since the establishment of the Import/Export Control Committee, over 3,500 applications from import businesses have been received. The approval and release of the list could have occurred sooner, but many applicants failed to fill out the application forms according to the required format, causing delays. The full list is expected to be released next week. It is also reported that there are no restrictions on import applications. Both established and newly formed businesses can apply, but the scope of the application must comply with regulations.

### Soap, Candles, and Matches Reach Unprecedented High Prices

Due to a shortage of raw materials for the manufacturing of soap, candles, and matches, production has declined sharply. Manufacturers have limited supplies for sale, and consumers are forced to search for goods on the market. This imbalance between supply and demand, coupled with hoarding, has caused market prices to surge. Yesterday, all grades of soap reached unprecedented high prices. Gu Ben soap increased by 11,000 yuan, Arrow Knife soap increased by 8,000 yuan, and Beautiful matches soared by 100,000 yuan, reaching a peak of 730,000 yuan. Candles also generally increased in price.

### Bank of Japan to Aid Textile Industry Recovery

One-fifth of the requested amount is to be allocated for the production of fishing nets.

### Difficulties in Selling National Goods to Southeast Asia

[Report from our newspaper] Trade between China and Southeast Asia has made no progress in recent months. From the perspective of exports, the biggest problem is the high cost of national goods and the low purchasing power in the local market. As a result, many exporters have returned empty-handed. At the same time, the lack of transportation further hinders the sale of national goods to Southeast Asia. From the perspective of imports, there were previously many imports of rubber, coconut oil, and other goods. However, since the announcement of the import permit system, the situation has changed significantly. Among Southeast Asian imports, most of the items listed in the import goods list are in the second or third grade. Applying for import permits is time-consuming, and the volume of imports has been significantly affected. The fundamental solution is to improve production efficiency to reduce the cost of national goods. The short-term solution is to simplify procedures to facilitate imports. In addition, seeking the assistance of overseas Chinese is also a matter of urgency.

### Scarce Steel Rebar Commands High Prices

Steel rebar is widely used in this city. Due to the scarcity of foreign supplies, prices have been rising steadily in recent days.

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Since the reorganization of the Ministry of Education, with the establishment of the Secondary Education and National Education Departments, normal schools are now under the jurisdiction of the Secondary Education Department, and normal universities still belong to higher education.

### Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: Fudan Ties Global; The Result is a 2-2 Draw

The referee was Wang Nanzhen, and the linesmen were Chen Jingchu and Chu Jianhong. Fudan team captain Qian Changrong was absent. Wang Hesheng was moved forward, leaving a gap in the rear defense. In addition, the biting cold wind made the attack and defense less intense. The result was a 2-2 draw with Global.

Match Report

The course of the match was as follows: At the sound of the whistle, the competition began. Fudan launched frequent attacks. In the third minute, center forward Wang Dingqiu (who is a currently serving air force member), a veteran of the air force, broke through the Global defense line with the ball and shot fiercely. The ball grazed the post and bounced back. Fan Sijie caught up and scored, opening the scoring. Global center forward Wang Fushan was enraged and equalized the score. The first half ended 1-1.

Changing sides and fighting again, Fudan's Wang Hesheng was transferred to the left inner wing, making the rear defense even more vulnerable. Global's Wang Yishan took advantage of this and scored a goal, putting Global in the lead 2-1. Seeing the situation worsen, Fudan intensified its attack. However, Global defender Zhu Chengfu defended very strictly, repeatedly turning danger into safety. In the 71st minute, Wang Hesheng sent a high ball, Wang Dingqiu passed left, and Fan Sijie took the opportunity to score again. The two sides then entered a chaotic battle, with no further goals scored. The final score was 2-2. The lineups of the two sides were as follows:

### The Ching Pak Team's Final Battle in Hong Kong: Football Team Wins, Basketball Team Loses

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] On the 16th, the Ching Pak football team defeated the Hong Kong All-Stars team by one goal, completing their tour in Hong Kong. Ching Pak's victory was truly a stroke of luck. After half a month of matches in Hong Kong, this last game found the Ching Pak players exhausted. Some had already left, and others were injured, almost leading to a weakened team. In the end, they brought in the veteran Fuchs from the St. Francis team, who reluctantly played. Fortunately, the defense line remained strong, and Qin Biga seemed increasingly energetic, ultimately defeating the Hong Kong All-Stars.

Sparse Crowd on Jia Mountain

Hong Kong and Chinese fans, seeing that Ching Pak's skills were "nothing more than this," were not as enthusiastic as before. Yesterday, Jia Mountain was noticeably deserted. The Ching Pak team will take a car to the province this morning, preparing for two matches, one against the city police and one against the Strong China team. They plan to return to Hong Kong in 20 days, at which time there may be another Shanghai All-Stars vs. Hong Kong All-Stars match. However, due to the reduced interest of fans, it is still difficult to predict whether that game will actually take place.

Basketball Spectators are Sick of It

In basketball, Ching Pak was defeated by the Hong Kong All-Stars. On the 15th, the Hong Kong All-Stars beat Ching Pak 32-23. On the day Ching Pak barely defeated the Zhili, the basketball champion of Hong Kong and China, by one point, experienced spectators predicted Ching Pak would face an inevitable final misfortune. Looking at these nine Hong Kong-Shanghai football and basketball matches, we cannot help but lament the lack of sporting talent in our country. It's always the same players playing, and even the audience is sick of watching. The sporting value is even more questionable. Therefore, our post-war sports plan urgently needs to overthrow the "hero worship" of the past and start with the universal cultivation of new talents.

The lineup for the Ching Pak vs. Hong Kong All-Stars match was as follows:

Ching Pak Team

Qin Biga, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Zhai Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Cao Qiuting, Zhang Jinhai, Song Lingsheng, Fuchs

Hong Kong Chinese All-Stars

Zhu Zhaoheng, Li Guowei, Huo Yaohua, Luo Quan, Liang Rongzhao, Kong Qingyu, Li Shuoyou, Zou Wenzhi, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, He Yingfen

Victory by One Goal; Defeating Hong Kong All-Stars

After playing for half the game, neither side had scored. The Hong Kong All-Stars forwards were active, frequently attacking Ching Pak. Ching Pak played cautiously and defended against the strong opponents. Qin Biga delivered an excellent performance at this time. Zou Wenzhi, Li Shuoyou, and He Yingfen made multiple fierce shots, all saved by his skillful hands.

In the second half, Ching Pak gained an advantage. In the forward line, Zhang Jinhai's rushes, Song Lingsheng's flair, Luo Shoufu's running across the field, and Cao Qiuting's quick runs and passes each had their unique strengths. So, less than seven minutes into the second half, Luo Shoufu got a goal, facing the goalkeeper alone. The All-Stars goalkeeper left the goal, and the ball went into the net. This goal was truly due to a misunderstanding between Huo Yaohua and Zhu Zhaoheng. Ching Pak won by such a lucky chance, which shows that it was not an extraordinary success in terms of skill. If Ching Pak becomes complacent because of this victory, the status of our national football team in the international arena may decline even further!

Brief News from Civil Affairs

### Municipal Government Orders the Promulgation of a Model Baojia Agreement; Yesterday, Orders Were Distributed to All Districts to Comply

The Municipal Government, according to Articles 28 and 29 of the previously promulgated Shanghai Municipal Baojia Reorganization Implementation Rules, stipulated that each bao should convene a bao affairs meeting to agree on baojia regulations, which should be jointly signed by baojia personnel above the household head level within the bao and submitted to the district chief for reporting to the Municipal Government for record. In order to provide a basis for each bao to formulate regulations, a model agreement for bao use was specially formulated. Yesterday, orders were distributed to all district offices to immediately instruct the bao chiefs to follow the model and formulate regulations, which should be reported for verification and without delay.

Population Increase in the Seventh District

Since receiving the order to handle the registration of household registers in duplicate, the Seventh District (Changshu) immediately instructed the dedicated bao cadres in each bao to concentrate on registering at the district office. It is now learned that the entire task has been completed, and all six copies of the population statistics table have been compiled overnight by all the assistants. Yesterday, the table was submitted to the Civil Affairs Department. It is reported that the actual number of residents in the district this time is 75,835 males and 67,838 females, totaling 143,673. In addition, the floating population is 14,931 males and 14,331 females, totaling 29,262, an increase of more than 24,000 compared to last month.

Winter Special Issue

### Talking About the Christmas Eve of Revelry

— From Our Newspaper's Research Department

Ten years ago, dance halls looked forward to Christmas with great anticipation. Because the usually slow business could be guaranteed to be full on that day. Therefore, the original dance halls were all decorated. The roofs were hung with cotton snow, with a bunch of balloons tied in the middle. The band's backdrop was nailed with the words "Merry Christmas." In addition, the dance hall owners also prepared bags of toys, paper hats, whistles, dolls… symbolizing Santa Claus bringing a large bag of gifts in the snowy weather, sliding down the chimney, and distributing them to those who are kind.

We also cannot forget the Christmas feast in the dance halls, the excellent turkey, the fragrant champagne… The dancers also prepared new outfits to repay the kindness of the foreign bosses and reserved Christmas feasts in the dance halls.

That night, the dance halls borrowed many tables and chairs from fellow hometown associations to accommodate the rare crowded dance guests of the year. Although the tables and chairs were full, the tide of people, those gentlemen and ladies in formal wear, often shrugged their shoulders, indicating that they could not get a seat.

Look! This situation is unimaginable for beggars shivering outside in the northerly wind, unable to receive gifts from Santa Claus. The radiators were turned on hotter than the sun, and the smoke filled the air like steam. The waiters used their experience to pop open the champagne. The gentlemen and foreign bosses drank with the same wild abandon as shown in American movies. The musicians received rewards and played with extra vigor in their formal wear. But the chaotic sounds of whistles from all directions ruined the jazz. Not a single dancer was left in the seats. The young and old were all swept away. In this way, a small piece of the dance floor was packed like an ant colony in the African forest, making it impossible to see the whole, only the shifting sands wriggling there.

In order to boast to friends the next day, those who had drunk too much foreign wine hired cars and went to the second, third… dance halls to play. In this way, they played until dawn before lying across the carriages and humming foreign songs on their way back.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the foreigners in Shanghai were driven into enemy detention camps. The compradors changed their professions to hoarding and speculation. Clerks also lowered their status and ran small errands. As a result, the very foreign Christmas became very deserted. The first set of formal wear was torn, and there was no strength to make a second set. Although the dance halls had Christmas feasts, people were not interested in turkey. Patrons wearing silk padded robes stepped into dance halls where the radiators had been removed by the Japanese, only occupying a corner and replacing champagne with clear tea. After all, the Japanese's big leather shoes were far inferior to the bright, pointy, thin-skinned patent leather shoes. Draft beer filled the Japanese up, and they staggered around the dance halls. How could they form a whole block of people again?

However, students at missionary schools could not forget this Western interest. They often gathered in groups of three or five to hold Christmas "parties" in their homes. Talcum powder was rubbed on the small living room floor, red and green light bulbs were strung on the Christmas tree, and a record player was turned on, with the help of the radio. They could still dance very excitedly.

Now, it is the second Christmas after the victory and is fast approaching. The foreign bosses have been out of the concentration camps for a long time, and with the addition of a large number of American soldiers, the grand occasion of Christmas Eve will surely be revived.

Yes, each dance hall is planning: menus, programs, gifts… preparing a night of revelry for the customers!

However, the grandeur of ten years ago cannot be revived immediately. The import firms that depended on foreigners for food have suffered great losses, and all industries are in a state of decline. Who would be in the mood to make formal wear and attend the turkey feast?

### Christmas Tales of Wonder

Heavy Snowfall on the Day - Great Harvest Next Year for Sure

Strong Wind at Dawn - All Livestock Suffer

Bright Lights at Night - Can Eliminate Disaster

Cricket on the Stove - Everyone is Overjoyed

All countries in the world cannot avoid superstitious actions, and Westerners are even more superstitious about Christmas events in a "variety of ways."

This year's Christmas is on Wednesday—eek! Christmas falling on a Wednesday is said to be very ominous! According to their saying, this year will be very cold, and there will be hurricanes, wars will happen next year, epidemics will run rampant everywhere, volcanoes will erupt, and natural and man-made disasters will be everywhere, and… hey hey! Do you believe it or not?

The weather on Christmas Day is said to be related to good or bad fortune for the coming year, just as our people say that if it rains on the first day of the Lunar New Year, it is unlucky to go out this year. Their saying is this: If the moon is bright and the stars are sparse on Christmas Eve, that's great. There will definitely be a great harvest of melons and fruits next year, and the price will be cheap. If the sky is covered with dark clouds, or there is a downpour, that's terrible. You won't be able to eat melons and fruits or drink wine. It is best to have heavy snowfall on Christmas Day, and next year will definitely be a bumper year. If the sky is gloomy during the day, the wheat will be abundant next year, otherwise, the harvest will definitely be poor. If you can get a lot of milk at night, the production of chickens and ducks will definitely be high tomorrow. If there is a strong wind at dawn, chickens, ducks, cattle, pigs, and all livestock may suffer. If there is thunder and lightning on Christmas Day, the weather will be extremely cold, but next year, the industrial and commercial sectors will be very profitable. If the sunlight is warm from morning to evening, then next year will be stable and uneventful. However, if there are dark clouds obscuring the sun at sunset, epidemics will spread in the spring and summer of next year. If there is also a gust of wind, the population will definitely die in heaps next year, which is unimaginable!

A Westerner's home is always filled with joy and excitement on Christmas Eve, thoroughly lively. All the lights, candles, and electric lights are lit, because in their view, light can eliminate great disasters. Some families hang a multi-sectioned wooden stick on the wall and burn it with fire, then the whole family sits and "chants words" of blessings. Everyone hopes that this wooden stick can be burned completely, then all events next year, large and small, will definitely be satisfactory.

What's disappointing on Christmas Eve is that many demons and ghosts also come to visit on this evening, the most common of which is the "suicide ghost," taking advantage of this time to seek "hosts." "They" often spread the seeds of sin in the human world before twelve o'clock. However, it is best to simply open the windows completely before twelve o'clock to show "welcome," then perhaps you will be forgiven by "them." What is most taboo is: if you keep the windows tightly closed, those demons and ghosts will come looking for trouble.

The first thing that enters the door on Christmas Day is best to be green, and the first person to enter the door is best to be a man, because it is said that a man entering the door first can bring happiness. Even cats, dogs, and other livestock, it is best for the male to enter the door first.

The most popular animals at Christmas are crickets and roosters. Because Westerners believe that crickets carry the most seeds of happiness. If a cricket jumps on the stove, the whole family will be overjoyed. If the rooster can crow all night on Christmas Eve, it foretells a bumper harvest next year.

If a young lady hopes that her fiancé will meet her in a dream on Christmas Eve, she only needs to eat a few black chicken eggs before going to bed. If she is afraid that the dream will be short and the feeling long, and that the rice is exhausted, then first cook the eggs thoroughly, remove the yolks, mix them with sugar, and eat them. If this trick is not effective at all, and you don't have a single dream? Then you deserve it!

There are many more myths and legends! The holly used for interior decoration should not be too smooth. If it is too smooth, there will be unfortunate events next year. It also cannot be too rough. If it is too rough, the relationship between husband and wife will become bad. When preparing sacrificial items, a woman must not break the fruit bread when baking it, otherwise, this woman will not live to see next year's Christmas. Leather items cannot be brought into the door on Christmas Day, because leather will bring in the seeds of misfortune. When burning charcoal, barefoot or blind people must not enter the door, especially women with fat insteps. It is best to keep the charcoal fire in the stove at night properly, so that Mr. Zhurong (the god of fire) will not visit you throughout the next year.

There are too many to remember. If you are interested, you may want to ask the Westerners living in China if they have any of the above actions?

### The Winter Solstice is as Big as the New Year

Foreign customs on Christmas are similar in principle to Chinese rituals on the Winter Solstice.

Chinese people always like to call Christmas the "Foreign Winter Solstice," because foreign customs on Christmas are completely similar in principle to the customs of our country on the Winter Solstice Festival. Why do we say that? Because both follow the ancestral myths and rituals, and contain the ancient folk festive entertainment!

Writing about Christmas is certainly a timely article, but I am afraid that the entire text is too full of "foreign" atmosphere. Here, I will write about our country's Winter Solstice, to show that we have not forgotten the "national essence."

The Days are Short, the Nights are Longest

"The Winter Solstice is as big as the New Year." This colloquial saying is almost known to all women and children. Suzhou people also have the saying "Fat Winter, Lean New Year." There is also a Shanghai proverb: "Dry and sunny Winter Solstice, wet and bland New Year; Lively Winter Solstice, Cold and bland New Year." This last sentence has the same meaning as "The Winter Solstice is as big as the New Year." The origin of this saying is probably like this:

First, from an astronomical point of view, the earth revolves around the sun from west to east along the ecliptic. When the sun's rays shine directly on the Tropic of Capricorn, it is the time of the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. On this day, the days are shortest, and the nights are longest. After this day, the sun begins to move north again, and the sundial gradually increases. The ancients compared the sun to the emperor, so there is the far-fetched statement that "the yang qi rises on the Winter Solstice, and the way of the ruler grows." Because "the way of the ruler grows," there are also rituals of "celebrating the Winter Solstice Grand Assembly." The etiquette is no different from the New Year's Day in the first month, and the people also have customs such as worshiping ancestors, paying respects to elders, wearing new clothes, and greeting each other, which is called "Paying Winter."

Paying Winter, Old Customs

The custom of "Paying Winter" already existed in the Han Dynasty. When it spread to Shanghai, it was probably during the Southern Song Dynasty. Qin Rongguang's "Shanghai County Bamboo Branch Song" describes the Shanghai customs of the Winter Solstice Festival, saying:

"Winter Solstice rice cake and glutinous rice balls, dividing winter wine to celebrate the year; After bowing and congratulating relatives and friends, piles of meat are placed on the plate to worship the ancestors."

Shanghai people often grind flour to make rice cakes and glutinous rice balls on the eve of the Winter Solstice, as items for worshiping ancestors and announcing the winter. Qin Nai's Miscellaneous Remarks says: "Winter Solstice sends cakes, New Year sends flour, those who don't come will also come." It can be seen that cakes and flour are not only for personal use but must also be given to relatives and friends.

The Eve, Worshipping Ancestors

Just like the eve of Christmas, the eve of the Chinese Winter Solstice, called "Winter Eve," is also quite lively. Every household, large and small, prepares food and drinks to worship ancestors, and each family takes turns inviting people to drink and feast, called "Dividing Winter Wine." "The Records of Qihua Township" states: "The night before the Winter Solstice is called Winter Solstice Night, worship ancestors and eat meat." "The Records of Songjiang Prefecture" also states: "In the eleventh month, on the Winter Solstice, prepare rice cakes, seal sheep and pigs, and worship ancestors." There must be meat for worship. The dead ancestors and spirits will not eat meat. This meat is naturally waited until after the worship, when the whole family divides and devours it. The Shanghai proverb says: "Calling for a piece of meat on Winter Solstice Night is like not having Winter Solstice." When there is meat to eat, but only one piece is eaten, one can only mock oneself by saying it is "like not having Winter Solstice."

Winter Morning, Paying Respects to Elders

On Winter Morning, scholar-official families customarily wore their official hats and belts to congratulate each other and pay respects to elders. Even rickshaw pullers and those who sell soy sauce also changed into new clothes and strolled through the city, greeting acquaintances.

This year's Winter Solstice is the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh lunar month, December twenty-second of the Gregorian calendar, three days before the "Foreign Winter Solstice"!

### Christmas in Europe

London

After these years of war, Europe is generally much poorer this winter. In London, when early December came, housewives were already preparing their Christmas supplies and hoping to get more candy, meat and canned fruits under the strict control of the government. As for alcohol, there is very little in England, and the fine wines shipped from the continent are still on their way, obviously too late to help.

France

The situation is even worse in France. The French all want to enjoy more food this winter, but food prices are rising daily. The biggest problems now - transportation difficulties and the black market - have not yet been resolved, so the French hope for Christmas food enjoyment has disappeared invisibly.

Belgium and Holland

Belgium and Holland have a relatively large number of poultry, but the quantity of other food is not enough to distribute. The worst situation is in the American occupation government within Germany, which states that food prices in Germany are still rising daily and cannot be resolved this winter. The food situation in the British occupation zone is even worse. As for the Soviet occupation zone, because the land is relatively fertile, the food situation is slightly better. Therefore, the Germans this year will still have difficulty changing their enjoyment of black bread, potatoes and cabbage from the past.

Romania

In Romania, 2 million people are using grain flour and "Red Cross soup" for the Christmas feast. Although most Romanians can enjoy better food, if the government cannot solve the food difficulty by earning a lot of income, the general people's lives cannot be improved.

Hungary

Hungary, the Christmas situation this year is a little better than in previous years, but the terrible inflation has made most Hungarians dizzy.

Switzerland

Switzerland is working hard to rebuild its travel business system, so that they can make Europeans eat better in restaurants and stay in better hotels. Other former Axis countries, such as Italy, Italians are still unable to obtain bread and inferior rations due to high prices. The government is struggling to achieve the lowest material living standards for the people, how can they talk about a Christmas of high material enjoyment?

Speaking of Yugoslavia, although the UN has shipped a large number of materials for relief, most Yugoslavians are still unable to obtain a better Christmas enjoyment due to the damage of the drought.

Greece

Greece is also facing high prices and worrying about the serious food problem next spring, so this year's Christmas can only "muddle through".

Sweden

Sweden's food situation is relatively normal, thanks to its proper rationing of the major foods.

Summary

In short, the situation in Europe as a whole is that there is not enough food, and people are mostly living on half-full stomachs. Bread is still out of the question, let alone turkey and roast goose? This is the second Christmas after the end of the war. This year, "Santa Claus" is coming to the earth again, and looking at this world devastated by the war, I wonder what kind of feelings will arise!

### Advice to Those Suffering from Neurasthenia

— Xia Zhenyi

In the past, many young people from various places often wrote to inquire about various issues related to neurasthenia. I once wrote an article entitled "On Neurasthenia" (published in the sixth issue of the third volume of the Chinese Health Magazine in the 30th year of the Republic [1941]) as a general response. Considering the prevalence of this ailment and the seriousness of its impact, I feel it is necessary to reiterate my views now.

Modern Civilization Disease

The term "neurasthenia" truly necessitates discussion and correction. Because when we take the name literally, we assume that the nervous system is the master of the body. So, if the nervous system is "weak," the body is bound to be severely threatened. People then recognize it as a frightening disease, leading to fear, anxiety, and bewilderment, ultimately losing the joy of life. Young people! Do you have this mistaken notion? The progress of modern medicine has, in fact, proven that the nervous tissues of these patients do not suffer the slightest damage or weakness. The real reason lies in the morbidity of their personalities, rendering them unable to cope with or overcome the hardships of life. In other words, they are truly a group of weaklings who escape from life. Therefore, some say that neurasthenia is a unique ailment of modern civilization, which contains a great deal of truth. Because the more advanced civilization becomes, the higher people's desires and the more intense their lifestyles become. Our bodies and minds often face the danger of not being able to maintain balance, just like a sturdy ship. Although it has good machinery, it cannot withstand the attacks of great storms due to being overloaded, resulting in the tragedy of capsizing. Therefore, how many young people today have suffered the misfortune of "capsizing" in the highly stressful and complex sea of life.

Since neurasthenia is so prevalent, this term has been deeply imprinted in people's minds, just like the term for typhoid fever. When Chinese people encounter persistent fever, regardless of the cause, they collectively call it typhoid fever. Similarly, many people who suffer from some neurological symptoms often diagnose themselves with "neurasthenia" before seeing a doctor. In fact, what people commonly call "neurasthenia" encompasses many different diseases. In psychiatry, we call this type of disease "psychoneurosis." We see these types of patients in our clinics every day. They have numerous complaints. They often write down a long list of various symptoms in advance and hand it to the doctor, and they bring different new complaints at each visit. Although many patients suffer from mild mental illnesses, such as "obsessive-compulsive disorder," "hand-washing mania," and various "phobias," most patients suffer from hyperesthesia, neurasthenia (we will temporarily use this term until we have a more appropriate term), hypochondria, hysteria, and anxiety states.

Typical Patients

A typical neurasthenia patient often feels tired, forgetful, unable to concentrate easily, has headaches, backaches, insomnia, nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, pessimism, disappointment, depression, and feelings of inferiority. Patients with hypochondria are overly sensitive to their body's functions. The symptoms produced are often limited to various organs of the body. We often encounter patients who complain that their heart function has stopped, their gastrointestinal tract is ulcerated, their internal organs have shifted positions, and the blood in their brain has congealed into clots, and other strange sensations. I once met a middle-aged woman who complained that there was a "turtle" in her abdomen, and therefore she was fearful and anxious all day long, leading to starvation. A patient with hysteria often resembles a truly ill person, with symptoms such as numbness, loss of sensation, paralysis, blindness, [omission], feeling like they are becoming [omission], mental derangement, patients with anxiety [omission] often experience paroxysmal palpitations, sweating, feelings of suffocation, fear of death, mental tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation [omission]. Patients themselves will feel anxious and [omission] their symptoms.

When these patients complain of various neurological sensitivities, worries, insomnia, fears, and other vague symptoms, general doctors feel that since the physical examination reveals no morbidity, it is not worth spending more time. They often readily diagnose "hypersensitivity" or "neurasthenia," write a prescription for a sedative, and consider it done. Sometimes they may impatiently say to the patient, "These are all illusions; there's nothing wrong." In fact, their suffering and symptoms are absolutely real to them. Therefore, this allows the patient to go from one doctor to another, wasting time and money, which is so heartbreaking!

Key Psychological Points

We know that the functions of the nervous system can be divided into several levels. The higher psychological level is located in the cerebral cortex, representing a person's thoughts and mental life. The lower physiological level is located in the medulla oblongata, representing automatic physiological functions such as circulation, respiration, and digestion. Psychological influences are constantly emitted from the cortical center to control physiological functions. In other words, there are connecting neurons between the higher and lower centers, resulting in a harmonious, balanced, and unified state, representing the entire life of a healthy person. There are two opposing forces between the cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata—excitation and inhibition. We have not yet understood the fundamental nature of these two forces, but we know for sure that they exist. Without these forces, we would have no controlled life. With them, the capabilities of the nervous system are effectively expressed. Physiologically, the excitatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart and the inhibitory influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart are clear facts. In the psychological realm, we can also see the excitatory effect of instinct and the inhibiting power of conscience. These two opposing psychological forces cause various psychological conflicts in humans, which are also the basis for maladjustment.

The two lower levels of personality are habit and instinct, and the two higher levels are wisdom and reason. If each level is not properly adjusted, it is the root cause of psychoneurosis. When the emotional impact and sympathetic nervous system produced by this conflict cause functional disorders, various visceral, glandular, joint, muscle, circulatory, and other symptoms arise. When it affects the function of the cerebral cortex, it produces various special psychological disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. The above points are the psycho-pathological analyses of neurasthenia and other psychoneuroses by modern scholars.

The Connection Between Body and Mind

Physiologist Cannon has also pointed out that fear and other emotional tensions can produce physiological changes. When fearful, excessive secretion of adrenaline causes palpitations, sweating, pupil dilation, cessation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion, and changes in metabolism. Other emotions such as worry, anxiety, disappointment, and anticipation can produce the same physiological changes. From this, we can understand that in the long term, tension, fear, irritability, and anxiety can change the function of normal organs, causing discomfort and abnormal sensations. Other life problems such as economic difficulties, sexual dysfunction, regret over masturbation, discord in work interests, conflicts in religious beliefs, discord in the family, and worries about childbirth and contraception can all form factors of hyperesthesia or neurasthenia. Patients with hypochondria are often well-cared-for, only children spoiled by their parents. Their parents have never given them an opportunity to be independent. Therefore, they become dependent by nature. They also don't know what difficulty is. But good times don't last long. Parents cannot provide shelter for them for a lifetime. Once they encounter difficulties, they have no strength to overcome them. This leads to various pathologies of the body's organs to escape from difficult reality, seeking temporary inner peace. In hysteria and obsessive-compulsive disorder, those past repressed and fragmented experiences are the root cause of the disease.

Neurasthenia and other various psychoneuroses are all due to their "special personality" and the reactions it causes to life experiences. This "special personality" is often formed in childhood. We often see these "neurotic" children, whose initial unstable emotional manifestations include timidity, shyness, submission, fear, nightmares, irritability, bed-wetting, nail-biting, unstable vasomotor function, protein allergies, allergic reactions, urticaria, eczema, asthma, and other phenomena. Adolescence is a critical period for shaping the personality of adults. These emotionally unstable young people often have hypersensitivity, excessive worry about future difficulties, dissatisfaction, and loneliness, or premature, diminished, or abnormal sexual development. Many young people also regard sexual issues as mysterious and obscene, seeking sexual satisfaction in fantasy. Therefore, on the surface, these people appear calm, but their hearts are actually shy, timid, hesitant, and irresolute. Once they encounter difficulties in life, they lack the willpower to struggle, and various neurological symptoms arise to escape. Strictly speaking, any of us will have this symptom response if we encounter extraordinary difficulties, but neurotic people cannot cope with even the most ordinary setbacks and quickly produce various reactions.

As for the physical aspect, these people are also not very robust. They often suffer from underweight, visceral ptosis, spastic constipation, colitis, and require more time for sleep and rest than ordinary people. We also often find that their tendon reflexes are enhanced, the sympathetic nervous system is overactive, prone to facial flushing, skin writing, blood rings, and vascular instability, menstrual irregularities, and carbohydrate and water imbalance phenomena.

Personality and Physique

We know that the whole person encompasses both the body and mind. Therefore, we must consider both aspects when studying or diagnosing a patient, so as not to have any negligence. When encountering this type of patient, the first thing to do is to understand their individual, physique, and complete life record. Everyone's personality is different, including their physiological or biological components, their special emotional composition, and their intelligence. Many are inherited, and many are acquired from life experiences. We [omission] personality is formed by the fusion of life experiences and our inherent nature. Only this harmonious fusion can allow people to work, play, and rest to form a precise balance. In certain neurotic people, any of these traits are threatened and cannot be tolerated, and neurological symptoms arise. If the doctor is willing to listen quietly to the patient's account of their life story and adopts a serious attitude, using an objective perspective, it is not difficult to understand the patient's personality. Only in this way can the pathogenic mechanism be discovered. Everything in childhood can represent the prototype of personality. School performance can indicate the level of intelligence. Professional success or failure can represent a person's inherent trust and perseverance. In addition, from a person's marital and sexual life, we can also discover what they are worried about. Fear of pregnancy, sexual dissatisfaction, discord between husband and wife, and worries and fears about masturbation are all important factors.

As mentioned above, masturbation, nocturnal emissions, impotence, and premature ejaculation can be said to be symptoms that most neurasthenia patients will complain about. Here, I must point out a correct concept. Masturbation is indeed a bad habit, but the influence of masturbation itself is not great. Rather, the attitude of society toward masturbation is very important. Shame, goodwill, and anger are mixed together in the consciousness, causing very bad consequences in the spirit. In other words, the main harm of masturbation lies in the struggle with this mentality. Similarly, nocturnal emission is originally a normal physiological phenomenon for healthy young people before the start of sexual life. More than four or five nocturnal emissions per month is considered pathological. Often, young people do not have accurate medical knowledge. Whenever this physiological phenomenon occurs, coupled with the promotion of improper pharmaceutical advertisements in newspapers, it causes great fear, which is very harmful. However, when the number of occurrences has increased abnormally, of course, a specialist should be consulted for examination. As for impotence and premature ejaculation, a specialist should be consulted for examination. Reading newspapers and taking medicine is the most foolish thing to do. According to the results of current medical research, most patients with impotence and premature ejaculation are due to neurotic fear, childish timidity, and the inability to adapt to society. From this, it can be seen that treating these patients is not only effective by taking medicine and injections. The most important thing is to start from the psychological aspect.

Pay Attention, Young People!

Recently, this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from many readers inquiring about various issues related to neurasthenia. In addition to having replied individually, here I would like to bring up a common traditional misconception shared by most young people—kidney deficiency and neurasthenia—whether the terms kidney deficiency and yin deficiency are terms used by old Chinese medicine, which is a mistaken concept without scientific and victorious foundation. We know that the function of the kidneys is to specialize in excretion and is the factory for making urine, which is fundamentally unrelated to the common symptoms of general neurasthenia patients—nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and impotence. Because of "deficiency," it needs to be "replenished." Furthermore, because of the confusion between the kidneys and the function of the gonads, injections and medicines with pleasant terms such as "hormones" and "賜保命" (a life preserving substance) are regarded as the only good medicine for "tonifying." Moreover, due to the promotion of various improper medicines, patients flock to them, wasting money and suffering in vain, which is so foolish!

Be optimistic! People with neuroses, you must not be pessimistic, disappointed, or anxious. You must not be deceived by misleading advertisements, wasting money and time. Injections and medicines are futile for this disease. Only understanding, encouragement, and inspiration can allow you to re-evaluate your own value and return to the world of people, work, entertainment, and love.

### The Attitude We Should Have Towards the Mentally Ill

— Liu Yeci

In our lives, we will always encounter crazy mentally ill people on the street a few times. As soon as they are discovered, we can immediately see many pedestrians circling around them, standing and watching as if enjoying a kind of play game, unwilling to leave. If we carefully observe those spectators, we will find that their attitudes toward the patients are all different. Some arbitrarily ridicule and criticize the patients, as if they have finally found a topic of conversation. Some are indifferent, seeing as if they have not seen, hearing as if they have not heard, and have no special expression toward the patients, just watching. Some sigh at the patients as if they are a little pitying. If the patients are going crazy and singing loudly, making many strange expressions, we can see that the audience will immediately burst into laughter in unison. Suddenly seeing the patients naked, [omission], we will again [omission], shut them in a room, not allowing them to come out again. People without family members will also be homeless and have nowhere to rest. From the above attitudes, we can deeply see that if a person unfortunately suffers from mental illness, in addition to being gloated over and ridiculed by others, what they get from the environment is only contempt, insult, jokes, and scolding, without getting the sympathy that human beings deserve.

Since traditional wrong attitudes are like this, if a family has a mentally ill person, because the family members first discriminate against the patient, according to the psychology of "judging others by oneself," the family members must also be afraid that others will discriminate against the patient. Therefore, most are unwilling to mention it to others. At the same time, because the patient often causes trouble during the period of madness, they simply keep him locked in a room, not allowing him to run out. As long as he does not make noise, that is enough. Of course, he is not allowed to share meals with his family every day, and it is enough to give him a portion. If relatives and friends occasionally mention the patient, the family members will definitely use other words to conceal the situation for the patient. Firstly, people generally do not know that mental illness can also be treated, always thinking it is the work of gods and ghosts. Secondly, it is to save the family's face, fearing embarrassment. Even if they know that mental illness can be treated, they are unwilling to seek treatment. Furthermore, because the patient [omission], everything [omission] situation [omission] patients, I really don't know how many there are.

Therefore, [omission] or in today's so-called civilized society, whenever and wherever, as long as the word "crazy person" is mentioned, people mostly [omission] have a kind of fear and discrimination toward them. Their mentality is that the patient is "finished for this life." In fact, the facts tell us that people suffering from mental illness are no different from people suffering from other illnesses. As long as they are treated properly, their chances of recovery are the same. After they recover, they can also do a great and magnificent career like ordinary people. For example, in 1900, there was a top student at Yale University in the United States named Clifford Beers, who was a person who had suffered from mental illness for two years. After he recovered, he not only wrote a most valuable book entitled "A Mind That Found Itself," which made extremely valuable contributions to the medical community. Moreover, he continued to work hard and became the initiator of the mental hygiene movement. In our country, we have heard that there was a Mr. Luo Feng, who was also a scholar who had suffered from mental illness. After he recovered, he retold his experiences and insights of getting sick. In 1944, he also published a book entitled "Crazy August Notes." After the book was published, its contribution to medicine was even greater. Comparing China and the West, their achievements are equal. Their ability to work after illness is beyond what ordinary people can compare.

In short, mental illness is no different from other diseases, because it is also a disease and is not surprising. People suffering from mental illness are no different from people suffering from other diseases, so it is not strange. If we have lung disease, we dare to boldly seek medical treatment. If we have mental illness, we should also go to seek medical treatment immediately. Since we love and protect people suffering from lung disease, we should love and protect people suffering from mental illness even more. After they get sick, they should also enjoy the same treatment, because they are sick, not guilty of a crime. At the same time, we should have already realized that we should not beat them, scold them, and not give them inhumane treatment.

### Unfold Literary and Art Construction

— Wu Mintai

Literature and art are a symbol of the spirit of resistance, a kind of life cried out in times of life's brevity, suffering, pain, and anger! It is all kinds of strange and varied living facts in human society. Through the power of their images, it arouses the sensitive and emotional abundance of writers, emitting sounds of groaning, shouting, angry lamentations, weeping, satire, protest, appeals, or praise. It is then created and expressed through language and words as a kind of art! It should not only truthfully expose reality on the surface, reflect society, depict darkness, and extol light, but it should also provide a true and realistic life thought that is sufficient to awaken and alert the people from the cruel reality, excavate the truth of the darkness, ugliness, and harm hidden behind the light and beauty, and then pierce the filth and pus wrapped in the tumors! Therefore, we can say that literature and art are the driving force for promoting social evolution, the breast milk for nourishing the human soul!

Of course, we don't need to particularly emphasize that the power of literature and art far surpasses the range of guns! Nor do we need to particularly exaggerate that the effect of literature and art is more important than the battles of soldiers, but the spiritual function of literature and art in assisting the War of Resistance and national construction and stimulating national thought and patriotic emotions is very obvious and cannot be denied by anyone!

In the past, the literary and artistic youth of our country were always unafraid of the powerful and unafraid of dangers. First, they used the pen as a weapon that used ink to create blood, to awaken the deaf, to sweep away demons, and acted as the pioneers of the times and the vanguards of the revolution! Now, in this transitional and turbulent period of national construction, the literary and artistic people of the whole country should continue their efforts, actively carry out literary and artistic construction, and actively build a healthy and solid literary and artistic fortress to defeat those works containing toxins, absurdities, and obscenities. Facing the turbid, treacherous, ugly, and evil reality, they should use a pen that resembles steel rubbing against steel, iron colliding with iron, blood and sweat exchanging, and is full of a positive fighting atmosphere to point out the errors of the times, expose the darkness of society, express the suffering of the masses, and further point out a correct and bright path for the future era!

Literary and artistic youths, the times are calling us, let us densely concentrate our firepower! Let us hold hands tightly!

### A Button

— Bao Yu

On a desolate journey, braving the chilling wind, I walked for a day. My hands were frostbitten, and my legs felt incredibly heavy. It was less like walking and more like dragging myself along step by step. The bamboo cane in my hand trailed on the ground, making a weary sound. Seeing that the sun was about to set and my shadow lengthening, I couldn't help but feel a little apprehensive.

Just then, I suddenly saw a small mountain town ahead. The sign of a small roadside restaurant and the flames from the stove beckoned me. How delighted I was!

I hurried towards it. The woman tending the stove looked to be around thirty. She wore a set of blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers and had a floral cloth tied around her head, the picture of simple country attire. The firelight made her round face glow red.

Although I was a weary traveler, she showed no hint of disdain towards me or my small bag. On the contrary, she treated me with great hospitality. She took care of everything without me having to worry. First, she arranged a place for me to sleep. Although it was just straw laid out, I found it as comfortable as a Simmons mattress. Then she brought me a basin of water to wash my face and a large pot of tea. Although the water in the basin contained a lot of grit and the towel wasn't very clean, my frostbitten cheeks and hands were desperate for warmth, so I didn't mind. The tea made from roasted soybeans had a hint of coffee flavor, and I happily drank it down. A steamed bun and a bowl of hot millet porridge, eaten with salted soybeans, tasted incredibly delicious.

After the meal, a kerosene lamp was placed on the table next to my bed. By then, the restaurant door was closed, the street was very quiet, and wild animals in the mountains were making frightening howls.

Without me asking, she placed a basin of boiled water on the floor for me to soak my feet. My swollen feet felt instantly relieved of the day's journey after being soaked in the hot water. As I soaked my feet, I chatted with her, from the situation in the town to the details of her restaurant. She was as quick with her words as she was with her actions. She told me that her husband gambled and drank all day and only came home late at night. She took care of everything in the restaurant, and there was also an elderly mother-in-law in her sixties who had already gone to the back room to sleep before it got dark. As she spoke, there seemed to be tears in her eyes.

After soaking my feet, she rinsed my wet socks in the water. After rinsing them, she put them by the stove to dry.

"They'll be dry overnight, and you can wear them again in the morning!" she said.

At the same time, she noticed that a few buttons on my cotton-padded jacket were about to fall off. She found a needle and thread and insisted on sewing them on for me.

"Lie down and take off your jacket!"

"I'm so sorry!"

"No, it's no trouble for me to sew on a few stitches. I know how hard it is for people traveling away from home!"

The kerosene lamp flickered, and she trimmed the wick with the needle tip, bringing it closer to the light as she sewed the buttons on for me. The needle and thread passed through the cloth jacket, making a soft sound, echoing her quiet breathing.

As she finished sewing, she told me:

"You're missing a button on your coat!"

"It's alright if I am!"

"No, it's not warm enough to wear if you're missing a button!" With that, she quickly took off a similar black button from her own underclothes.

"But then I have a button, and you don't!"

"It doesn't matter about me, you have to travel early tomorrow morning!"

A traveler accustomed to the coldness of society never expected to receive such human warmth in a small mountain town restaurant.

The next morning, I set off on my journey again. The rising sun shone on my cotton-padded jacket, and the last, larger black button reflected the light.

### Recording Liu Kuizhong's Paintings and Calligraphy

— Yu Liuhua

Fifteen years ago, I saw the Huaibei painter Liu Kuizhong in Shanghai. His flower paintings were influenced by Wu [Changshuo], and his medical practices by Qing Daoren. He had already established himself. This year, he came to Shanghai again and showed me his recent works. They were completely different, completely shedding his old habits, with no trace of his former style. His rapid progress is truly remarkable.

Since Lin Liangjian's ink wash freehand style in the Ming Dynasty, Zhou Zhimian created the outline-flower and dot-leaf style. Xu Tianchi, with his innate talent, painted freely and unconstrainedly, with everything as he wished, and freehand flower painting reached its peak. In the early Qing Dynasty, Shi Tao expressed it with a bold and unrestrained brush, and Bada used an ancient brush, achieving perfection without seeking it. Later, Li Futang used a twisting and turning brush, similar to Zhou Zhimian; Gai Xinluo used a delicate and elegant brush, writing freehand but close to meticulous brushwork. In the late Qing Dynasty, Zhao Zhiqian and Wu Rangzhi used the brushwork of writing Wei steles to create broad and vibrant paintings, with a unique interest. In the early Republic of China, Wu Changshuo wrote flower paintings with the brushwork of seal script, with a rough and wild style full of rustic and profound air. For a time, scholars followed suit, forming a grand trend. However, many who imitated him stuck to the old methods, not knowing how to change, and gradually became disliked. Only Liu Jun refused to be confined by Wu's style, transforming from rough and wild to elegant, from ancient and clumsy to clear and spiritual. Tracing back from Zhao Zhiqian and Li Futang to Zhou Zhimian, he is implicitly the orthodox of flower painting, with no bad habit of using large amounts of red and green, and is truly worthy of praise.

Qing Daoren used twists and turns to write inscriptions on bronze vessels and official script, which is certainly interesting, but ultimately not found in ancient methods. His brushwork is too restrained, and his spirit is not smooth, inevitably giving the impression of artificiality. Liu Jun's initial study of Qing Daoren is similar to his flower paintings influenced by Wu Changshuo. Recently, he has gradually transformed Qing Daoren's square and clumsy style, returning the inscriptions on bronze vessels and official script to their original appearance, incorporating twists and turns into fluidity, solid without being stagnant, and gorgeous without being superficial. Few contemporary calligraphers can do this. His cursive script is especially pure, skilled, and unrestrained, not falling into the stereotypes of modern people. Learning and being able to change, and changing to a higher level, Liu Jun's attainments are truly limitless.

Liu Jun recently exhibited several hundred of his recent works at the Chinese Painting Academy. Those who love this art should go and see them, so as to prove that my words are not wrong.

### Palm Tree

— Liu Kuizhong

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 127

— Ye Jingfeng

"A young shop assistant at the counter, the department manager saw that she was capable and introduced her to the 'First Store' to do chores two months ago. In less than a week, the general manager of the First Store saw that she was charming and very clever and picked her to work in the office. Last night, she saw the boss of the 'Introduction Agency' with her own eyes and admired him very much. The boss's experiences in the First Store were all conveyed by her. Our department manager discovered that she was very loyal and could be promoted to the mountain-level service category, so he charged her with finding out the news of the 'goods'. Coincidentally, she was very familiar with the 'goods' storage department, and she sorted things out this morning. So the department manager told me to get to the boss within five hours..."

This is the usual way of talking in Tsurumi's secret organization, but it needs to be interpreted:

In secret conversations, Tsurumi's organization refers to itself as "Introduction Agency", "Department Store", or "Translation Agency", etc.; depending on which nature is suitable for the environment, it uses the "jargon" of which organization to talk. The roles of the subordinates are roughly divided into three classes; the highest-class confidants, about twenty in total, are all comrades of life and death selected by Tsurumi over the years, each of whom not only has expertise, is shrewd and capable, but also shares the same interests, and their numbers all start with "0". Some are in charge of one of the twelve secret radio stations, and some hold special positions; such as "04" in Changxindian, "012" in Tokyo, etc.

Under these senior confidants, there are two or three classes of workers; the second class is the confidants of the first class, and the third class is the confidants of the second class. These two classes are also divided into A, B, and C grades. The maintenance styles of these "confidants" are of various kinds. As mentioned earlier, some want to be promoted and make a fortune, while others are special, such as revenge, or appreciation, or spontaneous friendship, or the same interests, or members of secret societies in other countries. However, they only have a "vertical" organization and no "horizontal" relationship. Even this vertical organization is limited to one level, that is, his or her direct contact person.

One difference between this organization and other secret societies is that the number of cadres is more than the total number of the second and third classes combined by two or three; because most of the subordinates with "0" at the beginning have no underlings. Other than that, most of them are temporary employees and cannot be counted within the organization.

The "First Store" mentioned above refers to the current cabinet, and the general manager is of course referring to Konoe. According to the oral report of Wild Boar, the person who found out the location of the "Seven Secret Instruments" was a woman named Yoshida Maruko. 012 found a way to get her to Konoe's villa to work as a chore worker, and Konoe took a fancy to her and chose her as one of the concubines, successfully creating a very useful internal line. Since 012 went to solve the six guys who were unfavorable to Tsurumi and were driven away by the Fifth Column, and Tsurumi was forced by Konoe to meet with him, he then ordered Maruko to randomly protect Tsurumi internally. As soon as this Maruko saw Tsurumi, she obeyed him with twelve sincerity and was willing to die for him.

It is not that the author advocates "heroism" to make Tsurumi so heroic, causing people to fall in love with him at first sight and simply becoming a "superman". But Japanese women inherently have this kind of "little hen" personality, loving vanity, loving men, and loving heroes. Even if you are a rickshaw puller, as long as you are a strong man who runs faster than others, she will admire you. What's more, among the 35 million strong men in Japan (according to the Japanese population survey in 1935, whether it is true or false, the author is not responsible), apart from a very small number of Western mixed breeds (Japan has been a mixed blood since the Meiji Restoration, except for a small number of aboriginal fishermen in Hokkaido), where can you see a handsome man like Tsurumi? Therefore, it is no wonder that this "little hen" fell in love at first sight.

(In fact, compared to young people in their twenties in our country, Tsurumi is not particularly handsome and romantic, but he is just well-proportioned, brave, spirited, and has a dashing appearance, which makes people pleasing to the eye.)

### Meeting

— Shao Fu

Democratic politics cannot be separated from the form of meetings. In meetings, one can record a person, whether it is their cultivation, demeanor, wit, or decisiveness. People praise the British Parliament, and people also know that British politicians are influenced by the Parliament. The history of Disraeli, the last prime minister of the Victorian dynasty, struggling in Parliament for forty years will move those who read history.

Our National Assembly has been in session for thirty-four days. One thousand two to three people have come from all over to gather in Nanjing, discussing the constitution. Although there have been many ups and downs and disputes, the overall progress has been good. We may still be learning, but this first lesson in democratic politics cannot be considered bad.

Let people speak their minds, even if they are wrong, they have that right. Don't look down on those representatives who have traveled thousands of miles. As long as they say a word or two at the assembly, they will forget their hard work, and they will have gotten their worth.

During these thirty-four days of the meeting, many scenes are worthy of our special appreciation. Here, let us mention the words of Fu Sinian, Jiang Yuntian, and Chen Qitian in the Comprehensive Review Committee on the 18th (see the Nanjing special telegram on the first page of yesterday's newspaper):

Fu Sinian: I am not determined to maintain the previous resolution in order to achieve my personal goals, but due to spiritual feelings, I believe that my soul has not given any guarantees to others and should have the freedom to speak. ... I do not expect to overturn this review motion with this reason, but only hope to include it in the record.

Jiang Yuntian: I propose to postpone the decision on this issue and wait for all parties to sincerely negotiate again. First, the role of our minority party in the meeting can only be realized through reason and emotion. If we rely on the right to vote, it is difficult to achieve any goals, which is what we do not want; second, for this point of contention, even if the Kuomintang uses its strict discipline to make all party members give up their claims, there will inevitably be unhappiness in their emotions, which is also what we do not want. Third, only the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party participated in this arduous task of constitution-making. We must pay attention to the intentions of those who did not participate, so that our resolutions can be agreed upon and accepted...

Chen Qitian: It is impossible for several parties to fully agree on a decision on one matter. It is already a good thing to seek the next best thing and achieve general satisfaction.

Calm and rational, reasonable and approachable, embodying the demeanor of a fighter for democratic politics.

The common people are not without eyes. Every movement, every silence, every word, and every smile in the assembly is being closely watched. Because they are both supervising and learning.

### The Third Master is Truly Miraculous

— Mo

The child of the Wang family in the front building could not get out of bed due to fever and chills, which made Mrs. Wang very anxious.

The good old woman in the pavilion room suggested that they had encountered filth - the Red Devil, and that they only needed to send soup and rice and burn tin foil at night. Mrs. Wang obeyed.

Sending soup and rice and burning tin foil, the fever and chills were still very severe. So the sister-in-law in the back building, seeing what was right, spoke out righteously. According to her idea, they should call a "spirit medium" to "look at the incense head." Mrs. Wang only wanted her son to get better, so she agreed to everything.

The result of the spirit medium was that the stars were bad, and that Taoists needed to resolve the stars. At the same time, they had to use a pig's head and three animals to make a vow at the temple. The more money and food they offered, the faster the disease would get better. Mrs. Wang said "O.K." to everything.

Mrs. Wang's son's condition only worsened. The landlady complained to Mrs. Wang, "The child is so sick, why don't you go to 'Third Master's' place on Baik Road to ask for a fairy prescription. 'Third Master' is truly miraculous. The hemorrhoid problem of my eldest daughter's father, no one knows how many doctors he saw without any effect. Later, 'Third Master' cured it and also granted him a child. Isn't Auntie Jie in the kitchen now three months pregnant because she asked 'Third Master'?..."

"Third Master's" fairy prescription was like plain water. After taking it, the condition only worsened. It was not until then that they thought of a doctor, but it had been more than two weeks since the disease had started.

The doctor prescribed a prescription and said to Mrs. Wang, "This prescription is only to open the way. Its effect is very weak. It is best to buy and take his secret medicine powder. The mixed material costs 100,000 yuan per dose, and the single material costs 60,000 yuan per dose. At least three doses must be taken." Mrs. Wang hoped that her son would recover as soon as possible, so she naturally bought the double material in wholesale, taking out 300,000 yuan in legal tender.

Immortals do not recognize pills and powders. Who can figure out what kind of medicine is synthesized in this medicine powder? Only heaven knows. As the saying goes, "Although no one sees the cultivation and combination, heaven knows whether the intention is good." However, the doctor's chauffeur understood, because this medicine powder was made by the chauffeur in the "iron boat." It is said that these are the main ingredients: "Winter mulberry leaves, Tianhua powder, Rehmannia glutinosa, etc." It is guaranteed that it will not harm you, but it will not cure the disease either.

Mrs. Wang's son only took two doses of the medicine powder and was sent to the funeral home. Many people said that killing a living child was a given and said that the child's "life was exhausted."

### Human Market

— Cai Lin

"Human Market" is another name for "Introduction Agency", that is, "Matchmaker Shop".

Most Human Markets are located near the vegetable market. The business hours of the Human Market are strictly before the vegetable market closes in the morning.

The goods in the Human Market are like the pickled pigs in the salt goods store in the Sixteenth Concession. The so-called stock is piled up like a mountain, including maids, older women, seamstresses, needleworkers, wet nurses, governesses, strong ones, dry ones, pretty ones, and ugly ones, young rickshaw pullers, everything you can imagine, too much to list in detail.

The owner of the Human Market is not only well-known in Shanghai, but also in the countryside. If a maid's hands and feet are not clean and she steals someone's things, she runs to the countryside with the "thirty-six tricks." The Human Market owner still has a way to bring her back to Shanghai without disturbing the "fixer." Therefore, the Human Market has excellent credit, more "flexible" than several "shaky" "banks".

The Human Market owner's "brain" is also very active. When a customer comes to the door, he treats them as warmly as the old men in the barber shop. If a female customer comes to the door, the owner will definitely call out a few old maids for an interview. Conversely, if a male customer comes to the door, he will try his best to choose a young older woman for the guest. If they hit it off and a recommendation is successful, then the owner has "ups and downs" to take, which is exactly two-sided income.

The Human Market is closed in the afternoon. There is often a table of "mahjong" in the store. Everyone gambles on credit, and they pay back the money when business comes, but "tips" are caught on the spot and never owed.

The second floor of several Human Markets on XX Road is temporarily used as a "platform" for young maids to circle on the street. If an impatient womanizer "stalks" and they talk to each other, a deal can be made. The price of a one-night stand still has to be "halved" with the boss. These few "Human Markets" are even more worthy of the name.

### Sharing Wonderful Articles

— Translated by Tian Shi from "Magazine Digest"

A certain pharmaceutical factory produced a nerve sedative; in order to promote its efficacy, it publicly solicited testimonial letters from users. The first prize-winning article is recorded as follows: "I don't know how to recommend it, but I can report a factual experience, which proves that your factory's products are of good quality and have miraculous effects. My wife is the most nervous woman in the world. No one dares to sleep with her, but since taking a bottle of your factory's sleeping potion, almost anyone can 'sleep in the same bed' with her."

### What Secrets Does the Atomic Bomb Have?

— Translated by Chen Zhongheng from the Chicago Sun-Times

"The atomic bomb has absolutely no secrets to speak of." If you don't believe it, we can get a new proof from the following dramatic story. The person telling the story is the young Dr. Philip Morris, who is an atomic expert researching atomic bombs for the government and one of the first investigators to go to Hiroshima, Japan, to investigate the destructive power of the atomic bomb.

As soon as he arrived in Hiroshima, he met Professor Nishina Yoshio of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research of Japan. This Professor Nishina Yoshio was studying atomic bombs in a "family laboratory" with equipment worth less than 20 US dollars. He has not read the Sims report, which is a description of some atomic bomb secrets by the US Department of Defense. Professor Nishina's research was based only on the consequences of the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima.

However, Professor Nishina has compiled the main facts about atomic bombs into a book. And strangely, several situations that are generally considered big secrets by Americans have already been known by Dr. Nishina. Not only that, but according to Dr. Philip, Professor Nishina has already found the "way" in all aspects of atomic bomb research, but all he has is equipment worth only twenty dollars, the amount of money an average high school student has.

The reason why Dr. Philip wants to make this story public is to let people know that as long as there is appropriate equipment, a scientist like Professor Nishina can know the secrets of atomic bombs in a short period of time.

The meaning of Dr. Philip is very obvious: since the atomic bomb has no secrets to keep, the only effective way to preserve it is to use the power of the whole world to control atomic bombs and other weapons of war.

Here and Now

### Protect Morality

— Jun Ji

Yesterday, another case of road police beating military police occurred in the Great Light Theater.

Please see the obedience of the American soldiers to their "MPs" and "SPs." Not a single soldier dares to be presumptuous in front of them. Even in defeated Japan, during the occupied period, I once saw a Japanese junior sergeant being slapped and kicked by the military police very "obediently." From this, we can see the existence of military discipline and our country.

### "God Sniper"

— Dong Jishi

In the movie "God Sniper," relying on a machine gun, he was able to capture 132 German soldiers alive. He is truly worthy of being a "God Sniper"!

In Chinese society, there are "God Snipers" instead of "God Gunners"! The skills of this kind of God Sniper are specialized in "snatching money," being able to snatch the money of thousands of people into his pocket unknowingly, without any "effort." It can truly be said to be "miraculous." He is also worthy of being a "God Sniper"!

The end of the year is approaching, and these days, the "God Snipers" are in full swing, snatching a ticket for the New Year! As the Suzhou people call it, "killing the New Year's Eve."

This group of "God Snipers" is the master of "hoarding," "manipulating," "profiteering," and "speculating," arbitrarily raising prices!

### Kind and Tactful - He Chengjuan

— Mi Shan

The National Assembly had a very heated debate over the draft constitution, and the person presiding over the tenth plenary meeting was He Chengjuan, one of the chairmen of the National Assembly.

Anyone who has paid a little attention to the history of the Republic of China will remember that He Chengjuan is a soldier of political reason. He is frugal and has a very deep city in his heart. Although he came from a military academy, he has always been good at dealing with all parties and is tactful and sophisticated, which is very rare among Chinese soldiers.

He's style name is Xuezhu, and he is from Suixian County, Hubei Province. He is sixty-five years old this year. He has been involved in the revolution for forty-three years since he was twenty-two years old, and he is very qualified. When Father [Sun Yat-sen] was building the country in Guangdong, he served as a military advisor in the Grand Marshal's Mansion, and he was lost in the crowd and failed to display his talents. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Chairman Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek] sent troops to the Northern Expedition. Seeing that He had great talent, he was promoted to chief counselor of the National Revolutionary Army and chief representative stationed in Shanghai. He was promoted to prominence and everything went smoothly. When the Gui faction rebelled, the government appointed He as the director of the Beiping Military Camp to clean up the Gui faction's rebel army in the north. The war was extinguished, and He also contacted Yan Xishan and Zhang Xueliang to help him. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, he began to enter the political arena and became the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government.

At that time, the director of finance of the Hubei Provincial Government under the leadership of He was Wu Guozhen, the current mayor of Shanghai, and the director of civil affairs was Liu Wendao, who was "fighting tigers." To use a common saying, it can be said to be a "grand lineup, unparalleled in strength."

He is generous and can endure humiliation and bear burdens. If colleagues have difficulties with him, Director He pretends to be stupid and allows them to ridicule and mock him. He has been in charge of Hubei politics for several years, unlike the domineering and arrogant style of ordinary people. He also likes to socialize and does not put on airs. There is such a legendary story: He is good at playing football and is known as "He the Invincible." He once closed a sports field for people to wander around. He also often came to compete with others in his spare time. The story happened like this: A certain division commander had a grudge against He and bribed a disciple of a Sichuan abbot named Wang, teaching him to often wander around the sports field and take the opportunity to "injure" He. Who knew that He saw Wang, loved his martial arts, and made a deep connection with him. Wang was grateful for He's kindness and remembered his master's three precepts and six prohibitions, and he couldn't help but regret it greatly. He told He all about his original intention. He was quite shocked at first, and then he was calm and had no grudges against the division commander. Those who knew about it admired He's generosity.

Someone compared He to Zhuge Wuhou of the Three Kingdoms period. Although the comparison is very far-fetched, it is not without three points of similarity.
