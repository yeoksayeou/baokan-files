### President and Wife Arrive in Shanghai from Taiwan, Meet with Mayor Wu and Others to Inquire About Everything, Will Return to Nanjing in a Few Days After a Short Rest

[Our Newspaper's Report] President Chiang, accompanied by his wife, went to Taiwan on the 21st of this month to inspect and comfort the Taiwanese people, and personally presided over the grand ceremony commemorating the restoration of Taiwan. He arrived in Shanghai at 2:10 PM on the 27th, flying in a special "Meiling" aircraft. The aircraft took off from Taipei at 11:15 AM on the 27th. The original plan was to land at Jiangwan Airport, but the landing was temporarily changed to Longhua Airport, so few people knew about it. Mayor Wu, along with Director Tie Wu of the Propaganda Bureau and others, waited at Jiangwan Airport to greet him, and immediately rushed to Longhua upon hearing the news. The President and his wife had already returned to their official residence on Dongping Road in car number 17745 to rest. However, more than a dozen people, including Zhang Bide, the head of the Protocol Section of the City Government, and Yan Xianghu, the Inspector of the Police Bureau, were still waiting at Longhua Airport.

When the President and his wife disembarked from the aircraft, they were both smiling and radiant, looking very happy. The President wore a long gown and a black jacket, with a black cloak and a gray-black felt hat. His wife wore a black coat. Shortly after the special aircraft arrived, two other aircraft carrying accompanying personnel arrived one after another. Those who came with the President and his wife included Yu Jishi, Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs; Shi Juemin, Adjutant; and more than twenty secretaries including Shen Changhuan, Zhou Hongtao, and Cao Shengfen. Chen Xizeng, Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the National Government, and others had arrived in Shanghai the day before. After arriving in Shanghai on the 27th, the "Meiling" aircraft returned to Nanjing and will fly back to Shanghai on the 28th.

After resting briefly at the official residence, the President met with Mayor Wu and the Director of the Propaganda Bureau at 2:30 PM to inquire about the situation in Shanghai. At 4:30 PM, he accompanied his wife and others in car number 17445 for a walk along Hongqiao Road, returning around 6:00 PM. He had dinner at the official residence in the evening, and after dinner, he went out again with his wife and others at 8:10 PM, returning to the residence after about an hour. Mayor Wu visited the President three times yesterday. It is reported that the President and his wife visited Madam Lu yesterday. The President will rest in Shanghai briefly and return to Nanjing in a few days. Another rumor says that the President may fly to his hometown of Fenghua today. All sectors of the city are currently making enthusiastic preparations to celebrate President Chiang's sixtieth birthday, and are extremely excited to hear of the President's arrival in Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] President Chiang and his wife flew from Taiwan to Shanghai on the "Meiling" special aircraft at 11:15 AM on the 27th. More than a hundred people, including Chen Yi, Yang Lianggong, and Lin Yizhong, went to the airport to see them off.

[Another Telegram] President Chiang and his wife left the temporary residence at 10:10 AM on the 27th. At 10:30 AM, they went to the Taiwan Provincial Government to preside over a press conference. At 10:55 AM, they left the government office after the conference and went to Songshan Airport. After reviewing the honor guard, they boarded the "Meiling" special aircraft at 11:10 AM amidst the melodious music. They took off at 11:15 AM, circled the city once, and then flew northwest. President Chiang and his wife arrived in Taiwan on the 21st and flew to Shanghai on the 27th, staying in Taiwan for a week. They visited Danshui, Taichung, Keelung and other places. Except for staying overnight at Sun Moon Lake on the 23rd, they stayed at the Caoshan temporary residence in Taipei for a total of five days. Caoshan is located in the deep valley of Samsung Mountain and Yarn Hat Mountain in the northern suburbs of Taipei, 11 kilometers from the city, 443 meters above sea level. The spring water contains sulfur and can be reached by car from the city in 40 minutes. On the morning of the 27th, the President and his wife left the mountain, and the nearby children held flags and gathered along the road to bid farewell.

### President Commends Rapid Restoration of Taiwan

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] At 10:00 AM on the 27th, before President Chiang departed from Taiwan, he received reporters at the Taipei Governor's Office. More than a dozen people, including Ye Mingxun from the Central News Agency and Li Wanju from the New Life Daily, were present. President Chiang answered the reporters' questions about his impressions of inspecting Taiwan as follows:

I am very pleased to see that the restoration work in Taiwan has been 80% completed. In particular, the transportation and water and electricity industries can be said to have been restored to the standards of the Japanese era before the war. Therefore, general economic activities can be quickly restored, and people can live and work in peace. Comparing the transportation, economy, and people's living conditions in Taiwan with those in the mainland, especially in Northeast and North China, the degree of prosperity is incomparable.

When we review the achievements of Taiwan's restoration work today, we are grateful to our ally, the United States, for assisting our country in handling the repatriation of 500,000 Japanese prisoners of war immediately after the war. This allowed the Japanese prisoners of war in Taiwan to be repatriated within a short period of time, enabling the rapid restoration of social order. This kind of assistance, which is purely out of pure friendship, is truly admirable.

Education in Taiwan has become widespread, and the social foundation is quite sound. In the future, on the one hand, we should strengthen the people's national consciousness and national concept, and on the other hand, we should improve the people's cultural and living standards. In the past, although education in Taiwan was widespread during the Japanese colonial era, the Japanese never allowed Taiwanese people to make progress and conduct research on various advanced subjects. The various political and economic measures implemented in Taiwan were all to govern Taiwan as a colony. In the future, the policy of the Taiwan Provincial Government should first focus on public opinion and cultivate public spirit. In education, we must pay attention to the spirit of mutual assistance and autonomy, so that academic thought can develop freely. In particular, we must promote the inherent virtues of the nation, so that every Taiwanese compatriot knows the importance of unity and cooperation, and enables them to have the ability to respect themselves and be independent, so as to become the backbone of national construction. I hope that you, in the position of public opinion, will assist the government in leading the people to work hard on construction, and in three to five years, Taiwan will surely become a model province.

Last year, foreigners observed Taiwan and believed that after such a major bombing and the degree of damage, our government would be unable to restore the original state of the Japanese era. Some even publicly criticized that after our government took over Taiwan for six months, transportation, water, and electricity industries would be interrupted and unable to maintain. However, today's facts prove that during the restoration period of this year, we have restored important works such as transportation and water conservancy without the help of foreigners, and various undertakings have not only not been interrupted, but have also made progress day by day, which shows that the Chinese people have the ability to construct. This fact is truly worthy of our attention.

I am in a hurry to leave today, so I cannot discuss it further. I hope you will convey to all the compatriots in Taiwan to work together to build a new Taiwan of the Three Principles of the People. My wife and I have been welcomed during our stay in Taiwan for several days, and I hope you will convey our thanks.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The new proposals from the third parties in the ongoing peace talks were initially completed on the evening of the 26th, and an emergency meeting was held at Jiaotong Bank on the morning of the 27th to discuss them.

According to Sun Ke, the content of the proposals is very close to the government's opinion. In addition, due to the loss of Andong, the Communist Party decided to express to the third parties that they "do not want to talk anymore," so ten people once made pessimistic remarks. When the third parties visited the government representatives on the 27th, they conveyed this matter. However, the government stated that it would continue to meet with the third parties and accept their mediation. At 8:00 PM, the third parties continued to hold a meeting at Jiaotong Bank to discuss everything.

### Sun Ke Issues Statement: Six Key Points of Peace Talks

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke met with reporters today and issued the first formal report on the current informal peace talks, revealing six key points related to the Kuomintang-Communist conflict. Formal negotiations can only begin after these six key points are resolved. The six key points are as follows: (1) The issue of the Communist army's garrison area in Northeast China: Sun said that the Northeast China Truce Agreement, which was established in June of this year, designated half of the two Northeast provinces as the Communist army's garrison area. However, at that time, due to the unresolved dispute over the Andong issue, the agreement was not signed. But now, according to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there is no established agreement on designating half of the two Northeast provinces as the Communist army's garrison area. The provisions in the Northeast China Truce Agreement only concern the clauses on Harbin. (2) The issue of local government: Whether it should be resolved in informal talks or left to the reorganized National Government Committee to resolve. (3) The issue of submitting the draft constitution to the National Assembly: Sun said that the government, in view of the fact that the Constitutional Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) failed to formulate a PCC draft constitution that could be accepted by all parties, advocated treating the May 5th Draft Constitution as the formal draft. (4) The CCP refuses to participate in the National Assembly before the government is reorganized. (5) The issue of whether the reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan should be carried out simultaneously: Sun said that according to the PCC resolution, the National Government Committee should be reorganized first, and then the Executive Yuan should be reorganized. Sun likened the National Government Committee to a mother and the Executive Yuan to a son, saying: "There must be a mother before there can be a son." (6) The issue of the number of seats that parties other than the Kuomintang should occupy in the Executive Yuan: Sun Ke revealed during the meeting with reporters that Luo Longji, the leader of the Democratic League, requested that the Communist Party and third parties should get seven to eight seats. At the same time, the content of the propaganda truce plan established last Friday was not announced on the scheduled date. Luo said that the agreement is still awaiting approval from Yan'an. According to the Central Daily News, the agreement includes the following three clauses: (1) The Kuomintang and the Communist Party should immediately stop the stimulating propaganda war. (2) News about the peace talks should be released by the third parties. (3) During the truce, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should issue war communiques. Regarding the second item, the CCP delegation is asking Yan'an for instructions.

### The CCP's Opinion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The CCP spokesperson refuted Sun Ke's remarks to reporters in the Nanjing Central Daily News on the 27th, and at the same time claimed that this was the CCP's first positive explanation of the government's eight articles, which briefly stated that Sun said that the first and second articles were not a problem. The Communist Party stated that in the June truce negotiations, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party agreed on a draft agreement of four items in whole or in part. Now the government only selected two of them. Regarding the other three articles, Sun said that "although an agreement was reached, it was not signed." The Communist Party believed that in the June negotiations, the government requested the Communist army to retreat to two and a half provinces, which the Communist Party fundamentally did not agree to, so there was no agreement to speak of. As for the so-called temporary stationing of the National Army in Central and North China in the current location, and the issue of local government, it was limited to within the Pass (Guannei). The Communist Party believed that the government had clearly pointed out that the Northeast was excluded. Finally, it stated that the government has always insisted on the eight demands that the Communist Party cannot agree to, and took the opportunity to occupy Andong during the negotiation process, continuing the nationwide civil war, which fully proves that the government has no sincerity. A certain government representative said that he did not know where the Communist Party's sincerity was.

### The CCP Admits Withdrawal from Andong

Expresses that it has an Impact on Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The spokesperson of the Communist Party delegation, Mei Yi, officially announced on the evening of the 27th that the Communist army had withdrawn from Andong on the afternoon of the 24th, and at the same time expressed that this had a considerable impact on the negotiations. The government representatives said that such incidents often occur because the war has not stopped. If the Communist Party can agree to the government's opinions earlier, then there would be no such thing today. At the same time, the Andong war was caused by the National Army taking self-defense counterattacks in the Andong area.

### National Army Controls Coastline from South of Andong to Zhuanghe, Soviet Army on Dajiang Bridge, We Request Its Withdrawal

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The National Army is making a comprehensive advance from south of Andong to Zhuanghe. The coastline such as Dagushan, Qingduizi, and Zhuanghe have all been taken over by the National Army on the 26th. The National Army in Zhuanghe is cleaning up the areas from the southwest to the so-called Guandongzhou border line by the Japanese. Several Soviet troops are stationed at the Dajiang Bridge leading to Korea in Andong, and we have negotiated to request their withdrawal. There should be no problems with the power generation from the hydroelectric power plant on the other side of the river, because both China and the Soviet Union need it. The war in Andong City was rapid. The fighting was only slightly fierce in places such as Motianling and Dagushan near Fengcheng. There was no contact in places such as Xiuyan. According to the troops entering Xiuyan, they advanced to more than 20 miles away from Xiuyan. Because the telephone had not been destroyed by the Communist army, they used the telephone to talk to the county head appointed by the Communist army in Xiuyan and asked him how it was going. The county head replied urgently that there were only more than 200 troops left in the city and he could not defend it. The National Army told him that we would defend it for you, and the National Army then entered the city. In addition, there are still more than 10,000 Communist troops in Andong, preparing to retreat into the mountains for guerrilla warfare. The National Army is carrying out the work of clearing them out. According to military authorities, in order to relieve the siege of Zhangyuan, the Communist army mobilized its forces to launch offensives in Xi'an and other places. As a result, the National Army was stationed in Zhangyuan, and the Communist army in Xi'an did not succeed, and lost Andong as a result. This is what is called intending to take advantage of the National Army's emptiness, but being taken advantage of by the National Army instead.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] The National Army in the southern section of the Chinese Changchun Railway received Xiongyue City on the 26th and is now advancing south along the route. It is reported that it can reach Fuxian within days.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 27th] Neutral observers here announced today that the government army authorities are now worried that the National Army's recovery of Andong may cause international disputes. These observers returned to Beiping from Shenyang last night. According to them, Andong is located near the Soviet-occupied area in northern Korea, and the National Army authorities are paying close attention to the Soviet Union's reaction. However, it is known that the Soviet army is stationed on the other side of the Yalu River and has no contact with the Chinese Communist army on this side of the Yalu River.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] After the National Army was stationed in Shenyang and on the Andong Line, the Northeast Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Transportation has sent personnel to inspect. It is reported that there are many caves along the line, which have all been destroyed by the Communist army. According to the railway bureau, the line needs 350,000 railway ties. In addition, the Shenhai Line still needs 150,000 railway ties, which is quite difficult to raise. The unused railways in the line and the Fushun and Anshan mines are now being dismantled to supplement them. As for the time limit for the restoration of the line, it is currently difficult to estimate.

### The National Government Reiterates the Prohibition of Opium, Ordering Military and Political Organs to Strictly Supervise and Thoroughly Eliminate Opium Within the Time Limit

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The National Government orders: It has been previously stipulated that opium and drugs nationwide must be thoroughly eliminated within three years after the end of the war, without any extension. Cultivation, transportation, sale, and smoking are all subject to penalties, which cannot be reduced lightly. However, to prevent the source of opium, strict prohibition of cultivation is essential. Given the vast territory of our country, investigations may not be comprehensive. In remote areas, ignorant people only seek profit, making it difficult to guarantee that they will not disregard the prohibition and secretly cultivate opium seedlings. Now is the time for sowing poppies in late autumn and early winter. If precautions are neglected, old habits are easily repeated, which will inevitably affect the future of the prohibition policy and cause significant harm. Therefore, we reiterate the order, earnestly admonishing and warning that all military and political organs nationwide must strictly supervise and thoroughly prohibit opium cultivation. Local governments at all levels must conduct comprehensive inspections within their jurisdictions. Adjacent areas of provinces, counties, and cities should be jointly responsible and work together to prevent opium cultivation. Any opium seedlings discovered must be immediately eradicated, and those who planted them must be punished according to the law. Those who rely on power and influence to protect opium cultivation or resist eradication will be severely punished to serve as a warning. It must be understood that effective prohibition of opium is the goal, and prohibiting cultivation is the primary task of eradicating drugs. The deadline is approaching, and negligence cannot be tolerated. We hope that all will strictly abide by the laws and regulations and diligently implement them to achieve early prohibition and complete success, which is our great expectation.

### Authorities Appoint Commissioners to Supervise Military Service in Designated Areas; The Country Is Divided into Ten Areas, and They Will Depart Soon

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Since the establishment of the first batch of divisions and regimental districts nationwide, the authorities have been actively planning to send personnel to supervise each district to prevent abuses.

### Ministry of National Defense Cables Military and Political Organs to Provide Guidance to the Families of Deceased Soldiers and Officers in Applying for Pensions; Excerpt of Chairman's Handwritten Instructions, Hoping for Strict Compliance

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of National Defense, because the Pension Committee has ended, all pension cases will continue to be handled by the Pension Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, specially excerpted Chairman's handwritten instructions, telegraphed to each line of command, commander's office, pacification public office, municipal government, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Social Affairs, and each general headquarters, and various offices, bureaus, and departments, urging their subordinates to guide the families of the deceased in applying for pensions, so that the families can universally benefit from the actual benefits, and to live up to the Chairman's utmost concern. The original telegram stated briefly: It has been found that there are many officers and soldiers who sacrificed their lives during the eight years of the war of resistance. Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the families of the soldiers. I hereby respectfully excerpt Chairman's handwritten instructions to Yu on July 7, 26th: (1) Commanders of each unit must report the facts of the deceased soldiers under their command at any time, as well as the situation of their ancestral homes and relatives, and quickly apply for pensions, without backlog. If the situation of their relatives is unclear, they should write to the government of their original hometown to investigate and report in detail. Do not intentionally delay due to their lack, so as not to miss them; (2) If the family members are sure that their children have died in battle, but have not yet received the pension certificate, they are allowed to report for pension; (3) If the family members do not understand writing very well, or do not know the procedures for applying for pensions and receiving documents, the local Baojia chiefs or gentry, or educational personnel, if they know, should immediately assist them in handling the matter, or in accordance with the method of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers on expeditions, the enthusiastic and capable people in each place should specially find ways to maintain their livelihoods, and should be regarded as a supplement to the matters in the committee chairman's secret telegram to the gentry and educators nationwide on January 19, and earnestly promote it. If local governments and Baojia personnel deliberately embezzle the pension funds that each family should receive, once verified, no matter how much the amount is, they will be severely punished; (4) All civil and military personnel dispatched by the central party and government agencies to inspect and review the front and rear should immediately visit and investigate the families of the deceased soldiers in various places, whether the pension funds they should receive have been received in accordance with the regulations, and whether the local government and people can earnestly abide by the preferential treatment laws and regulations, and report the implementation in detail to the committee chairman for verification. The original dispatching agencies of the central government should also list it as one of the assessments of the diligence and merit of the dispatched personnel. The above points, although brief and essential, are effective ways to implement the pension regulations, and are also the unshirkable responsibility of Zhongzheng and military and political leaders at all levels and compatriots across the country. We hope that all will comply. etc. Now that the Pension Committee has ended, all pension cases will be continued by the Pension Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters of the Ministry. We hope to urge our subordinates to guide the families of the deceased in applying for pensions, so that the families can universally benefit from the actual benefits, and to live up to the Chairman's utmost concern. In addition to sending telegrams, we also send telegrams to check and handle, and also forward the order to comply.

After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Yin Zanxun delivered an opening speech, stating: "The society has been established for more than twenty-four years. Although the society's affairs have been slightly affected due to the war, the work has never stopped, and the number of members has increased, and publications have continued to be printed. The members have worked tirelessly under difficult and arduous circumstances, which is very gratifying." He also stated. "There are only 200 people engaged in geological work in our country, and currently, only middle people can be added each year, and only 200 people can be added in ten years, which is far from the goal of increasing 1,200 people in ten years as expected. We hope that geological education and the geological community can cooperate; the personnel changes in the geological community during the war were extremely large, which affected the work. Now that the situation has stabilized, we hope that all members can stand firm in their positions and continue to work." A report on the society's affairs followed, stating that the Beiping branch has been established, and a meeting is being held in Beiping at the same time, and some papers will be read there.

Those of us over 50 are not discouraged, and we hope that young people around 30 will do more practical work. Zhu Jiaou gave a speech, saying that the annual meeting of the Geological Society is the most successful of all academic groups, and the contributions in the past nine years have been the greatest.

Editorial

### Looking at These Fourteen Days of News

After the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representatives Zhou Enlai and others and the third-party representatives went to Nanjing a week ago to resume the long-stalled peace talks, everyone believed that this was a major turning point in the current domestic situation. We, the common people, could not help but ignite a glimmer of hope, hoping that the political situation would become clear from now on. Before flying to Taiwan, Chairman Chiang met with the CCP representatives and the third-party representatives who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai and sincerely stated: "From now on, the talks will be presided over by President Sun, and we hope that they will start quickly and be completed quickly." However, time flies, and in the blink of an eye, another week has passed, and the peace talks are still stuck in the dispute between the "eight points" and the "two articles." Although the third party has made great efforts to refer to the government's "eight points" and the CCP's "two articles" to draft a compromise plan, it has not yet been submitted, and we do not know what the content is. However, from today until the National Assembly opens as scheduled, there are only two weeks left. The progress of the peace talks seems to be as slow as a snail's pace. How can we, the ordinary people who yearn for peace and democracy, not be extremely anxious?

The people of the whole country read the newspapers every day, hoping to see good news, but what they see is still that the CCP refuses to accept the concrete methods for resolving the Kuomintang-Communist issue proposed by Chairman Chiang as the basis for negotiations and insists on taking the two preconditions of the Yan'an statement as the premise. Therefore, the peace talks are stranded. On the one hand, the third-party representatives are drafting a compromise plan, and on the other hand, they are asking President Sun to telegram Chairman Chiang to return to Nanjing so that the government can make a final decision at any time. At the same time, all parties also believe that if this peace talk is to be successful, a friendly political atmosphere must be cultivated. Therefore, the method of publicizing a truce was discussed. The third party put forward three points: (1) Both sides stop propaganda warfare; (2) Subsequent news of the peace talks will be released by the third party; (3) Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can also release war reports. The government has expressed its agreement in principle, but the CCP representatives still need to ask Yan'an for instructions on the second method. The result of a week of peace talks is, at best, only this. Looking forward to Nanjing is really unbearable!

Standing on the position of the people, this newspaper has repeatedly stated that it hopes that the country can be peacefully unified and democratic, not only expecting the country to turn hostility into friendship as soon as possible, but also hoping that politics can immediately embark on the right track of constitutionalism, with a democratic and peaceful constitution, so that no political party will use weapons as a tool for political struggle, and from then on, all parties can use the parliament as the battlefield and lips and tongues instead of guns and cannons; therefore, we sincerely hope that the repeatedly postponed National Assembly will not be postponed again. Chairman Chiang formally stated yesterday morning in Taipei when hosting the press: "The National Assembly will be convened as scheduled, and the government will never change this determination due to any external obstruction, so there is no possibility of postponing the National Assembly." We were very pleased to hear this. It seems that there are only two weeks left from today until the day the National Assembly opens. Can the peace talks still be so slow? Fourteen days of work will pass in the blink of an eye, can we still delay? Therefore, we hope that the third party will make special efforts in these fourteen days to mediate and bring the opinions of both sides closer; we also hope that the CCP can take the overall situation into account and not create complications, and lose this last opportunity; at the same time, we also hope that the government can take a broad view and not argue over minor details. We must complete the task of peace talks within these fourteen days, so that we, the common people, can see the representatives of various parties gathering under Zijin Mountain on the day of Sun Yat-sen's birth to jointly discuss the fundamental law of the country and lay a solid foundation for the country's century-long plan.

In short, from today until the day the National Assembly opens on Sun Yat-sen's birthday, there are only fourteen days left. The people of the whole country are looking forward to Nanjing every day, and are waiting for good news every moment; we hope that all parties will not disappoint the people's urgent expectations too much.

### The Issue of the United Nations Veto

The Second General Assembly of the United Nations is currently being held in New York, and recent discussions seem to be focused on the so-called revision of the veto power. British Prime Minister Attlee, during a previous debate on foreign affairs in the British Parliament, expressed the British government's attitude towards the veto, believing that the veto power of the United Nations has been arbitrarily abused by a certain powerful nation. He issued a warning, stating: "Such phenomena will gradually diminish the value of the Security Council." The leader of the opposition in Britain, former Prime Minister Churchill, echoed this sentiment, forming a unified British front against the veto power. Recently, Cuba, Australia, the Philippines, and other countries have also submitted requests to the United Nations General Assembly, asking for the organization of a special committee to discuss the abolition and amendment of the veto power. The presentation of this request was immediately opposed by the Soviet Union. Soviet commentary even considers any country opposing the veto power to be an enemy of peace; this shows how firm and vehement the Soviet Union's attitude is. In Britain and the United States, it is believed that since this issue has been raised, it should be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. This position is incompatible with the Soviet Union's attitude. Therefore, the discussion and handling of the veto power issue will be a difficult problem for the Second United Nations General Assembly. How this issue will develop in the future is related to the maintenance of world peace, and it is indeed worthy of our attention.

The so-called veto power was originally a system stipulated in the United States Constitution. Its purpose is to enable the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the government to have mutual constraints and checks and balances. The establishment of the United States Constitution came after the French Revolution; at that time, political thought was deeply influenced by Rousseau and Montesquieu; and Montesquieu praised the separation of powers system. Based on this doctrine of separation of powers and checks and balances, the United States Constitution thus stipulated the political system of the United States. This means that laws passed by Congress can be vetoed by the president; however, when this law is passed again by Congress, the executive veto loses its effect, and only a judicial veto can invalidate the law. The origin of this system bears a strong 18th-century flavor. Some public law scholars in the United States also believe that this system is outdated and advocate for its amendment. However, in the United States, there is also a provision to veto the veto, so it does not lead to major problems for the country's governance.

The provision for veto power in the United Nations organization can be said to be entirely a concession to the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union felt that it had few allies in a world organization, it was difficult to manipulate the voting of the United Nations. Therefore, when planning the organization of the United Nations, it indicated that the establishment of the veto power was a necessary condition for the Soviet Union to participate in the United Nations. Under the circumstances at the time, if there had been no veto provision, the United Nations organization would have faced an insurmountable fate. British and American politicians were not unaware that if there were such provisions, the United Nations organization itself would have major deficiencies from the start, which would cause great difficulties in the future operation of the United Nations organization. However, here, as elsewhere, President Roosevelt believed that sincerity could move people. He believed that with his intelligence, he could win the support of the Soviet Union, so he did not give in on "minor details." However, realpolitik and President Roosevelt's noble ideals may not always coincide; and President Roosevelt did not live to see world peace and the future operation of the United Nations organization and passed away.

Needless to say, the provision for veto power makes the United Nations organization exist in name only and is a very unreasonable system. The inability of small and medium-sized countries to enjoy this privilege already violates the principle of national equality; at the same time, the unrestricted use of the veto power in the Security Council creates a situation where the minority oppresses the majority. As long as one country opposes it, the Security Council cannot make any resolutions or take any actions. The unreasonableness of this is conceivable. The use of the veto power in the past year has inevitably been a fatal obstacle to the United Nations organization, making it impossible to advance its work. Therefore, from the perspective of the effectiveness of the United Nations organization itself, this provision for veto power is tantamount to paralysis. If surgery is not performed, it will be difficult to restore health. In order to improve the organization of the United Nations organization itself, it would naturally be best if this provision for veto power could be abolished. However, under the current circumstances, the abolition of the veto power still seems to be an unattainable goal. For the sake of the effectiveness of the United Nations General Assembly organization, it seems that we cannot allow the unrestricted use of the veto power, and its operation must be subject to certain restrictions, which may reduce the public's condemnation of the veto power.

But whether the veto power is retained or restricted, these are all external forms. If countries can have mutual trust and faith, then the existence of the veto power will never become a problem; the reason why it becomes a problem is because of the lack of international trust and faith. As the United Nations General Assembly discusses the veto power, we must urge all countries to first establish mutual trust between each other, and then all problems can be solved easily, and the veto power will no longer become a problem.

### No Changes to Conscription in Southern Jiangsu; Suspension Only Applies to Nanjing and Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 27th] A Shanghai newspaper published on the 26th a conversation with the Director of the Conscription Bureau, Xu Siping, stating that conscription in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas would be temporarily suspended due to insufficient preparations. The news has drawn close attention from people in this county and the surrounding counties of Wuxi, Wujin, and Wuxian, causing quite a stir. This newspaper's special correspondent in Suzhou, seeking verification, visited the commander of the garrison area in Suzhou, Du Xu, on the 26th, but was unable to meet him due to official business. On the morning of the 27th, he visited again and was granted an audience. Commander Du said: The areas for which Director Xu spoke about delaying conscription are limited to Nanjing and Shanghai. It is regrettable that the Shanghai newspaper mistakenly added the phrase "and surrounding areas," causing confusion and doubts, and he hoped for a correction. Currently, among the three counties under the jurisdiction of this area—Suzhou, Wujiang, and Wuxian—Wuxian has the best conscription performance. The quota for that county is 800, and half have been recruited by the previous day. Suzhou's quota is 980, and although they have been continuously sending recruits to the county for inspection and acceptance, the urban area has not been mobilized, so only about 200 have been collected. Wujiang's quota is 450, but no recruitment report has been received at all. He has decided to personally go to that county on the 28th to supervise. In short, the deadline for conscription is the end of this month, and each county must recruit according to the deadline. The reporter then asked how the training work for the newly recruited soldiers would be carried out. Commander Du replied: For the time being, the three counties will conduct preliminary induction education locally and physical education. Suzhou will form six companies, Changshu will form two companies, and Wujiang will form two companies. The garrison area headquarters will assign personnel to each county to supervise the training. Once the induction education is completed, they may choose a location to concentrate on implementing formal infantry training. Commander Du added: Military service is the duty of every citizen, so we must not fill the ranks with unqualified personnel. We must ensure that all recruits are formal county residents and eligible young men. He hoped that the county magistrates would pay close attention to this matter.

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 27th] The Wuxi County Government, the district offices, and the township offices have been actively promoting conscription in recent days. However, because it is difficult to recruit volunteers, it has been decided to draw lots on the 29th, selecting one candidate from each bao. Qian Sunqing, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, after seeing a report a few days ago that a senior military service official told reporters that the Conscription Law is only a basic law and that more than 20 other laws related to military service have not yet been finalized and promulgated, believes that the proper handling of military service may have to wait. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned conversation, he sent a letter to the district chief of the urban area, Shen, today, calling his attention to the matter and informing the county government for reference.

[Our Newspaper, Songjiang Dispatch] Conscription in this county was carried out on the 26th by the district offices drawing lots in each township. Three people were selected from each township. Among them, Yue Temple, Piyun, Kuatang, and Huayang towns, as well as Lita Hui, Baiwo, Longxing, and Xiaoxijing townships, each had three volunteers, so they were exempt from drawing conscripts for military service. The draftees selected from the other townships have been issued conscription orders, which have been handed over to the township chiefs to transfer to the draftees, who are to report on the 29th.

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo Dispatch] This county has been ordered to implement temporary conscription, with a quota of 1,055 people. We began handling applications for exemption from military service on the 5th of this month. The original deadline was the 20th. The county assembly, at a temporary meeting, decided that the application procedures were complicated and it was difficult to complete them by the deadline. Therefore, they telegraphed a request for an extension of 15 days.

[Our Newspaper, Pinghu Dispatch] With the draft looming in this county, the county government, to urge each township to handle the matter seriously, has established six supervisory groups, each with a leader and a member. They have been dispatched to supervise each township and district starting on the 25th and will complete their work by the 16th of next month.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Counties to Strengthen Security on Transportation Lines; Suzhou Townships Strictly Prevent the Resurgence of Scattered Bandits

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 27th] In order to ensure rural security after the suppression of bandits and to prevent the resurgence of scattered bandits, the Suzhou County Government has formulated specific measures and ordered the organization of joint township offices in townships with unstable security and important strongholds. The participating units are not limited, but are mainly those whose transportation geography is interconnected. The only principle is to concentrate local self-defense forces and coordinate them in a unified manner at any time to ensure complete safety. At the same time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also telegraphed each county, ordering them to earnestly improve the organization of road protection villages along the transportation lines. On the one hand, this is to prevent scattered bandits from fleeing, and on the other hand, it is to ensure the safety of the transportation lines. The order also specifically warns that if any changes are caused by negligence, the heads of each jurisdiction will be held accountable.

### Shanghai-Zhenjiang Long-Distance Telephone Lines to Be Increased; Zhenjiang Telegraph Office to Establish a Command Bureau

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Zhenjiang Telegraph Office has been ordered to establish a Command Bureau. The bureaus and offices under its jurisdiction are Danyang, Jurong, Longtan, Taizhou, Taixing, Yangzhou, Xiannvmiao, Gaoyou, Shaobo, Baoying, and Lianghuai, which will adopt direct command methods for communication guidance, without separate written documents. According to Director Ni, the main reason for establishing the Command Bureau is to save time and operate smoothly. He then spoke to reporters about the current telegraph and telephone business. Before the war, the bureau had 1,200 telephone sets in the provincial capital. After the restoration, due to limited equipment and restrictions from the ministry, there are only 700 sets currently. The existing palace-style internal exchange, with a capacity of 1,500 lines, can only use 800 lines, and there are about 700 local telephone lines. According to Qian Jie, the person in charge of the bureau's telephone business, 400 lines of the exchange were damaged by the enemy and have not yet been repaired due to a lack of parts. Regarding long-distance telephones, there is only one line between Shanghai and Zhenjiang, and callers have to wait two or three hours or more, leading to complaints from users. It has been proposed to the ministry to add three more lines, which will be realized soon. However, there are already three lines between Nanjing and Zhenjiang, which is faster. As for telegrams, improvements are being made step by step. Before the war, the total number of telegrams received each month was over 7 million. After the bureau's restoration, 30,000 telegrams per month was still insufficient. Currently, it can handle over 50,000 telegrams per month. Gaobao, Huai'an, and Taizhou have all restored telephone and telegraph services, and the number will gradually increase as needed in various counties in northern Jiangsu.

### Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Cause Trouble with the Intention of Blackmail: Over 800 Prisoners on Hunger Strike

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 27th] About 800 prisoners at the Siqian Street Detention Center of the Suzhou High Court have engaged in a group hunger and water strike from the morning of the 26th to the afternoon of the 27th. This newspaper's special correspondent in Suzhou inquired about the inside story from various sources and learned the details as follows: It turned out that a prisoner charged with treason, Zhou Zhongshan, from Anhui Province, had been detained for more than half a year. His wife, who worked as a helper in Nanjing, came to Suzhou for the first time to visit her husband on the morning of the 26th. Cheng Weiying, the director of the detention center, said that the visitation period was stipulated as every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which was difficult to make an exception. He did not grant the request, but only allowed the items brought by her to be passed into the prison by the guard. Unexpectedly, when Zhou learned that his wife had come to Suzhou to visit him, he was overjoyed and demanded to be allowed a face-to-face meeting. When this was not granted, he roared in the prison. Director Cheng, seeing that Zhou was disrupting order, interrogated him and warned him, and put him in shackles and confined him to a solitary cell as a punishment. When the incident was heard by all the prisoners, they felt that Zhou had been separated from his family for more than half a year, and they had traveled thousands of miles to visit him. Even if the request to meet violated the regulations, it was unavoidable due to human feelings. Now, not only was it not allowed, but he was also being punished. This aroused public outrage, and they unanimously began a hunger and water strike. From the morning of the 26th to the afternoon of the 27th, for a full day and night, more than 800 prisoners did not drink a drop of water. After Sun Honglin, the president of the High Court, found out, he immediately went to the detention center to persuade the prisoners with sincere words and ordered Zhou to be unshackled and returned to his cell. All the prisoners were deeply moved and began to resume eating and drinking on the afternoon of the 27th, and this disturbance finally subsided. After the incident, the reporter visited Sun and talked about his views on the incident. He said that prison management is originally a very difficult task, but at a time when social security is not yet stable, in fact, we have to take strict measures to prevent hidden dangers. The prisoners have been caught in the legal net and do not know how to be discreet, taking advantage of the opportunity to cause trouble with the intention of blackmail. This trend must not be allowed to grow. He has now strictly ordered Director Cheng to pay attention to the prisoners' usual education work in order to naturally reform them.

### Hangzhou City Land Value Tax: Agreed Upon Three Principles

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Dispatch] The Hangzhou City government and the City Council have repeatedly argued over the standards for levying the Hangzhou City land value tax. The county-level proposal has been pending for a long time. The City Government, believing that the collection of land tax is imminent, submitted a request to the City Council's extraordinary general meeting for reconsideration on the 25th. Following previous negotiations, it was provisionally approved based on the principles decided by the provincial government conference. The main decisions involved three principles: (1) The land value tax rate should be 1.5% as stipulated by the Land Law (which is 100 times the pre-war rate). (2) Each yuan of land tax should be levied with one "shi dou" of grain, and the borrowing would be exempted. (3) The land tax revenue should be distributed to the national, provincial, and city governments in a ratio of 3:2:5.

### Wuxi Abolishes "Book Allowance": Petitioning by District Secretaries Causes Uproar

[Our Newspaper Wuxi Dispatch] The field tax for this county this year has been officially levied. The registers created by the district secretaries have also been successively submitted to the County Land Tax Office for review. However, the district secretaries creating the field tax registers have historically received a "book allowance" to maintain their livelihood. Previously, the authorities abolished this bad practice, eliminating the book allowance. The district secretaries, concerned about their livelihoods, petitioned to have the decision reversed and requested relief. The County Government also submitted a request to the provincial government to allocate 30 million yuan as expenses for creating the registers, approximately 70,000 yuan per "tu" (a unit of land). The temporary council recently decided to temporarily allow the district secretaries to collect a subsidy fee of 50 yuan in legal tender per mu (a unit of land) from each household this year. However, the district secretaries believed that this meager amount could not sustain their families. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, more than 200 district secretaries from the entire county, holding paper flags, went to the city district office to petition. They then went to the County Government to petition. They were accompanied by District Chief Shen and received by Deputy Director Shen of the County Land Tax Office. Because the case involved a resolution from the temporary council, no definite answer was given. As they were about to go to the temporary council to petition, they suddenly saw Council Speaker Jiang [name obscured] in a chauffeured car. They immediately surrounded him, causing a chaotic scene. Speaker Jiang, seeing the unfavorable situation, waved his hands and shouted, "Let's talk this over!" He said that he sympathized with everyone and that the registers could be withheld until the allowance issue was resolved. He also said that if the authorities arrested them, he would be responsible for bailing them out. Hearing this, the district secretaries reluctantly returned. Afterwards, the Land Tax Office stated that the submission of the registers by the district secretaries could not be delayed any further. Anyone who resisted would be arrested by the grain police and prosecuted for obstructing official duties. The day before yesterday, all 416 "tu" district secretaries in the county issued an appeal to all sectors of society, calling for fair-minded people to provide righteous assistance, arguing that the statements made by Jiang and Shen were contradictory and left them at a loss. County Magistrate Xu Yuanruo, who recently went to the countryside to inspect, was furious after learning of the situation yesterday in Xicang. He sent a special commissioner back to the city with a personal note, ordering Secretary Huang to have Deputy Director Shen and District Chief Shen reconvene a meeting to warn the district secretaries about the incident of petitioning and surrounding Speaker Jiang, and forbid any further acts of coercing the authorities by gathering a crowd. The promises made by Speaker Jiang were considered invalid and the matter would be subject to mediation.

### Hong Kong Plans to Build New Airport

[Hong Kong Dispatch] After the war, Hong Kong's aviation industry is becoming increasingly developed, and various civil aviation companies are hoping to build a new airport. The facilities at Kai Tak Airport have been deemed inadequate in recent years, and its location is not ideal, with mountains to the north and a runway that is too short for planes to take off and land. The Hong Kong authorities are planning to build a new-style airport. Engineers from the Public Works Department have already begun to formulate plans. The location for the new airport is a long stretch of land along the Deep Water Bay waterfront, requiring approximately 4 million pounds. The project is quite complex, requiring the blasting of 4 million cubic feet of rock. It will take eighteen months to complete the process of filling the Deep Water Bay waterfront with the blasted rock. After the new airport is built, the original site of Kai Tak Airport will be converted into a new residential area.

### Suzhou Trial for Shooting Husband Concludes: Verdict to be Announced on the 31st; Female Protagonist Asks for Lenient Sentence

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The trial of Ye Suming, the female protagonist in the sensational shooting of her husband, which previously caused a great stir, took place at the Wu District Court on the afternoon of the 25th. The one-day trial was presided over by female Judge Wang Xiuqing, and the verdict is set to be announced on the 31st of this month. Details are as follows: Ye Suming, a woman from Nanhai, Guangdong, is currently 19 years old. She used to work as a ticket seller at a theater in Guangxi. In late August of the 34th year of the Republic, she met Xu Maolin, a captain in the motor transport corps who had recently returned from India and Burma, through a friend's introduction. They fell in love at first sight and got engaged and started living together. She followed him to Shanghai and Nanjing, and eventually to Suzhou, where he was stationed, renting a house in a civilian residence in Xibaidu. Initially, they were very affectionate, but after arriving in Suzhou, Xu's feelings suddenly cooled, and he repeatedly stated that he wanted a divorce. In mid-July of this year (only half a month after arriving in Suzhou), they mutually wrote divorce papers in an agreement, and Xu immediately left Suzhou for Shanghai. He returned to Suzhou after staying in Shanghai for more than ten days and coincidentally ran into Ye outside [obscured character] Gate. They went to the suburbs for a walk, and after arriving at home late at night without anyone to open the door, Ye slept with Xu in the troop's dormitory. The next day, on August 11th, at around 3:00 PM, Ye was still lying in bed, playing with Xu's revolver. She accidentally pulled the trigger, and the bullet hit Xu Maolin's chest, a vital spot, who was sitting in a swivel chair in front of the bed, and he died on the spot. Three colleagues were in the same room at the time, napping. They were awakened by the sound and saw Ye standing still by the door with the gun, while Xu was dead in the chair. They first snatched the weapon and attempted to assess Xu's injuries, at which point Ye seized the opportunity to flee to the train station. After dispatching personnel to apprehend her, they found Ye standing motionless in the station and arrested her, taking her to the local prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution, and then to the criminal court for trial. Judge Wang asked if she had a motive of hate. Ye replied, "We only lived together for more than ten months before separating. Although I cannot avoid the pain, I do not hate him, hating is useless. As for the shooting, it was purely accidental. If I intended to kill him, why would I do it in his troop's dormitory during the day? This shows that it was truly unintentional." At this point, the court asked if she had any requests. Ye replied, "Please have mercy on me for being young and ignorant, causing this great disaster, and also for being more than four months pregnant. I ask for a lenient sentence." After the prosecutor's arguments and the defense lawyer's arguments, the court concluded the hearing and set the pronouncement for 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month.

### Zhejiang Province Road Construction: Old Appearance Expected to be Restored Next Year

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 27th Dispatch] Before the war, Zhejiang Province had 830 kilometers of roads, which were among the best in the country. Many were destroyed during the war.

### Songjiang Demolishes City Walls to Build Roads

[Our Newspaper Songjiang Dispatch] The city walls of this county have been dilapidated for many years and are of no practical use.

### Wuxi Arrests a Traitor

Yin Jiating Also Charged with Drug Addiction

[Our Newspaper Wuxi Dispatch] Yin Jiating, a local resident, willingly collaborated with the enemy during the puppet regime period. He served as the chief of the general affairs section of the Anhui Rihua Miscellaneous Grain Trade Purchasing and Transportation Office, the chief of general affairs of the Rihua Joint Stock Company, and the director of grain purchasing and transportation in Linhuai Pass on the Jinpu Railway.

### Luo Beichen Goes to Suzhou to Expand Insurance Business

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 27th Dispatch] In order to help stabilize family life and reduce the impact of life problems on family finances, the Central Trust Bureau is extensively expanding its life insurance business. The Life Insurance Department of the Bureau has drafted a price index group life insurance charter, which has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Luo Beichen, the manager of the department, came to Suzhou from Shanghai on the 26th. At a tea party held at 3:00 PM, he invited members of the local press and prominent figures from local legal and political organizations to explain the price index group life insurance business in detail. He pointed out that its special feature is that the government's treatment of civil servants is meager. In the event of a life change, not only is there no money for funeral expenses, but also the maintenance of the surviving family becomes difficult. The compensation stipulated in the compensation regulations is only a drop in the bucket, and does not meet the living conditions of the present era. Therefore, this method is specifically designed to provide relief. It is completely different from ordinary commercial life insurance. Currently, the insured amount is tentatively set from 500,000 yuan to 5 million yuan. The premium is 2 per thousand per month. It is hoped that various [obscured characters] factories and other organizations can bear or subsidize the insurance premiums of employees, regarding it as a legitimate welfare expense. The China Trust Bureau has now suggested to the Ministry of Finance to forward [obscured characters] to the National Defense Commission, asking it to issue a notice to the employees of all provincial and municipal [obscured characters] affiliated [obscured characters] that the insurance premiums for life insurance [obscured characters] regular expenses can be implemented once it is approved. Mr. Luo, in his capacity as the chairman of the National Insurance Association Federation, called for attention to the issue of stamp duty on insurance businesses, stating that the current stamp duty on the insurance industry is a double levy. In addition to the insurance policy requiring a payment of one-twentieth of the premium, the premium receipt also requires a tax rate of 3 per thousand. This is a major threat to the insurance industry, which serves society and benefits the people. A resolution has been made after the convocation of a national temporary representatives' meeting to [obscured character] representatives to petition in Beijing, requesting the abolition of the stamp duty of the insurance industry [obscured characters] progress [obscured character], and according to the pre-war regulations, the maximum amount of the two taxes is 15,000 yuan.

### Jintan Field Tax Collection Begins

[Our Newspaper Jintan Dispatch] This county's field tax was previously exempted for one year by order of the central government, but will be officially collected from this autumn onwards.

### Opium Found Hidden in Mailed Package: Secret Discovered During On-the-Spot Inspection

[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch] The [obscured character] Gate Post Office in this city received a package No. 1606 from Xuzhou Post Office on the 23rd of this month. The package cloth was marked with the sender's information as Hao Zengfan of Xiechengtai, 16 Sidao Street, Xuzhou, addressed to Xu Jian, 98 Hulong Street, Suzhou. The contents were declared as leather clothing. The bureau immediately notified the addressee to come to the bureau to claim the package in person according to regulations. At 9:00 AM on the 25th, a person speaking with a guest accent came to the bureau with the claim form. The staff of the bureau immediately instructed the person to unpack the package and verify whether the contents matched the declared items according to regulations. However, when he unpacked it halfway, he suddenly became flustered and attempted to escape. The staff of the bureau also realized that something was wrong and restrained him, ordering him to continue unpacking. As a result, a package of opium wrapped in newspaper was found inside the leather clothing, weighing 360 grams (approximately 10 taels minus a little). The bureau immediately dispatched personnel to report to the responsible Fourth Sub-Bureau, and the police were dispatched to the bureau to take the recipient to the station. After questioning by Officer Wang, the person identified himself as Peng Zhaoli, 46 years old, from Pi County, a firewood merchant, currently residing at Jiajia Lou 4 Bao 4 Jia 5 Hu, Wannian Town. He confessed that the opium was privately trafficked in partnership with Hao Zengfan of Xuzhou. The police station also detained Xu Jian. According to his statement, he received the package slip the day before yesterday, but he did not know Hao Zengfan. Peng Zhaoli was a friend in the same industry. Yesterday, he came to his house and took away the package slip, and also borrowed his seal, which he did not allow. However, Peng secretly carved a seal and went to claim the package. He knew nothing about the private trafficking of opium. After interrogation, because the case involved private trafficking of drugs, he was sent to the Fourth Sub-Bureau for investigation.

[Our Newspaper Dang [obscured character] Dispatch] The County Farmers' Association, etc., previously telegraphed requesting the opening of the Baimao Sluice Gate to discharge water because low-lying fields were flooded by storms, reaching more than 400,000 mu. However, the gate was under construction and could not be opened.

Admonishing Parents to Beware of Kidnappers

I have a piece of social news, is it possible to publish it in your esteemed journal? I read on the ninth page of your newspaper on the 16th, "Hong Kong Air News on the 7th" which stated: "...Macau has an organization for kidnapping children... they send people to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou to find ways to kidnap children who 'meet the requirements.' According to my inquiries: A child of seven or eight years old, clever and with decent features, regardless of gender, is worth nearly one million national currency."

This kind of incident has clearly become a most serious problem in current society. Now in Yangzhou, children have repeatedly gone missing recently. As far as I know, in the past two weeks, four boys around the age of ten have disappeared. One of them is my relative, Zhou Zhengfu, a boy of eleven years old, from Hubei, who was in the sixth grade at Jiangdu County Elementary School and disappeared on October 1st on his way to school. We have searched extensively in all directions, but still, there is no trace. The child is clever and has decent features, also "meeting the requirements." Whether the aforementioned kidnappers have already sneaked into the mainland and abducted him, is unknown. But it can be concluded that similar kidnappers already exist in Yangzhou, carrying out their work. I advise parents with children to pay special attention, and I hope the local public security authorities will not ignore this report. (Zhang Yunyu)

No Reason for Another Ferry Price Increase

The city ferry, since April 1st of this year, has increased the price for crossing the river from 30 yuan to 100 yuan (4 cents pre-war). The long-distance line from Shanghai to Xidu has increased from 80 yuan to 200 yuan (8 cents pre-war). The current monthly income of the city ferry is around 200 million yuan, and the monthly expenditure is about 150 million yuan, with a surplus of 50 million yuan, used for repairs and allocation. Now, it is heard that the city ferry will raise prices again from November due to insufficient expenses. Among the Shanghai public utilities, such as ferries, trams, water, and electricity, the city ferry has the highest fees, exceeding pre-war fees by more than 2,500 times. If prices are raised again, there is no reason. Public utilities are not originally intended for profit. In the current situation, the city ferry should always consider the welfare of the citizens and social order and should not raise prices first, causing unrest among the people. (Pan Bosheng)

Grain Prices Are Disproportionate to Commodity Prices

I am an old commoner from the countryside, who has suffered greatly under the enemy. Everyone knows that China is an agricultural country. During the eight years, we villagers suffered under the enemy's tyranny and the monopoly of unscrupulous merchants, who devalued the price of rice every year at harvest time to be worse than the bran fed to pigs. This was originally the enemy's way to push China towards self-destruction and bankrupt our tenant farmers. Looking at the rice shortages in various rural areas in recent years, eight out of ten families are living hand to mouth, borrowing rice from others, isn't this a joke? You need to know that when they look forward to the harvest, the price of rice is devalued again! Paying off rice debts and various debts, plus buying some New Year's goods, they say that sixty to seventy percent of the harvest has already been spent. By the time a portion is left for next year's planting, the annual life is again trapped in the bitter situation of patching things together. Year after year, isn't it like Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year, getting worse and worse? Unexpectedly, more than a year has passed since the victory, and there is still no effect on improving life. The soaring prices of various commodities and the devaluation of rice prices, to what low level of cheapness, are unknown! The harvest season is approaching, and following the enemy's and puppet era's practice, relying on unscrupulous merchants' tricks, prices of all goods rise, and the fixed price of military rice allows military rice merchants to take the opportunity to hoard! In short, everything, during this rice harvest season, will cause you villagers to not be able to exchange all your sweat and blood for even two or three tenths of the value! No wonder people are anxious and cannot settle down! China's foundation is in danger, I hope the authorities will no longer ignore it. (Wu Weijiang)

The Lament of Small Businessmen in Shou County

I am a small businessman from Yingheji, Shou County, running a grocery store, selling cigarettes, sweets, and local wine. When business is good, I can make a living. Now business is not good, because the flood in Shou County is too heavy, and the heavy taxes are too great. Since last month, a Director Gao came to the commodity tax bureau, and he is truly formidable, leading tax soldiers like wolves and tigers all day, searching door to door, causing unrest. When they see cigarettes bought from other ports, even if the small box has a inspection certificate affixed to it, they say it is illegal and must have a stamp. If there is no stamp, either they collect the tax or they impose a fine. In fact, what kind of stamp he is referring to, no one has ever seen. Even eight to ten pounds of white sugar must be reported for tax and must also have a distribution document. Poor small businessmen selling a few pounds of sugar, where would they get a distribution document? Zhongshan cigarettes from the Daxing Tobacco Factory in Yingheji, have never been seen with inspection certificates affixed, and they are sold in the market just the same, and no one says they are illegal. There are nearly two hundred wine merchants in the nearby dozen townships, and each merchant must pay 17,000 yuan, even 23,000 yuan per month, saying they have a receipt, but they never show it. Is this what they mean by simplified collection methods? It is truly perplexing. (Ren Xin)

Six Contributions to Nursery Schools

Nursery schools are a public social service to solve the suffering of working civilians, but all the nursery schools in the city are unsound. They are not suitable for civilians, and there is no reasonable solution for children's hygiene, education, and parents' finances and time. This is a common problem in all nursery schools in the city. I hope that the old ones can improve and the new ones can find ways to avoid these problems. You should know that running a public service requires responsibility and serving as public servants.

Now I will put forward a few points of my opinion for the consideration of those who run nursery schools: (1) The building must be relatively spacious, and the environment should be quiet and the air fresh. (2) The fees must not exceed 60,000 yuan (this is the highest limit of the economy of civilians, and nursery schools are of course established for civilians). (3) The location should be in the suburbs but also near the center, with a branch office set up in a temporary school or church. Every Saturday noon, parents can come to pick up their children and take them home. And on Monday morning, the children can be handed over to the office, and the office will use a vehicle to transport them back to the nursery school. (4) The nursery should refuse any rewards, so that nurses do not give special preferential treatment to one child, which would lead to class problems. (5) Security deposits should not be charged. A surety method can be used to reduce the burden on parents. (6) Absolute attention must be paid to children's diet, nutrition, and physical records. The above points are only a general outline. I hope that those who are interested in social work will pay attention to them. (Yu Wenhua)

Refusal to Accept Customs Gold Units for Fine Payment

Previously (on the 19th), I drove to the bicycle registration and tax inspection office on Jiangning Road to pay the tax for the second half of this year. Because it was past the specified date, I had to pay a fine of 2,000 yuan according to the regulations. I submitted five 20 yuan Customs Gold Unit notes to the fine payment window for exchanging the license, and the collector glared at me and said: "This place only accepts legal tender, not Customs Gold Units." May I ask, are Customs Gold Units and legal tender not of equal value? Since I only had Customs Gold Unit notes with me, I had to leave the office and exchange them at a nearby cigarette stall before paying. I respectfully request that the responsible authorities clarify this matter to avoid causing taxpayers more trouble! (Yinsheng respectfully)

### To Prevent the Abuse of Veto Power Britain Formulates Secret Plan Gu Weijun Scheduled to Deliver Speech Today

[Central News Agency, London, 26th United Press] According to British Foreign Office personnel: Britain has formulated a secret plan to prevent the Soviet Union from "recklessly" using its veto power in the Security Council. Britain's plan will be implemented at the United Nations General Assembly at an appropriate time. The content of the plan cannot be disclosed at present, otherwise, it will hinder its final success. In addition, British foreign policy experts admit that the hope of this plan's immediate success is extremely slim. The British Foreign Office does not believe that the Soviet Union's withdrawal of its opposition to the United Nations' discussion of the veto power is an indication of a change in Soviet attitude. The general public believes that the Soviet Union's participation in this world organization is entirely based on the fundamental principle of unanimous agreement among the major powers, as claimed by Moscow. The first step in Britain's strategy may be to make a strong representation to the Soviet Union, stating that the vast majority of countries in the United Nations oppose the Soviet Union's policy of using the veto power as a political weapon. However, some observers believe that the Soviet Union has no reason to change its policy because of this. Public opinion outside the Soviet sphere of influence has no effect on the Kremlin. Moscow Radio discussed Cuba and Australia's proposal in New York today to abolish the veto power, clarifying the Soviet Union's attitude on this issue, stating that they were selected to engage in this kind of work in order to cover up the reactionary Anglo-American group's attempt to undermine the consensus of the major powers, because the principle of unanimous agreement among the major powers cannot adapt to their self-governing world attempts.

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th Special Dispatch] Among the ten people scheduled to speak to the United Nations General Assembly on the morning of the 28th, our chief representative Gu Weijun is also one of them. It is expected that Gu will discuss China's position on the veto power issue. Gu will be the second speaker among the representatives of the five major powers, the first being Britain's Baker. For the past three days, most of the speakers have been representatives of small countries, and the discussions have focused on the veto power issue and the Spanish issue. The coordinating or steering committee, composed of 14 countries, will hold secret meetings on the mornings and evenings of the 28th to continue reviewing the provisional agenda. So far, the committee has approved 45 of the 53 items on the agenda. The Security Council will also reconvene under the new chairman, Cadogan, after a long recess, to discuss Switzerland's proposal to participate in the International Court of Justice as a non-member state. According to the Charter, non-member states can also participate in the court after being recommended by the Security Council and approved by the General Assembly.

[United Press, New York, 26th] As the United Nations General Assembly concludes its first week of debate, the veto power of the five major powers remains the number one explosive issue, and the growing pressure may force a clear definition of the use of the veto power. After days of speeches by representatives from 13 countries and several tense committee meetings, it is clear that there is little possibility of amending the Charter to abolish the veto power at this time. The Soviet Union has used its veto power nine times in the Security Council. The current goal seems to be to force it to agree to amend the way the veto power is used. Norway, Chile, and Turkey joined the movement to limit the use of the veto power today. The representatives who spoke earlier also expressed regret over the "excessive" and "arbitrary" use of the veto power. According to Norwegian representative Lange, the time is not yet ripe to amend the United Nations Charter, but he asked the major powers to establish an agreement on the use of the veto power themselves, using it only as a last resort. Turkish representative Bedu said that humanity often depends on the will of the majority, and there is no reason to include the veto power as an exception, but in the transitional period, the veto power may not be abolished immediately. At least, a method should be considered to limit the scope of its use. Chilean representative Holivo also said that the most important task of the United Nations organization is to determine human rights and its basic freedoms. Chile does not support amending the Charter at this time but hopes that the major powers will do their best to limit the use of the veto power.

### India Contends for a Seat on the Security Council The UK Decides to Give Full Support The Indian Flag Flies in Front of the UN General Assembly

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 26th] Among the flags of 50 countries in front of the United Nations venue, there is also the Indian flag. However, according to an Indian representative, the flag is not the Indian national flag, but the flag of the Governor-General of India. As far as the Indian delegation is concerned, this matter is not of any importance. India currently does not have a national flag and is planning to design a flag that can represent the national government and includes the flags of the Congress Party and the Muslim League.

Regarding India's application for a seat on the Security Council, the British delegation has decided to support it. The UK will oppose the Soviet Union's suggestion to nominate Norway as a director. British sources often mention three candidate directors, namely Belgium, Colombia, and Syria. The UK may withdraw its support for Belgium because, for the benefit of Western democracies, Europe already has the UK and France participating in the Security Council. It is reported that the United States will support Colombia to succeed Mexico, whose term has expired.

### Foreign Secretary Bevin Departs for the United States

[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to travel by plane from here to Southampton Port tomorrow morning with his private secretary Dickson and Assistant Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Sir Harvey to board the postal ship "Aquitania" to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. The ship will stop at Cherbourg, France, to pick up representatives from other countries attending the United Nations General Assembly and go to New York together.

### British Policy Toward Spain

Unaffected by Trades Union Congress Resolutions

[Reuters, London, 26th] Although the Trades Union Congress in Brighton resolved to demand that the British government immediately sever relations with Spain, it is expected that Foreign Secretary Bevin will not be affected by this resolution. The British government has repeatedly stated that severing relations with Spain would only strengthen the Franco regime's position in Spain. The British government and trade union organizations have the same attitude toward the Franco regime, the only difference is in the methods. The House of Commons and the Labor Party have recently heard Bevin explain his attitude towards Spain and have expressed their support for this policy.

### The United States Will Not Give Up Governance of Pacific Islands

[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 26th United Press] It is learned that the United States will soon take preliminary steps to hand over the Caroline and Marshall Islands to the proposed United Nations Trusteeship Council for management. Officials said that this kind of actual trusteeship may not be formulated immediately for a considerable period of time. The Pacific islands, which were obtained through hard battles, will still be governed by the United States during the transition period. The United States' announcement of its intention to hand over the island's land for trusteeship does not mean that the United States is giving up governance.

### US Ambassador to Yugoslavia to Return Home for Consultations

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th Special Dispatch] The US State Department announced today that the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Patterson, will fly back to Washington from Belgrade. Patterson's return home is only a private action and is not of any importance. However, it is believed that Patterson's return home, like the return home of Ambassador Smith to the Soviet Union and Ambassador Leen to Poland in the past two weeks, is not accidental. The return home of the ambassadors to the Soviet Union and the pro-Soviet countries of Yugoslavia and Poland may indicate the tension in US-Soviet relations and discussions among senior officials on a policy of patience and firmness towards the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Belgrade, 26th] President Tito has recently made repeated speeches, criticizing the failure of the Paris Peace Conference and saying that our rights have not been correctly recognized by our wartime allies. The Atlantic Charter is just an empty promise.

The Security Council of the United Nations Organization in Lake Success, New York, opens.

Secretary-General Lie (third from left in the first row), Soviet representative Gromyko (fifth from left in the first row), and others attended most of the meeting.

### To Maintain World Peace The US Must Ensure Naval Strength President Truman Issues Navy Day Message

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Yesterday was the US Navy Memorial Day. US military leaders declared that to maintain world peace, the US military strength must be maintained. President Truman praised the US Navy in a special message and hoped that the people of the whole country would carry forward the spirit of serving the country.

Nimitz Emphasizes the Importance of the Navy

[Agence France-Presse, Indianapolis, USA, 26th] Today is US Navy Day, and Admiral Nimitz delivered a speech here, saying that until an international police force is established, the US Navy should still be prepared to mobilize at any time. As long as mankind needs to transport materials from one continent to another via sea routes, the US Navy will still be indispensable. The naval authorities should not underestimate the danger of the atomic bomb. We should know in what direction naval strategy will develop to avoid new dangers. Submarines must operate in very deep waters to be effective. The US Navy's current strength is equivalent to one-sixth of its wartime strength.

The United States Must Obtain Control of the Two Oceans

[Reuters, Boston, 26th] US Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Vice Admiral Sherman delivered a speech here today, saying that the United States must obtain sea and air control over the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Without our people in Europe, Europe cannot maintain balance and stability. Obtaining sea and air control of the two oceans is a prerequisite for protecting the Western Hemisphere. Others may bomb the United States from the air via the Arctic, but if the United States is strong enough to retaliate, it will not be a major problem.

Atomic Submarines Are New Weapons of War

[Reuters, Kansas City, 27th] Rear Admiral Starr, Director of Underwater Warfare of the US Navy, delivered a speech on Navy Day, saying that in the navy of the future, long-range submarines equipped with atomic rocket guns or atomic missiles and powered by atomic energy will occupy a very important position. Submarines powered by atomic energy can maintain very high speeds underwater and can make unlimited long-range voyages. In terms of self-defense, aerial atomic bombs or radar detection have less effect on this type of submarine. In terms of offense, its atomic rocket gun equipment is the most powerful offensive weapon.

China Declares Acceptance of the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun submitted a declaration from the Chinese government to United Nations Secretary-General Lie today, stating that it accepts the judicial jurisdiction of the League of Nations Court. The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands have already submitted similar declarations. This declaration by the Chinese government is valid for a period of five years and can be extended indefinitely. If there are any changes, six months' notice must be given.

### Relief Work for the Famine Will Be Handled by the United Nations

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: United Nations Secretary-General Lie received documents from UNRRA Director La Guardia today, stating that Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and China will encounter serious food shortages when UNRRA is dissolved in early 1947. Lie said that if necessary, he can propose specific measures to deal with relief work after the end of UNRRA.

### The Trumans Go to the Villa to Spend the Weekend

### Rumors of Agreement Reached in British-Egyptian Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 26th] The 13-member Egyptian delegation led by Egyptian Prime Minister Seeteki flew back to Egypt this morning. Seeteki did not make any statements before leaving. Cairo newspapers said that an agreement has been reached in the negotiations, and the UK has accepted the Egyptian view on the Sudan issue, making the area part of the Egyptian kingdom.

### The Soviet Authorities Are Working Hard to Study German Technical Secrets German Factory Technicians Are Transferred to Soviet Territory The Hamburg Council Urges the UK to Take Action

[Agence France-Presse, Hal, Germany, 26th] At the end of World War II, Germany invented a jet-propelled aircraft with a speed of 750 miles per hour. The plan was ready, but before it could be manufactured, Germany collapsed. The Soviet army advanced into Berlin, seeking the original plan, but General Baden's Third Army of the United States took the lead. The Soviet Union was disappointed. Because flying at 750 miles per hour is equal to the speed of sound, it is the maximum speed of the aircraft, and the Soviet Union is determined to study the secrets of this aircraft. A few months ago, the Soviet Union was busy gathering specialists who had worked in the Siebel aircraft factory in Hal before the war to restore their work and report the results of their research to the Soviet authorities. It is reported that this plan was almost completed in early autumn this year. These technicians were paid 600 marks per month, but they often received bonuses, sometimes as much as 10,000 marks, and they also received special allocations of food and cigarettes. At that time, these technicians signed contracts stipulating that they would be sent to work in the Soviet Union when necessary. This contract has now been forgotten. Recently, the Allied Control Council for Germany decided to organize an investigation committee to investigate whether all the arms factories in Germany are being dismantled. The Soviet authorities realized that this work must be intensified, but they did not take any action before the local elections in Germany. It was not until the 25th of this month that the factory began to be dismantled, and according to the contract, 250 workers and mechanics were sent to the Soviet Union. These workers signed new contracts, guaranteeing to stay in the Soviet Union for five years, with monthly salaries as high as 5,000 marks. Most of the workers were quite satisfied with the generous treatment, but some workers also felt uneasy, because they were guarded by sentries at the train station, who told them that anyone who tried to escape would be shot.

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] The Council of the British military district passed a resolution protesting the transfer of German workers and their families to other countries and demanding that the UK take action in the Allied Control Council. Reports received here stated that the first phase of the Soviet Union's transportation of German factories focused on rocket, jet, and V-weapon factories and scientific laboratories. These factories are mostly located in Mecklenburg, Saxony, Thuringia, and the Harz Mountains. German officials working under the Soviet authorities estimated that as many as 50,000 German workers, technicians, and their families, and even girlfriends, have been transferred from Germany to the Soviet Union. A worker from the Zeiss lens factory escaped to the British military district by bicycle. He said that some of the Soviet soldiers, some of whom were drunk, beat workers who were unwilling to go to the Soviet Union with the butts of their rifles, and women and children screamed in horror. Soviet newspapers in Berlin said that the transfer of German workers to the Soviet Union was all with their consent. Several representatives of the Siemens factory who came here from Yena a few days ago have sent a telegram to Stalin on behalf of the workers, asking him not to dismantle the factory's equipment. The telegram was entrusted to Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet occupation forces, to forward.

### Su Ruo Continues to Accuse US Policies; US Will Not Loan to Soviet Union; Byrnes Formally Declares to the Press

[United Press, Washington, 26th] If the Soviet leaders do not cease criticizing the United States' foreign and economic policies, their application for a $1 billion loan from the United States is bound to be hopeless. Similarly, it will also be difficult for Czechoslovakia and Poland to jointly obtain an $850 million loan from the "World Bank," which is dominated by the United States. US Secretary of State Byrnes recently stated clearly when receiving reporters that in the future, US economic assistance will only be given to friendly countries that do not accuse monetary loans as instruments of economic enslavement. According to unofficial official sources, Byrnes' remarks are mainly aimed at the Soviet Union's accusations that the US aid program to Eastern European countries is monetary diplomacy, economic enslavement, and economic imperialism. Three months ago, the United States issued a third note to the Soviet Union regarding the loan issue and is now awaiting its reply. The Soviet Union is unwilling to agree in advance to combine the loan with an examination of the economic situation in Eastern Europe, resulting in a stalemate in actual negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to date.

### Romanian Foreign Policy: Maintaining Friendship with All Countries

[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 26th] The bloc of democratic parties in Romania recently held a meeting to begin their election campaign. Foreign Minister Tătărescu delivered a speech on the spot, emphasizing that close cooperation between Romania and the Soviet Union and all democratic countries should be regarded as the foundation of foreign policy. He also said: The future, security, and development of our country all depend on the solidity of our mutual friendship and the closeness of cooperation between us and the peoples of the Soviet Union, but this does not mean that we want to pursue a policy of isolation. The distinctive feature of our foreign policy must be to maintain friendly relations with all democratic countries in the West, especially Britain, the United States, and France. Moreover, we should strengthen mutual relations with our democratic neighbors, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria. We have never been isolated from each of these countries due to differences of opinion. As for Hungary, we have absolute confidence in it and will certainly find ways to establish understanding and friendly relations with it.

### Wang Shih-chieh Sends Telegram in Reply to New Italian Foreign Minister

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 26th] The new Italian Foreign Minister, Nenni, sent a telegram to the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Shih-chieh, on the day he took office. Foreign Minister Wang recently replied in a telegram, saying, "I hereby extend my warm congratulations on Your Excellency's appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs and presiding over the foreign policy of your country. I truly share the sentiments expressed in your telegram regarding the relations between our two countries."

### US State Department Releases Report: Implementing Wealth Distribution Policy in Japan; Japanese Emperor Completes Six-Day Tour and Returns to Palace

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The State Department released a report last night on the disposal of assets of Japanese zaibatsu, stipulating that the assets of major Japanese industries and zaibatsu will be transferred to small merchants and artisans, so as to evenly distribute wealth in Japan and maintain balance among all social classes. It is reported that during the war, Japanese small merchants and artisans saved funds amounting to 5.3 billion US dollars, which is sufficient for taking over the zaibatsu's businesses.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The State Department and the War Department recently released a report by a US expert group investigating the control of Japan's economic life by Japanese zaibatsu. The group also put forward recommendations to eliminate this control system, but it has not yet been released. The report reveals: By 1944, the capital of the zaibatsu had reached a quarter of the paid-up capital of all companies in Japan, and 99 percent of the funds in various savings banks were in zaibatsu banks.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th, United Press] The Japanese Emperor completed a six-day tour of central and southern Honshu and returned here this evening. Before leaving Gifu, he accompanied Shigeru Yoshida, who had arrived in Gifu, to inspect Ogaki, 30 miles southwest of Gifu. Yoshida will attend the Liberal Party meeting there. It is reported that the Liberal Party supports the Emperor system.

### Another Atrocity by Japan in the Philippines

### Statistics of Merchant Ships of Various Countries: US Ranks First

Siam Has the Fewest, Only One Ship

[Our report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: According to statistics released by the Maritime Commission today, the tonnage of US merchant ships exceeds the total tonnage of merchant ships of all other countries in the world. As of the end of June 30, the total tonnage of merchant ships owned by the US government and private companies totaled more than 55 million tons, of which 4.68 million tons were flying foreign flags. During the same period, the total tonnage of merchant ships owned by the governments and companies of other countries was approximately 45.54 million tons.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The US Maritime Commission announced today the statistics of merchant ships of various countries in the world: among them, the United States ranks first, with a total of 4,861 merchant ships, with a total tonnage of more than 50 million tons, accounting for 51 percent of the total tonnage of existing merchant ships in the world. This accounted for only 14 percent before the war. The United Kingdom ranks second, with a total of 3,159 merchant ships, about 20.1 million tons, accounting for 24 percent of the world's total tonnage. This accounted for 30 percent before the war. The Soviet Union ranks third, with a total of 488 merchant ships, totaling more than 2.6 million tons, accounting for 3 percent of the world's total tonnage. This accounted for only 2 percent before the war. France ranks fourth, with a total of 262 merchant ships, totaling 1.6 million tons. The country with the fewest merchant ships is Siam, with only one 1,000-ton ship.

### New Type of Ore Smelting Furnace

Invented by Soviet Scientists

[United Press, London, 26th] According to TASS, Soviet scientists have invented a new type of ore smelting furnace that can directly smelt steel from ore and pig iron without intermediate procedures. The new type of ore smelting furnace, with the help of automatic transportation, can melt ore into pig iron, and then smelt pig iron into steel, continuously. Its special advantage is that it does not need to use coking coal, only bituminous coal is needed, and even bituminous coal can be used.

### Göring's Special Method of Hiding Poison: First Swallow the Medicine Tube, Then Retrieve It from Feces

[Reuters, Heilford City, 26th] The four-nation commission investigating Göring's suicide case issued a report in Nuremberg tonight, believing that neither the prison authorities nor the German staff were guilty of any wrongdoing. The report stated: After detailed investigation by this commission, the conclusions obtained are as follows: (1) Göring had poison hidden when he was first arrested and kept it until the night of October 15, 1946, (2) Evidence shows that Göring hid the poison in the muscle of his navel, (3) Evidence also shows that Göring kept the poison hidden there throughout his imprisonment, sometimes swallowing the medicine tube into his abdomen and then retrieving it from his feces for storage. The warden, US Colonel Andrews, and his staff took every necessary measure to prevent Göring from committing suicide, and everything that could be done was done, so there is no guilt to speak of. According to the British military doctor of the Nuremberg Court, the navel of an obese person like Göring is very deep and can accommodate a small tube of poison. If swallowed into the abdomen, it can be completely undetected within 24 hours, unless viewed with X-rays to find the metal tube in his abdomen. As for swallowing the metal tube into the abdomen, it is not necessarily harmful to his digestive function.

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 26th] British General Walsh and French General Morrell told reporters at the Nuremberg Court today: Göring's three letters of will have been sent to the Allied Management Committee and are unlikely to be published. Judging from Göring's letter to Warden Andrews, the guards seem to have nothing to do with the suicide case.

The atmosphere here is very calm, and all parties believe that the implementation of the Franco-Vietnamese New Agreement will not be accidental.

### Cotton and Tobacco Fields in the American South: Night in Greenville (Part 1)

— Mao Shuqing, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in the United States

More than eighty years after the Civil War, the American South and North are still two worlds. The industry of the North has become the economic overlord of the world after more than eighty years. Although the South also has industry, the social economy is generally still dominated by agriculture. The enterprising and enlightened nature of the people in the North is in stark contrast to the simple and conservative nature of the people in the South. Take black slaves as an example! President Lincoln fought a four-year "Civil War" in order to liberate black slaves. The Civil War was won, but were black slaves liberated? This is still a question. I took a train from Chicago to Tennessee, and after passing Cincinnati all the way, I

Implemented "Separate Seating on Trains"

From Knoxville, Tennessee, to the long-distance bus in South Carolina, white people sat in order from the front to the back, and black people sat in order from the back to the front. When the two sides "met," the driver shouted "Full." In this way, later passengers had to wait for the next bus. The buses were very crowded, running from midnight to day, with many shifts, all long, 50 percent longer than the public buses in Shanghai and Chongqing. The seats in the car were very comfortable, with reclining chair backs that could be freely rotated. Luggage was placed in the compartment between the tires and the passenger compartment, which did not take up space and did not have to worry about being exposed to the wind and dew on the roof. People all along the way in North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia like to take public buses. There are two reasons: first,

Southerners Are Frugal

Public buses are cheaper than trains; second, this road is mostly mountainous, and trains travel relatively slowly because they climb mountains, so most of the passenger traffic on trains is taken by public buses. The bus runs on dangerous mountain roads. The famous "Great Smoky Mountains" (also translated as Smoghan Mountains) between Tennessee and North Carolina are all narrow mountain roads with 90-degree turns, similar to the Sichuan-Hunan Highway in China. I was really worried that his long bus would not be able to turn around. After five hours over the Great Smoky Mountains, the bus stopped in Asheville, North Carolina; I did not get off the bus there and went straight to Greenville, South Carolina. Along the way, there were quiet and lovely rural areas, with small bridges and flowing water dotted between the fields, and scarecrows standing in the wheat fields, similar to Chinese farmhouses.

Greenville City

Has 76,000 people, with 40,000 people living in the city and more than 30,000 people scattered in the suburbs. Although the city is small, it also has a bustling scene. The residents have a very high level of education. There is a men's liberal arts college and a women's liberal arts college in the small city. Southerners are more conservative and religious than anything else; social interaction between men and women is not as unrestrained as in the North. I found the Bureau of Commerce on the upper floor of the Liberty Building in Greenville. A female secretary helped me find out the number of overseas Chinese and their residences. She spent a lot of time and found a Tom Lee. She said: Tom Lee is the only Chinese person in the city. He is the owner of a laundry shop. In fact, Tom Lee returned to China more than ten years ago, and the current laundry shop owner is called Fang Laofang. He is from Kaiping, Guangdong. Three years ago, he came to Greenville City to take over this laundry shop. His predecessor was not Tom Lee either. For business convenience, the old shopkeeper can hand over the business one after another, and the laundry shop's brand name remains the same. Lao Fang said: From the time Tom Lee founded the shop to him, there have been five or six major changes. He said: He is indeed residing in this

The Only Chinese

However, although there are no Chinese; there are many people who understand China in this small city, most of whom are missionaries. I went to Greenville to visit a foreign teacher who taught me English fifteen years ago: Mr. and Mrs. Rowland and Douvis, but I missed them. The Douvis couple resided in Honolulu during the war and have not returned to the United States for more than ten years. Residents of small cities in the South are more cordial to unfamiliar foreigners. When I was disappointed in finding someone, I met a strong middle-aged man, Bergway, who was Douvis' childhood best friend. Dou went to China to preach, and he still stayed in the United States. He said: Every time Douvis came back, he would talk a lot about China, "His Chinese stories are endless, and he can talk for half a year." Bergway has a very good image of China. He is a graduate of the local liberal arts college. His wife, Xue Lansi, is a scholar and a virtuous housewife.

### Conveners of Various Groups of the Municipal Council Hold a Joint Meeting Today: Should the Water Contract with the British Company Be Extended? All Members Provide Opinions

[Our report] The conveners of various committees of the Municipal Council are scheduled to hold their first joint meeting at 3 pm today to discuss the Municipal Government's proposal to take back the Shanghai Water Company or allow it to postpone the contract for ten years. The British Shanghai Water Company signed an exclusive contract with the former Public Concession Bureau in 1905, which was revised on March 17, 1928, with a valid period of 20 years (from January 1, 1927 to July 1, 1947). The contract stated that if the Bureau wanted to take it back, it must formally notify two years before the expiration date (ie, before January 1, 1945), otherwise it would be extended for ten years. After the restoration of the city last year, the Executive Yuan issued a telegraph instruction from the Chairman, stating that the contracts of the Tram Company and the Water Company will expire in one or two years, and that the recovery should be studied after the expiration date. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau notified the Water Company on October 26, 1945, that the contract would not be continued and recovered after the expiration date for public operation. Informal exchanges of views were also conducted with the company. The company did not object to the repurchase, but stated that the notification was issued after the contract stipulated "two years before the expiration date," so the company declared its reservation. The Municipal Government's policy on the company's disposal after the expiration of the contract was discussed at the municipal meeting. The legal capital of the company has been increased to 40,236 shares of 20-pound face value stock and 359,280 shares of 1-pound face value stock, totaling £1,164,000, plus taels 2,000,000 of treasury silver and 3,000,000 yuan of national currency. The actual paid-up capital is £1,163,225, plus taels 2,000,000 of treasury silver. The 1905 contract stipulated that 975 shares of 20-pound face value stock should be donated to the Public Concession Bureau. Subsequently, the Bureau purchased 3,208 shares of 20-pound face value Class A stock, 15,660 shares of 1-pound face value Class B stock, and 50,000 shares of 1-pound face value Class C stock, totaling £129,820. At present, the Concession has been recovered, and the city has the shares of the former Public Concession Bureau, so the company is actually a joint venture between the government and merchants. According to the principle passed by the 148th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, under the premise of not hindering sovereignty and the implementation of the plan, foreign capital can be absorbed in various ways. It seems that there is no need to rush to recover it. Moreover, the city has just been restored, and the reconstruction and construction require a lot of funds. If a large amount of money is raised in a short period of time as funds to recover the company, it will be difficult to raise funds given the city's financial difficulties. Therefore, it is proposed to approve the extension of the term for ten years and negotiate to revise the contract, with the aim of safeguarding sovereignty and developing public utilities. A letter was sent to the Municipal Council for discussion and reply. After the Council approved the letter, it was considered to be of great importance. During the recess, in order to thoroughly understand the opinions of the councilors and to quickly decide on a policy to reply to the Municipal Government, letters were sent to solicit the opinions of the councilors, and it was proposed to submit all the information to the first joint meeting of the conveners of various committee groups held at 3 pm today for discussion and decision, in order to remedy the situation.

After that, they will regularly run on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, providing medical treatment for employees of the two roads, railway police, their families, passengers, etc., at small and medium-sized stations without hospitals and clinics. The clinic cars are converted from 20-ton cargo cars. The cars are divided into medical rooms, bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, toilets, etc., and all emergency medical supplies are complete.

### Shanghai's Area Should Be Expanded

[Our report] The demarcation of the border between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province has not yet been completely decided. A certain important person has informally stated that the area of ​​Shanghai must be expanded. Because the standard of a modern city is that the population per square mile is most reasonable at 5,000 to 10,000 people; but today Shanghai has a small land area and a dense population, with the highest density being 200,000 people per square mile, which is very detrimental to the health of the citizens.

### U.S. Navy Donates to Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Two Prefabricated Houses Completed with Ample Light and Air

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association recently received a donation of two prefabricated houses from the U.S. Navy. These have now been erected at the Association's First Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road. Yesterday morning, members of the press were specially invited to visit. These prefabricated houses are semi-circular, supported by stone blocks at the four corners, raising them about one foot off the ground to prevent dampness. Both walls are made of glass windows, providing excellent light and air. One of them is now equipped with seventeen free beds, while the other is temporarily used as a living room and dining hall.

American Red Cross Donates Beds. The Anti-Tuberculosis Association was established in 1937, with Mr. Yan Huiqing as its chairman. It currently operates two sanatoriums. The First Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road originally had 72 beds, which, with the addition of 17, now totals 89. Among these, seven are first-class, four are second-class, twenty-four are third-class, and the rest are free. The Second Sanatorium on Yuyuan Road has approximately thirty beds. Recently, the American Red Cross donated 250 beds to all anti-tuberculosis organizations in the city, and this sanatorium will also receive a portion. Regarding fees, the daily cost of hospitalization is 28,000 yuan for first-class, 15,000 yuan for second-class, and 3,000 yuan for third-class, with the cost of medication extra. The income from these first, second, and third-class beds subsidizes the free beds.

Financial Difficulties Often Felt. Yesterday, the Association's General Secretary Huang Jiali and Doctor Liang Weizhen reported on the importance of tuberculosis prevention and the current situation of the sanatorium. Regarding funding, apart from a small subsidy from the Executive Yuan, most of it relies on external donations, which is often a struggle. In terms of medical equipment, items such as bronchoscopes, X-ray films, and surgical instruments are lacking. They hope that all sectors of society will generously donate. The Association will also promote anti-tuberculosis stamps before Christmas this year, both to raise funds and to promote tuberculosis prevention.

### Silk Cooperative Factory Approved by the Executive Yuan, Soon to Be Established

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau attaches great importance to the unemployment problem among workers in this city. In addition to working with relevant agencies to provide worker reception and unemployment relief, it also plans to establish cooperative factories. On one hand, to increase production, and on the other hand, to provide employment for unemployed workers. A plan was drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan requesting the allocation of several enemy and puppet factories, as well as requesting subsidies to help start them. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has approved the allocation of three silk factories to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the China Silk Company, and the Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs to jointly implement the plan, with the China Silk Company as the main entity. The heads of the three agencies have already met to discuss implementation measures and are in consultation with the Economic Department Commissioner's Office to take over the factories designated by the Executive Yuan and are actively preparing for the silk cooperative factory. This large-scale cooperative factory is a first for this city.

### Repairing the Songhu Railway to Be Built to Southern Wusong

Although the Songhu Railway has been under repair by the authorities since it was demolished by the Japanese, it has not yet been fully opened to traffic. According to sources from the Railway Bureau, the railway will be repaired to Southern Wusong (i.e., Yunzaobang) in the shortest possible time. Once this project is completed, passengers can reach Wusong Town via the Yunzaobang Bridge. The original terminus of the line was Taiwan, but because the land in that area has been requisitioned by the Municipal Land Administration Bureau for the Resource Committee to build a large-scale shipyard, the Railway Bureau will reconsider the terminus of the Songhu Railway. The Songhu Railway has already been repaired to Zhanghuabang, but passenger tickets are still only sold to Gaojingmiao.

### Cosmetics and Perfumes Consumption is Astonishing, Imports of 50 Million Yuan in Eight Months

### More Than 1,000 Personnel Under the Municipal Government Once Held Puppet Positions, Police Account for the Vast Majority, Dismissal Would Affect Public Security

[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently asked Mayor Wu when the "Measures for Punishing Civil Servants Who Held Puppet Positions During the War But Were Not Convicted Under the Traitor Statute" would be implemented. According to Mayor Wu, after receiving the relevant order from the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government immediately instructed all its agencies to investigate. According to statistics from the Personnel Department, more than 1,620 people in the Municipal Government have held puppet positions. There is no doubt that these civil servants should be punished. However, the problem lies in how to continue their current work after such a large number of civil servants are dismissed. According to inquiries by this reporter at the Personnel Department, police officers account for the vast majority of the 1,620 people. The city already feels that there are not enough police officers. If they are dismissed before there is certainty about replacement officers, it will inevitably have a serious impact on public security. Therefore, the mayor believes that the order must be implemented in principle, but in light of the facts, there may be changes to the regulations or the implementation dates.

### Revenue and Expenditure Slight Deficit, Municipal Government Will Not Lay Off Staff

[Report from this Newspaper] According to Mayor Wu, regarding the issue of Municipal Government layoffs, the previous City Council resolved that, to save expenses, the budget should be reduced by 15%. All existing staff positions exceeding the planned establishment should be eliminated. However, according to the results of an investigation by the Municipal Government Personnel Department, the current number of personnel in the Municipal Government agencies has not reached the planned number in the establishment, and the work of various bureaus and departments is already very intense. Therefore, layoffs seem impossible. Moreover, after including the tax revenues from July, August, and September, the budget for the second half of the year is only slightly insufficient and can be remedied.

### Disaster Victims in Rugao Urgently Awaiting Relief, Hoping for Assistance from All Sectors

Since its organization, the Relief Committee for Disaster Victims in Northern Jiangsu has had the Red Swastika Society Relief Team and the Buddhist Association Burial Team carry out treatment and burial work in the disaster area, which has been very intensive and well-received by all sectors of the local community. Now, the staff of the Committee have moved into Rugao to carry out relief work. The Relief Committee has received a report from the team stating that Rugao has been devastated by the disaster, with widespread destruction. After inspecting the disaster area, bones were found everywhere in the fields. Master Fancheng of the Buddhist Association buried them at any time. Four rooms in the suburbs of the city have been reduced to rubble, and two-thirds of the city's streets have been destroyed. Nine out of ten houses are empty. The remaining people are struggling to survive, unable to afford coffins. Thousands of refugees are still in the city, with little clothing or food, waiting to be fed. Efforts have been made to accommodate them and establish clinics to treat the sick and injured. It is hoped that kind people in Shanghai will quickly donate food, cotton clothing, quilts, and other items for relief. After receiving the report, the Committee held a meeting to discuss and send letters to various committee members to raise funds. It also petitioned the Sooning Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to appeal for medicines and food. It is hoped that all sectors will provide immediate assistance. If you have food, clothing, or other items, please send them to the Red Swastika Society, 15 Zhonghe Village, Changle Road, for transfer to the disaster area.

After arriving in Shanghai, the CNRRA will find ways to provide ships to send them back to their hometowns.

### The Inside Story of Shanghai Pickpocket Gangs (8)

— Huang Jiamo

Black Shops Have Black Hearts, Killing Without Drawing Blood

The number of stolen goods obtained by pickpocket gangs every day is quite considerable. A few days after these stolen goods are stolen, they must be sold to black shops. Moreover, they must be sold to black shops in their respective areas and must not be sold across boundaries or sold privately to individuals or legitimate second-hand stores, so as to prevent leaks and cause trouble for the brothers of the entire gang. In fact, those legitimate second-hand stores are mostly afraid to accept such valuable things from unknown sources, so as to avoid losses after the case is solved.

This kind of black shop specializing in receiving stolen goods has been established in Shanghai for many years. In the concession era, it was a semi-closed business. The people who opened such shops were also qualified "uncles" of the older generation in the gang. These people had experienced pickpocketing and were old enough, and they were also good at accumulating wealth, so they could open shops and start their own businesses. In the eyes of the brothers in the gang, they naturally belonged to the first-class figures of "high age and virtue." However, there are legal and illegal operations in this type of shop. They are described as follows:

(1) "Inn" - that is, a small inn, specializing in providing lodging for poor people and young members of the gang.

(2) "Muffled Kiln" - specializing in collecting waste materials.

(3) "Small Road Kiln" - a second-hand shop specializing in receiving stolen goods.

(4) "Setting Up a Balance" - collecting stolen goods under the guise of collecting second-hand goods. The first two are not worth mentioning. This section specializes in recording the inside stories of the third and fourth types of illegal black shops.

It is naturally a great risk for the older generation to operate this kind of illegal business, so they must make extensive connections. In the "concession" era, they tried their best to win over people in the public sector and contact influential "local bullies" in the area. At the same time, they also had to show "face" to overwhelm those "good-for-nothing" types. Because there are many at least rascals on the streets of Shanghai who specialize in intimidating and extorting money, only "face" can overwhelm them. Because "Small Road Kilns" are illegal operations, the shop address must be absolutely secret. However, for the convenience of trading, they must be opened near the wharves and docks within their sphere of influence, and they must let the brothers in the gang know. Because all the stolen goods of the pickpocket gang are stolen temporarily, of course, there is no fixed form for the size or value. Moreover, the thieves do not know the current market value, so the owner of the black shop can ruthlessly reduce the price and obtain valuable goods at a very low price. The price paid is only about 50% or even 10% of the market price. The benefits are so great that it is shocking.

Each black shop occupies a wharf. Although they talk about friendship on the surface, the boundaries are very strict, and they do not infringe on each other invisibly. Because they all belong to the exploitation class, they routinely refuse to accept small goods sold by gangs from other places. They abide by this rule. If a member of the gang wants to open another black shop to taste the "sweetness" of the "Small Road Kiln," it is tantamount to robbing the profits of the old shop, and a friction or conflict will inevitably occur.

"Setting Up a Balance" is an open black shop, which is no different from an ordinary second-hand shop on the surface, but in fact it specializes in receiving small goods. However, it absolutely does not accept stolen goods from the wharves of the "Running Under" gang, but only receives stolen goods from the "Eating Bad Rice" gang, so as to maintain its boundary with the "Small Road Kiln" black shop, and they never conflict with each other. The convenience of this kind of black shop is that it can be sold publicly immediately after buying it, without having to do business as secretly as the "Small Road Kiln."

The people who open "black shops" must be "black-hearted men." They exploit and rob the brothers who risk stealing in the guise of "thieves robbing thieves," and enjoy the greatest profits. It is extremely hateful. The results of the "little ghosts" hard work fatten this group of black shop owners who kill without drawing blood.

Losing One's Nerve on the Battlefield, It Is Still a Sigh That Talents Are Hard to Find

Although pickpocket gangs are said to be profitable, they must be alert, clever, courageous, and resourceful. Among the many brothers in the gang, only one or two out of ten can be trained by the "uncles" and be competent after entering the world. Especially in the pickpocketing field, only those with advanced skills can be considered "debut." If their skills are poor and they lose their nerve as soon as they enter the stage, they are fundamentally mediocre talents who cannot be presented to the world. Therefore, the "uncles" often sigh that "talents are hard to find." Moreover, no matter how superb the skills are, as long as they have been on the battlefield several times, they will inevitably go to jail due to losing their nerve. The skills they have learned have all become "stinky plates" in prison. "Stinky plates" are most likely to attract the attention of detectives or tram ticket sellers when they reappear on the streets, so their actions lose freedom, and cunning plans cannot be implemented. This is what "stinky plates" worry about most. Therefore, the uncles in the gang like to find one or two "foreign plates" to join the gang, which is tantamount to increasing a new force. The so-called "foreign plate" is a kind of down-and-out young man who is halfway out of the house. He is already in his twenties or thirties. When he was a child, he had never received the "primary education" of "little ghosts" like the brothers in the gang. He hesitates on the streets all day long and is accustomed to seeing the money-making magic of pickpocket gangs, so he cannot help but be happy to see it. So he occasionally tries it once or twice, and only then does he taste the sweetness. However, he is spotted by the "uncle" in the area, who beats him at the beginning. It is also strange that "no discord, no concord." As long as the "foreign plate" is willing to become a disciple and join the gang, the uncle will naturally accept him. Having a "foreign plate" in the gang will not attract the attention of the police when going to the streets, and their actions are much freer. Moreover, because they lack experience, they are fearless and especially bold. The so-called "newborn calves are not afraid of tigers." After the uncle teaches them the gang rules and daily homework, it is not difficult for them to become a "good talent." However, they still inevitably become a "stinky plate" after their debut, which is the most regrettable thing.

Pickpocket gangs are very worried about going to jail. What they fear most is being caught on the spot by passers-by after losing their nerve, or when there is nowhere to escape in the tram, the crowd will beat them with their fists and feet, and everyone will irresponsibly beat them up. After the beating, they will either disperse or hand them over to the police. Regardless of the pain of the physical punishment suffered on the spot, they are often beaten by the crowd into internal injuries, often losing their front teeth, spitting blood on the spot, and breaking their ribs, all of which can easily cause fatal injuries. "A pickpocket named Zhang Agou was beaten to death" is not a big deal in the news of this city. People will also scold him for "bringing it upon himself."

### Public Utilities Increase Prices, Electricity Allowed to Be Adjusted First, Tramway Not Yet Considered

It has recently been rumored that public utilities in this city will increase prices simultaneously starting next month. This will not only increase the burden on citizens, but also stimulate general prices, which is of great importance to people's livelihoods. Yesterday, a reporter from the East China News Agency specifically asked Mr. Zhao Zengting, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, about this issue. Mr. Zhao's key answers are as follows: (1) Due to the high cost of electricity in this city and the huge expenses, the company has been losing money heavily every month. The company has repeatedly stated its business difficulties and requested that the electricity price be adjusted appropriately. The Bureau has sent personnel to investigate in detail, and the statements are found to be true. It has been decided to approve the company to adjust prices first. (2) The British and French tramway companies have requested to change the fare, but the standard of the increase has not yet been considered. (3) Public buses will maintain the lowest possible cost due to the high cost of fuel. (4) The prices of tap water and telephones need to be carefully studied and decided.

### What Boldness! Stole a Check, Went to Cash It in Person, Finally Arrested by the Victim's Police Report

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhu Jinkui, a 24-year-old from Zhenjiang, lives at 26 Madrid Road, Ma Huo Road. He usually makes a living by setting up a book stall. At around 9:00 AM on the 25th, Zhu had not yet gotten up when two thugs suddenly appeared. One of them held a pistol and pointed it at Zhu's mother, accusing her of smoking opium. Zhu denied it and was slapped twice. The other bandit arbitrarily searched the tin box and stole 360,000 yuan in legal tender and a check for 583,000 yuan issued by the Shenyuanxiang Women's Shoe Shop in Xiaohuayuan, Guangxi Road. Before leaving, they also stole the gold ring on Zhu's hand. The thief was deeply afraid that the check could not be cashed, so he forced Zhu to accompany him to the Shenyuanxiang Shoe Shop to confirm the check. It turned out that the check was a remittance from the mainland to Shanghai. According to the person in charge of Shenyuanxiang, it should be cashed here on the 27th. At the time, Zhu did not go to the police station to request an arrest, but expected that the bandits would go to collect the money at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Zhu then instructed his brother, Helin, to wait at the Shenyuanxiang Shoe Shop. Before long, the two bandits did arrive. The shop first paid them 300,000 yuan, and the remaining amount was scheduled to be paid off today. When the bandits left with the money, Helin followed behind them. At the intersection of Guangxi Road and Hankou Road, he reported to the traffic police to arrest them and brought them to the Lao Zha Police Station. According to their confessions, one was Wang Xinqi, 23 years old, and the other was Lei Zhenhua, 26 years old, both from Wuxi. Wang used to be a member of the self-defense corps in his hometown and is now unemployed, reduced to a bandit. Afterwards, according to their confessions, the police continued to capture the prostitute Qiao Linchu, and seized two pistols and eleven bullets at Qiao's residence, 202 Qinghe Hotel. The case is currently under investigation.

### A Quarrel Followed by Violence: Scissors Violently Stab Husband

[Report from Our Newspaper] Dai Qiguo from Tongzhou, aged forty, residing at No. 5, Lane 685, East Changzhi Road (formerly East Seward Road) in eastern Shanghai, previously worked as a laborer in Taicang. He is currently employed by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Shanghai. His wife, Ms. Lin, thirty-three years old, is moderately attractive, but the couple is not harmonious and often quarrel. Recently, the situation has worsened. Yesterday morning, around four o'clock, Dai and Ms. Lin had another argument, which escalated into violence. Unexpectedly, Ms. Lin was unusually fierce. She grabbed a large pair of tailoring scissors from the cabinet and stabbed Dai in the right leg twice, each wound about an inch deep. Blood gushed out immediately, splattering the bedclothes. Dai cried out for help, and neighbors, hearing the noise, got up and saw Dai lying in a pool of blood on the bed, his injuries severe. The sub-landlord, Miao Ercai, reported the incident to the Tilanqiao Police Station. The police dispatched officers to investigate, arrested the assailant, Ms. Lin, along with the recovered scissors, and took them to the station for interrogation. At the same time, they urgently summoned an ambulance to rush the injured Dai to Gongji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Dai's two wounds on his right thigh had severed blood vessels, and he had lost too much blood, which could be life-threatening. It was later learned that Ms. Lin's behavior had been improper recently, and she had an affair. The cause of the attack was a quarrel, but the police are investigating whether there were other underlying reasons.

### Shanghai Commodity Prices: Then and Now

Special Article from Our Newspaper

Since the beginning of the war, commodity prices have soared out of control, rising daily without any sign of stopping. The cost of living index for September of this year was 496,739.70, using 1936 as the base year of 100. This means that prices have increased nearly 5,000 times in the past ten years. Currently, one yuan of legal tender is worth less than two li of what it was before the war. Living with such high prices is oppressive for everyone, and most people are struggling on the brink of death.

How did this unprecedented surge in commodity prices come about? During the First World War, the whole world experienced high commodity prices, but China's commodity prices only increased by 20% from the beginning to the end of the war, while the United States increased by more than 100%. However, during this war, China's situation was different from the last time, encountering an unprecedented situation. There was an urgent need for materials, which created this straight-line upward surge in commodity prices.

After Shanghai became an "isolated island," the population not only did not decrease but gradually increased. The occupied areas expanded daily, and people could not bear the oppression. They all considered the isolated island a haven of peace and came one after another. With a large population, consumption naturally increased. After the war, transportation was not smooth, and goods could not come in a steady stream. Under the principle of supply and demand not matching, a situation of "things are valued when they are scarce" naturally arose. As for currency inflation and foreign tightening, these are all factors that form the commodity price problem, but let's leave that for the experts to analyze.

Everything Can Be Hoarded, Nothing Isn't Speculated On: A Memory of a Dark Period

The soaring of commodity prices is like "a wind blowing through an empty cave." We only see the prices in stores changing every three days or five days. We only hear the rice dealers in the alleys arbitrarily adding to the rice price two hundred, three hundred, three thousand, five thousand, but this is not the main reason for promoting the soaring of commodity prices. Shanghai is a speculative market. After the war, many high-ranking refugees brought considerable funds with them. After the outbreak of the European war, wealthy businessmen from Hong Kong and Macau brought even more huge sums of money to Shanghai. The funds in the Shanghai market were particularly abundant, without a proper outlet. Everyone tended to speculate. In addition to foreign exchange, sharks' fins, cotton yarn, etc., attention was also shifted to goods, which were more reliable than sharks' fins and foreign exchange. At first, it was only rice, flour, grains, bean oil, etc. Later, the financial industry relaxed its lending for these most reliable goods as much as possible, making those who engaged in hoarding stronger and more powerful, and they did everything they could to monopolize and manipulate the market. Matches, soap, cigarettes, etc. were all targets of hoarding. It is true that everything can be hoarded, and nothing isn't speculated on.

After the trend of hoarding became popular, the entire Shanghai society became a large casino. All funds were used to hoard goods for profit, forming a large organization. In this great hoarding organization, there were three types of people: those who hid behind the scenes of the political arena, relying on their collusion with political connections and using huge financial resources to buy goods; these were the hoarders with special power. The silver and money industry absorbed cash and used other people's capital to make their own windfall profits, which was also a broad road to hoarding. These were the hoarders in the financial industry. Opening factories was supposed to supply production, and opening stores was supposed to distribute consumption, but factories had no output, stores did no business, and the factories and stores were used as a cover to engage in hoarding; these were the hoarders in industry and commerce. Other small hoarders who were "kicking the ball" were not worth mentioning.

Price Controls and the Black Market

Once the trend of hoarding started, everyone held the view that manufacturing was not as good as selling, and selling was not as good as hoarding. The goods on the market were completely monopolized by the hoarders. With fewer goods, prices naturally soared, with a momentum of reaching new heights. The pockets of the profiteers were indeed full, but who thought about how many people were struggling on the brink of death due to high commodity prices! This "gulf" divided the paradise and hell of the isolated island.

When commodity prices soared, the former concession authorities repeatedly issued orders to ban them, established a commodity price stabilization committee, and announced the prices of major commodities. The policy of adopting official fixed prices was aimed at curbing the rise in commodity prices, but the result was that the announced prices were out of sync with the actual prices, and commodities were hidden away because of the price controls. Goods disappeared from the market, and those who needed them had to seek them in the black market. Although the authorities strictly controlled them, transactions were established as long as one side was willing to sell and the other side was willing to buy. If the buyer did not pay this price, they would not be able to buy what they wanted. Price controls led to the emergence of the black market, and the black market raised commodity prices, a cycle that continued endlessly.

Price controls and the black market thus launched a fierce struggle. Although the former concession authorities punished and even sealed up the illegal shops, it was ineffective, and it was only the small merchants who suffered. As for the large hoarders who manipulated the market, they had reliable backers, usable financial resources, and even mysterious and unpredictable methods. Although under strict control, they could not stop the rise in commodity prices.

Rationed Rice

The reason why the rising tide of commodity prices could not be stopped was that the administrative authorities could not grasp the materials. To control commodity prices, it is necessary to control materials first. Therefore, the former Public Works Department established a Material Control Office to investigate the goods stored in the warehouses. On the one hand, it tried to increase supply and purchase goods, and directly distributed them to consumers. This method seemed more active than price controls.

A certain rice store was going to sell flat-price rice, and a certain alley was going to ration bean oil. These good news were comforting enough for the citizens. Although each person only had a few sheng of rice and a few liang of oil, it was better than nothing. So, supporting the old and leading the young, they took their sacks and baskets and gathered in front of the store, forming a "long snake array." Although the store doors did not open until six or seven o'clock in the morning, some people had already been waiting there since eight or nine o'clock the night before, as if they were going to the temple to catch the "first incense." After finally waiting for the door to open, the crowd started another round of commotion. Originally, when doing business, it was possible to distribute one by one, but it was always me squeezing you and you squeezing me. The sedan chair was trampled off, things were squeezed away, and even children were injured and pregnant women had miscarriages. This scene was tense and tragic enough.

Buying rationed goods was so difficult, waiting for most of the night, squeezing in the crowd for at least a few hours, and the rice obtained was only enough for a bowl of porridge, and most of it was red rice and brown rice, plus some sand and stones. The citizens were disappointed with the rationing. As a result, it not only had no effect but also fueled the rampant black market, making people even more insecure.

At the same time, these very small amounts of rationed goods could not be distributed on time and in quantity, because they first had to meet the large amounts of supplies for the enemy army, and then supply the various demands of the traitors and puppets, so the source was still not smooth. When the concession existed, the four suburbs were controlled by the enemy and puppets. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the lack of materials became even more serious. Initially, the rationed items were rice, salt, oil, and other important daily necessities, and gradually even soap, matches, and cigarettes were included in the rationing list, but this only indicated that the acquisition of materials was more difficult, and the people did not benefit from the increase in the number of rationed items.

Commodity Prices Before the War

The current huge amount of living expenses was transformed in the past eight years. Let's not talk about hundreds of years ago or decades ago. Just comparing the commodity prices before the war with the current prices is already worlds apart. The former Public Works Department's Health Department used to investigate the prices of food in the former International Settlement on a daily basis for comparison. Here is a list of the prices of several important foods:

Item Unit Price

Steak Pound 0.47

Lean Beef Pound 0.98

Yellow Croaker Pound 0.60

Pork Pound 0.49

Ham (Raw) Pound 0.96

Bacon Pound 0.65

Live Chicken Pound 0.56

Cabbage Pound 0.07

Potato Pound 0.04

Orange Each 0.17

Lemon Each 0.21

From the above table, although there is only a difference of ten years, the soaring of commodity prices cannot be measured in distance.

The Rising Tide of Commodity Prices Did Not End with the End of the War

During the war, due to transportation difficulties and the lack of materials, and Shanghai's special situation, the prices rose like crazy, which can be explained. Everyone hoped that victory would come soon, and the pressure of commodity prices could be lifted. The firecrackers of victory finally resounded throughout Shanghai, but the rising tide of commodity prices did not end with the war and continued its consistent style: rise! rise! rise!

In Shanghai in the early days of victory, commodity prices did fall. However, people from Chongqing, upon arriving in Shanghai and seeing that things in Shanghai were much cheaper than in Chongqing and Kunming, bought them one after another. Merchants, seeing that there was profit to be made, immediately changed their prices again. The commodity prices, which had taken a slight break, continued to rise as a result. The workers' cost of living index in September of the 34th year of the Republic of China was 29,923.62, rising to 44,142.43 in October, an increase of 50%. In November, it rose to 102,190.83, more than doubling compared to October. The cost of living index for September of this year was 496,739.70, an increase of more than 17 times compared to a year ago. How can one control these crazy commodity prices?

Rice is the most important thing for people's livelihood. In September of last year, each shi (approximately 133 pounds) cost about 6,000 yuan, and then rose to 8,000, 9,000. Once the Lunar New Year passed, it had already broken through 10,000 yuan. Everyone was worried about food again. In March of this year, the Grain Administration released 200 million yuan of rice purchase loans to encourage rice merchants to go to the producing areas to purchase rice in order to enrich Shanghai's food supply, so that rice prices could naturally fall. Who knew that before the loans were released, the Grain Administration thought it was a good deal, but after the loans were released, the rice merchants did not go to the producing areas to buy rice, but purchased it on the Shanghai market with the loans, causing rice prices to rise higher and higher. The grain loans fueled the rise in rice prices, and finally it was exposed, which was the grain loan bribery case that caused a sensation for a while.

Once food prices rose, other goods had an excuse to raise their prices. In addition, labor strikes occurred one after another, and terms such as unified distribution and rationing appeared in Shanghai again.

### How Are the Salary and Wage Indices Compiled?

Currently, there are two types of cost of living indices seen in Shanghai, apart from the one for Westerners: one is the workers' cost of living index, and the other is the employees' cost of living index. The workers' cost of living index was compiled the earliest, in 1929, by the former Social Affairs Bureau, using the "household survey method." In the five districts of east, west, south, north, and Pudong, 500 worker families were selected to keep daily records. The selection criteria were: (1) families of three to six people, (2) monthly income of 20 to 60 yuan. At that time, only 305 families kept records for a full twelve months, for a total of 3,660 account books. The items included in the index were based on calculations from these account books, totaling 60 items, including 31 food items, 11 clothing items, 3 rent items, 8 fuel items, and 7 miscellaneous items. According to the compilers, the selection of "samples" was quite difficult due to the large number of items and the different qualities. At the same time, attention was also paid to the weight of each item. For example, rice is heavier than sugar. In terms of investigating commodity prices: (1) there were five regions: East District, South District, West District, North District, and Pudong District. According to the size of the region and the number of workers, a number of representative shops were selected in each district. (2) In terms of time, prices that did not change much were investigated once a month on the 15th, and prices that changed more frequently were investigated once a week to calculate the average price of a target. (3) The quality was kept consistent. If there was a standard brand name, the standard brand name was used; otherwise, comparison was used. The calculation formula used was a type of "weighted aggregate formula." The base period was adopted as 1926, the reason being that the economic situation in that year was stable and there were no special changes, and it was also convenient to compare with foreign indices.

Employees' Index

The employees' cost of living index was created in 1941 by the former Public Works Department's Industrial and Social Affairs Department. Initially, 500 employee families were also sought to record detailed accounts of income and expenses, with three months set from October 12 to December 31. At that time, a total of 1,038 families responded, of which 167 families stopped recording at any time, 430 families' accounts were not suitable for use, and the remaining 441 families completed the recording in accordance with the prescribed method. Because it was urgent to use, a temporary index was compiled based on the account books of 100 families first. The accounting families were (1) limited to the Chinese employee class in the city, and the head of the family was not limited to the industry, but peasants, workers, or those who established their own businesses were not suitable for selection. (2) Self-reliant families who did not rely on ancestral property income or parental subsidies for daily living expenses. (3) The salary and other income of the head of the family was limited to 500 to 1,500 yuan in legal tender per month, and those whose salary was in foreign currency were not suitable for selection. (4) The family population, including husband and wife, children, and dependents, was limited to no more than ten people. Those who lived in and paid for accommodation, as well as servants, were not included. (5) The family residence was limited to those who lived in cargo houses, and those who owned their own houses or lived in the service place and did not need to pay rent were not suitable for selection. (6) The family meals were limited to those who prepared their own meals or hired servants to cook, and those who contracted with cooks or restaurants were not suitable for selection. Those who dined out due to work or study were not limited to this. According to the survey at that time, there were 224 students in 100 families, accounting for 33.94% of the family members. There were 108 male employees and 13 female employees, totaling 121 people, accounting for 18.33%. Only 6 wives, 4 sons, and 3 daughters were employed. The income of children did not supplement household expenses, so one employed person had to bear the living expenses of more than five people, including servants. The occupations of these 100 families are shown in the following table:

Manufacturing Industry Male 11 people

Transportation Male 16 people Female 1 person

Freelance Male 2 people

Wholesale Industry Male 11 people

Education Male 13 people Female 7 people

Public Utilities Male 15 people

Administrative Agency Male 23 people

Finance and Banking Male 10 people Female 2 people

Retail Industry Male 3 people

Church Male 4 people

Total Male 108 people Female 13 people

According to the calculations at that time, the average income per family per month was 688.38 yuan, and the expenditure was 883.78 yuan. After offsetting income and expenditure, there was a shortfall of 274.08 yuan. As for the compilation method, it was roughly the same as the workers' cost of living.

### Beyond Comparison: An Old Account: Memoirs of the Late Ming and Early Qing Dynasties

The soaring of commodity prices in Shanghai is not a recent special situation, but has been around for a long time. However, the recent surge in prices is truly alarming. Comparing it with the commodity prices of the past decades, it is hard to believe.

In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the price of rice was as follows: At the end of the Chongzhen reign, Shanghai experienced years of drought, and the price of rice rose to one tael of silver per shi (in the Qing system, one tael was equivalent to 700 copper coins), which was an unprecedentedly high price. Hungry people were everywhere, running around reporting the emergency. By the sixth year of the Shunzhi reign, there was a great harvest in the autumn, and grain and rice were only worth 1.2 taels per shi. Japonica rice was cheap at 900 cash. When the Kangxi Emperor ascended the throne, the country was at peace, and the five grains were abundant. The price of rice dropped to 200 cash per shi, causing a good harvest to hurt farmers. Many wealthy families, despite having abundant millet, could not afford the land tax they had to pay. In order to pay taxes, they abandoned it and fled. This is not a joke, but a fact.

The price of wheat in the early Qing Dynasty was also the cheapest during the Kangxi period. When the new wheat was first harvested, the officials began to strictly pursue the completion of the grain payment. Because farmers urgently needed to sell wheat for silver to pay to the national treasury, they painfully sold it cheaply, only 300 to 400 cash per shi. In the ninth year of Kangxi, wheat was 700 cash per shi, and He wheat was 600 cash per shi, which was already waiting for a good price to sell.

Cotton Cloth

Cotton and Cloth: Shanghai began to cultivate cotton as early as the end of the Song Dynasty, on a scale equivalent to rice fields. In the early years of the Chongzhen reign, the price of cotton was 4 to 5 taels of silver per dan (approximately 100 pounds). Later, due to the rise of roaming bandits, it could not be transported out, and gradually went downstream. By the third year of the Shunzhi reign, it fell to 500 to 600 cash per dan. The most expensive time was in the eighth year of the Shunzhi reign, at 9 taels per dan. But usually, a value of about 3 taels was considered very expensive. As for the market price of cloth, it was roughly 200 to 300 cash per tael of silver.

The Price of Tofu and Meat: Soybeans used to be cheaper than rice, with one shi of beans worth seven dou of rice. In the fourteenth year of Chongzhen, Shanghai experienced a severe drought, with more beans than rice. One shi of rice could be exchanged for two shi of beans. In the ninth year of Shunzhi, there was more rice than beans, with each shi priced at 900 cash, while the price of beans was worth 1.8 taels. In the early years of Kangxi, high-quality soybeans were worth 500 cash per shi, and the expensive ones were only between 500 and 600 cash. Cheap beans, made into tofu, were naturally enough to burn two or three large bowls for one copper coin.

Pork and Salt and Sugar

The market price of pork in Shanghai was often around 20 cash per tael of silver. When the Qing army went south, the price rose to 1.2 taels per catty (approximately 1.3 pounds) amidst the chaos of war. Until the Shunzhi era, it never recovered to the original price of the late Ming Dynasty. It was not until the twelfth year of Kangxi that it fell to 25 cash per catty again, and then it was often around 30 cash. When the Shanghai citizens, who had not tasted meat for three months, heard this, they truly wished they had been born a hundred years earlier.

Salt and Sugar: Shanghai borders the river and the sea, and is a salt-producing area. During the Chongzhen reign, the price of salt was as cheap as 150 to 160 cash per dan. During the Shunzhi reign, it was 10 cash per catty of silver. In April of the eighth year of Shunzhi, it was as high as 600 to 700 cash per catty of silver due to a major flood, which was the highest record for the price of salt in Shanghai in the early Qing Dynasty.

As for the price of sugar in Shanghai, in the late Ming Dynasty, high-quality white cane sugar was worth 30 to 40 cash per catty. During the Shunzhi reign, the source of sugar was blocked due to the many incidents on the sea frontier, and it was worth 400 cash per catty. It was not until the middle of the Kangxi reign that the old price of sugar was restored. In the twentieth year of Kangxi, white sugar was worth 30 cash per catty, and brown sugar was as cheap as 10 cash. In the twenty-fifth year of Kangxi, it fell further to 20 cash per catty.

The Life of Westerners in Shanghai When It Was First Opened

The market prices of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties are too far away from the current life. Let's take a look at the situation when Shanghai was first opened. At that time, silver dollars had flowed into China. The commonly used silver dollar was the Spanish silver dollar, commonly known as Benyang, which was equivalent to 1,400 to 1,500 copper coins each. The "North China Herald" (predecessor of the "North China Daily News") on September 14, 1850, published the prices of various goods in Westerners' food shops, which shows how low the commodity prices were at that time, which Shanghai citizens today cannot imagine:

Fresh Beef 14 pounds per dollar

Fresh Mutton 12 pounds per dollar

Fresh Pork 120 cash per catty

Lard 130 cash per catty

Chicken 95 cash per catty

Duck 110 cash per catty

Eggs 6 cash each

Flour 24 cash per catty

Rock Sugar 120 cash per catty

Granulated Sugar 56 cash per catty

Sweet Potatoes 18 cash per catty

The prices listed in the above table are already more expensive than those purchased by ordinary Chinese people, but now it seems that they are really incredibly cheap.

However, although the cost of living was low at that time, life was still not easy. At that time, a Westerner named Lan wrote a book called "Shanghai Social Talks," saying that spending 400 pounds in Shanghai was not as comfortable as spending 100 pounds in England. At that time, the salary of a coolie was 4 yuan per month, while a trained "boy" required 6 yuan. The silver dollars at this time were already Mexican silver dollars. According to Lan's words, I don't know how low the living standards were in the British Isles at that time.

### A Dinner Seventy Years Ago

"A rich man's dinner is a poor man's half-year's food." How have the prices of banquets, which are generally considered luxurious, changed over the years? During the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, the most exquisite banquet was a whole roast suckling pig banquet, with a price of 12,000 cash per table. The next best was a sixteen-dish banquet, eight large and eight small bird's nest dishes, priced at 5,600 cash. If the sixteen dishes were not used and replaced with twelve-dish four-appetizer plates, it would only cost 5,000 cash. The value of a shark fin banquet was 4,200 cash, with twelve dishes, six large, six small, and four desserts. A sea cucumber banquet also had twelve dishes, four large, four small, and four desserts, and the price was only 2,400 cash. As for the food for the followers and servants, each table had six large bowls and only cost 1,200 cash.

In the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Ye, the magistrate of Shanghai, held a 70th birthday celebration for his mother, and the banquets he held included two suckling pig banquets, thirteen shark fin banquets, and twelve secondary shark fin banquets. 170 catties of Shaoxing wine, 206 bowls of top-grade noodles, 214 bowls of medium-grade noodles, and 1,000 bowls of low-grade noodles, cost a total of 266 silver dollars and 87,898 cash. It is estimated that it is not enough to eat a customer's meal or breakfast now.

As for daily meals, the food expenses in the yamen (government office) at that time were stipulated as 400 cash per day for the magistrate, and the rest were divided into three levels: upper, middle, and lower. The upper and middle levels were 80 cash per person per day, and the lower level was 60 cash per day. Temporary workers, such as weeding and sweeping garbage, only had 50 cash per day. But at that time, everyone could live comfortably, which is enviable to hear.

### Old Paper Pile: Several Pages of Food Bills

In some old books, I found a few pages of food bills, dating back forty or fifty years. Seeing the prices at that time, I cannot help but feel the changes between the past and the present. 1. One page from the 27th year of the Guangxu reign: rice was 1,200 cash per shi (unit of dry measure), flour was 14 cash per jin (unit of weight), firewood was 70 cash per 100 jin, meat was 56 cash per jin, eggs were 4 cash each (2 for 7 cash), sugar was 24 cash per jin, wine was 18 cash per jin, and cloth shoes were 80 cash per pair. Hiring a rickshaw typically cost from 12 or 13 cash to 40 or 50 cash; from Wuma Road to Fanwang Ferry, it was 100+ cash. From Ximen to Xujiahui, it was only 60 cash. In large teahouses like Hua Zonghui and Wanhua Lou, a bowl of tea for two people was only 28 cash. Noodles were 16 cash per bowl, steamed buns were 7 cash each; three or four people drinking tea would spend 200 cash, and spending 300 or 400 cash meant drinking wine and ordering dishes.

2. One page from the first year of the Xuantong reign: rice was 2 yuan per shi, firewood was 100 cash per 100 jin, pork was 60 cash per jin, oil was 56 cash per jin, soy sauce was 64 cash per jin, eggs were 5 cash each, chicken was 60 cash per jin, vegetables were 150 cash per dan (unit of weight), sedan chair rides were 400 cash each (approximately 10 li), haircuts were 50 cash each, and city houses rented for 3 yuan per month.

After reading these two pages of old accounts, comparing the present with the past, one cannot help but feel like being in two different worlds. At that time, a family of four or five could live comfortably on a monthly income of 20 yuan. In the mid-Guangxu period, each silver dollar could be exchanged for less than 1,000 cash; even during the Xuantong period, it was only 1,100 cash. Twenty yuan could be exchanged for about 20,000 cash. Considering the most important expenses for daily life, food and housing, only 4,000 or 5,000 cash were needed, leaving 15,000 or 16,000 cash for other expenses, which was enough to satisfy life's needs. If one was slightly frugal, one could even save a little each month.

### Song of Hard Living: How Much Can Ordinary People Earn? How Will the Old, Weak, and Disabled Survive?

In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sheng Chengxuan of Nanhuashan, feeling the high prices and difficult living conditions, wrote a "Song of Hard Living." But today's prices cannot be measured by miles and leagues. The lyrics say:

"Hard to make a living, hard to make a living, it's truly sigh-inducing to talk about. White rice is eleven yuan per hundred jin, brown rice is nine and a half jin per yuan, coarse firewood is twenty cash per jin, even Mao firewood costs twelve or thirteen. A dime buys a jin of salt, nine cents buys six liang of oil, Shaoxing wine is a dime per jin, two pieces of tofu cost three copper plates. One thousand cash buys a jin of meat, seven hundred cash buys a jin of fish, salted fish costs two dimes per jin, the price of white fish is up to the seller, sixty cash buys a duck egg, seventy cash buys a goose egg, chicken prices suddenly became unusually expensive last year. Fifty is the minimum for buying wheat flour, thirty is the minimum for buying sugar sauce, fried dough sticks, sesame cakes, and stinky tofu all cost thirty cash each. Green vegetables, cucumbers, and mung bean sprouts can barely be stir-fried for a hundred cash, turnips and mustard greens are cheap in winter, but a hundred jin costs more than two yuan. Thirty cash buys a shoulder of water, one hundred and twenty cash buys a jin of charcoal, tea prices depend on the quality, five dimes a jin for leaves with stems. Coarse cloth costs three hundred cash per foot, foreign cloth costs five thousand cash per zhang, a cotton quilt costs six yuan, a cotton mosquito net costs five yuan, a straw mat costs two thousand cash, a felt blanket costs ten thousand cash. A box of matches costs twenty cash, a box of kerosene costs more than four yuan. No matter what piece of clothing, you need at least one yuan to get it. These are all daily necessities, and prices are not negotiable, compared to other places, it's considered cheap, but compared to the late Qing Dynasty, it's ten times as much. One yuan is worth three thousand cash, but it can only be exchanged for three hundred copper coins, an ordinary household of five people cannot afford dishes for one yuan a day, how much can ordinary people earn in a year? How will the old, weak, and disabled survive? This alone shows how hard it is to make a living, not to mention the burden of taxes, donations, and social engagements, hard to make a living, hard to make a living!"

### Social Services: Advocating Infant Welfare, Banking Sector Donates Generously

Infant Health and Welfare Institute is appealing to all sectors for donations.

The Shanghai Infant Health and Welfare Institute is a newly established health and welfare organization in China. Due to limited funding and facilities, its operations have been restricted. Since Mr. Pan Gongzhan took office as chairman, he has been very interested in this kind of health and welfare work and has given it great enthusiasm. Mr. Pan asked the banks to raise funds: the Central Bank pledged 50 million yuan, the China Farmers' Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau pledged 10 million yuan each, and the Seventh District Machine and Occupational Guild pledged 50 million yuan. Local dignitaries Liu Hongsheng, Xu Ji _, Luo Qinghua, Xi Yushu, Qian Jianqiu, and Shui Xiangyun were divided into groups to solicit donations, and Chairman Pan invited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to serve as the general leader, coordinating all matters.

Furthermore, yesterday, Mr. Yang Fusheng of the Heming Shoe and Hat Store in this city sent a donation of 1 million yuan, which has been forwarded to the institute. As for other donations, they have not yet been settled and will be announced later. It is still hoped that all sectors will actively contribute and jointly participate in this benevolent cause. Mr. Yang's original letter said: "Chairman Pan Gongzhan: The establishment of the Infant Health and Welfare Institute aims to promote the health of children and lay the foundation for national construction. The merit lies in serving the people, and the concern lies in protecting infants. I deeply admire what I heard the other day and dare not fail to follow suit in order to see its early success. I respectfully offer a check for one million yuan, and I pray that you will accept it. I am ashamed of being but a drop in the ocean, but I hope to add my mite to the effort. Please consider it carefully. I respectfully wish you success. From Yang Fusheng's hand (attached a check for one million national currency)."

### Seeking Information

Seeking Ye Renfu: A native of Wuyuan, serving in the Second Battalion of the 370th Regiment of the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division. He has been away from home for nine years without any news. His family is constantly worried. If any friends of Mr. Ye know his whereabouts, please kindly inform Ye Yongfu, Xia _ Qi, Dongxiang, Wuyuan, Jiangxi, so that the family can be reunited. Your kindness will be greatly appreciated.

If any friends of Mr. Li know his whereabouts, please kindly inform Li Guoan and Zhang Rongzhuang of Wanxing Teahouse, Wannianchang, Chengdu Outer Car. Your kindness will be appreciated.

Seeking My Cousin Chu Lintang: My cousin came to Shanghai last month, but why hasn't he come to my place? Brothers Shu Ken and Er have both sent letters to him, which are now at my place. Please let me know your address so I can send them to you and relieve their longing. Song Ren, Aurora University, Lupan Road.

### After Reorganization of Yarn Allocation Agency, Allocation Price is Lower, Allocation Quantity will Increase, Qualifications are Strictly Checked, and Money Supply is Tightened

[This Newspaper Report] In recent days, the weather has been warm and cloth sales have been sluggish. In addition, the money supply is tight and interest rates are high. Cloth market prices have fallen slightly by 20-30%. However, yarn prices remain firm and have fallen very little. The reason for this is that the production of cotton yarn is inherently insufficient, and the _ operated yarn factories are financially strong and do not need to reduce prices for sales. Although the allocated prices by Fangjian are low, the allocated quantity of yarn is very small. Moreover, the cotton yarn reproduction industry has very little yarn in stock on weekdays. Since work cannot be stopped, raw materials must be replenished at any time. Therefore, yarn prices have always been firm, especially for fine counts. Since Mayor Wu concurrently serves as the director of the Textile Industry Management Committee, the joint yarn allocation system has been improved. People's hearts have calmed down slightly. Recently, the Six District Cotton Textile Association and the Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry Associations are actively deploying, and allocations will begin today.

Lower Allocation Price

The allocation price, based on 20 counts as the standard, is 1.75 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous period. It is heard that the amount proposed by the Six District Cotton Textile Association was not just this number. Subsequently, after Mayor Wu approved the above, it was lower than the 1.8 million proposed by a person in charge of the reproduction industry at the municipal meeting. Mayor Wu said that yarn prices must be lowered, but he advocated doing so gradually. Therefore, the allocation price for the next period may be reduced. According to people in the yarn factory industry, the current cost of cotton yarn is around 1.4 million for small factories and lower for large factories. If the report that President Song approved the continued allocation of foreign exchange to purchase foreign cotton is true, then yarn prices could be reduced again.

Allocation Quantity Standard

The total amount of yarn allocated for this period is 12,004.5 pieces, including 7,816.5 pieces for the dyeing and weaving industry, 1,902 pieces for knitting, 1,015 pieces for underwear, 720.5 pieces for towels and blankets, 460.5 pieces for handmade cotton weaving, and 90 pieces for handkerchiefs. This is based on Mayor Wu's calculation of 60% of the total amount of yarn needed as declared by the reproduction industry associations, allocating one-half of that amount as stated above to meet the sales volume for this half month. At a meeting convened by the municipal government last week, Mayor Wu solicited opinions from various reproduction industries. A person in charge stated on the spot that this amount was inherently insufficient, but due to the recent warm weather, sluggish sales, and tight money supply, 60% should be sufficient, and added that some companies may not be able to receive all of it. According to the yarn allocation committee of the cotton yarn reproduction industry associations, all industries need yarn of various counts. Their declaration books were clearly classified. The above allocation quantity is based on a composite standard of 20 counts. In reality, there should be multiple counts.

Allocation Procedures

It is heard that the yarn allocated by the Textile Management Committee to the various reproduction industry associations will be issued in a master list yesterday afternoon, which will be handed over to the joint committee of the allocated industries, and then distributed to the six associations, which will allocate them to each member based on the number previously declared and in the same proportion. The reproduction industry allocation committee is already planning this work. According to the person in charge, it will be difficult to allocate if the counts from the Textile Management Committee are not uniform. Factories that urgently need yarn can only distribute it proportionally based on the counts received. Member factories that actually need yarn but have not reported to the association for submission to the Textile Management Committee will not be able to participate in the allocation this period. However, it is heard that the associations are collecting continued declarations so that they can be added in the next period. Many of the knitting and dyeing industries did not participate this time. At a board meeting of the knitting industry association the night before, it caused criticism from non-reporting members. After the person in charge of the association explained with understanding, they were understood. The canvas industry is also one of the cotton yarn reproduction industries. This time, because it did not report in time, it did not participate at all. The person in charge of the Textile Management Committee stated that there was no way to help this period, but it can be added in the next period. Therefore, the allocation quantity for the next period can often be increased.

Qualification Review

The yarn allocation committee organized by the cotton yarn reproduction industry associations is the joint organization required when the Textile Management Committee issues documents. As for the internal affairs of each industry, they are still managed by each industry itself. However, a person in charge advocated organizing a joint investigation team so that each industry could supervise each other. The personnel of the investigation team will be as many as dozens of people. It is also heard that Mayor Wu strictly forbade resale of yarn this time. The important members of the yarn allocation committee also consider this to be a work that cannot be relaxed. They will contact the yarn market to gather information for investigation. As for the internal affairs of each industry, they have already been ordered by the Textile Management Committee to establish a review team to re-examine the original declaration books. It is expected that many factories will have their errors pointed out by their associations. However, factories that were previously disqualified from allocation by Fangjian, if it is found that they exchanged counts with yarn shops and not for the purpose of reselling for profit, and are still operating and do need yarn, will still be allocated yarn.

Money Supply to Tighten

The total amount of yarn allocated this time is more than 12,000 pieces, with a total price of more than 20 billion. The Textile Management Committee requires it to be paid off within three days. This is of great importance to the money supply in the market. Many industries such as handmade cotton weaving and knitting lack capital and have lower turnover capacity. They have repeatedly expressed to their respective associations that the allocation periods must be distributed and the payment dates must be extended. Each association has transferred the negotiations to the yarn allocation committee jointly formed by the reproduction industries to seek improvement. It is said that the joint allocation of yarn between Fangjian and private yarn factories was originally three times a week, but now it has been changed to once, which obviously does not take into account the difficulties of the allocated industries. If it is not improved urgently, it will cause Mayor Wu's original policy to lose its true meaning.

### Yarn Factory Electricity Saving Measures: Wages and Day/Night Shifts are a Problem

This city has a dense population and numerous factories. The amount of electricity consumed has already reached saturation. In order to take care of both sides, the municipal government has reached an agreement with the power company on electricity saving measures. It is understood that all yarn factories in the city are divided into six groups, with a six-week cycle, that is, the first two weeks are four days and seven nights, the middle two weeks are five days and seven nights, and the last two weeks are six days and seven nights. The labor side believes that there are more night shifts and the work is hard. It has jointly applied to the Social Affairs Bureau with the capital side to stipulate that seven night shifts will be calculated as eight and a half days' wages. Due to power relations, night work is done for nine hours (the original work was ten hours), and wages are paid as usual. Those working less than nine hours will be paid half the wages proportionally. If day workers can only work for nine hours, they will be paid 9.5 days' wages.

In addition, since the yarn factories in this city implemented the new power distribution method, the original day and night shift times should be changed. However, some unreasonable workers believe that the work has increased and the income has not increased (referring to the fact that wages are paid as usual on Sundays). Therefore, there are complaints, and they refuse to work night shifts and rush to work day shifts, which has caused confusion in factory order. New No. 5 Factory, No. 7 Factory, and Weitong Yarn Factory have all experienced labor unrest. Hengfeng and Yongan No. 1 Factory have also been affected. After persuasion and mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the General Labor Union, except for a few details that have not yet been finalized at Weitong Factory, the other factories have resumed normal operation.

### Price Negotiation System in This City Starts with Daily Necessities

[This Newspaper Report] Since prices have gradually risen, the lives of ordinary citizens have been greatly threatened. When the Municipal Council met, a plan to suppress and stabilize prices was unanimously decided and sent to the municipal government for implementation. The municipal government has decided to start with daily necessities for general people's livelihood. In addition to the Textile Management Committee, which Mayor Wu himself serves as the chairman to actively promote, other items such as sugar, cotton cloth, wool yarn, rice, and cooking oil have all been ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to organize committees separately to implement price negotiation. Among them, the sugar item has been decided to be distributed, and the distribution certificates have been printed and sent to the Civil Affairs Office last Saturday for distribution to various district offices. The implementation date is not far away.

### Fuel Management Committee will Adjust Coal Prices Next Month, Factory Coal Prices Remain Unchanged

The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to adjust the allocation prices of various fuels starting from the first of next month due to the fact that the treatment of coal miners in various production areas has been improved several times and the transportation situation is not very good, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. Among them, except for the selling price of coal applied for by state-owned and private factories, which remains unchanged, the others will be moderately increased by 70% to 100%. In the allocation price set by the committee in August, private enterprises will be one-third higher than state-owned enterprises. In the future, they will be classified according to the difference in the nature of the enterprises, and the selling price of state-owned and private enterprises will be the same. The main allocation targets of the committee are water companies, power companies, ships, factories, and coal ball factories. The current cost of each ton of coal is 100,000 yuan. The committee's regular work is to use the surplus earned from allocation to various factories to supplement the losses in other public utilities.

### The Amount of Counterfeit Reserve Certificates Redeemed Totals More Than 4.2 Billion Yuan

[This Newspaper Report] According to relevant sources: The amount of counterfeit Central Reserve Certificates redeemed, from the beginning of November last year to the end of March this year, totaled 4,215,715,089,625.61 yuan. Later, in order to protect the interests of those who held the counterfeit banknotes but did not have time to exchange them for legal tender, the authorities decided to continue to register and redeem them from September 1 to September 30 this year. The total amount redeemed was 27,464,199,382.51 yuan. The total amount of the two redemptions is 4,243,179,289,008.12 yuan, which is still higher than the total amount of issuance announced by the counterfeit Central Reserve Bank. However, all counterfeit banknotes have been removed from this total redemption amount.

### Gejiu Tin is Oversold

[Kunming, October 27th Dispatch] Gejiu's large tin production is far from covering costs, and sales are stagnant. For months, it has been on the verge of collapse. After representatives were elected to go to the province to make requests, it is now known that the transportation and sales office has agreed to request the central government to set the price for stored tin at 4.5 million yuan per ton. Based on current prices, if large tin can reach 5 million yuan per ton, there may be hope for the future of production.

### Tung Oil Exports are Difficult, Conditions are Similar in Hong Kong and Shanghai

[Hong Kong News] The market conditions of the tung oil industry in South China are similar to the scene of falling yellow leaves in this season. The previous stored oil has deteriorated, and it is now the tenth month of the lunar calendar, when tung oil seeds are ripe and it is time to press oil again. However, there is still a large amount of tung oil on the market. According to industry insiders, the demand from Europe and the United States has not decreased. On the contrary, there is a shortage of paint in the United States. However, on the other hand, a large number of products in our oil-producing areas are being abandoned. This contradictory phenomenon is heartbreaking. Currently, the selling price of tung oil in this city is above 160,000 yuan, which is the highest in various places. The current price in Shanghai is about 120,000 yuan, and the price in Hankou is also slightly above 120,000 yuan. In addition, the market price of tung oil in the United States is only about 35 US dollars, which, according to the official exchange rate, is still less than 120,000 yuan. However, the cost of shipping from Shanghai to the United States, including freight, is no less than 160,000 yuan. If shipped from this city to the United States, it would often be more than this. The stored oil can only be left to deteriorate.

The transportation and sales of tung oil in this city mainly focus on Europe, but due to the various situations mentioned above, exports are not cost-effective. Our country's inflation rate in the past eight years of the war is higher than that of other countries. It is estimated that current prices in the United States have increased by three times compared to before the war, while in our country, they have increased by about 5,000 times. In comparison, the difference is huge. Therefore, although American goods are expensive, it is still considered cheap to import them into China. Although domestic goods are cheap, it is considered expensive to export them to foreign countries. Tung oil exports are no exception.

### Tonics are in Season, Codonopsis Pilosula Stands Out

Recently, the trend of traditional Chinese medicine has not improved. The prices of various goods continue to decline, but Codonopsis pilosula has shown unique brilliance. As an essential tonic in winter, sales are brisk, so Xikui Lude has increased by 16,000 yuan. The recent market prices are as follows: (unit: yuan)

Xikui Lude 16,000

Xitu Lude 14,000

Xigong Lude 12,000

Wen Dang Wang 12,000

Ten-Branch Angelica Sinensis 4,500

Fifteen-Branch Angelica Sinensis 3,200

Forty-Branch Angelica Head 18,000

Sixty-Branch Angelica Head 10,000

Eighty-Branch Angelica Head 6,000

### Zhejiang Sericulture Discusses Improvement Measures

The Zhejiang Sericulture Industry Association recently held its second member conference. Dozens of members attended. The Provincial Government, the Department of Construction, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the China Silk Corporation, the China Farmers Bank, and the Provincial Social Affairs Office all sent personnel to provide guidance. Chairman Xu Danren reported on the business situation over the past year and pointed out four points on how to improve the silkworm seed policy: (1) Cooperation between seed factories and silk factories; (2) Reasons for the failure of autumn seed production; (3) Improvement of seed production technology; (4) Requesting the Agricultural Bank to provide more loans. Subsequently, Section Chief Jiang of the _ Department of Construction and Zhu Xinyu, director of cocoon collection in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui of the China Silk Corporation, delivered speeches, and provided detailed discussions and opinions on the reasons for the low autumn seed production. After the speeches, the following issues were discussed: (1) Trying to achieve self-sufficiency in raw silk; (2) Progress on spring seed loans; (3) _ managed cold storage; (4) Determining spring seed prices.

### Dye Sales are Sluggish, the Stock of Defu Goods is Too Thin, and Substitutes are Unpopular

[This Newspaper Report] According to people in the dye industry, 70-80% of their business is special customized goods. The current transportation is not smooth, and purchasing from foreign cities is also sluggish. In this city, the sales volume is limited and purely depends on the prosperity of the silk and cotton cloth industries, which need the most stock. However, these two industries have not been very glorious or disgraced recently. In terms of dye supply, most foreign customers are accustomed to the Lion and Horse brand of Defu Foreign Company. The order forms received almost all specify Defu goods. Although foreign goods of the same type and quality are available, they are not popular. Because the liquidation office of Defu Foreign Company can only allocate a small amount of goods each week, and the stock is becoming increasingly thin. In terms of imports, the dye production in various countries is very small since the beginning of the post-war recovery. They are barely able to take care of themselves, and the amount of dye that can be exported is often very limited. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of ships, so few goods arrive. Therefore, there is no guarantee of a normal supply of dyes. After the foreign exchange adjustment in August, the prices of various dyes in this city generally increased by 60% to 100%, but business has not improved. In addition, there are many difficulties such as the lack of restored transportation in various places and the lack of dye supply. The recent situation of the industry is only described as unremarkable.

### Cocoon Reeling is Too Heavy, Three Dan of Japanese Cocoons Can Reel One Dan of Silk

[This Newspaper Report] Relevant personnel told reporters: The restoration of our country's silk industry is extremely difficult due to the heavy losses during the war; even with the full assistance of the government, it will take at least two years to restore pre-war production levels. The improvement of silkworm species is one of the most important tasks at present. Compared with Japan, three dan of Japanese cocoons can produce one dan of silk, while our country needs four dan. The variety is obviously behind. It is also learned that the Japanese original cocoons are difficult to obtain because the other party keeps the secret very strictly.

### Fierce Competition and Weak Purchasing Power: The Southern Goods Industry Also Falls into Difficulties

[Report from our newspaper] A person in charge of the Shanghai Southern Goods Industry Association recently told reporters: In this city, operators in the southern goods industry are divided by the type of goods. Sugar is the largest category, followed by seafood and dried longan. Taking sugar as an example, there are no less than seven well-funded firms engaged in procurement, and over one hundred wholesalers. There are over two hundred wholesalers dealing in seafood. More than sixty firms rely on trading dried longan for a living. In the past, the largest portion of sugar came from Java. The quality was the best, and the sweetness of seventy catties was comparable to one hundred catties of other types of sugar, hence the common name "70% sugar." However, since the victory, due to a shortage of ships, not much has arrived. Second-grade sugar comes from Taiwan and Fujian. Taiwanese sugar was refined during the Japanese era, making it white and attractive. It is said that it contained bone meal, hence the name "meat sugar." After our country took over Taiwan, the Taiwanese sugar became grayish in color and contained many impurities. The price of sugar in this city is about 190,000 yuan per dan at the highest and about 110,000 yuan at the lowest. Currently, the types of Taiwanese sugar valued by the Social Affairs Bureau are medium-grained raw sugar and fine-grained raw sugar. Although sugar is a necessity, it is taxed heavily. Before the war, the cost of a bag of sugar was four yuan, but the sugar tax was eight yuan. Today, on average, a bag of sugar is taxed about 60,000 yuan. There are not many domestic goods among seafood, limited to fresh fish from Fujian. The majority is British goods. As for dried longan, Fujian goods are very good, while those from Xiamen are of poorer quality. This year is a poor year for dried longan, and not much has arrived. Shanghai is the distribution center for the above three types of southern goods. Operating in the southern goods industry does not require extremely large capital, nor is it as difficult as running an industrial enterprise, but it also has its own problems: (1) Sales are sluggish due to weak purchasing power. At the same time, apart from sugar, southern goods are not necessities. Moreover, many new southern goods stores have opened recently, leading to fierce competition. As a result, southern goods stores have had poor business since the Mid-Autumn Festival. (2) High interest loans are also a major threat, with interest rates as high as 16% or 17%. (3) For the benefit of retailers and consumers, it is best for the procurement firms to establish a "Procurement Industry Association" to purchase directly from production locations, which can avoid exploitation by middlemen.

### The Seriousness of the Current Rural "Capital" and "Labor" Problems

— Zhang Bo’an

In recent years, due to the war, the rural labor force has long become a serious problem. After the victory, some lands abandoned due to the war were re-cultivated. However, rural labor is expensive, and farmers lack production capital, resulting in increasing production costs. "A good harvest means a lifetime of hardship; a lean year inevitably leads to death" is a true depiction of the current rural situation. If we want to understand the crux of the current rural decline, there are only two points: one is the shortage of rural production capital, and the other is the seriousness of the rural labor shortage. These are described below:

(1) The Exhaustion of Rural Production Capital: China's rural areas are vast, and they stand in the scientific age of the twentieth century with the most ancient production methods, while cities are like blood vessels that absorb the vast rural areas. Therefore, as early as ten or twenty years ago, there were already voices of rural collapse. The eight years of hard fighting have further depleted the vitality of the countryside. In addition, wherever the beasts went, houses were reduced to ruins. Restoring the countryside will take decades, and under this realistic rural situation, how can there not be a shortage of rural capital? When capital is exhausted, production is reduced accordingly. Agricultural affairs are restricted by natural seasons. Whenever "capital" is needed, it is often impossible to obtain it. Even if it can be obtained, the future crops must first be used as collateral for the loan. In recent years, the efforts of agricultural banks to provide agricultural loans seem to have brought some benefits to the countryside. However, providing for the vast rural areas with limited capital feels like a drop in the ocean. In terms of the actual situation of agricultural loans, it is feared that very few genuine farmers can access national funds. As Mr. Jiang Baili said, Chinese affairs can only be viewed with a telescope, not with a microscope. Everything is the same, and how can "agricultural loans" be an exception? Furthermore, in terms of agricultural harvests, this year's rice fields have had favorable weather and abundant harvests. Assuming that each mu of rice field yields two shi of rice (author's note: In the Jiangnan area, each mu of rice field originally yielded an average of 2.5 shi, but due to reduced fertilization and insufficient labor in recent years, two shi is now the highest ideal yield). It takes three months and requires ten laborers, costing 3,000 yuan per laborer, totaling 30,000 yuan. Fertilizer and seeds cost about 20,000 yuan, totaling 50,000 yuan. The harvest of two shi of rice is currently priced at 35,000 yuan per shi of brown rice at the production site, totaling 70,000 yuan. Adding the income from rice straw is 2,000 yuan, totaling 72,000 yuan. With three months of time and 50,000 yuan of capital, the harvest is 72,000 yuan. Therefore, the average income per mu of rice field is 7,000 yuan. This refers to owner-farmers. For tenant farmers, after paying the rent, how much is left? Therefore, this year, there are more and more coolies from the countryside in Shanghai.

(2) The Seriousness of the Rural Labor Shortage: Staying put and guarding their homes is the indomitable spirit of our farmers. Even during the war, when the flames of war were raging, farmers would not abandon their fields and ancestral graves unless absolutely necessary. After the victory, why did they abandon their fields and wander around? This question is worth studying. First, they can no longer struggle on the death line in the countryside. Farming means only death, and wandering to the city is better than death. As a result, the rural population has greatly shifted to the cities. Although life in the city is difficult, it is a million times better than in the countryside. This phenomenon is very frightening. Second, in the current rural society, the unsoundness of basic-level politics often makes it impossible for farmers to withstand the heavy exploitation. This is a fact. Third, production capital is exhausted, so they have no choice but to abandon it and change course. The above three problems are the biggest reasons for the migration of the rural population. However, the migration of the rural population to the cities has made rural labor more expensive, and production volume and productivity have declined even further. This is simply the eve of the total collapse of the countryside.

The decline of industry and commerce and the hardship of people's livelihoods depend fundamentally on the efforts to revive the countryside. Otherwise, any rescue measures are unimaginable.

### Opening Up the Silk Market, Sending Personnel to India

[Report from our newspaper] The China Silk Company will send personnel to India in the shortest possible time to conduct liaison work and seek to expand overseas markets. Related people told reporters: India is the most promising market for raw silk exports. Because before the war, a lot of Japanese goods were used in the raw silk in India. If our country can take over this part of the market, the amount will be considerable. Secondly, the price of silk in the Indian market today is higher than that in Europe and the United States. If our country can export in large quantities, it will naturally be profitable. However, it is regrettable that when the War of Resistance was just won, a group of speculators sold more than 4,000 packages of the worst quality old silk to Indian merchants, causing our country's commercial credit to be completely lost. At present, even if Indian merchants place orders, they are for small quantities of one or two hundred packages, and they dare not order large quantities at all. The purpose of sending personnel to India this time is to explain the misunderstanding and seek to open up the Indian market.

### Central Trust Bureau Tenders for Yarn and Cloth

The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent to sell government materials and property, will be tendering for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, rayon fabrics, rock sugar, and white sugar, as well as a batch of various parts, on the 29th of this month at 3:00 PM. Bidding will start from today until 12:00 PM on the 29th.

### A List of New Invention Patents Approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs Since the Restoration; There Are Still Twenty-Two Cases Under Review

[Report from our newspaper] Since the National Government promulgated regulations to encourage industrial technology and implemented them, many items or methods researched by Chinese people in industrial technology have been submitted for awards and have been approved for patents. According to Director Wu Chengluo of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and related authorities, the ministry has received more than 1,400 applications for inventions to date. More than 500 people have been approved for patents and have obtained patent certificates. In addition to sincerely encouraging such inventions, the ministry is working hard to strengthen its organization and actively expand its work. During the War of Resistance, those who had already obtained patent rights but suffered losses due to the war or were unable to manufacture and sell them due to obstruction could state their reasons and apply for an extension of their patent period. It is reported that the ministry has reviewed and approved twenty-two invention cases. This is the first public announcement since the restoration, and there are also twenty-two invention cases under review. The patents that have been reviewed and approved are listed below:

Once the review is completed, it will be announced in accordance with the law. (Urgent Public)

### Smuggling Impairs the Match Industry; Current Production is Only 60% of Pre-War Levels; Competition is Too Fierce, but Quality Has Improved

[Report from our newspaper] Related parties told reporters: The production volume of the match industry in this city is currently only about 60% of the pre-war level. The main reason for the decline in production is that competition is too fierce and sales are poor. Since 1941, many small factories have been established in this city. The production costs of their products are lower, so they sell very well in rural areas. According to statistics from the industry association, there are a total of twenty-four large-scale match factories in this city, with Da Zhonghua and Da Ming being the largest, each with a registered capital of 10 million yuan. The registered capital of the remaining historical match factories ranges from 5 million to 50 million yuan. As for the exact production numbers of each factory, the association is still investigating. The sales of matches produced in this city are mainly along the Beijing-Shanghai line, and some are transported to the north. According to people in the industry, the quality of matches is currently slightly better than before the war. Foreigners who have set up match factories include the American Meiguang Company, which produces Rose Tree and Wheel Brand matches, and the Swedish Ruizhong Foreign Firm, which produces Phoenix Brand matches. Both factories have a long history and are large in scale, but because they do not join the industry association, their production volume is unknown. There are not many imported matches. Some are relief supplies sold on the market, and there are also a large number of matches sold without stamps, which are smuggled goods. In terms of raw materials for matches, self-sufficiency was once possible during the war. Shanghai once had the establishment of the Shanghai Match Raw Material Factory; today, with the sea route reopened and a large number of American goods pouring in, this factory has closed down. What the match industry hopes for at present is to effectively crack down on smuggling to maintain normal business.

### Overseas Chinese Who Resumed Business Loans with Priority for Those Who Resisted the Enemy

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, a considerable number of our overseas compatriots in various places directly or indirectly participated in the motherland, or assisted in the local work of resisting the enemy. Among them, there were also many who went bankrupt as a result. In order to commend national integrity and encourage loyalty, our government intends to formulate measures for overseas Chinese to resume business loans, with the right to enjoy priority loans for those who have made contributions during the enemy occupation period. The Bangkok Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang directly under the Central Overseas Department received a telegram from the Central Overseas Department, Jinghai San (35), No. 1133, which provided some explanation of the measures. The overseas party departments at all levels should take note of this. According to the application submitted by the Philippine General Branch, overseas Chinese who have had their property confiscated should be granted priority loan rights. The Ministry of Finance has approved the letter, Caiqian Yi, No. 17676, dated April 13, 1946. The letter stated, "After the promulgation and implementation of the measures for overseas Chinese to resume business loans, in order to reward overseas Chinese who have made contributions to the work of resisting the enemy during the enemy occupation period, this department has determined the order of priority for loans as follows: (1) Overseas Chinese who directly participated in the motherland or local work of resisting the enemy during the enemy occupation period, (2) Those who indirectly participated in assisting the motherland or local work of resisting the enemy, (3) Those who did not cooperate with the enemy. Those who participated in enemy or puppet organizations or are suspected of colluding with the enemy will not be granted loans. The above situations should be certified separately by the overseas consulates in accordance with Article 4 of the Measures for Overseas Chinese to Resume Business Loans for the overseas Chinese who are applying for loans, and the handling bank shall handle them in accordance with the regulations. The head office has already handled them in accordance with the regulations. I hereby reply to the inquiry and request that it be forwarded to all comrades and overseas Chinese for their information." - Central Overseas Department, Shiyin.

### Indian Government Collects Export Tax on Raw Cotton at 20 Rupees per Bale

[Reuters, New Delhi, 6th] The Indian government today promulgated a decree stipulating that the government may collect export tax on raw cotton, and the tax rate may be changed at any time within the prescribed maximum amount. This decree shall take effect from today, and the central government announced that from today until further notice, the export tax on raw cotton is set at 20 rupees per bale.

### Japan's Cocoon Transportation to China Not Yet Ready

[Report from our newspaper] The issue of transporting Japanese cocoons to China has not been resolved because an agreement has not yet been reached on the quantity and price, so the person in charge of China Silk has not yet made the trip. At present, this matter is still being fully negotiated by Mr. Zhu Shiming. If the transportation of Japanese cocoons to China cannot be realized, silk factories in our country will generally suspend work for half a year; if the quantity is less than 10 million pounds, there will also be partial shutdowns. Chu Fucheng, chairman of the Silk Filature Association of the Third District (Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui), has requested the government to pay attention and strive for the transportation of Japanese cocoons to China in order to save the crisis in the silk filature industry.

### US Lumber Exports Decrease

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The US Civilian Production Administration announced: In the three months of the third quarter of 1946, the US's lumber exports decreased by 20 million board feet because the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has agreed to change the original procurement of lumber from the United States to procurement from the Soviet Union and Brazil for foreign use. The United States can use the lumber saved for housing construction. The United States originally planned to export 199.3 million board feet of lumber in these three months, but in reality, 129.3 million board feet were exported.

### The Current Situation of the World Cotton Market After Fluctuations in US Cotton Prices

[Reuters, Manchester, 6th] The Manchester Guidance Report stated: Lancashire is not surprised by the rise and fall of New York cotton prices. Other cotton-producing countries' markets have tried to avoid being involved in the whirlpool of fluctuations in the US cotton market. Bombay cotton prices fluctuated slightly at one time, but are currently higher than in early October. Alexandria market prices seem to be still bullish. The São Paulo cotton market was once affected by the sharp drop in US cotton prices, but the general situation is also quite optimistic, because Brazil's cotton exports to the United States, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands have increased compared to last year.

### The Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy Property in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regularly Clears All Warehouses

The Bureau for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will be closed at the end of this year, and some institutions are gradually being scaled down. All received enemy and puppet materials are being sold off at an accelerated pace, entering the liquidation phase. It is reported that the bureau is counting warehouse materials. If the materials are of large quantity and value, they will be entrusted to relevant professional institutions for sorting and resale. Other remaining materials, or scattered and disorganized items, or bulky and difficult to move, cannot be entrusted to agencies for resale one by one. They will be entrusted to the Jianghai Customs to auction the warehouses as units, scheduling dates for each warehouse. Later, in order to expand the scope of the auction, the Central Trust Bureau was also entrusted to set up a resale committee to handle the auction. This work has been going on for five months since the beginning, with an average monthly income of more than 20 billion yuan, all of which has been remitted to the national treasury. Due to the stepped-up cleaning last month, the income reached 37 billion yuan, and this month's income is also expected to maintain this figure. It is reported that the Disposal Bureau has set the end of this month to completely dispose of the received warehouse materials in order to clear all warehouses.

### Leather Prices Fall

Recently, under the pressure of tight monetary policy in this city, most commodity prices have stopped rising and turned to fall. The most significant drop has been in leather, because recently, the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau has released a large batch of enemy and puppet leather reserves, but the outlets are sluggish. Bidders have to reduce prices to sell off the goods.

### Living Expenses in Hong Kong Are Over 13 Yuan Per Person

[Hong Kong News] According to the Labor Department's announcement yesterday, the cost of food and fuel per person for the past week was 13 yuan, 2 jiao, and 8 cents (Hong Kong dollars). The items included are listed below.

### Li Shizeng Has Now Left Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] Member of the Central Committee, Li Shizeng, has been in Beiping for two months and will fly to Nanjing tomorrow morning to attend the World Academic Conference. At 11:30 this morning, he hosted a reception for academic, educational, business, and local leaders in the city to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the World Society.

### Jiaotong University Needs Funds for Re-establishment: Approved for Overdraft of 300 Million

[Our Report, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Education previously reported to the Executive Yuan that the restoration work of various affiliated schools was facing a huge shortage of travel and construction funds, requesting an additional 120 billion yuan. Before the funds were allocated, it also requested the National Bank to allow the schools to apply for loans. The Four Banks Joint Office had previously approved the use of due restoration funds to borrow 3 billion yuan from the National Bank in advance. Now, the Ministry of Education intends to have the schools handle the loan themselves, but the Ministry of Education must first borrow 3 billion yuan to allocate it in a unified manner. That is, after each school needs funds for restoration, it will apply to the Ministry of Education to determine the amount, and then forward it to the Four Banks Joint Office for approval, with the Ministry of Education guaranteeing the total amount, limited to 3 billion yuan. The board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Office decided on the 24th to handle it according to the Ministry of Education's opinion. In addition, Jiaotong University's application for an overdraft due to the need for funds for re-establishment was approved for an overdraft of 300 million yuan within the 3 billion yuan limit, in accordance with the above-mentioned method, to provide assistance.

### All Circles in This City Held a Meeting Yesterday to Commemorate Tao Xingzhi

The famous educator, Mr. Tao Xingzhi, died in Shanghai on July 25th of this year due to cerebral congestion, causing national mourning. All circles in the city held a memorial meeting for Mr. Tao yesterday (27th) at 9:30 am in the auditorium of Aurora University on Luma Road.

### The Penalty Kick Almost Led to Displeasure: Donghua Defeats Longjie Juniors: Result 2-1, Longjie Lacked Experience: Disobeyed the Referee's Decision, Persuaded to Continue the Game

[Our Report] In the second act of the Group A football match, Donghua veterans fought Longjie rookies at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. Donghua finally defeated Longjie with their battlefield experience. The result was 2-1. Donghua took the lead 1-0 in the first half. After all, Longjie's juniors were less experienced. In contrast, Donghua was more stable. Although Longjie was young and strong, due to playing small football for a long time, their position and playing style needed to be improved, and the strength of the forwards was also poor. However, they fought very hard and have hope in the future. The audience wanted to know what kind of team the new army was, so they came in droves, and there were also three or four thousand fans.

Donghua Scores First: Donghua kicked off and attacked. Youliang shot high, and Li quickly, was caught by Sheng Peter. Donghua failed to enter several times, and the three armies worked hard. Huang Kehou dribbled forward, passed it to Chen Mingzhe, and picked it up to Youliang. Jia cleverly passed it to Li , who lived up to his mission and built the first success for Donghua, one quarter of an hour after the start of the game. Longjie's rookies counterattacked, but all failed. After thirty minutes, Longhai missed twice, and Li swept near the door, but he was still caught by Sheng Peter, all in vain. The first half ended, with Donghua leading 1-0.

Penalty Kick: After changing sides, Longjie replaced Zhang Jiuqing with Shen Jinda. Longjie attacked first, and Wang Burong shot wildly. Longhai shot, but was saved by Sheng Peter. Longjie's fortunes finally turned around. After ten minutes, Wang Burong threw a boundary ball, and Gao Xiuqing built a single-handed success and returned, tying the score at 1-1. Since then, although Donghua's offensive was frequent, it all failed until the 42nd minute, when Longjie's Zhou Yongfang committed a handball in the penalty area and was judged to have a penalty kick. Donghua's Tan Fuzhen took the knife and hit it in one fell swoop. However, at this time, Longjie's players believed that the handball was outside the penalty area and should not be judged as a penalty kick, and they planned to leave the field immediately. Fortunately, the main cadre Cui Shifu knew the general situation and ordered them to enter the field to replay. Before long, the statutory time had arrived, and Donghua narrowly defeated Longjie 2-1.

### Huasheng Basketball Team's Farewell Battle: Loses to Shantou Team by One Goal: Result 31-29, Difference of Two Points: Lin Weicong's Long Shot in the Last Second

In the last battle of the Huasheng basketball team in Shanghai, it faced the Shantou team at the Municipal Gymnasium at 5 pm yesterday. As a result, Huasheng lost to the Shantou team by one goal. The result was 31-29, with Huasheng leading 14-13 in the first half. Yesterday's game attracted a considerable audience and was quite lively. After the game, the Municipal Gymnasium and the County Party Committee presented Huasheng with a silver cup.

The Heyday of Huasheng: The Huasheng players were Liu Xueqi, Wang Hongbin, Fu Jinsheng, Guo Jinming, and Wang Jinbei. The Shantou team was Cai Yanxiong, Lin Weicong, Liu Jingxing, He Lide, and Ji Nankang. The referees were Zhai Honglu and Liu Hesheng. Huasheng had a great momentum on the court, and the Shantou team was at a loss. Huasheng's Xue Xiao Hongbin Jinsheng was bound to hit, and Phosphorus led 7-1. At that time, Huasheng replaced Wang Jinliang with Han Wentian. Hongbin Jinsheng scored twice, and 11-1 was the heyday of Huasheng. The Shantou team replaced Liu Jingxing with Chen Qingjiang. Before long, the first quarter ended, 12-3, and Huasheng had an absolute advantage. In the second quarter, the Shantou team's Lin Weicong and Chen Qingjiang were very active, and the score gradually approached. Huasheng only scored two goals by Guo Jinming's penalty. At the end of the first half, 13 to 14, the Shantou team was one point behind.

The Shantou Team Overcomes Later: After the break, the battle resumed. The Shantou team's He Lide scored twice, and the score suddenly exceeded. At this time, Huasheng became a follower, but the difference was only one or two points. The third quarter ended, and the Shantou team took the lead 23-21. In the final quarter, Chen Qingjiang scored first, and Huasheng's Liu Xueqi passed to Jinsheng and broke the basket in succession, leading again with 27 to 25. At that time, Chuan Jinsheng left the field with five fouls, and Han Wentian was replaced. The Shantou team scored two penalties and each tied 27 points. In the last second, at 29-29, Lin Weicong took a long shot from the center circle. The bell rang after the shot, and the basket was broken, and it was judged as a winning goal. As a result, Huasheng unfortunately lost to the Shantou team with 29 to 31, a difference of two points.

### Abuse of the Red Cross Symbol; Municipal Government Ordered to Ban It

The General Association of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China believes that the Red Cross emblem should be jointly owned by all Red Cross societies worldwide. Except as stipulated in the 1929 International Red Cross Convention, all rescue teams accompanying the military, those used for transporting, examining, and caring for the wounded and sick, and personnel engaged in the management of rescue teams' weaving locations, as well as military chaplains, are protected by the convention with the Chinese government's recognition and permission for personnel of rescue associations and rescue equipment, and have the right to use the special white-background red cross symbol. Other individuals or associations are not allowed to use it, and even more, are not allowed to impersonate this Red Cross symbol and name for commercial or other purposes. However, since the War of Resistance against Japan, non-statutory health organizations and practicing physicians in various places have widely abused the white-background red cross symbol, which is detrimental to international reputation. A telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan requesting it to instruct provincial and municipal governments to direct their subordinates, together with the local authorities in charge, to strictly prohibit such abuses in order to rectify international perception. It is reported that after receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, the municipal government yesterday issued instructions to its subordinates to comply.

### Cross-Section of Wuyuan Tea; Once Shone Infinitely in the International Market

— Wuyuan Quick News, 12th; Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo

The foundation of a country's economy must have many special products as its source. The lifeline of a county's economy also has one or two products as the basis of its livelihood. Large ones like the silk and cotton of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the grain of Hunan and Jiangxi, and small ones like the porcelain of Jingdezhen and the black tea of Qimen, each have been endowed with unique vitality due to soil and climate.

"Qihong" (Qimen Black Tea) and "Wulv" (Wuyuan Green Tea) are the highest grades among China's exported "yangzhuang" teas. Wuyuan's precious green tea has always been known worldwide along with Qimen black tea. The total number of tea farmers, tea merchants, tea workers, and tea companies in the county who depend on tea for a living is no less than 50,000. The regulation of rural finance also relies on tea prices and wages to circulate. The history of Wuyuan tea trade has lasted for more than 200 years, but now it has disappeared invisibly in the short period of seven or eight years, which is truly heartbreaking!

Past Tea Market

Wuyuan's Chouzhen, Tezhen, Zhenmei, Meimei, Tegong, Mazhu, Zhenmei, and other green teas have always been the main products for foreign export and occupy an important position in the international market. Before the War of Resistance against Japan, Wuyuan tea production was more than 100,000 boxes per year, which recovered a considerable amount of lost revenue. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the export of tea was severely hit. Especially after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the foreign sales of "yangzhuang" boxed tea were completely blocked. The tea firms that operated "yangzhuang" tea closed down one after another, and tea merchants and tea workers switched to small-scale brokerage, living as independent brokers, selling to inland ports such as Nanchang, Ji'an, Wucheng, Zhangshu, and Ganzhou, depending on the convenience of waterway transportation. The lively scenes of tea companies gathering in various villages once a year have not been seen today.

New Tea Production

The four borders of this county are mostly mountainous, and the area planted with tea is second only to rice fields. Whether in remote mountain corners, flat gardens, all are planted with tea bushes. In the past, the output of spring tea was as high as 70,000 to 80,000 dan per year. In the past ten years, the output has gradually decreased. This year, the total output of new tea in the county is less than 6,000 dan, which is almost a tenfold decrease compared with the previous year. The degree of decline is unbelievable. There are four reasons for this: (1) tea gardens are converted to plant cotton and miscellaneous grains; (2) due to the lack of labor, the tea is left uncultivated and not picked or produced; (3) summer tea is not picked; (4) no human fertilizer is added for cultivation. Due to these four reasons, tea seems to have been abandoned by tea farmers as waste, no wonder the production has naturally declined.

Tea Farmers' Trend

In the past, when the tea market was booming, as soon as the new tea started to be produced, the tea companies would mobilize to purchase it. Before the tea was finished, it would be bought by the companies competing with each other. The tea farmers relied on this regular income to maintain their agricultural capital. The total annual tea price income of the county was a larger amount than any other local product. As the saying goes, "Those who have a stable income have a stable mind." The tea farmers relied on this reliable stable income throughout the year, focusing their energy on the tea gardens, fertilizing, and expanding the tea land, putting their greatest effort into the green tea trees, hoping for increased production. In recent years, the situation is the opposite of the past. The produced tea is left unattended. Carrying it on their shoulders to sell, the price obtained does not cover the cost of the tea. As the saying goes, "Those who have no stable income have no stable mind." This makes them complain about the tea production, and they have to find other ways to make a living. This is a natural trend, without any element of forced possibility.

Domestic and Foreign Sales

Tea is divided into "yangzhuang" and "benzhuang." "Yangzhuang" boxed tea is sold to Europe and America, and "benzhuang" basket tea is sold domestically. In the past, "yangzhuang" boxed tea exports accounted for 90% of the output, while "benzhuang" only accounted for 10%. In recent years, the export route has been blocked. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Huizhou tea market in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou could not be exported. The "benzhuang" basket tea purchased by stores was only sold to various ports in the unoccupied areas, and the quantity was very small. Although the enemy-occupied areas offered higher prices to purchase Huizhou tea, merchants in this county did not dare to try this smuggling risk. The produced tea could only be left to mold, without finding other outlets. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, domestic and foreign sales remained sluggish, and there was no sign of improvement. The sales volume of "yangzhuang" tea companies in this county this year is only 2,000 to 3,000 dan, and the domestic store sales market is even smaller than in previous years. Even the Xiehechang Tea Company, which was known as the largest in the area, only purchased more than 300 dan of tea this year. The amount collected by other scattered tea vendors is even smaller. At present, Taiwan's red and green tea and Japanese tea have large production volumes and are sold abroad at lower costs than Chinese tea. Looking at the current domestic and foreign sales of Wuyuan green tea, the future may be even more bleak, which is not yet known.

Tea Companies Lack Capital

In the past, there were no less than 300 tea companies in this county. Each tea company only needed 10,000 yuan of its own capital and a loan of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan from a tea warehouse to start producing 200 to 300 boxes of tea for the year's business. Because at that time, the price of tea was low, only 20 to 30 yuan per dan. Each company purchased 300 dan of tea, only requiring 10,000 yuan for the tea price. The remaining labor, food, raw materials, and transportation costs only required more than 10,000 yuan. The capital of each tea company, the larger ones (producing more boxes) were 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the smaller ones were 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and most were sole proprietorships, with very few joint-stock organizations. Now the price of tea has increased, each dan costs 100,000 yuan or more. Processing 100 dan of tea requires capital of 10 million yuan. Each tea company must process at least 200 dan of tea, which requires capital of 20 million yuan. Adding the cost of tin, boxes, paper, indigo, raw materials, tea making, tea picking, tea roasting, screening, labor, and transportation costs requires 40 million yuan. A tea company that processes 200 dan of tea needs a total capital of 60 million yuan. The tea merchants in this county have weak financial resources, and they can only sigh at the current operation of tea companies!

Although the government has released tea loans, prudent tea merchants believe that the interest rate is too high and the procedures are too restrictive. If they receive a tea loan, they must produce tea. If the cost increases and the tea does not sell, they will not be able to repay the principal and interest within the limited time. If they recognize the interest for a long time, they will lose all their capital and accumulate debts. The reason why tea companies dare not open their doors now is because they lack funds, and they really have the difficulty of "short sleeves making it hard to dance."

Market Price Increase

For any business, one must calculate the cost of one's goods before proceeding with the transaction. In the past, the cost of raw tea was only 20 to 30 yuan per dan, and tea farmers still had a small profit. This year, the price of tea has risen to 100,000 yuan, and tea farmers believe that there is no profit, regardless of the effort to make tea. Tea companies purchase tea at 100,000 yuan per dan, and adding labor, raw materials, and transportation costs, each dan of tea costs 300,000 yuan. At the current Shanghai market price, the highest-priced tea has not reached this value, and there is no profit to be made. If the desire of tea farmers is to be satisfied, the price of each dan of tea must be increased to 200,000 yuan, and the cost of raw materials and labor will inevitably rise accordingly. Thus, the selling price of each dan of tea must be 1 million yuan to make a profit. The price of 1 million yuan per dan of tea, I am afraid that among all kinds of native products in the world, there is absolutely no such high price. If the tea trade can turn around in the future, the price of tea should be reduced as much as possible to reduce costs as the first step. From the perspectives of production, consumption, and the foreign market, the way out for Wuyuan tea is to estimate that the price of tea will not increase in the future.

Future Tea Industry

Every product will inevitably undergo a change after a certain period. Wuyuan tea trade has a history of more than 200 years, and it is now facing a disaster, perhaps entering a period of transformation. However, when trying to measure the reasons for its transformation, there are traces to be found. The mountainous soil of Wuyuan has not changed, and the color, aroma, and taste of tea have not changed in the slightest. The reputation of "Qihong" and "Wulv" will not be allowed to be copied by other teas.

The reason why it cannot become more prosperous day by day and cannot compete with foreign tea in the market is that human efforts and improved new knowledge have not been fully utilized. (1) Tea farmers do not put their efforts into cultivation and provide effective cultivation and nourishment suitable for the tea's nature. (2) Tea farmers mostly seek quick results and ease in tea picking, tea kneading, and tea roasting, without refining the picking of tender tea and producing it carefully. There are even inferior practices of crude picking, rough drying, and sun-drying. (3) Tea companies have short capital and lack the organization of large-scale companies. The manufacturing methods and decorations are mostly reduced in workmanship and crude materials, without seeking improvement. (4) Tea companies only know how to engage in brokerage and make profits, without deep-seated competition. (5) The government lacks low-interest loan assistance and practical management, and lacks specialized technical personnel to help improve.

With a rare natural special product in the world, they do not know how to cherish and value it, letting it grow and die on its own. No wonder the tea market is declining day by day and it is difficult to step onto the broad road of the international market. In the future, if we want to reverse the decline of the tea industry, the government, tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea workers must work together to understand how beneficial the export of tea is to the country and what the relationship is between the interests of tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea workers. How to improve the manufacturing and planting, so that the production can be increased and the tea quality can be improved, and what methods can be used to compete with foreign tea. If we understand these four key points, perhaps the buried tea market will have the hope of restoring prosperity, otherwise the future market will only provide tea people with the illusion of mirages and false hopes, which cannot give us real success.

### The Thirteenth Army in Rehe; Defend Must Be Solid, Attack Must Be Victorious; Fighting Rats Like Fighting Tigers

—航讯, 16th; Ziji, Posted from Chengde

Chengde is a summer resort for Qing emperors. In order to promote border policy, palaces and eight large-scale Lama temples were built here. Although it has experienced several disturbances and was destroyed, the painted pavilions and carved beams are still there, but they are dilapidated and desolate. The towering Six Harmonies Pagoda, the winding palace walls, the verdant and graceful ancient pines, and the lotus-filled Ruyi Island still faintly show the prosperity of that year. Sitting upright among the steles and inscriptions, one feels deeply the ancient meaning. At the northern end of Ruyi Yuan, there is a long rectangular pond made of stone, which is said to be the Rehe River. Even in the middle of winter, its water does not freeze. The name Rehe may have originated from this.

The Shield of North China Behind the Northeast

Rehe is a province in Inner Mongolia and a stepping stone for foreign invaders in past dynasties. Its location is outside the Great Wall, with the Yinshan Mountains running across it, forming a barrier with the heart of North China, Tianjin and Beijing. The independence of Outer Mongolia is not only insufficient as a buffer zone between China and the Soviet Union, but also makes the position of Inner Mongolia in national defense even more important. Shanhaiguan, Xifengkou, and Gubeikou are the passages into and out of the Great Wall. Rehe is the corridor between the Northeast and Guannei, serving as the rear of the Northeast and the shield of North China.

Rehe is a barren province. Due to climate and soil, it cannot be listed as a major grain-producing area. However, the coal of Fuxin and Beipiao, and the fur of Chifeng Weichang, can also be used for national defense needs. The Fuxin and Beipiao coal mines were mined extensively during the Japanese occupation, making them the most important industrial areas after Fushun. The fire power here far exceeds the power generated by the wartime capital Chongqing. It can be used by towns hundreds of miles away. In addition, coal, gold, silver, lead, zinc, iron ore, medicinal materials, timber, sorghum, and other products buried underground should not be ignored. The province's main transportation network is composed of the Jin (zhou), Gu (beikou), Ye (baishou), and Chi (feng) railways. The military value of these two railways far exceeds their commercial value. All important towns in the territory are accessible by highways, which are very convenient for military and civilian use. The province covers an area of more than 190,000 square kilometers and is inhabited by 6 million people, including 800,000 Mongolians. The administrative "separate governance" and "joint governance" of Han and Mongolians have been reformed many times, and there is still no final conclusion. After the independence of Outer Mongolia and the strange drama of so-called "East Mongolia Autonomous Region" directed by the Chinese Communists, the problems of these ethnic minorities have become more complex, but it seems that they have not reached a serious stage. The general public was already very poor. After twelve years of exploitation by the Japanese and one year of "benevolent rule" by the Chinese Communists, food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all problems, and they are already facing a serious stage. Sorghum, millet, and potatoes are the main food crops. After the Communist army's large-scale requisition, there is widespread famine everywhere, especially the lack of clothing, which is barely enough to cover the body. Most children are naked, and even the whole family shares a pair of pants. When one person goes out, the whole family has to close the door and sleep.

Soviet Soldiers Bring Eighth Route Army and Communist Representatives

After the Japanese army entered Rehe, it was included in the "Puppet Manchukuo" territory, and all facilities were the same as those in the Northeast. It initially showed leniency, and then used the police to strictly control it. To this day, people still turn pale at the mention of the police. Last year, on August 15, Japan surrendered, and the Soviet army entered from Outer Mongolia. Many enemy and puppet materials and people's property followed them. Their military discipline left a very deep impression on the people's minds. At the same time, they brought the "People's Army" – the Eighth Route Army, all empty-handed, carrying their bags, claiming to have fought against Japan for eight years and defeated the enemy, "Don't you need weapons to fight a war, just talk with your mouth?" The people had the first question about the Eighth Route Army. The weapons of the Eighth Route Army were distributed outside the customs. Under the slogan of "democracy," they held "popular elections for chairman." Li Yunchang, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a declaration of "protecting the safety of the lives and property of the people of Rehe." The situation at that time was difficult to understand. It is unlikely that other political parties participated in the election. They used cars to transport the so-called "people's representatives from various counties" to participate in the election. They raised their hands to vote on the spot, and Li Yunchang was elected as the chairman of Rehe Province. After that, the "struggles" and "liquidations" made the safety of the lives and property of the people a problem, negating their promises. When the national army recovered Chengde, the "popularly elected provincial government" was said to have moved north or south. It is impossible to determine. Based on the principle of "counties not leaving counties and townships not leaving townships," it is natural that "provinces do not leave provinces either." Anyway, in this province, there are many mountains and no one knows where they are.

### The People of Rehe Have Four Comments on the Communist Army: A Knife's Heart, Tofu's Mouth, Small Leather Belly, Rabbit's Legs

Compatriots in government-controlled areas have always considered the "liberated areas" a mystery. Were they "heaven" or "hell"? Once you arrive in the newly recovered areas, you will know. All the compatriots in Rehe have praised it with one voice. In the demobilization and reorganization of the army, they actively "expanded the army" and "contributed grain," and the army lived in the homes of the people, breaking the propaganda of "reducing rent and interest." Unlimited "contributions," the Communist soldiers ate free meals in the homes of the people, turning the people into paupers. "Liquidation" is the largest corruption case ever. Each time "liquidation" is carried out, in addition to the land, houses, and furniture being distributed to the poor, the remaining cash and valuables are contributed to the "government" and put into private pockets. In the Communist army, Communist Party members eat white noodles and are given seven catties of pork per month to show preferential treatment. Such a political party is also unseen and unheard of. The most beautiful trick they play is destruction. Whether it is railways, highways, factories, mines, electricity, telephones, or all public buildings and houses of rich families, all are destroyed. It is said that destruction is a means of striving for democracy. The railway industry operated by the Japanese during the occupation had reserved value in terms of military, political, and livelihood aspects. What is left now is a vast expanse of desolation. This kind of action is not understood by patriots. Most of the soldiers of the Communist army are forced to join, and they are strictly monitored and cannot be dispersed to fight. Therefore, they often adopt night attacks and dense charges. The only tactic of the Communist army commanders to attack fortified positions is to drive the soldiers into the national army's fire net. They often lie dead in front of machine guns. The Communist army's escape wind is extremely strong, so the combat power consumed in desertion is more than the casualties. The people in the "liberated areas" are not deaf or dumb, and they have their own public opinion. It's just that the voice is too weak. There are four popular comments in Rehe about the Chinese Communist Party: "A knife's heart, a tofu's mouth, a small leather belly, and a rabbit's legs."

Rehe was also a place that had been occupied for twelve years. The government's takeover was entirely armed. The receiving personnel followed the army forward. Government agencies, warehouses, factories, and people had all been "liberated" and had become deserted. The property received had long fallen into the hands of others, leaving behind a broken city and countryside waiting to be restored. From the time the national army entered Rehe in January to the ceasefire on January 13, the vanguard only reached Pingquan, and what was received was only a railway line that was uncertain from morning to night. The orders of the provincial government could not be separated from the railway, and the orders of the county government could not get out of the city gate. The so-called "anti-Japanese regime" still exists in the countryside. Personnel from administrative agencies only operate in the areas where the army is stationed, laying the foundation for the takeover after the area is captured. The war situation has turned around, and Chengde, Weichang, Chifeng, and Micheng have been recovered at a rapid speed. The recovered area has been expanded, and the administrative personnel have been stimulated by the new expansion, and they have launched new receiving work in coordination with military operations. The administrative efficiency has obviously improved a lot compared with half a year ago.

A Powerful Long Spear Inserted into the Interior of Rehe to Cover the Corridor Between the Northeast and North China

At most, there were four and a half divisions of the national army here, and at least there was only one 13th Army. It has supported itself in this difficult and arduous environment for more than half a year. This elite force is equipped with American weapons and is full of vitality. In Bailingmiao, Nankou, Xinkou, Taierzhuang, Jiangbei, Enan, Ebei, Exi, Guinan, Guiliu, Wu Sui, and Dedi, it left behind brilliant achievements and has always stood on the front line of national defense. During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, it traversed the areas of the border fortress, the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, without staying there for consolidation. The opportunity for their training is in combat and long and hot marches. In mid-November of last year, it knocked on the door of Shanhaiguan and became the first to set foot in the Northeast, which had been occupied for fourteen years. It recovered Suizhong in one breath, laying the foundation for determining the takeover of the Northeast. In January of this year, braving the wind and snow, it recovered the two major mining areas of Beizhen and Beipiao, and was advancing north. Suddenly, it made a 90-degree turn to the left and entered the interior of Rehe like lightning. As soon as it arrived in Pingquan, it received a ceasefire order and stopped moving forward. An army drew a line from Xingcheng in the east to Benxi, through Beipiao, Gushan, Chaoyang, Yebaishou, Lingyuan, and even Pingquan, a snake formation that was more than a thousand miles long. Even people who don't understand military affairs were nervous for them. In fact, this is not a single line, but a long gun inserted into the abdomen of Rehe, grasping the traffic between North China and the Northeast, and sheltering the corridor between the Northeast and North China. After the ceasefire, the joint meeting of national and communist commanders was held twice through the Chengde, Chifeng, and Chaoyang three groups, but there were no results. Xiao Ke spent a lot of effort and twisted facts to argue for the issue of separating the two armies, from which we can see the elements of "ceasefire" and "peace" in the Communist army. The commander of the pacification zone, General Shi Jue, the commander of the 13th Army, is an old hand at fighting. Without saying a word, he first completed the disposition of "being invincible." As expected, in May, the Communist army gathered 17 brigades with a total of 100,000 troops and launched the "May Offensive," attempting to cut off the long array section by section and then eat them all up. Horrifying rumors spread among the people, and people in various cities panicked. After twenty days of fighting, the Communist army successively occupied Gushan, Beipiao, Chaoyang, Yebaishou, and Lingyuan. All communication and traffic were completely destroyed. The 13th Army exerted its power at various key points, and the Communist army's offensive was frustrated. In the seven-day battle of Gushan and the three-day battle of Beipiao, the price paid by the Communist army was its own heavy casualties. The people's panic was eliminated, and they believed in the national army. The news of these fierce battles has always been closed off. The officers and soldiers of the 13th Army did not complain. They had the spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake of anonymity, and the brilliant results in the suppression of the internal rebellion were not enough to boast about. After this lesson, the Rehe Communist army lowered its head to the 13th Army. It is said in the Communist army: "I would rather fight the ×× army once than fight the 13th Army once." This is the honest truth after being taught a lesson. The strength of combat power can only be judged fairly by the enemy. The Communist army broke the ceasefire agreement and besieged Datong. The national army launched a counterattack, and the Rehe side quickly recovered Chengde, Longhua, Pingquan, and Weichang, and then recovered Weichang, Duolun, and Gu Yuan in one fell swoop. The Communist army suffered heavy losses and fled in panic. The 13th Army must be solid in defense and victorious in attack, but it is not arrogant and condescending to the enemy. Their key to combat is: "Fight a rat like you would fight a tiger." Be steady, strike hard, pursue fiercely, and maintain a rigorous style.

The 13th Army is the main force in the recovery of Rehe. Their clothing is simple, their spirit is extremely full, and most of them are brothers from Henan. The entire army is full of a simple and honest atmosphere, and they are one with the people. The people love and support the loyal and brave army, helping them repair roads and letting them live in their houses. They do not want a single piece of paper or wood from the people, and there is no gap between the army and the people.

With this strong army stationed on the front line of national defense, the rear of the Northeast can be stabilized and the heart of North China can be secured.

In March of last year, an American B-29 Superfortress crashed on a peak of more than 14,000 feet in western Kang Province, and the pilot's life and death were unknown. The picture shows the Xichang Village where the rescuers spent the night on the way up the mountain to search. (Together with )

### Autumn Acts Like Spring in Wuxi and Changzhou

— ·From Gao Wu Hong, Wuxi, 11th Day·

The days of "Autumn's End in Jiangnan" are fast approaching. As the "autumn" wave is about to depart, the reporter wishes to write a piece of communication that won't become outdated. However, it must be stated that this article combines Wuxi and Wujin, and does not write about them separately, to save space.

First, an anecdote: A month ago, the "sudden bloom of Lei flowers" in Qingyuan Park caused a small stir in Wujin city. In the past few days, on an open space behind the Wang clan ancestral hall in Wangjia Village, Henan, Xiahe Town, Third District, an apricot tree suddenly blossomed again, full of silvery-white flowers, emitting a burst of fragrance. The flowering of an apricot tree in autumn is considered a strange thing by everyone. The reporter once drove to observe it, but unfortunately did not bring a camera, and could not photograph the flowering situation, which is a real pity. The reporter heard the old painter Qian Xiaoan say: "The sudden bloom of Lei flowers and the autumn flowering of apricot blossoms are not good omens. The country has been in chaos for a long time, and it seems that the people still have difficulties ahead!" Hearing this in the sound of autumn wind and falling leaves makes people feel uneasy.

The Taihu Lake area has long been a place where bandits haunt, and the people suffer from banditry. The government authorities have repeatedly shown leniency, giving these criminals a new chance. However, those lawless desperados continue their mischief. The Jinghu Garrison Headquarters specially established a Wuxi Command Post and commanders of various suppression zones to first persuade and appease. If appeasement fails, they will be suppressed. After capture, they will be immediately interrogated and executed by military law. How can small-time bandits like Xiao Wei hope to contend with a mighty righteous army? The notorious bandit Li Defu, with new-style weapons, who roams across the borders of Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, and Qingpu counties, along with his henchmen Hou Mingqing and Luo Ying, were finally captured by the authorities during an encirclement because they refused to surrender, and were executed on the 16th in Suzhou at the Wang Shutun execution ground.

The internal ranks of the Communist army are also gradually wavering and disintegrating. Most middle and lower-level cadres with clear minds have realized that they were temporarily incited by ideology and became criminals of the country and the nation, serving as tools for the struggle of a few. Therefore, whenever they have the opportunity, they surrender one after another. Wu Sijian, the Communist Party commissar of Wujin, has surrendered to the authorities. Chen Xueliang, the "county head" of the Communist side in eastern Wuxi, has contacted Xu Yuanruo, the county head of Wuxi, and County Head Xu has given Chen a deadline of the 22nd to "surrender." For the few die-hard bandits, a full-scale military suppression will be carried out, with the aim of eradicating the bandit scourge in a short period of time and thoroughly pacifying the Third District, without any leniency.

Recently, Liang Hong, a native of Nantong who started as an apprentice and was the special commissioner of the Second District Committee of the CCP Central China Bureau in Xicheng, witnessed the Communist Party's plot to undermine peace and deceive young people. Moved by the Chairman's benevolence and the government's magnanimity, he led more than ten subordinates, including Zhu Dachuan and Luo Ye (female), to surrender and reform to the Wuxi Command Post, and issued a declaration of secession from the party, recounting the crimes of the Communist Party, and urging young people deceived by ideology to wake up as soon as possible. Attached to the declaration was the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party's instructions on work in Jiangnan, several thousand words long. Sections one and two distort and propagate the Chairman and the current situation. The following instructs the overall task of the Communist army and guerrillas in Jiangnan and southern Anhui, which is to mobilize the broad masses and actively launch mass guerrilla warfare. The war is divided into two types: (1) Assemble relatively strong main forces to conduct large-scale guerrilla warfare on the borders of Jiangnan and southern Anhui; if necessary, develop towards western Zhejiang, and at the same time establish larger, better, or smaller, more solid base areas. (2) In areas such as Taihu Lake and Maoshan, launch dispersed guerrilla groups, and in addition, in the vast Jiangxi area—areas where armed struggle cannot be launched—carry out mass work, develop the party's secret work, and boldly launch various forms of mass struggle.

From this incident, we can see the Communist army's ruthless means of disrupting the local area and undermining peace; at the same time, we can see how the middle and lower-level cadres of the CCP are wavering and uneasy within the party. The fate of the CCP is like the withered yellow leaves on a parasol tree. A gust of wind, a shower of rain, will scatter them all!

### The Battle for Senatorial Seats

The election of Wuxi County senators will be implemented in the short term, and the number of seats has been allocated by the county government, but all parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the allocated numbers, and a fierce debate has been unfolding in the past few days. The free professional group was only allocated one seat. The journalists, lawyers, doctors, and other units to which the industry belongs all believe that it is unfair and have asked the county government to consider increasing the number.

The most heated dispute is between the County Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union. When the County Chamber of Commerce held its 18th meeting of directors and supervisors, when discussing the allocation of senatorial seats, it believed that: "All taxes and levies are mainly borne by industry and commerce, and the nature of regions and groups are different. Now, in a democratic era, the establishment of public opinion institutions is intended to seek reasonable representation from all regions and professions. If the number of seats for the elected is not evenly distributed, the Chamber of Commerce will have to give up participating in the election." The opinion at the meeting was unanimous, and they were willing to give up participating.

The General Labor Union believes that the number of seats designated by the county government for the labor union is only based on the membership of 26,000 when the union was established. Currently, the total number of union members has exceeded 40,000. According to the provisions of the latter part of Article 10 of the election regulations: "The number of senatorial seats shall be allocated in proportion to the number of members." Therefore, the number of senatorial seats that should be obtained should be increased. They insist that the county government handle the matter in accordance with Article 10 of the election regulations promulgated by the government, otherwise they will not participate. The Farmers' Association, which was allocated twelve seats, also felt it was too few, and actually held a meeting of directors and supervisors, creating a "rush" situation. The reason is: "The number of farmers in this county accounts for an absolute majority. The county government plans to have a total of 43 professional representative seats in this session of senators, and our association has only obtained twelve, accounting for less than one-third. We should ask the county to increase the number of seats to be reasonable."

The battle for senatorial seats has reached its extreme excitement in the past few days. A few days ago, someone sent a letter to the county government for reference, based on the Shanghai Municipal Senatorial Election Seat Allocation Method (which uses the number of township farmers' associations, industrial or professional trade unions, and trade guilds as the standard for allocating seats). However, the county government believes that this method is not explicitly provided for by law and is inconvenient to decide, and has reported the situation to the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions on how to handle it. However, the public is not concerned about the "dragon and tiger fight" of the farmers', workers', and merchants' associations, as if the election of senators has nothing to do with them.

### The Sound of Biao Hui Fills the Ears

Due to the general economic downturn in society and the difficulty of life, the trend of "biao hui" (rotating credit associations) has recently become popular again in Wujin. Tea houses and restaurants are filled with the sound of "biao hui." Almost everyone is involved with "biao hui." The method of "biao hui" may be known to very few people. The reporter only recently understood it, so I will talk about it here: First, an individual initiates it (the "hui tou" or leader), inviting acquaintances, relatives, and friends to form a "hui." The number of people is not fixed, but usually at least ten. The "hui tou" sets a number, such as 100,000 yuan for the first round, so the "hui tou" can receive 900,000 yuan at once. From the second round onwards, a bidding method is used. Except for the "hui tou," who pays out a fixed 100,000 yuan each time, the remaining nine people write the amount they want to receive on a piece of paper, such as 500,000, 600,000, or 700,000 yuan. After collecting them, the bid is opened, and the person with the smallest amount wins the "biao." The "hui" money of the winner is publicly raised by those who have not won. The later the "biao" is won, the larger the "hui" money. The most cost-effective is, of course, the "hui tou," who receives a lump sum and pays it out in installments, without adding a single penny of interest. Therefore, everyone wants to be the "hui tou" and take advantage of it. So you "biao hui," I "biao hui," making a chaotic and unsettling mess. Some people even regard "biao hui" as a "way to make money" and are busy with "biao hui" every day.

"Biao hui" is also a form of disguised usury that exploits ordinary people. Some people want to do business but don't have capital, so they ask relatives and friends for help and "biao" for a "hui." However, with the popularity of "biao hui," the phenomenon of "running away with the hui" is also prevalent. Some people win the "biao" and then run away. Such disputes occur several times every day. The social atmosphere is shifting from stagnation to decadence, which deserves the attention of the authorities.

### Scenes of Hefei

— From Dou Baiping, Hefei, 10th Day

The reporter had an opportunity to travel from Chaoxian County to Hefei City. For the convenience of transportation, I decided to go via Hefei and take in the sights of this temporary provincial capital of Anhui.

There are now water and land routes between Chaoxian and Hefei. Small boats go west through Chaohu Lake and enter Xikou to reach Hefei. For the land route, one can take a car along the Huainan Railway (when the Huainan Railway will be open to traffic is still unknown).

### Political Progress in the Provincial Capital

Hefei is a place the reporter has visited before. This ancient city, which has endured eight years of hardship, was a historically famous place in the past, and now it is also the political center of Anhui. After the victory last August, the capital of Anhui Province was moved from Lihuang in western Anhui. There was a fierce debate in Anhui about whether to set the capital in Hefei or return it to Anqing. Some people believed that Hefei was located in the center of Anhui Province, and the city was large, so the capital should be located here. Others believed that Hefei did not meet the conditions for being a provincial capital in terms of location, and that construction was beyond the financial capabilities of the province and local authorities, so it should be returned to Anqing as soon as possible. So this issue was submitted to the Provincial Assembly for discussion. The result was that it was decided to return to Anqing, but the relocation would be carried out when the provincial government's finances allowed. This means that in principle, it will be moved back to Anqing, but the timing is flexible.

Although the provincial government has been in Hefei for a year now, the market has not prospered. On the contrary, it appears desolate and lonely. The power plant has not yet been restored, and the alleys are so dark at night that it is daunting. The shops are not as prosperous as before the war. There is only one road in the city, which runs from the provincial government to Xiaodongmen. The rest of the streets, except for the commercial area around Gulou, which is paved with flat stones, are uneven and bumpy, making walking a real chore!

Since Chairman launched the "Reform Movement" this spring, it is said that there has been some progress in politics compared to the past, but this point is only true in the provincial capital. In the countryside of the outer counties, as far as the reporter knows, the effect is still minimal. This shows that lower-level cadres cannot take responsibility for the upper levels. For example, in the "Reform Movement," corruption is listed as a prohibited item. However, corruption in Anhui is probably no less than in other provinces. Among the county heads, many have fallen from office after being reported for corruption. Township chiefs in the countryside can strut around and arbitrarily collect taxes, and farmers dare to be angry but dare not speak out. This is the reality of the past and present.

Civil servants in various departments and offices in the provincial capital, on the other hand, have a frugal style. Most of them wear gray cloth uniforms and carry symbols issued by the institutions. Their faces show the pressure of life. If a mid-level civil servant has a family of four, then an income of 130,000 to 140,000 yuan is not enough to cover the expenses of food, clothing, and housing. Now the prices here are rising with the wind. Rice in Hefei has risen to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and pork and cloth are rising even more wildly. I don't know to what extent they will rise!

### Watching helplessly as they fall into debt

Hefei currently has one provincial male and one provincial female high school, and one county high school. Most of the students come from nearby counties. In addition to tuition and miscellaneous fees, students pay for food entirely in kind. The total cost for a middle school student to enroll is 130,000 to 140,000 yuan, and at least 200,000 yuan per semester. Raising this point, there is a serious problem in the countryside, which is related to the education of the entire country.

After nine years of the War of Resistance, the knowledge level of our farmers has improved. They know that cultivating their children to study is necessary. Although the countryside is now in a state of bankruptcy, the children of farmers going to school, according to the reporter's estimate in several villages, is much more than before the war. In this situation, the problem comes. It is a well-known fact that the only income of the countryside is agricultural products, mainly rice, and the only source of tuition fees for children is this. When the school started this year, new grain was 10,000 yuan per dan. If a student needs 150,000 yuan to enroll, they have to sell fifteen dan of new grain. If a family of four receives a hundred dan of grain (in fact, there are too many people in ordinary villages who receive a hundred dan of grain), it is difficult to support themselves with the money needed for donations, food, pocket money, and even birth, old age, illness, death, and marriage. Adding the expenses of a middle school student for the whole year, they have to borrow money. And today, high interest rates are seizing the economy of farmers. In order to cope with the emergency, knowing that they are falling into debt, they have no choice but to keep moving downhill. This year, some farmers have already sold their grain cheaply for their children's tuition fees. Now that grain prices are rising, it is already too late, and now everything is rising, which only increases their burden of life. In this situation, farmers have the foolish desire to see their children become dragons, but in reality, they are limiting them from having this thought.

This is a problem that deserves attention. In the past, there were few literate people in the countryside, forming countless illiterates in China. Now farmers are consciously and actively eliminating illiteracy, but the burden of life is suppressing them. Is there no way for our country to eliminate illiteracy? We are an agricultural country. In the past, the foundation of the War of Resistance was in the countryside, and in the future, the foundation of national construction will naturally be in the countryside. Is there any problem more important than this?

During the war, civil servants were already complaining that they could not afford their children's tuition fees. Now, the reporter has seen with his own eyes that farmers are selling next year's food in advance for their children's tuition fees. Their children have entered school for now, but after this winter, they will have less to eat. How can they talk about studying then? This situation is truly chilling!

### With Science, There is Technology

— Zhao Zengjue

In 1943, the author published an article in Chongqing entitled "From Technology to Science," explaining that the progress of the nation requires not only studying technology but also paying attention to basic scientific research. Now, I further elaborate on the importance of basic science in the atomic age to awaken the attention of the people.

The highest purpose of our research in science is not so much for "application" as it is for "seeking truth." The most important contribution of scientists lies in developing and promoting the human spirit of "seeking knowledge" and "pursuing truth." The so-called life of a scientist is "beginning with seeking truth and ending with seeking truth." The mind of a scientist is a rational mind. Why do I say this? Scientists must have six major principles to carry out their work before they can complete their task. Now, I will try to explain them: (1) Must be able to distinguish right from wrong, be able to observe precisely, love novelty but must pay attention to proof. (2) Be able to understand the results of observations, apply strict logic and controlled imagination to analyze clearly, synthesize systematically; and use experience to derive theories, and use reason to interpret experience. (3) Must continue to repeatedly consider theories and experiments; draw hypotheses from experiments, and then create experiments from hypotheses to seek proof, and combine thought and action. (4) Must adjust one's conclusions and concepts about scientific research at appropriate times, and revise the created theories at any time, because scientific theories progress from rough to refined, from refined to subtle, and should be revised at any time. (5) Need freedom of research, freedom of thought, and freedom of discussion. (6) Need to collect examples from various sources, and humbly refer to the results obtained by predecessors or peers, because science has no national boundaries, and no personal limits. It is the common achievement or harvest of human efforts to seek knowledge. The above six major principles should be strictly followed and carefully used in the study of any science.

The study of natural science has two major goals: (A) Investigating things to acquire knowledge, and (B) Utilizing things to enrich life. The former is to satisfy the desire for "knowledge" and to enlighten the mystery of the universe. It is the driving force for human beings to seek "truth," and it is absolutely devoid of economic meaning and transcendent, as mentioned above. The latter is to use the knowledge gained from scientific research to exert the effectiveness of matter, which has economic significance. Due to the different nature of the above two major goals, the tasks achieved are also different. Therefore, the direction of modern scientists' efforts can be divided into three major categories: (1) Pure science, (2) Applied science, and (3) Technology. "Pure science" is not entirely for material benefits, but to study "nature" from the standpoint of seeking "knowledge"; this is basic science. Its method focuses on objective observation or experimentation, and seeks understanding from the results of observation or experimentation. This understanding creates a "hypothesis"; this "hypothesis" may be temporary, but it is enough to represent people's understanding of natural phenomena at a certain period. "Applied science" can use the same methods to obtain the same knowledge, but its pursuit of knowledge is for "utilizing things to enrich life." Pure science and applied science are completely the same in some aspects, and the talents engaged in research also need the same basic training, but the final goals are completely different. Pure science seeks to make mankind "better understand the universe" and "closer to the truth," while applied science strives to "control nature" to achieve mankind's "material enjoyment." As for "technology," it can be said to be the practical application of the results or knowledge of pure science and applied science to complete a practical economic method to utilize the "material world." Therefore, scientific research is to acquire and organize knowledge, and technological research is only to use this knowledge to achieve purposes other than science.

### Basic Science is the Source of Technology

Pure science (also known as basic science) is the basis of applied science, and applied science is the basis of technology. Knowing only to develop technology and applied science, but not paying attention to the basic research of pure science, is like only hoping for the flowering and fruiting of trees, but not cultivating the roots of trees. This will eventually lead to a day when flowers stop blooming and fruits will not bear! In World War II, the two most important inventions were "radar" and "atomic bombs." But if there were no "electromagnetic theory" of Maxwell, the saint of electrical science, which opened up optics and electromagnetics, recognizing the relationship between light waves and electromagnetic waves, and establishing the basic principles of electromagnetism, how could "radar" have been invented in World War II? If there were no efforts to study the pure science of "atomic structure" by Professor Bohr and his companions and students, and the basic scientific work of other physicists in breaking atoms with particles, discovering mesons, and using neutrons to enter the nucleus, how could the "atomic bomb" have been created in the war? Therefore, the Nobel Prize in Science in 1945 was awarded to Professor Bohr, which was indeed a well-deserved judgment. And the opening of the second battlefield in Europe had to be attributed to the progress of meteorology. In other words, the completion of "radar" and "atomic bombs" was at least the accumulation of more than half a century of human research in basic science, and then these two benefits were obtained in World War II. And fortunately, these two benefits fell into the hands of the United Nations, saving the "freedom" and "equality" of all mankind in the world. We cannot but admire the greatness of science, and we cannot but recognize the importance of studying pure science, and the mission and value of scientists in serving mankind. If in the next half century we do not strive to research pure science and accumulate this basic knowledge for use when needed, then applied science will inevitably remain at its current state and not advance. If applied science stagnates and does not advance, then we will not be able to make any progress in manufacturing cars, airplanes, ships, radios, and all kinds of manufacturing technologies and engineering technologies. Common people think that it is important to research and manufacture technologies such as cars and airplanes, but they do not know that it is even more important to research basic science! Especially in our country now, pure scientists are hardly valued by the people, which is truly a great crisis for the nation! Only the loud calls of scientists and those engaged in scientific work can awaken the attention of the people and the support of the government and society. Otherwise, our country will not only be a backward country in the atomic age, but will also forever become a country that is backward in science and technology!

### Using National Goods is Most Glorious

— Editor

"Using national goods is most glorious" is the slogan formulated by the movement to promote the use of national goods. The originator of the movement was Mr. Hu Boxiang. At that time, this slogan was formulated after repeated consideration, because it had to conform to the principles of psychology and be practical, without any exaggeration.

Over the past few months, thanks to the efforts of all parties, "using national goods is most glorious" has become a well-known slogan to the general public. Because of the frequent mention of this slogan, it can be translated into action, and as a result, the sale of national goods can become more widespread.

For any movement, grasping the psychology of the masses can be said to be a core element. "Using national goods is most glorious" has already produced a beautiful flower in just a few months. We hope that in the near future, we can get abundant fruits.

### On the Efficiency of Textile Factories

— Deng Shaoqiu

This article is an excerpt from the British Textile Industry Research Association's quarterly publication, "Improving the Efficiency of Textile Factories," by Hurdle. The full text is 50,000 words long. This is a concise translation to provide reference for research and those engaged in the textile industry.

(1) Machine Speed

In the textile industry, the speed, strength, and weakness of textile machinery are interrelated with the quantity of production and the efficiency of work. Low speed results in low output; in other words, work efficiency is also weak. However, the speed of machinery also has a certain limit. Too high a speed will reduce work efficiency instead. The speed of textile machinery must be determined by the size, quality, and grade of the fabric, the thickness of the yarn, and the size and number of shuttles. For ordinary plain weave looms around 40 inches wide, a speed of 180 to 200 (RPM) is most suitable. Therefore, the first step to increase work efficiency is to first ensure sufficient tension of the warp and adjust the speed of the machine.

(2) Sizing Process

In addition to the speed of the machinery, the sizing process is also extremely important. Whether the sizing process results in a good outcome is enough to affect the appearance and aesthetics of the finished textile, as well as the quantity of production and the amount of damaged cloth and waste yarn. The purpose of the sizing process is (1) to increase the strength and smoothness of the yarn, and (2) to increase the weight of the yarn to facilitate weaving. To achieve a good sizing process, one must pay attention to every detail, regardless of the difficulty of the various tasks. If the formulation of the sizing material is inappropriate or the method of harmonization is improper, it will not only be unhelpful to the fabric but also harmful and will cause endless difficulties during weaving. Therefore, the second step to increase work efficiency is to strive for excellent sizing results and to be familiar with the properties of compatible sizing materials.

(3) Warping Process

If the warping process is poor due to negligence, the fabric will be difficult to last and will be brittle and easily damaged. The inclusion of waste yarn will cause the yarn tension to lose harmony and uniformity. Therefore, the third step to increase work efficiency is to strive for perfection in the warping process. Otherwise, even if the machine speed is suitable and the sizing process is excellent, most of the fabric will be lost due to the warping process. At this point, even if one exhausts all efforts, it will be in vain.

(4) Warp Tension

The quality of the warp directly affects the production quantity and quality of the fabric, and indirectly affects the cost of production. If the warp tension is poor and the elasticity is insufficient, the warp on the loom will be subjected to sudden tension from the heddles and friction from the reed, causing violent shocks. Therefore, the fourth step to increase work efficiency is to conduct precise inspections of the tension and twist of the original yarn. For example, when weaving coarse cloth, use warp yarn of around 18 (S).

(5) Other

If one wants to describe in detail how to increase the efficiency of a factory, in addition to the above, other aspects cannot be covered in this short article. Even a thick book of more than an inch would not be enough. Therefore, to improve work efficiency, other steps are briefly described below.

(6) Uniformity of Yarn, (7) Temperature Relationship, (8) Warp Moisture, (9) Worker Skills.

The uniformity of the yarn is related to the warp tension, and the temperature relationship is also related to the warp moisture. If the temperature is high, the warp will be dry; if it is low, the opposite will be true. Dry warp is prone to breakage, while wet warp will shrink after drying when the fabric is finished. Therefore, the most suitable temperature for a textile factory is 70-80 degrees Celsius. Moreover, too high or too low a temperature is also detrimental to the health of the workers. Finally, the skills of the workers are naturally greatly related to the output and work efficiency of the fabric. This is something that everyone knows.

Finally, if the warp tension is sufficient and the sizing process is satisfactory, and all nine of these matters are rectified, then increasing the efficiency of the textile industry is something I can guarantee and be confident about!

The "Radar," a new invention of World War II, has been modified into a home machine.

### Current Status of Paper Production in the United States

— Fei Wen

The paper shortage in the United States is expected to be resolved soon, thanks to the efforts to encourage the development of the pulp and paper industry in recent months.

Major production has increased, and all conditions are favorable for production. In 1946, the production volume for the first four months was 6,211,000 tons, with an annual rate of 18,630,000 tons. This exceeds the production volume of the same period in 1945 by 8.5%. The Domestic Commerce Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that the supply and demand relationship for paper in the domestic market may return to normal by the end of the year.

However, regardless of how high the current production level is, the demand for paper and paperboard still exceeds the supply. The situation in the Pacific Northwest was the worst last winter. Heavy snow prevented logging operations for paper factories. Droughts and fires followed one after another. Fortunately, the production of papermaking wood began to increase in May. The production of papermaking wood and pulp in the southern United States accounts for 40% of the national total. The climate was equally unsuitable for loggers there. Due to heavy rain and flooding, work began in March. When the weather is good, it is easier to find workers, and work improved in April.

The greatest progress is that even American elementary school students know to collect waste paper, which also contributes significantly to the paper economy. Wartime patriotic motivations have been replaced by equally valuable peacetime goals. The money from the sale of waste paper is mostly used for school equipment, wartime orphans, or pediatric hospital wards. The collection of waste paper is truly astonishing. In April, donations from newspaper offices and government agencies totaled 656,000 tons, accounting for more than one-third of the paper and paperboard production that month, with a total of 1,635,000 tons.

The increase in paper production is partly due to price increases. Recently, the price of a ton of paper increased by $6.80, and it is said that it will increase by another 10%. The printing industry is in a bad situation due to the coal and transportation workers' strikes, but it is still increasing compared to 1945. For four months, U.S. consumption was 274,000 tons, or 17%, higher than in 1945 due to foreign imports and domestic production. Thanks to good paper sources, books, printing, and paper are more refined and excellent than before. However, the production of newsprint decreased in both May and June. According to industry sources at the end of July, the production rate of paper and paperboard in the second half of this year will continue to rise to 2 million tons, but domestic demand exceeds 2 million tons. Paper factories under construction hope to start operations in 1947 to meet the five-year needs. It seems that some exports will not be possible until 1948.

Packaging and Transportation

Issue Seven of Production Organization

The packaging of goods must be appropriate, sufficiently strong, but not excessive. When designing packaging, we must consider the following points:

(1) Padding: When goods are placed in wooden boxes, there must be sufficient padding to provide adequate protection. When packaging goods, we must not only think about the current situation, because when the goods are being handled in the factory, people are very careful. But once they are on the road, they will undergo countless vibrations, so we must imagine the situation of the goods during transportation.

Many businesses abroad, because they ship a lot of goods every year, have specifically created a testing machine to test whether the packaging is strong. This testing machine is quite impressive. Its design is circular and can rotate. Inside, there are many uneven objects. Then, the packaged wooden box is placed inside, and the testing machine is started to rotate. After several rotations, if it is not damaged, then it can be said to be qualified. This method is indeed worth adopting.

(2) Size of Wooden Boxes: The size of wooden boxes must be in line with the economic considerations of transportation.

(3) Moisture Content of Wooden Boxes: If the wood of the wooden box is too dry, it will easily crack. If it is too wet, it will damage the goods. Therefore, the moisture content must be moderate.

According to experts' tests, it is said that if the moisture content of the wood is 15%, and it is tested immediately after nailing, the resistance is 100%. If the moisture content is 30%, then the resistance is only 90%. If the moisture content is only 5%, the resistance is only 50%. This shows that the most appropriate moisture content is 15%.

(4) Nail Issues: The length, size, and quantity of nails are all worthy of study, because they are closely related to the cost and sturdiness of the wooden box.

If a manufacturing plant ships a lot of goods and needs to use a lot of wooden boxes every year, then the packaging issue must be studied in detail, especially when the goods are sold in various places.

After the packaging issue is resolved, we must talk about the transportation issue. There are specialized transportation companies in various parts of China that handle transportation procedures. You can entrust them to handle the procedures on your behalf. They have established procedures and fees that you can follow.

But before resolving the transportation issue, you must first study the transportation routes. Should you use water transportation or land transportation? When deciding on the route and method, you should consider the following points:

(1) Which route is the most appropriate? (2) Which route is the cheapest? (3) Which route takes the least amount of time? Sometimes, if you have considerable sales in several places, it is better to ship the goods to one place first, and then distribute them from there (establish an office in that place, if the goods sell throughout the year, or it is more cost-effective to compare). This way, you can save more on transportation costs.

If the transportation affairs are complex, you can set up a special department to manage the transportation affairs. After the Commercial Press in Shanghai prints the books at the main factory, they need to be sent to various branch libraries. Therefore, they have established a distribution department to specifically be responsible for the distribution and transportation matters.

If the scale of a manufacturer is very large, then it can even recruit a group of transportation experts to organize a transportation company, to serve the factory on the one hand, and to accept external commissions on the other hand.

When discussing transportation, one thing cannot be ignored, and that is the issue of insurance. You must never calculate the insurance premium cheaply, otherwise, if an accident occurs, you will suffer a great loss.

### New Type of Industrial Glass

— Lin Han

Science is constantly inventing, industry is constantly developing, and industrial products are constantly progressing. Many products have become outdated and even lost their former status as a result. But glass is different. Its position in the manufacturing industry may be maintained for thousands of years and will not be shaken.

Although the emergence of plastics has replaced the position of glass in some applications, causing people to only see imitation glass and ignore real glass, strictly speaking, due to improvements in glass manufacturing, its applications are increasing day by day. The future position of glass will not be greatly damaged. The following are the newly manufactured, widely used new types of glass:

In this war, the most significant and greatest gain in glass research was the successful manufacture of glass fuel tanks for industrial and laboratory use. Previously, it was thought that glass was too brittle and not suitable for use as fuel tanks. Now this shortcoming has been overcome.

Recently, a new type of glass has been invented. This type of glass does not contain sand, and its main component is phosphorus pentoxide. It is not corroded by hydrofluoric acid, which is completely different from ordinary glass. In the past, hydrofluoric acid was transported in lead or wax containers, and in laboratories, platinum or gold utensils were used to prevent chemical reactions. Now, it can be transported in new glass containers, which is much more convenient.

Gage glass is a special type of glass that has been developed over decades of research. It is not only very useful in wartime but also has a great impact on industrial progress in peacetime. Because glass gages are used to calibrate the horizontal lines of boilers that use steam power to generate light and heat in trains, ships, and other machinery. In the chemical industry, it is especially used in the oil refining industry to indicate the liquid level in pressure pipes and storage tanks.

Glass fiber. This type of glass was discovered before the 20th century. Now, it is appearing in new forms and with new names. It was previously called glass wool. It is a very fine fibrous glass that looks a bit like silk. A single fiber of this kind cannot be seen with the naked eye, because it is thinner than hair. It is commonly used to replace kapok as an insulator for cold, heat, electricity, sound, pests, and vibration, and for other wide industrial applications such as: winding underground oil pipes, gas pipes, and other metal pipes to prevent rust and electrolysis. Wrapped around pipes coated with tar or coal tar, it is durable and will bind even tighter after encountering water. When used on wires, it provides excellent insulation for motors, generators, transformers, etc. When manufacturing aviation gasoline (100 octane), glass fiber is also used as a filler in distillation towers.

### Life is Happiness

Life is indeed a very unhappy affair, but it is not difficult to make it very happy. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to win the first prize in a lottery, get two hundred thousand pieces of cloth, or win the White Eagle Medal, or marry a beautiful wife, because these blessings are temporary and easily lead to a habit of coveting the excessive. If you want to feel the joy of life forever, even in times of sorrow, then the following two points are essential:

(1) You should always be satisfied with your current situation.

(2) When you encounter unpleasant things, take a step back and think.

If the matches in your pocket suddenly disappear, you should thank Heaven for not using your pocket as a gunpowder magazine. This will make you happy.

If an uninvited relative comes to you while you are taking a vacation in the countryside, don't be so angry that your face turns blue. You should be very happy to say: "How fortunate! It's not a policeman!" This will make you happy.

If a splinter pierces your finger, you should think like this: Fortunately, it didn't pierce your eye. This will make you happy.

If your wife or sister-in-law or sister-in-law is playing scales on the piano in a mess, don't lose your temper. You should pretend in your heart that you are appreciating music and not listening to a concert of jackals or cats. This will make you happy.

You should often think like this: you are not a horse pulling a cart, nor a rod-shaped bacterium, nor a trichina, nor a pig, nor a bear led by a gypsy, nor a louse. This will make you happy.

You should often think like this: you are not a prisoner standing in the dock, you are not dealing with your creditors; you do not have to discuss the issue of royalties with that editor, Mr. Tuba. This will make you happy.

If you live in a place that is not as far away as Siberia, shouldn't you think like this: given a small chance, you might be exiled there? Thinking this way, you will be happy.

If one of your teeth hurts, you should think like this: Fortunately, it's not all your teeth that hurt. This will make you happy too.

You should comfort yourself: I'm fortunate that I can't afford to read the "Daily Citizen"; I'm fortunate that I don't have to drive a garbage truck; I'm fortunate that I don't have to marry three women at the same time.

If you are sent to a police station cell, you should jump in happily, thinking like this: Fortunately, you were not pushed into a blazing hell.

If you are beaten with a birch stick, you should jump around with joy, shouting, "How lucky, I wasn't whipped with a thorn whip."

If your wife is unfaithful to you, think like this: She has only betrayed you personally, not your country. Thinking this way, you will be happy too.

This is a humorous essay written by Chekhov at the age of twenty-five, which was published in the 17th issue of the humorous magazine Oskolki. It is missing from Chekhov's complete works. It is now translated from the 941st volume of the Selected Works of Chekhov in the Wanrenye Book. There are no notes for editor Mr. Tuba and the Daily Citizen. The translator has no books at hand to check, so I have to leave it in doubt. —Translator's Note

### Autumn Window Notes

— Hu Yingdong

The open space in front of the dormitory looks very desolate. Piles of withered grass and fallen leaves are being lit with fire by several wild children, making crackling sounds as they burn. Red flames and black smoke rise upwards, gradually turning into circles of smoke rings, skimming over the rooftops and disappearing into the sky. The season for burning wild fires is approaching. From here, I recall the days of living in Mist City. Every day, there was crimson fire, crawling like a snake across the plains and mountains. Now, the wild fire is burning all over the valley, and the soul of autumn is smiling. I use silence to praise the wild fire in my imagination, when I read the poets using truthful voices and emotions to sing the soul of spring to life.

Often, I stand on the corridors on both sides of the dormitory, looking at the distant scenery: that cloud mountain, that magnificent sea and colorful waterfalls washed by the setting sun, and the bald top of the church, the paulownia trees with fallen hair. All of this contains infinite tranquility. The appearance of nature is changeable, and autumn is an even more mature season, just like the graceful demeanor of a middle-aged woman. She hides the mystery of the season of time.

Dragging my heavy steps, I walk out of the residence along this small path paved with yellow sand, to take a walk in the fields outside, to hunt for some autumn flavor. Every day after dinner, I always make such plans with a belly full of contradictions, although I know that the feelings of the aging autumn will never bring me a trace of vitality.

The fields after the harvest are lying with lonely soil with grass roots. The soils seem to be sighing their fate. Their annual cultivation only reaps today's desolation. A few black, unknown birds fly over, peck at the field, and suddenly flap their wings and fly away with a rustling sound.

Everything contains mystery, everything is indifferent. I stare blankly at this desolate world in a daze. The harvested land everywhere exposes a year of scars and hardships. Counting the lonely heart, I silently walk towards home.

Under the white, translucent window lattice, let the light in the house shine on the window. The house is quiet, without a sound. Walking from the corridor into the house, and from the house to the corridor, the violin in the opposite dormitory plays out a tortuous love story, which makes me even more confused.

Dusk, a pale smile spreads outdoors. There is no moonlit night, but there is such dim light.

The shadows of the trees in front of the window dance in waves, reflecting on the milky white window bars. Black shadows are jumping, the light of the lamp, and the chaotic mood, accompany this deep autumn night, weaving into a pale yellow picture. The scene at this time makes me unable to forget the four difficult days I have endured, and makes me even more afraid to see the dancing phantoms in this real world...

The shadows of people remain, the table lamp shines with a peaceful light, and in the twilight, I hear intermittent cockcrowing.

### Bai Jiao Writes Orchids

— Jian Qi

"Ming Dynasty people are most skilled at sketching in ink wash flower and bird paintings, but they are often concerned more with the idea than with the form in orchid paintings. It was not until Luo Yufeng painted orchids that the attention was paid to sketching and his paintings have become a good example. However, his paintings sometimes lack a sense of rhythm. Li Qingjiang's paintings have uninhibited strokes with a declining scenery and lack of spirit. This is not what we are talking about in the pursuit of capturing the spirit."

Someone asked about the way of orchids, and Yunjian said, "Flowers are easy, leaves are difficult; brushes are easy, ink is difficult; momentum is easy, time is difficult; form is easy, rhyme is difficult; momentum is achieved through speed without haste, brushwork is obtained, time is achieved through moisture without wetness, inking is obtained, form is achieved through unstudied restraint and natural posture, and a complete spirit is obtained."

"The quality of orchids values even shoulders. The paintings take a side view, just like in writing, avoiding a flat and straightforward narration. The orchid flowers are all painted with pointed petals, which also shows a lack of understanding of the valuable qualities in orchids."

Someone asked how to tend orchids well. Yunjian said, "First, don't ask about what is good." He said, "If one is already able, from whom should one learn from the past sages?" He said, "Who did the ancients learn from?" He said, "How does one achieve spirit?" He said, "Do nothing."

"When holding the brush high, the palm is empty and the fingers are flexible, the brush has lightness and heaviness, and the force is even." Someone asked Yunwen about the technique of writing orchids, and he told him this.

Sequel to The Plum in the Golden Vase

The author of "Sequel to The Plum in the Golden Vase," Ding Yaokang, styled Xisheng, sobriquet Yehe [Wild Crane], was a native of Zhucheng, Shandong, a tribute student who served as a teaching inspector in Rongcheng during the Shunzhi reign. He was later appointed magistrate of Huian but declined the position. Lu Xun's "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" states his dates of birth and death as "approximately 1620-1691." Zheng Jing's "Abstracts of Ten Rare and Fine Legends" (Yenching Journal of Sinological Studies, No. 24) quotes Ding's postscript in a Zhengde edition of "Collected Works of Li and Du," saying, "In the year Gui Si of the Shunzhi reign, I lived outside in a seaside village and borrowed it to read. In the year Jia Wu, I went to the Rongcheng teaching office, carrying it as a companion on my travels… Moved by this, I wrote this. Written by Ding Yaokang of Langya at the Pepper Pavilion of the guest quarters, at the age of fifty-six." According to this, Jia Wu was the eleventh year of the Shunzhi reign. If he was fifty-six years old then, he was born in the year Ji Hai of the twenty-seventh year of the Wanli reign. The "Zhucheng County Gazetteer" of the Qianlong reign, Volume 36, states that he "died at the age of seventy-two," which should be the year Geng Xu of the ninth year of the Kangxi reign. Therefore, his dates of birth and death should be 1599-1670.

"Excerpts of Old News on Novels" once recorded six historical materials related to Ding. "Historical Materials on Chinese Novels" added another one from "Idle Talks at Chibei." Several items remain uncollected in the two books. Wang Shizhen's "Miscellaneous Records from the Ancient Tianyuting Pavilion," Volume 5, states:

"Ding Yaokang of Zhucheng, sobriquet Yehe, was friends with Qiu Shichang, sobriquet Haishi, but they were temperamentally incompatible. One day, while drinking in the Tie Gou Garden (Tie Gou Xing from Dongpo's collection is located there), they disagreed on a literary point. Qiu drew a sword from the wall, intending to harm Ding. Ding immediately mounted a horse and fled. Ding wrote 'Tianshi'; his poems contain many remarkable lines, such as the old general saying: 'Lowering his head, he pities the warhorse; the setting sun is on the great river in the east.' The old horse says: 'The west wind brushes past both ears; one last look at the setting sun.' These examples are all striking. In his later years, Qiu became an instructor in Xiajin. Passing by Liangshan Marsh, he wrote a poem saying: 'The tale of Shi and Luo is timeless; Zhuo's title is even more lamentable. Today, Liangshan is but so; Heaven and earth will gradually lose their wonder.' Ding was appointed magistrate of Huian, and Qiu was appointed magistrate of Gaoyao, but neither accepted the positions." Ruan Kui-sheng's "Casual Talks After Tea," Volume 8 (Wang's version, commonly found in Volume 7), states:

"Qiu Haishi and Ding Yehe were both poets from Shanxi. Ruan Ting's poems of remembrance mention 'Poet Ding Yehe of the Nine Immortals' and 'Qiu Lingju, of equal fame, every day.' The two gentlemen were close friends since youth. One day, they drank together in the Tie Gou Garden, and they disagreed on a literary point, engaging in insults and abuse. Qiu drew a sword from the wall and chased Ding. Ding escaped, mounted a horse, and fled. Qiu could not catch up and returned. The people of Dong regarded it as a fine story." Zha Weiren's "Lotus Slope Poetry Talks," Volume 1 (Dragon Prestige Secret Book edition), also contains an account, the first half of which is the same as Wang Zhuo's "New Sayings of Our Time," Volume 6, and the second half of which is the same as "Idle Talks at Chibei," Volume 12, and is therefore not recorded here.

Ding's writings listed in the "Zhucheng County Gazetteer," Volume 13, number eleven. There is also "Chronicle of Escaping Calamities," one volume, found in Ding Shouchun's postscript to "Record of Loyalty Displayed." Of the eleven titles, all but "Tianshi" survive. The Peking Library also possesses "Essentials of Family Governance," one volume, and "Manuscripts of Mr. Ding Yehe," three volumes. Ding Shenxing's "Re-engraved Account of the Beginning and End of the West Lake Fan" also records the poetry collection "Qiyuan Grass" and the legend "Feifei Dream," "Xinghan Cha," two titles.

"Sequel to The Plum in the Golden Vase" is listed in the "Catalogue of Chinese Novels" as having two types: an old nine-line edition and a ten-line edition published by a publishing house. The eight-volume, fifty-four chapter old manuscript edition in the collection of Yanyan Zhai is suspected to be an abridged version. The Shanghai Qingyun Publishing Company printed an edition in 1933 that did not divide chapters, totaling sixty chapters, omitting four chapters from the original book, with some textual abridgements, similar to their printed "Ancient Version (?) of The Plum in the Golden Vase."

The Post Story of the Water Margin

Lu Xinyuan's carved "Huzhou Book" contains Yang Fengbao's "Qiushi Collection," Volume 1, "Afterword to the Lost Collection of the Nanshan Poetry Hall," which states:

"After the Ming Dynasty collapsed, scholars, worn out and unemployed, gathered to form poetry societies, expressing their feelings for the former nation and ruler. South of the Yangtze River, there was no place without them. The most prosperous were: in Dongyue, the area around Ningbo; in the Sanwu region, Songling. … Songling was the hub of boats and carriages in the southeast, attracting talented and heroic gentlemen from all directions, even more so than in Yuezhong, and the Jingyin Poetry Society was the crown of the Wu societies. Ye Hengzou of Fenhu was the leader of the society. … Now, examining the famous figures who joined the society, as seen in Hengzou's 'Nanshan Hall Collection,' we can outline the following: from Shaoshang, Fan Meiyin (Feng Ren), Shen Xueqiao (Zu Xiao), Jin Wancheng, Chen Yanyan (Chen) [listing forty-five people, omitted], dating its beginning to Geng Yin and ending in Jia Chen. … Hengzou's name was Jiwu, sobriquet Wudai Shanren. The collection consists of four volumes." While focusing on Ye's "Nanshan Hall Collection," it also touches upon Chen Chen, the author of "The Post Story of the Water Margin." Shen Tong's "Zhenze County Gazetteer" essentially summarizes this text. Shen's entry notes that Zhen's "Nanxun Town Gazetteer" 36 (Miscellaneous Records 4) quotes it. Hu Shi's "Preface to Two Sequels to the Water Margin," "Historical Materials on Chinese Novels," then records it from the "Nanxun Town Gazetteer." Geng Yin was the seventh year of the Qing Shunzhi reign, and Jia Chen was the third year of the Kangxi reign, which is the datable start and end of this Jingyin Poetry Society (Shen's text lacks the year of termination). As for the so-called "Later, the historical case implicated the society, and some members were punished by law, leading to the society's dissolution" (Zhenze County Gazetteer), it likely refers to Pan, Wu, and Jiang Linzheng in the Zhuang Tinglong "History of Ming" case.

Wang Yizhen's "Nanxun Town Gazetteer" contains two additional items that have not been adopted by "Historical Materials." One appears in Volume 29 (Writings 1):

"Chen Chen (Biographies): 'Miscellaneous Writings of Yanyan' (lost). 'Poetry Collection of Yanyan,' two volumes (not seen). The Dong Gazetteer says, 'Han Chunyu's poems and preface briefly state: "Sui Yan and I have never met, and only after his death did I see his poems and miscellaneous writings. I urgently sought his complete works, but they were scattered and difficult to obtain much of."'" The following discusses Chen Chen's affairs, omitted. Also, Volume 35 (Miscellaneous Records 3):

"'Nanxun Gazetteer' Chen Yanyan, Chen, a Ming loyalist. Han Chunyu's 'Recent Poems and Lost Collection' refers to him, concealing his name and reputation. His life's writings have also been lost, except for 'The Post Story of the Water Margin,' a playful work, attributing it to Song loyalists." The "Nanxun Gazetteer" was written by Shen Dengying during the Daoguang reign. The notes in Wang's Gazetteer indicate that the "manuscript exists," suggesting there is no printed version. Yu Yue's "Continued Excerpts from the Tea Fragrance Studio," Volume 17, likely selects excerpts from the "Nanxun Town Gazetteer" as well.

Currently, the historical materials on Chen Chen are mostly recorded from Han Chunyu's "Recent Poems and Lost Collection." Even the twenty-four poems by Chen recorded in Chen Tian's "Ming Poetry Records," Xin Qian, Volume 14, are also recorded from such selected editions. The two-volume poetry collection was noted as not seen by Wang when he compiled the town gazetteer during the Guangxu reign, making it even more difficult to obtain the original book when Chen Tian compiled the "Ming Poetry Records" in the late Qing Dynasty. If "Recent Poems and Lost Collection" could be examined, it would not be difficult to discover new historical materials on Chen Chen.

Record of the Dragon Boat

Qing Mao Xiangling's "Ink Remaining Record," Volume 4, "Pan Jiuxiang" entry, states that during the Kangxi reign, there was a Pan Shirong who traveled to Yangzhou and took a prostitute named Jiuniang. The prostitute had a marriage agreement with Wei Shao of Sanyuan, and she abandoned Wei. Wei, angered, was killed. The procuress received a bribe and did not pursue the matter. Later, Shirong had a son named Jiuxiang, who was Jiuniang reincarnated. Wei reincarnated in Datuan Town, living near Pan. He argued with Jiuxiang and was captured and taken to Pan's residence, beaten to death, and his body was destroyed. Wei's son sued the officials, who brought Pan's son and his accomplices to justice. It contains the following:

"One of the accomplices, somewhat literate, composed the novel 'Record of the Dragon Boat' in prison, which is still circulated among the villagers."

The name "Record of the Dragon Boat" is not found in Sun Kaidi's "Catalogue of Chinese Vernacular Novels" and is also not found in the "Catalogue of Suspected Titles" (Appendix 1). Even books that collect and record literature, such as "Textual Research on Novels" and "Technical Talks on Novels," do not list this title. However, the meaning of the term "novel" used by previous generations was quite broad, encompassing all vernacular novels, ballad narratives, songbooks, precious scrolls, dramas, and miscellaneous writings. The "Study of Novel Industries," "Textual Research on Novels," and "Talks on Novels" published in the early Republic of China all followed this pattern. It is difficult to judge whether this "Record of the Dragon Boat" is a vernacular novel, a ballad narrative, or a songbook since the original book has not been seen. We will leave it as a question. Even if it belongs to the category of ballad narratives, this title is rarely seen. It is suspected that this, like the "Record of the Earth Prison" (quoted from "Eryou" in the Sequel, Volume 5) and "Record of the Smoke Box" (quoted from "Wenju Excerpts" in the Sequel, Volume 1) cited in "Textual Research on Novels," is a local novel or narrative that was not widely circulated.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 75

— Ye Jingfeng

Not far from Sister Cui's house, I drove the car into a small woods by the side of the road and concealed it. Although there were still no signs of anyone on the road, fearing unexpected trouble, I walked along the sorghum fields by the roadside. Arriving at Sister Cui's door, I saw that the shop was already closed and the door was shut. A red paper was pasted on the door, reading, "Shopkeeper traveling far, business suspended."

Just as I was uttering a "Huh?" I suddenly heard a woman's voice inside, chuckling, followed by the sound of the bolt being drawn, and the door was opened a crack. I peered into the room, but it was completely dark, and I couldn't see anyone. At that moment, I heard Sister Cui's voice saying, "Come in quickly, Long; someone might see you outside!"

"What is this all about?" I said, grabbing Sister Cui's hand in the darkness and groping my way forward.

"This is what that little old man who came with you last time meant. He said the city is very chaotic and there might be fighting here, so he told me to close the shop for a few days and see... This morning, quite a few vehicles passed by, very heavy ones, but we didn't dare get up to look..." She called Tiger Brother "little old man." I don't know what she meant, maybe because he was "small in stature but big in wisdom"?

After crossing the small courtyard and entering the back room, I thought Tiger Brother would surely be inside, but who knew that only Sister Cui's mother came out to greet us, beaming and saying some lively things.

"Didn't you just say that the little old man came?... Where is he?" I asked Sister Cui.

"He came very early and went out again," Sister Cui replied. "He said you might come, so he told me to keep an eye on the door? I've been waiting for half this time."

"Didn't he say where he was going?"

"He's probably gone to the station." Sister Cui said, cocking her ear to listen, not stopping me from speaking loudly; "I heard a knocking sound, let me go see." Before long, Sister Cui indeed came in with Tiger Brother.

"Little Aunt," Tiger Brother shouted in the courtyard. Entering the room, he shifted uneasily and saluted me, saying, "Captain! Reporting." But his face wore an awkward expression.

Tiger Brother was, after all, still a twelve or thirteen-year-old child. He was indeed very experienced in some matters, but in terms of human relations, he was still a child. For example, at this moment, he called me "Little Aunt" for a moment because he believed that in terms of time and place, we had returned to our original relationship—Little Aunt and Tiger Brother—but upon meeting, he became hesitant again, thinking that he had already taken office and been commissioned, and I should be his superior, Captain, so he called me "Captain." He was probably a little confused, as if standing on the edge of public and private, unsure of how to respond.

"We are still 'Little Aunt and Tiger Brother,' and for now, we have both left our positions." I gave him a clear boundary. In front of Sister Cui and her mother, I asked Tiger Brother to tell me everything about his recent actions. He told the truth, and Sister Cui and her mother supplemented a lot.

### Two Letters — Regarding the Transliteration of Mozart

— Zhang Ning

Letter One

Editor: After reading "Concerning the Issue of Transliteration in Music" in the Spring and Autumn section on the 17th, I feel that the argument is not entirely correct and would like to correct the errors. In the article, it says that the transliteration of Mozart should be "Mo Zha," with the "tt" silent, but this is wrong. Mozart's native language is German, and the pronunciation is approximately the same as the English pronunciation of Mo'tzart. The final "t" sound should not be omitted at all because German pronunciation differs from French pronunciation. Could it be that the author of the article is French and does not know German pronunciation! — Joseph

Dear Editor: In yesterday's "Spring and Autumn" section, there was a great work by Mr. Zhu Lixing: "Concerning the Issue of Transliteration in Music." Mr. Zhu strives to make transliterations faithful to the original pronunciation, and he goes to great lengths to research, which is truly admirable. However, the transliterations that Mr. Zhu gave us made me confused. Please allow me to raise them and ask Mr. Zhu for guidance.

Mr. Zhu transliterates Mozart as "Mo Zha" and believes that all other transliterations are wrong. However, as far as I know, (1) the "Z" here should be pronounced "　," but the "Zha" character in Mr. Zhu's transliteration has a "　" sound. (2) According to Mr. Zhu, the "t" character is silent and says that is with the country's law. However, language from the same family have never had so many silent letters (such as french). I don't know whether Mr. Zhu's is "奥语" or the one used in country。 If is said to be the case, come here, you are wrong!

Mr. Zhu also transliterates Dvo as "Fu Xiake" and believes that his transliteration is "accurate and appropriate." He confidently states that "D" is silent. However, as far as I know, this "D" character has a sound. The diacritic symbol above and the accent mark above the also should not be omitted. He also says that "r" should be read as "j." In fact, the "I" sound in 渡希米 is unlike anything in english, I don't know which language Mr. Zhu's "j" character is referring to.

Transliteration is originally a troublesome matter. There have been heated debates over different opinions in the past, but they have never yielded results. What Mr. Zhu is now proposing is specifically about musical terms, and his so-called "music" refers to "Western music," so this problem should be much easier to solve because people who appreciate and enjoy Western music, as a matter of fact, will definitely have some knowledge of Western languages. I myself am a music student, and when I encounter "Mo Zha" or "Fu Xiake," I know what Mr. Zhu is referring to and will never be mistaken. Therefore, I feel that it is somewhat redundant for Mr. Zhu to confidently say that he is "accurate and appropriate" and to criticize others as wrong before he has made things clear to himself. — Incidentally, let me tell Mr. Zhu that although English is not Latin, Austrian and German are also not Latin!

### Selling Houses

— Shaofu

It is said that the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to sell the second batch of enemy and puppet properties. What was the result of the first batch of sales? No announcement has been seen, so the details are unknown.

It is also said that the reason why the numbers issued in the past few months have not increased is mainly due to the sale of enemy and puppet materials. The country is currently facing financial difficulties, and this method may not be a good policy. Unfortunately, it can only be seen as a temporary measure. Otherwise, the President of the Executive Yuan and the Minister of Finance would be very comfortable and would not have to spend all day deliberating and racking their brains because enemy and puppet materials are, after all, limited and will eventually be sold out.

The Central Trust Bureau is indeed having a considerable headache over this assigned task of selling enemy and puppet properties because, although they are sold, the original occupants cannot be easily moved out. Buyers cannot receive the houses, so they are naturally not very enthusiastic, and often no one bids. However, this is beyond the control of the Trust Bureau.

The measures of the authorities are contradictory and often lead to ridiculous situations. Taking housing as an example, on the one hand, they are complaining about a severe housing shortage and want to solve the housing problem for civil servants, such as allocating huge sums of money to build citizen's residences. On the other hand, they are driving civil servants and citizens out of their houses and preparing to hand over this batch of houses to speculators and merchants to exploit and squeeze tenants. It is truly unknown what kind of brilliant policy this is.

Frankly speaking, the current enemy and puppet properties are mostly occupied by civil servants who persevered in the eight-year War of Resistance in the rear and were poor and unable to produce gold bars. They are not prominent figures who can simply issue notes to allocate them. However, if they had gold bars (no matter how they were obtained), who would not want to spend it happily to buy a beautiful house? Moreover, it is said that properties occupied by agencies will not be sold for the time being. May I ask, what is the use of an agency if no one works there? If the people who work there have nowhere to live, how can they work? There was a house-grabbing movement in London. May the authorities carefully consider this!

Intelligence Test

### Are You Forgetful?

— Lang Ge

Everyone's inherent memory capacity differs due to their different natural endowments. People who are naturally intelligent or have keen senses generally have stronger memories. Conversely, people who are naturally dull or have slow senses certainly have weaker memories.

Often, we can test the laughable forgetfulness of a person with a weak memory. For example, if I introduce a friend named Wang to a person with a rather weak memory, after a considerable period of time, when they meet again by chance, and Wang greets the person with a weak memory, he will feel confused and panic, and will not know how to address Wang. This is, of course, a very unfavorable defect in social situations. And especially in academic fields, we can observe how weak a scientist's memory is.

The same thing, a person with a weak memory forgets in a flash. But a person with a strong memory can retain it for a considerable length of time. Here, their difference in ability is displayed.

Everyone has memory, but can you know the extent of your own memory? Here is a scientific method to test the "breadth" of your own memory:

Use three sets of white paper strips, each set with six strips. Write different numbers of digits on the six white paper strips in each set, with the number of digits ranging from five to ten. That is, gradually increase the number of digits from the smallest five-digit number up to ten digits. For example, the six white paper strips in the first set are written as follows: the first strip has 68217, the second has 953648, the third has 4291537, the fourth has 52801746, the fifth has 409571392, and the sixth has 2147305988. The other two sets are the same as the first set of six, with five to ten digits, but the numbers written on them must be different from the other two sets.

Once the tools are ready, you can begin the test. First, prepare another blank sheet of paper and a pen. Then, pick up the strip with the smallest number of digits in each set, look at it, hide it, and after one second, write down the numbers seen on the strip from each set on the blank sheet of paper (no copying). Repeat this process until you have written down the different numbers of digits on all eighteen strips in the three sets. Finally, compare the numbers you wrote down for each set with the numbers in each set to see which digit number you wrote down incorrectly in each set of six strips.

Finally, you need to calculate the score. There is a fixed way to calculate the score. On the last ten-digit number on all three pages, try to check if what you memorized is correct or not. If the last three ten-digit numbers are memorized, then your memory capacity is ten, whether the numbers of nine from eight above have been memorized incorrectly. If all three ten-digit numbers are not correct, then check whether all three nine-digit numbers are correct, if all are correct, then your memory breadth is nine. The rest can be inferred by analogy.

If your memory range is ten, then your memory is quite amazing. If your memory range is five or six, then your memory is too weak. The average person's memory span is generally between seven, eight, and nine. Those who do not reach this number are truly foolish.

Do you want to test your own memory? This is a world-standard scientific test. If you are interested, you may wish to honestly test yourself and see what your memory span actually is?

### Jews

— Yimin

Yesterday, I took a trolley bus to the west. There were two Jews in the car, one holding two Russian breads, and one holding a leather bag. After a while, the ticket seller came, and the Jew holding the bread said to his friend (the one with the leather bag) in English: "Please buy a ticket for me." His friend looked displeased and said: "If you are willing to share a bread with me, I will buy it for you. Otherwise, I am unwilling." The Jew did not say anything upon hearing this. After a while, he said again: "Let's just buy our own."

### Small Talk

— Geng Lan translated from Your Life, October issue

The heat energy that the sun reaches the earth is estimated to be equivalent to burning ten million tons of coal per minute.

Professor Cohen, a history professor at Smith College, believes that today's college girls are too smart. Once, he asked the entire class: "What is the main object of folk literature?" Among the answers he received were: "Nationalism, patriotism, war, economics, and praising emperors, etc." Professor Cohen shook his head in disappointment and asked, "Haven't you heard of love?"

An investigator for an insurance company once conducted a survey. If you randomly select one hundred men, by the time they reach the age of sixty-five, fifty-four of them will have to rely on relatives or relief funds to get by, thirty-six will have died, five will still be working, four will be doing well, and one will be rich.

In 1900, there were about five million elderly people in the United States, and in 1930, there were more than ten million. According to recent estimates, that number will reach 21 million.

The Pennsylvania State Automobile Association recently reported that in 15,000 female drivers, there was only one fatal accident, while the ratio for male drivers was 1,701 to 1. Sorry, gentlemen!

When you feel depressed and depressed, think about the fact that, although he is a sick and blind person, he writes excellent articles for major magazines. Under the education of his mother and friends, he has published hundreds of short essays and stories. Many collections of poetry have been printed, and he has won thousands of dollars in prizes in various prize competitions, but none of his publishers know that he is disabled, let alone his suffering. He is currently starting to write a book, which is estimated to require more than two years of thought and writing.

### American Educator on American Education

— Recorded by Bao Zhongqi

Professor Wang Zonghai, a renowned American educator, recently came to China from the United States and has been employed by the University of Shanghai to teach in the Department of Education. On October 21st, during the weekly meeting, Professor Wang attended and delivered a speech, reporting on the trends and directions of American university education in recent years, which was extremely detailed. The following is a translation to serve as a reference and comparison for contemporary Chinese education.

Curriculum System:

Since the outbreak of the Great War, American training has focused on creating individuals capable of dealing with all aspects of society, cultivating excellent citizens with noble character and morals. Therefore, the course programs of American universities have been reformed. Former U.S. President Wilson once said: "College is for the training of general experience and mental discipline." Their universities are now operating according to this basic policy: regardless of the student's major, subjects such as "Economics," "Politics," "Religion," "Philosophy," and "Foreign Languages" are all compulsory, while the actual major courses are not studied until the junior year. To put it bluntly, which may cause some to doubt, American university courses are much shallower than those in China. Freshmen study analytical geometry, while calculus and differential equations are not studied until the sophomore or junior year!

Emphasis on Physical Education:

All freshmen must be able to swim. By the sophomore year, they must have a second athletic skill, whether it is soccer, basketball, horseback riding, or even golf. The goal is to prevent students from only studying and to cultivate a healthy physique.

Extracurricular Activities:

American schools often have only a little over a thousand students, but there are nearly a hundred extracurricular groups. There are also many student-run publications. In addition, there are weekly speech contests, concerts, or debates, allowing students to truly benefit from group education.

Advisor System:

On average, each professor is responsible for supervising the academic performance of eight students and guiding their daily lives. Students can raise any questions they have with their advisors, who will provide a satisfactory answer. This can greatly increase the feelings between teachers and students, with only respect and love, and no elements of dislike or fear.

Professor Wang's speech concluded amidst enthusiastic applause from the students. President Ling then stood up from his seat and shared his experiences and thoughts from his visit to several top universities in this ancient cultural city of Peiping two days ago. In the quiet atmosphere, President Ling said the following:

The first place I visited was National Tsinghua University. They had not yet started the semester. Although the auditorium and library were not damaged, the vast campus was covered in weeds. Although 500 people are now working on repairs, I doubt it will be completed by the end of October. Yenching University is adjacent to Tsinghua, with a campus covering 700 acres. They have already started the semester, but there are only 800 students, and their living conditions are very difficult. Every meal consists mainly of "w窝头 (a kind of corn bread)" which southerners find hard to swallow, with only a plate of salted radish as a side dish. The extent of the damage to the facilities is similar to that of Tsinghua, so Yenching University's funding is already very tight. As for the salaries of faculty and staff, the highest is only 250,000, and the lowest is only 120,000, making it quite difficult to maintain a meager living.

Peking University is the strangest of all. Unlike Tsinghua and Yenching, it does not have a fixed campus. The various colleges are scattered throughout the districts of Peiping, with the College of Liberal Arts as the center. The strangest thing is that there are only a little over 2,000 students, but nearly 1,000 faculty and staff. According to President Hu Shih, the level of education at Peking schools has generally declined by three years compared to before the war. In this year's enrollment of new students, Shanghai had the highest standards. Please think about what the education level is really like in Shanghai, and what American educational methods are like. President Ling's speech ended there.

Indeed, President Ling is one of the youngest university presidents in Shanghai. The University of Shanghai under his leadership is developing vigorously. We have also implemented the advisor system. In addition to intellectual growth, our school also pays attention to moral, physical, and group education.

President Ling has adopted the strengths of Chinese and American education and has great ambition to make the University of Shanghai a model for all universities in Shanghai, which is indeed worthy of praise!

### Passive Resistance

— Chunliang

An elegant old gentleman drove his car into a narrow road and encountered a young man driving a car from the opposite direction. The place was narrow, and they could not pass each other. Only one of them could back out of the narrow road and let the other pass.

"I think," the old gentleman said kindly, "you should let me pass because I am much older than you."

"I won't give you an inch," the young man replied angrily. Then, he took out a newspaper and sat in the car leisurely reading it.

The old gentleman leaned back comfortably in his seat, his eyes satisfied as he looked at the surrounding scenery. "Friend," he finally called out, "when you finish reading that newspaper, could you lend it to me?"

The young man finally gave in.

### Postal Rate Hike

— Wei Zhao

According to the report on the 23rd, the postage for ordinary mail will increase to 200 yuan from next month! I can't help but think that, indeed, apart from water and electricity bills and the salaries of public educators, there is nothing cheaper anymore. If the former is passed into law and allowed to be implemented, the remaining salaries of public educators can proudly claim to be the "only cheap things left"!

Although the long war has been won, due to inconvenient transportation and unrest in the countryside, I don't know how many people are still wandering as strangers in foreign lands! And for this group of people who are "away from their hometowns" and "unable to return home," the only thing they rely on to relieve their "homesickness" is a letter "reporting safety at home."

According to the current situation, 200 yuan is really not much, but for letters to other provinces, due to transportation reasons, they have to be sent by airmail. If the number is calculated proportionally, airmail may be 500, and air express may be 1,000! Eight hundred or a thousand legal tender may not be much to obese old men, but how can self-respecting public educators afford the cost of airmail?

The newspaper on the 20th stated that the transportation authorities have approved a five-fold increase, which has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. This allows the poor wanderers in a foreign land to breathe a slight sigh of relief. I hope that the legislative authorities will give it a discount so as not to leave the meager salaries of public educators feeling so lonely!

### Memorandum

— Gang Wu

Being born is dangerous, and dying is painful. So people seek happiness in the middle of the road. The most violent and evil are still filled with worries and anxieties. Only abundant knowledge can give you true pleasure!

### City of Peace - United Nations Capital Side View

— Jin Xia

According to statistics from January of this year, New York City has a total population of 7,768,000. Among these people, non-U.S. citizens account for more than 60 percent.

Jews account for one-third of New York's total population. The first foreigners to arrive in New York were the Irish. The Great Famine of 1840 forced them to cross the ocean.

The number of employees in the New York City government is greater than that of the entire Australian government. The number of police officers in New York is greater than the number of standing vehicles in Norway.

On average, the New York Police Department arrests one citizen every eleven minutes. New York is a city with the most disputes and crimes.

New York City is divided into four districts: commercial, residential, unrestricted, and undecided, each with its own scope that cannot be exceeded.

Residences all have flat, wide roofs that can be used for sunbathing, hosting banquets, and playing tennis.

The tallest skyscraper in New York is the "Empire State Building," which has 102 floors and 62 elevators. The distance that the elevators travel is nearly a mile, so it can simply be called a "vertical railway." To prevent dangerous accidents, air wells are installed under the elevators, so that even if someone accidentally falls, they will not lose their lives.

As a result of the consumption of 7.7 million citizens, New York produces 4,000 tons of garbage every day, an average of one pound of garbage per person. To maintain the cleanliness of the city, the city employs more than 15,000 street cleaners.

New York's street system is the simplest and most logical in the world, with street names mostly named in numerical order.

The "Chinaneh Nag" women's apartment on 78th Street is magnificent in architecture and fully equipped, with five or six hundred rooms, making it the largest women's apartment in the world.

In a day, the following things happen in New York: 275 babies are born; 34 people are killed by cars; 116 people get married; 4 people commit suicide; 1 person is murdered.

New York's Central Park covers 879 acres. Combining all the parks in Shanghai would not be half the size of it.

### Returned Student from Three Countries, He Siyuan

— You Nan

The newly appointed mayor of Peiping.

The government recently issued an order to transfer He Siyuan, the chairman of Shandong Province, to be the mayor of Peiping.

He's courtesy name is Xiancha, and he is from Heze County, Shandong Province. In 1916, he entered the Department of Philosophy at Peking University and was a strong member of the May Fourth Movement. After 1919, he went to the United States, France, and Germany to study political economy, earning a master's degree from the University of Chicago.

He returned to China in 1926 and served as a professor of finance and economics at Guangzhou Zhongshan University. His political career began in 1927, starting as a member of the Central Purification Committee. In May 1928, he followed the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army to Shandong and was appointed as a member of the Shandong Provincial Government and concurrently as the Director of the Department of Education, a position he has held continuously to this day, a history of eighteen years.

Good at Coping

The situation in Shandong Province has been unique since the Northern Expedition, with extremely subtle relationships both externally and internally. The chairman of the province has been replaced by Sun Liangcheng, Chen Tiaoyuan, Han Fuju, Shen Honglie, and Mou Zhongheng, but He Siyuan has not only never been replaced but has also risen from Director of the Department of Education to Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and then to Chairman of the province. During the War of Resistance, he remained in Shandong throughout, showing that he is good at coping with complex and difficult political environments.

When Han Fuju was in charge of Shandong, He inspected the state of education in western Shandong as the Director of Education, arrived in Jining, and summoned elementary school teachers at the Education Bureau to give a speech. One passage in his speech was very witty and profound. He said, "Currently, there are three types of people in society that make people envious: The first type is the bandits who recruit soldiers and buy horses and occupy the mountains, who are famous and well-fed, but the common people gnash their teeth and hate them. The second type is those who have a 'Yang Guifei'-style younger sister who marries a so-called 'bureaucrat,' acting as a toy, and the older brother can use this mysterious and wonderful qualification to find jobs and seek positions easily, simply surpassing bachelors, masters, and even doctors and returned students. There are probably not enough trains to carry all the examples of this! The third type is a group of people who specialize in studying the art of flattering and using means to curry favor, gradually gaining positions and promotions. Do you think the paths of these three types of people are normal? Where is their personality to be found? Only the work of you all is the most sacred and valuable. Although it is difficult, you are establishing indelible achievements in society..."

Very Good at Talking

The above remarks are so straightforward and refreshing, and in the end, he places a high hat on the heads of elementary school teachers, which is of course very welcome. This also shows that the mouth of this returned student from three countries is indeed extraordinary.

The current Shandong is a military conflict zone, and He is not of military origin, so it is difficult for him to display his strengths. Now that he has been transferred to be the mayor of Peiping, and Peiping is an ancient cultural city, a place where people and culture gather, I believe that He will definitely be able to develop his personal political aspirations.
