### After Victory, the Chairman's First Inspection Tour: The Chairman Flew to Nanchang Last Night, Citizens Emptied Their Homes to Welcome Him with Thunderous Cheers.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanchang Office, 21st] Chairman Chiang arrived in Nanchang at 5:36 PM on the 21st aboard the special "Meiling" aircraft for his first inspection tour after the victory. The Chairman wore a felt hat and a grass-green Zhongshan suit, appearing energetic and in high spirits. Upon disembarking, he was greeted by the presidium of the welcoming committee, including the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, Wang Lingji; the Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Chen Zhaoying; the Chief of the Youth Corps, Zhan Chunjian; the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Wang Zhenxin; and prominent elders Ouyang Wu, Peng Chengwan, and Gong Shizeng, who paid their respects to the Chairman. Four young ladies, Sheng Qi, Liu Fangnan, Wang Jiaying, and Tao Shengci, stepped forward to present flowers. The Chairman accepted them with a smile, repeatedly saying "Good, good," and shook hands with each of the welcomers. He then smiled and slowly walked out of the airport, accepting the respectful salutes from representatives of the Nanchang government, military, party, and organizations standing along the roadside. The Chairman nodded frequently in response as he passed the welcomers, and upon reaching outside the station, he boarded special car number one with Wang Lingji amidst the melodious military music, and drove to the backyard of the provincial government on Minde Road for a rest. Various leaders from all walks of life among the welcomers, as well as reporters from Jiangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan newspapers, followed in cars. Over a hundred cars, one after another, made for a spectacular sight.

Two hundred thousand citizens of Nanchang, with extremely joyful hearts, emptied their homes to welcome Chairman Chiang, who had rescued over fourteen million Jiangxi compatriots from fire and water and brought them comfort, whom they had longed to see for twelve years and awaited for seventy days. The welcoming crowds stretched for ten Chinese miles, from Tiger's Mouth to Minde Road. The government and military welcomers included three thousand officers from the Sixth Military Officer Corps, over two thousand members of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, over a thousand staff from the provincial government departments, and the rest were students and citizens from various schools. When the Chairman's car passed through this long welcoming crowd of ten Chinese miles, the cheers of "Long live the leader!" from the people shook the sky. The enthusiastic atmosphere and strict order were rarely seen by this reporter traveling in various provinces in the last decade. Seeing the love and respect of the Jiangxi compatriots for him, the Chairman, while in the car, felt deeply gratified that it remained the same as twenty years ago (it is said that in 1926, when the Chairman served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expeditionary Army and defeated the warlords in Jiangxi, he entered Nanchang barefoot wearing straw sandals and received a grand welcome from 300,000 citizens). However, when the Chairman noticed the ruins of houses and dilapidated walls in the suburbs through the car window, imagining the suffering of the Nanchang compatriots under the enemy's invasion, he couldn't help but sigh for a long time. He turned to Chairman Wang Lingji and said, "The people of Nanchang have suffered too much. We should quickly provide them with housing and conveniences and work together for reconstruction."

Grand Welcoming Meeting This Morning: The Chairman Decided to Attend and Give Instructions in Person.

The 21st was the first day of the Chairman's visit to Nanchang. A cool breeze blew in the morning, and the citizens, knowing that the Chairman would arrive, wore clean clothes and stood quietly on the streets, waiting happily. When the "Meiling" special plane landed at the new airport about five Chinese miles from Qingyunpu, the light rain had just cleared, and the rain clouds over the West Mountains, the high clouds over Nanpu, the rainbow hanging on the ground, and the afterglow of the sunset created an extremely beautiful scene. The citizens saw a rainbow suddenly rising from a corner of the airport and applauded and cheered, regarding it as an auspicious sign.

After Chairman Chiang arrived at the provincial government office, the leaders of all circles in Jiangxi province, knowing that the leader had worked hard along the way, waited for instructions to meet him. At about 6 PM, the Chairman invited Wang Lingji to have dinner together. The Xiangguang Theater Troupe, which had been scheduled to perform Peking opera, changed the performance to the evening of the 22nd. The grand welcoming meeting for the leader by all circles was scheduled to be held at the stadium at 7 AM on the 22nd, and Chairman Chiang decided to attend in person to deliver a speech to comfort and encourage the Jiangxi compatriots.

After attending the welcoming meeting of all circles in Nanchang on the 22nd, Chairman Chiang will go to Qingyunpu to pay respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery, and then to the Sixth Military Officer Corps to address the more than 7,000 demobilized officers. He also plans to visit the old site of the Nanchang Headquarters on the shore of East Lake and the destroyed library.

Dunkin and 24 other members of the UNRRA stationed in Jiangxi also went to the airport on the 21st to welcome the Chairman. They stood at the head of the welcoming line. They included nationals from six countries, including Britain, the United States, India, and Canada. They said that they felt very honored to see the demeanor of our leader in Nanchang.

Will Convene Military and Government Officials from All Circles to Discuss the Post-War Reconstruction Plan for Jiangxi Province.

Shen Changhuan, Secretary of the National Government, and 24 other members of the Chairman's entourage arrived in Nanchang at 12:00 PM on the 21st aboard aircraft 47-294. Shi Juemin, Military Advisor of the National Government, arrived in the province on the afternoon of the 21st in Chairman's Nash-style car number 17423. Before the "Meiling" special plane flew to Nanchang, Nanchang Airport sent a small trainer aircraft with a ten-foot-long red, white, and blue tricolor cloth tied to its tail, flying in the air as a signal. The welcoming crowds on the streets cheered and applauded upon seeing it. About ten minutes after the "Meiling" special plane carrying the Chairman landed, aircraft number 285, carrying Yu Jishi, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government, also landed.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanchang Office, 21st] It is reported that before Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing, he will convene the leaders of the Jiangxi party, government, and military from all circles and local elders to discuss the post-war reconstruction plan for Jiangxi Province. Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the general difficulties in restoring the rural areas in the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangxi Province. The Chairman will return to Nanjing in about one or two days.

### The Chairman Stayed in Lushan for Sixty-Nine Days: Before Leaving, He Visited the People to Inquire About Their Suffering; The Elders lined up to See Him Off, Reluctant to Part.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 21st] Chairman Chiang departed from the Guling office at 9:35 AM on the 21st to inspect Nanchang. Dozens of elders from Lushan, dressed in long gowns and mandarin jackets, lined up in front of the office to see him off. The Chairman immediately nodded to each of them to express his thanks and said, "I dare not trouble you. See you again next summer." He then took a sedan chair to Hanzhou Pass, Guanyin Bridge, Xiufeng Temple, and had lunch at Haihui Temple. He then turned from Haihui Temple to Jiujiang Xingzi Highway and back to Jiujiang. The Chairman visited the people along the way to inquire about their suffering and inspected the old residences of Guanyin Bridge and Xiufeng Temple. Guling Street was cleaned up on the 21st, and every household hung county flags and lanterns to show their farewell. The Chairman had been stationed on the mountain since July 14th, which was sixty-nine days until September 21st. The mountain people felt very close to him because they had seen him in person. Once they parted, they were all reluctant.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] Before leaving Guling, the Chairman inspected Xiufeng Temple, paying tribute to the site of the fierce battle during the enemy's invasion of Jiujiang during the Anti-Japanese War. He then went to Haihui Temple for lunch. Haihui Temple was the location of the Lushan Training Corps before the war. From 1933 to 1937, the Chairman gathered military officers from all over the country to receive training there every summer, instilling national thought and improving their military skills, laying the foundation for the subsequent Anti-Japanese War. Before leaving Guling, the Chairman made a special trip to inspect it.

[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 21st] Chairman Chiang went down the mountain from the south road of Lushan, circumnavigated the Jiuxing Highway at the foot of the mountain, and arrived safely at the naval pier here at 4:15 PM. Military generals Zhang Ruigui and Liang Bo and representatives of the people lined up at the pier to see him off. The Chairman did not rest and immediately took a naval special boat to cross the river. At 5:00 PM, the special plane flew directly to Nanchang for inspection.

### Public Sale of Grain: Implementation Postponed.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The public sale of grain in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, originally scheduled to begin next month, has been postponed due to insufficient preparation and various difficulties.

### American Personnel in the Military Mediation Department: Interest in Mediation Undiminished.

Cai Wenzhi Speaks to Reporters

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] Today, when a reporter asked Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government in the Military Mediation Department, about the prospects for peace, Cai said that the fact that over two hundred and seventy family members of the American side had newly arrived in sixty-six units showed the American side's interest in mediation. According to what the reporter knows, they all agreed to the US government's requirement to have at least a one-year stay before coming to Beiping. The Communist Party's performance in the Military Mediation Department is passive, the number of staff is decreasing day by day, and yesterday another sixteen important personnel were sent back to Zhangjiakou. There are no increases in the number of teams in other places, and the teams in the war zone not only cannot mediate, but must also urgently seek to be transferred back, otherwise their lives will be in danger and they will be regarded as spies by the other side. Within the Military Mediation Department, issues such as violating the No. "Harmony" order are only discussed briefly.

[Special Dispatch from Our Changchun Office, 20th] Wu Xingzhong, Major General and Director of the Government Mediation Office of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Military Mediation Department, and two staff members flew to Harbin this morning, and plan to transfer to Qiqihar, with an expected one-week visit.

### Nantong Team Will Return to Beiping.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nantong Office, 21st] Colonel Qu Menhan, the American representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Department's Nantong Team, and four others, escaped from the Communist area a few days ago and returned to Nantong. All the items they carried were robbed and retained by the Communist army, and they were in a very embarrassing situation. They are currently staying at the Taizhihua Hotel, and have been sorting out everything in recent days. They will accompany Lieutenant Colonel Blankhurst to Beiping to report.

### Chifeng Executive Team Has Already Lost Its Freedom.

[Central News Agency, Chaoyang, 21st] After witnessing the experience of the Chengde team, the Chifeng Second Executive Team felt uneasy. It was rumored that they had planned to retreat to Beiping, but because the Chifeng Airport was severely damaged, they planned to take a jeep to Chaoyang and then transfer to Beiping. Currently, the team is contacting both the Nationalists and the Communists to pass through. After Li Yunchang arrived in Chifeng, the American representatives of the team lost their freedom, and their safety is worrying. The American representatives of the team are Colonel McArthur and three others, the government representative is Lieutenant Colonel Liu Wuwei, the translator is Chen Zhengping, and the radio station director is Luo Wokai.

### Foreign Exchange Will Be Adjusted Regularly: Methods Have Been Drafted and Are Being Submitted for Approval; Rumors of Another Devaluation Have Not Been Confirmed.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Relevant parties here have not been able to confirm the rumors circulating in the Shanghai market that foreign exchange will be adjusted again. A certain authoritative person said that only one month has passed since the government announced the new exchange rate, and it seems impossible to devalue it again. The emergence of this rumor may be due to the fact that international banks need us to re-determine the value of the legal currency, and it is caused by the rumors of another devaluation of the US dollar and the French franc. It is also heard that relevant parties have drafted a method for adjusting foreign exchange, planning to make small adjustments on a regular basis, which is currently being submitted to the authorities for approval.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] It is learned that the work of the Central Mint has now stopped. The Shanghai newspaper reported that the factory is preparing a plan to resume production in order to adapt to the future currency system reform, and has requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate tens of billions of funds, which is not reliable. The factory was severely damaged by the enemy and puppets, and it is possible to request the allocation of funds for repair. The unification of the old currency system reform is indeed something that must be done in the future, but it is too early to talk about it at present, and it will take a considerable period of time after the political situation is stabilized before we can talk about reform.

### The National Army in Fengzhen and Datong Joined Forces; The Communist Army's Dependents in Zhangyuan Fled in Droves; The National Army in Jining Is Advancing Towards Shangdu.

[Special Dispatch from Our Gui Sui Office, 21st] The troops of Ma Zhanshan in the Twelfth War Zone attacked from Datong yesterday and advanced to Gushan last night. This afternoon, they joined forces with the troops attacking from Fengzhen in Baoziwan. It is said that the commander who rescued Datong is General Sun Lanfeng, who was the first to take over Datong last year.

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] According to official sources, the National Army in eastern Sui and the garrison in Datong joined forces at noon on the 20th between Fengzhen and Liuyi. From then on, the main road between Gui Sui and Datong has been completely opened. The Gui Sui and Jining roads are now open to traffic, and the work of repairing the road between Jining and Datong is being stepped up and will be open to military traffic in the short term. The Communist army suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Jining, and Zhang Bai, deputy commander of Yao Zhe, was also killed in battle. He Long's troops have now withdrawn from Zuoyun and Youyu in northwestern Shanxi, and Nie Rongzhen and Xiao Ke have withdrawn to Zhangjiakou. Although the first team originally stationed in Jining has returned to Beiping safely, it is said that the representative of the chief officer, Zhou Beifeng (Director of the Sui Land Political Affairs Bureau), is still missing. It was rumored last month that Zhou was sent to Jining and Fengzhen to persuade He Long to lift the siege of Datong, but to no avail, and the Jining battle broke out. The Jicha Jin Daily in Zhangjiakou compared Zhou to Lai Chi, and Zhou's safety is quite questionable.

[Special Dispatch from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] After the Communist army in Datong set fire in the suburbs, they collapsed to Zhangyuan. There are already three or four thousand Communist army dependents in Zhangyuan, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing to Kelan via Wutai.

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] The Qinglong area is still calm today. However, two highway bridges between Beiping North and Changping were destroyed by the Communist army, and the National Army has dispatched troops to repair them. According to official intelligence, the 120th Division Headquarters of the Communist Army is currently stationed in Kangzhuang, two brigades and three regiments of the Communist Army are stationed in Huailai, and one regiment of the Communist Army is stationed in Yanqing. Both sides are still in the process of mobilization, and there may not be any battles in the next one or two days.

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] News of the National Army advancing towards Zhangjiakou still cannot obtain concrete proof from a powerful source. When inquiring about the relevant parties, they are all evasive and reply that Chief Chen strictly ordered not to casually reveal military information when he came to Beiping, but said that it is okay to publish it when there are results. It is rumored that Zhu De is indeed sitting in Zhangyuan. The government side of the Military Mediation Department said that the government and American representatives of the Zhangjiakou team are being monitored by the Communist army, and the American radio station is also prohibited from using. Whether the team can be retrieved is still a question. Another person familiar with the military geography of Chahar and Sui said that there are three routes for the National Army in eastern Sui to attack Zhangjiakou: one is from Fengzhen via Zenyongkou Yanggao Chaigoubao, one is from Fengzhen via Longshengzhuang Chaigoubao, and one is from Jining via Shangdu Shangyi Zhangbei. The first Qian is the most convenient of these three routes. It is reported that the National Army that recovered Jining has divided its troops into one route and is advancing towards Shangdu. The progress of the advance is unknown.

[United Press, Beiping, 21st] The government army launched an offensive against Zhangjiakou today and advanced to Nankou, two hundred miles northwest of Beiping. However, this news has not yet been confirmed.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] After senior official sources close to the government confirmed that Zhangjiakou and Harbin have become the main targets of the National Army's offensive, qualified parties here believe that the situation in China and the position of the American mediator will undergo drastic developments in the near future, which may cause serious reactions to the China policy of the United States and the Soviet Union.

### Madame Chiang Arrives in Shanghai from Guling: Mrs. Marshall and Soong Tzu-liang Came Along.

[Report from Our Office] Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall took a plane from Guling to Nanjing at 1:00 PM yesterday. After a short rest in Nanjing, they flew to Shanghai in the original plane at about 5:00 PM. At that time, the autumn rain was tight and the journey was inconvenient. After Mrs. Chiang and others arrived in Shanghai, it was difficult to find the airport due to poor visibility. They circled over the city for several weeks and safely landed at Longhua Airport at 6:40 PM. Those who came to welcome them were Mayor Wu and his wife, Huang Renlin who had just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, Group Leader Yan Hugu of the police department, and Colonel Charles, the American military representative. Soong Tzu-liang, General Manager of the China Construction Corporation, and Zhang Yongliang, the adjutant of Madame Chiang, came to Shanghai on the same plane as the two ladies.

[Central News Agency, This City] After spending the hot summer in Lushan, the summer resort of China, Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall flew to Shanghai on Marshall's special plane No. 476650 last night. Those who came to the airport to welcome them helped the two ladies off the plane and said frequently: "Be careful, ladies." It is said that they will come here for a five or six-day stay and have no special mission. After the two ladies got into the car, they nodded and smiled to greet those who came to welcome them, and then drove to Chiang's residence on Dongping Road to rest.

### The National Army in Hebei and China Advances: Baigou Town Was Recovered Yesterday.

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] Baoding Telephone: (1) The National Army advancing towards Xiongxian has defeated the main force of the Communist Army, and recovered the important stronghold of Baigou Town last night. The county government will be set up in the town to control the entire county. The National Army has now advanced twenty Chinese miles across the Baigou River. (2) The National Army advancing southwest of Baoding recovered four strongholds, including Dongxi Linshui, last night. Two new field regiments of the Communist Army were transferred to support, and they are fighting fiercely. (3) The Communist Army along the Pinghan Road is preparing to destroy the railway in a big way. Last night, the Yujiazhuang and Xushui railway stations were attacked by the Communist Army, and they retreated after a three-hour fierce battle. At the same time, Dingxing Xincheng was also attacked last night. More than 10,000 Communist Army troops arrived near Gaopaidian Railway Station last night, and there was an attempt to attack the station.

### Millions of Japanese Troops in the Northeast: Mysteriously Disappeared.

American Congressman Demands Explanation from the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Representatives Hillis and Sikes, members of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, recently demanded that the Soviet Union be forced to explain the mysterious disappearance of one million Japanese troops in the Northeast.

### Marshalls Meet Yesterday: The Political Situation Is Developing.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Amid the military progress, peace talks are still ongoing, especially with the Marshalls still making various final efforts with active confidence. On the 21st, Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 11:00 AM, and left after talking for half an hour. At that time, Pi Zonggan, military attache of the National Government, also came to visit. After Marshall left, Pi met with Stuart and Fu Jingbo again, and left shortly after. According to people around Stuart, the situation is developing. When reporters asked whether it was a good development, they replied that the content of the conversation could not be announced at present, but the development should be hopeful.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] It has been learned that the Communist Party's dispute over the three-person and five-person meetings has faded, but its goal remains unchanged, that is, an immediate ceasefire must be achieved. As for the rumors that the content of the five-member group's discussions can be expanded, the Communist Party still firmly rejects it, because the Communist Party wants to talk about a ceasefire first, and the government wants to talk about other things after the topic of reorganizing the National Government Committee is settled. Therefore, the Communist Party will not participate. However, based on the premise of a ceasefire, the Communist Party believes that the military three-person group meeting must be convened. The content of Wang Bingnan's visit to Ambassador Stuart today is circling around this point.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] A reporter learned from an authoritative source that Special Envoy Marshall handed over a document containing opinions to Wang Bingnan on the 20th for delivery to the Communist Party. The content is still unknown. According to a certain person, these two days will be a turning point for the overall situation, depending on the Communist Party's reply. The reporter then tried to obtain confirmation from the US Embassy and the Communist Party Office, but both denied it, believing that this was not the case.

### Liang Shuming Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday.

Carrying a Letter from Zhang Junmai to Marshall

Main Opinions Are the Same as the Communist Party.

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st. Liang brought a letter from Zhang Junmai to Special Envoy Marshall, the content of which explained that the current situation should still focus on a ceasefire. His main opinions coincided with the Communist Party. Zhang Shenfu left Nanjing by plane for Beiping this morning.

### The Chinese Communist Party Is Standing at a Crossroads: Should Decide on a Political Line; It Is Said That Fu Zuoyi's Telegram to Mao Zedong Was Full of Sincerity.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Because General Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to Mao Zedong, requesting him to abandon force and join the government, a Central News Agency reporter visited Minister Peng Xuepei of the Propaganda Department to inquire about his opinions. Minister Peng replied that General Fu's telegram was full of sincerity, and he could not agree more. In recent days, the National Army has been progressing smoothly everywhere. The government is very pleased with the loyal and brave soldiers, but at the same time, it is even more saddened by the loss of life of the majority of the people who have been driven by the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is now standing at a historical crossroads and should deeply consider and decide on its future political line: whether to continue to sacrifice countless lives to try to seize power by force, or to follow Chairman Chiang's repeated advice, abandon force and follow the path of democratic constitutionalism in order to engage in political struggle? If the former is chosen, the people will suffer prolonged bloodshed, create chaos and poverty, and the Communist Party itself will be tormented by conscience; if the latter is chosen, the Communist Party will be the second largest party in China, a strong enemy or friend of the Kuomintang, either winning the support of the people through political means, or participating in the government to contribute to the restoration of the country. The advantages and disadvantages are very obvious. It is meaningless to consider the issue of face due to military victory or defeat. During the War of Resistance, millions of people contributed their lives to the country. What is the Communist Party reluctant to give up in contributing some important transportation points to the country? As for Mr. Zhou Enlai's statement that the Communist Party will never surrender to the Kuomintang, it is even more unexpected. The Kuomintang will never harbor the fallacious idea of victory or surrender. On the contrary, Chairman Chiang has always sincerely asked the Communist Party to participate in the government and the National Assembly. If a political party abandons the policy of rebellion and engages in the struggle of constitutionalism, it is a noble and patriotic act, not surrender. I believe that General Fu's telegram is in complete agreement with Chairman Chiang's August 14th manifesto.

### Telegram from Fu Zuoyi to Mao Zedong

(Continued from Yesterday) Internal strife is unanimously hated by the people. How can you, the initiators of the strife, stand among the people? There is only one correct path. In the constitutional system, the Communist Party has a future, but armed rebellion and separate division will surely be destroyed. Please think carefully: When the victory came at the beginning of last year, how many people sympathized with you for proposing democracy? After a year of factual proof, so-called democracy and peace are just your propaganda, and war and division are your true actions. How many people at home and abroad sympathize with you today? This is a very obvious test of your policies. A leader who claims to be a revolutionary should know that the so-called revolutionary situation is objective and real, not subjectively forced, otherwise

Cutting One's Feet to Fit the Shoes

To impose on the people what the people hate will never succeed. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you can accept the bloody lesson, immediately change your policies, abandon the idea of the omnipotence of force, quickly join the government, end the internal strife, and let the people of the whole country work hard to build our country. I have never been hostile to the Communist Party, and I have no intention of fighting the Communist army. My mother is a person who sympathizes with the Communist Party. You once firmly advocated the War of Resistance, and I admire your spirit of firm struggle. Only today's policy of war is extremely wrong. For the sake of the country and the people, I ask Mr. to immediately abandon this policy, promote the realization of constitutionalism, nationalize the army, and democratize politics, so as to work together harmoniously. As long as Mr. Mao participates in the government and recommends Mr. He Neng or any of you to succeed me in my current position as a member of the government, I will not only be the first to welcome him, but also be willing to do my best to make it happen. If you don't mind, I myself am willing to be a low-level staff member under Mr. Mao and absolutely faithfully obey you. Such a peaceful, unified and democratic China is what the people of the whole country demand, what the United States and the Soviet Union jointly hope for, and what all countries in the world sympathize with. We must maintain close cooperation with the United States and maintain close relations with the Soviet Union forever. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and world peace can be guaranteed. With a single thought, Mr. not only can China achieve peace, but also humanity will benefit. Success or failure, good or bad, now is the best opportunity for you to choose. Fu Zuoyi, You, Hao, Kou. (End)

### Lu Xi Communist Army Collapses Towards Juye; National Army Enters Heze City; Communist Army Flees to Southern Shandong After Defeat at Huaiyin

[Central News Agency Xuzhou 21st Dispatch] The National Army in Western Shandong entered Heze at 12:00 noon on the 20th. The Communist army has collapsed towards the Juye (east of Heze) area. (Note: Heze is the old Caozhou Prefecture, a major town in western Shandong. After the National Army's entry, it can echo the National Army in Jining and control western Shandong).

[Our Newspaper Jinan 21st Dispatch] The government has reported that the Shandong Communist army is still actively concentrating supplies from all parts of the province to the mountainous areas of southern Shandong. All supplies in the plains of western Shandong have been transported to Sangcun and Fengmao Village east of Teng County, and the Tianbao Mountain area of Fei County in recent days. The conscription of able-bodied men is being carried out urgently. 6,000 people have been drafted from each of Gu County, Qingping, and Boping in northwestern Shandong, and 10,000 from Tangyi. The public is extremely panicked and has organized self-defense groups for self-protection. The Communist army (Shandong Provincial Government) personnel in Linyi have moved from Xigaoqi Village south of the city to E Zhuang Town, nine kilometers northwest of the city, to conduct official business. The National Army entering Jinxiang in western Shandong has advanced north and reached the southwestern part of Jiaxiang County. Jiaxiang is expected to be recovered within days. Li Jiande's People's Self-Defense Army of over a thousand people in Wulibao, west of Jiaxiang City, engaged in a fierce battle with the Communist army for a day and night, defeating the Communist army and seizing over five hundred guns. The Communist army in southern Shandong has hollowed out each hole of the Jinpu Railway's large iron bridge south of the boundary, installed explosives, and seems to be preparing to destroy transportation and abandon the railway.

[Central News Agency Zhengzhou 21st Dispatch] The eastward and westward extension and repair of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has passed Lanfeng County, with only two stations remaining to be completed.

[Our Newspaper Xinpu 20th Dispatch] The Communist army in northern Jiangsu has collapsed. More than 20,000 Communist army personnel who were defeated in Huaiyin have arrived at villages south of Longju Township in the second district of Donghai. In recent days, they have been fleeing from Niushan and Xutang Village on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway towards southern Shandong. The Communist army originally stationed outside Donghai has automatically retreated. Local model teams in many places have experienced infighting, rebelling and defecting from the Communist Party.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 21st Dispatch] Since Huaiyin was recovered by the National Army, Ji Yuzhi, the special commissioner of the Seventh District, is going to Huaiyin from Xu on the 21st to restore order in the county and comfort the refugees, and will arrive in one or two days.

[Our Newspaper Xikou 21st Dispatch] It is reported that the approximately 160 men of Peng Chao's unit, the 5th Regiment of the Communist Army's Independent 2nd Brigade, have been successively harassing Baojiadian near Huanggang County from Luotian since the 10th of this month. After being intercepted by our security forces, this small group of Communist army has completely collapsed.

### Legend of Jingfang's Talk to Reporters: The Strategy for Suppressing Bandits in the Taihu Lake Area Emphasizes Appeasement and Giving Bandits a Chance to Turn Over a New Leaf

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 21st Dispatch] Major General Fu Jingfang, the commander of the bandit suppression in the Taihu Lake area, met with reporters alone today and said: The bandit suppression work is currently being actively prepared. The headquarters will be temporarily set up in Mudu Town, which belongs to the county, starting on the 22nd. Once the work has made progress, it will move to the Dongshan area. The jurisdiction covers nine counties, including Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujiang, Wujin, Yixing, Wuxing, Changxing, Guangde, and Xuancheng, spanning the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. However, the strength of the bandits is not as great as rumored. According to a confirmed investigation, the total number is no more than a thousand people. Among them, apart from a part of the New Fourth Army, very few are willing to be bandits. Most are scattered soldiers and vagrants who are forced to take risks due to their livelihood. The current government is broad-minded in everything. The government has also followed its original intention in dealing with the bandit suppression in Taihu Lake, and has instructed me to use virtue to influence people and emphasize appeasement. Therefore, the strategy for suppressing bandits is to eliminate the stubborn bandits who refuse to reform, but to give those who can repent a chance to turn over a new leaf, and allow them to choose whether to serve or return to farming, according to their wishes. The recent plan is to go to the counties under its jurisdiction in the next two or three days to inspect, exchange views with local authorities, determine the overall plan, and convene a security conference for the bandit suppression area in Suzhou on the 25th, attended by the county magistrates and military section chiefs of the five counties of Su, Xi, Wu, Wu, and Yi. As for the four counties of Wuxing and Changxing, due to the long distance, it is planned to hold a separate meeting in Wuxing. The bandit suppression period is scheduled to be completed by the end of October. For the sake of a permanent solution, it is decided to dispatch all local teams in the jurisdiction to launch operations in different areas at the same time. If necessary, mobile forces and regular troops will be requested to participate, so as to gradually tighten the encirclement and ensure that the bandits disappear and that security is maintained forever. We are truly determined to do this.

### UNRRA to Transport Railway Equipment to North China; Decides to Move and Repair Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun Railways

[Our Newspaper Nan　 Correspondent] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway starts from Hangzhou in the east, traverses Jiangxi through Jiangshan, and extends to Zhuzhou in Hunan, connecting with the Yuehan Railway, with a total length of 1008 kilometers. During the War of Resistance, more than 80% of the entire line was destroyed. This time, due to the difficulty in obtaining track and other equipment for transportation and restoration, all sections except those ordered will be repaired by Zhu Nengxing. According to a message from the Jiangxi Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Director Cai went to Shanghai to participate in the UNRRA meeting. Because the locomotives and tracks transported by UNRRA to Shanghai for use on various roads in North China could not be transported due to obstruction by the Communist army, he specially requested UNRRA to allocate this equipment to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun Railways so that they could be quickly repaired. UNRRA and the Ministry of Communications both strongly agreed, and all preparations are currently underway. The Nanxun Railway has a total length of 122 kilometers, and is managed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as a branch line. Because this road is the throat connecting Jiangxi to the Yangtze River, its importance is critical. Construction is currently underway in four sections, and it is expected to be open to traffic next spring. A large iron bridge will be built to cross the Gan River and connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, parallel to the Zhongzheng Bridge. The location will be between Lizhishe Niuhang or Chao Wangzhou, and is currently under investigation.

He also said that UNRRA is in negotiations with the Ministry of Communications on highway transportation cooperation, but no final decision has been made. Regarding the cooperation between UNRRA and companies such as China Merchants Bureau, it is also limited to providing ships for the companies to transport UNRRA materials, but the ships still belong to UNRRA.

### Editorial: The Final Stage of Reviewing the Municipal Budget

The Shanghai Municipal Council discussed the budget for the second half of this year yesterday afternoon, and the debate was extremely heated. It can be said that the conference has entered the most intense and important stage. Although the budget has not been approved due to the fact that the figures for some income and expenditure items are still awaiting the review reports of other groups for reference and discussion, judging from the budget review report submitted yesterday, it can be said that there will not be much change in the future. We would like to briefly state our feelings based on the reports of our reporters at the scene yesterday and the resolutions that have already been passed.

First of all, we believe that the spirit of the Municipal Council in reviewing and even discussing the budget is worthy of the support of the citizens. The review principles stated in the review report are: "For the revenue budget, those that are considered to be underestimated should be appropriately increased, and those that are improperly collected should be eliminated; for the expenditure budget, those that are considered to be administrative expenses should be appropriately reduced, and those that are considered to be business expenses should be listed in full." We believe that this is absolutely accurate. In particular, we believe that the Municipal Government has an unshirkable responsibility to diligently supervise and collect, rectify tax collection, eliminate embezzlement, and prevent fraud, so that tax revenue can be increased without increasing tax rates. We know that there are many donations and taxes now, and what the citizens pay is more than this number, and half of it goes into private pockets. Assuming that every drop can be returned to the public, it will definitely exceed the figures listed in the original budget. Therefore, the Municipal Government should do its best to rectify old taxes and increase revenue under the condition of not increasing new taxes. It must not intentionally underestimate income and form a deceptive situation. If it is truly used properly, and the income is insufficient, then it can be responsible for opening up new tax sources. As for expenditure, it should be used where it should be used, and saved where it should be saved. "Not a penny should fall into empty space" should be the principle followed by those who manage public expenditures. In particular, since the Municipal Council has expressed its full acceptance of the construction business expenses, the Municipal Government should do its best to streamline staff and administration and reduce its administrative expenses as much as possible, so as to alleviate the burden on the citizens, which should always be kept in mind by the Municipal Government.

Secondly, the Municipal Council's style of seeking truth from facts during discussions is also very commendable. They believe that the names of revenue donations and taxes are inappropriate or the season has passed, such as the collection of defense corps uniform fees and epidemic prevention fees from the housing donation, and they resolutely eliminated them, and would rather use other methods to make up for the shortfall. They believe that the collection of donations and taxes from citizens must be justified so that everyone can see at a glance what the taxes are used for. Now that the defense corps has been abolished early, and the summer epidemic prevention has also passed, what would be the citizens' impressions if they continue to be levied permanently under the housing donation? Of course, we know that after this elimination, the Municipal Government will receive seventeen or eight hundred million yuan less, and the citizens will still have to bear the responsibility of making up for it, but we agree with the Municipal Council's view that it is better to open up new tax sources so that we can understand what this new tax is used for.

Finally, we absolutely agree with the Municipal Council's attitude of not being overly demanding or letting go of the Municipal Government. The Council is preparing to reduce the original expenditure listed by the Municipal Government by more than 10.7 billion yuan. In addition to the proposed new expenditure and the eliminated income, the shortfall must be in the range of 23 billion yuan, which is 10 billion yuan less than the 33.3 billion yuan shortfall in the original plan of the cloth government. The Council's resolution authorizes the Municipal Government to investigate this reduced amount, and, on the principle of not reducing business expenses, make overall plans, consider the complexity of affairs, the number of redundant personnel, and do its best to reduce expenses in order to be suitable, without making rigid and binding regulations. We believe that this is very appropriate. This is the style of not being overly demanding. At the same time, the Council instructs the Municipal Government to recompile the budget within the scope of this resolution and send it to the Council for review in the shortest possible time, so as to serve as a guideline for future review and final accounts. In particular, the deadline for submitting the budget for the next fiscal year (the 36th year) is the end of November this year, which shows that it will never let go of its supervision of the Municipal Government's revenue and expenditure. The British often boast that their representative system first grasped the government's "power of the purse." In the initial stage of the Municipal Council's implementation of democratic politics in Shanghai, if it can adhere to this policy and continue to make progress, it can be said that it has found the pearl in the deep sea and is not far from the topic.

However, the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Government for the second half of this year is already behind schedule at this time of discussion, and it is only a test demonstration. How much is the total budget, and how to make up for it, and what new taxes to adopt, we still have to wait and see the Municipal Council's resolution tomorrow. We hope that the councilors will carefully and conscientiously fulfill their responsibilities.

### Important Resolutions of the Municipal Council Yesterday: Relief for Out-of-School Children, Increase Education Funding, Abolish Branch Agencies and Surcharges on Housing Damage Fees, Urge Acceleration of Land Value Tax Collection

[Report from our newspaper] How much revenue should the municipal government actually receive in the second half of this year? How much should it spend? How much will be deficient? And how will the deficient amount be made up? This important proposal, closely watched by four million citizens, unfolded in one of the most heated and brilliant debates at yesterday afternoon's general meeting. Although, due to time constraints, the specific figures and solutions for making up the deficit are still to be decided next Monday, several important principles have been successfully passed: (1) Education funding should be increased to at least 20% of the total budget, with particular emphasis on the universalization of national education. (2) The collection of land value tax should be actively promoted by the municipal government's Land Bureau, according to the teachings of the National Father, and must be completed within this year. (3) The defense corps uniform fees and summer epidemic prevention expenses attached to the housing damage fees should be immediately abolished. (4) The Housing Lease Management Committee is no longer necessary and should be abolished. (5) The Police Bureau's mobile patrol team should be abolished. (6) Allowances for councilors' transportation expenses should still be included, but those who voluntarily waive them should return them to the municipal treasury.

The original budget prepared by the municipal government showed a deficit of over 33.3 billion yuan. After careful review by the Ninth Subcommittee, additions were made where appropriate, and subtractions were made where appropriate. As a result, the deficit was reduced to over 20.3 billion yuan. The detailed figures submitted to the general meeting for discussion are shown in the following table: 1. Original Total Revenue Budget: 51,390,363,015 yuan

Add: Proposed Increase in Revenue Budget: 3,756,100,000 yuan

Total: 55,146,463,015 yuan 2. Original Total Expenditure Budget: 84,717,521,800 yuan

Less: (A) Proposed Discretionary Reductions in Budgeted Amounts: 2,395,361,050 yuan

(B) Purchase and Repair Costs Reduced by 30% of Original Budget: 506,364,000 yuan

(C) General Administrative Expenses Reduced by 15% of Original Budget: 7,875,901,494 yuan

Add: Proposed New Expenditure Budget: 1,556,000,000 yuan

Total: 75,495,895,256 yuan 3. Revenue-Expenditure Deficit: 20,349,432,241 yuan

Xu Yongzuo Reports on Review Results and Explains Additions and Subtractions in Detail

Xu Yongzuo, the accountant and convener of the Ninth Subcommittee, not only reported on the committee's review process but also explained the above figures in detail. The proposed increases in revenue were based on the actual collection of existing tax sources in the first half of the year, with appropriate adjustments. Specifically, license plate tax revenue was increased by one-fold compared to the original budget, banquet and entertainment tax revenue increased by 10%, new vehicle registration fee revenue increased by 50%, slaughter tax revenue increased by one-fold, sanitation revenue increased by 20%, public utility company compensation increased by 10%, and tuition and teacher appreciation fees were reduced by the teacher appreciation fee portion. On the expenditure side, the recurring departments eliminated were (1) Housing Lease Management Committee expenses and (2) Police Bureau mounted patrol expenses. Reductions were made in subsidies and assistance expenditures. Temporary departments reduced were (1) Municipal Council meeting expenses, (2) Municipal Government Secretariat gazette printing and advertising costs, (3) Housing Lease Management Committee purchase and repair costs, (4) Education Bureau vehicle fuel costs, (5) private school and agency subsidies, and (6) Public Utilities Bureau electrical equipment costs. Eliminated was the establishment cost of the Municipal Civilian Hospital.

Xu particularly pointed out that this budget, both in its preparation and review, felt rough due to time constraints. However, the council's review of the budget differs from that of accounting or auditing agencies, as it can only focus on the big picture and make general increases or decreases. It should not be too rigid to avoid difficulties in implementation.

After the report, the general meeting began to discuss the review results. During the discussion, Speaker Pan summarized the opinions of the councilors, harshly criticized the current tax system and certain unreasonable administrative practices, and, amidst the most enthusiastic applause in the entire venue, passed several important decisions.

Discussion of Education Funding

The first issue raised was education funding. According to the draft constitution, education funding should account for at least 30% of local total expenditure. However, after the review committee's reductions, it accounts for only 19% of the total budget, which is insufficient. Zhou Feicheng was the first to appeal to the general meeting, pointing out the importance of education in China today and arguing that education funding should have an independent nature and should be increased to at least 20% of the total budget. Jiang Jizhou, Sun Zhenchun, Cen Zhiliang, and others also added their opinions, especially highlighting the large number of children out of school today and emphasizing the urgent need to establish more national schools. How can funding be reduced?

Speaker Issues Conclusion

The speaker gave a clear conclusion to this issue, saying: "Education is certainly the most important. The current percentage of education funding is too low. We propose that the municipal government revise the budget to increase education funding to at least 20% of the total budget, making overall adjustments from various expenses. Special attention should be paid to the universalization of national education, and the Education Bureau should focus on national education. When so many children today still do not have the opportunity to study, many unnecessary and non-urgent things should not be done. For example, drama schools and the like can be closed down. We must first solve the problem of children out of school. We have no spare money to run ornaments!" His proposal was unanimously passed amidst enthusiastic applause.

Outdated Police Facilities: Mounted Patrol Team Decided to Abolish, Defense Corps Uniform Fees and Epidemic Prevention Expenses Simultaneously Voted to Abolish

The defense corps uniform fees and epidemic prevention expenses attached to the housing damage fees were still included in this budget. During the discussion, Shen Ding proposed their cancellation, arguing that since there is already a revenue-expenditure deficit and new sources of revenue must be found, all such nominal or outdated taxes should be abolished. The vote resulted in a majority in favor of cancellation, thereby reducing revenue by 1.8 billion yuan, which will be added to the deficit for separate planning.

Regarding the issue of the Police Bureau's mounted patrol team, Director Xuan sent a letter to the council yesterday, briefly stating that the city of Shanghai has a vast area and rugged roads, and the mounted patrol team's suppression effect is the most significant. He requested that the team be maintained for the sake of public order. During the discussion, some argued that the mounted patrol team is an outdated police facility, while others pointed out that the Police Bureau only established the mounted patrol team because it had received a batch of enemy-property horses. In fact, Shanghai does not need such a mounted team. Some advocated for its retention but proposed that it be stationed in the suburbs. The vote resulted in only fourteen votes in favor of retention, and the resolution was to abolish it.

The last interesting discussion was about the councilors' own transportation expenses. When it was first proposed, many councilors said they did not want to take this fee and wanted to remove it from the budget. Suddenly, Deputy Speaker Xu Lao spoke, saying: "Although we do not actually care about this transportation fee, since there is a regulation, we do not need to be polite." Fei Shusheng believed that this issue should not be discussed or voted on at all. This is a regulation of the council's organization and the rights that councilors should enjoy. Unless they are willing to waive it themselves, even if the entire body passes a resolution not to include this fee in the budget, he personally will still take it from the municipal government.

The case was therefore no longer discussed, and if there are volunteers to waive it, the council will return it to the municipal treasury.

Suggestions Made on Municipal Government Budget in Three Points

Before discussing the specific budget figures, the speaker temporarily put forward several important suggestions:

(1) The council's reduction of budget expenditure is only a decision on the total amount. As for how to weigh the distribution, the municipal government should plan comprehensively, consider the complexity of affairs, the number of personnel, break away from favoritism, and independently decide on measures to reduce staff and simplify administration.

(2) After this budget is approved by the council, the municipal government should revise the budget in the shortest possible time based on the resolution for verification.

(3) The budget for the 36th year [of the Republic] should be sent to the council together with reference materials before the end of November of this year, and it should be submitted for discussion at the second general meeting to avoid temporary constraints and inadequate review.

These three suggestions were unanimously passed.

Two Temporary Motions

At the council meeting yesterday morning, the temporary motion proposed by councilors Feng Youzhen and others was discussed: "As winter is approaching, it is proposed to consult with the municipal government to quickly issue a temporary relief fund of 105,567,000 yuan to purchase winter clothing for children in distress in a timely manner. Is this appropriate? Please put it to a vote." Because the Caohejing children's shelter houses 1,700 children in distress, expenses are enormous, and funding is urgently needed. The general meeting passed a resolution: "Please allocate funds from the municipal government within the scope of the budget to purchase as a priority."

Another temporary motion was proposed by Zhang Zhongyuan and others: "Suggest that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, regarding the factories taken over from enemy puppets, should change their brand names and decorations if they continue to produce products in order to correct public perception." The speaker said: "The Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken over many factories with many products. Please consider this carefully." Some councilors believed that changing the brand names of all enemy puppet factories taken over might be inconvenient. Li Wenjie said: "For example, the Indanthrene produced by De Fu Yanghang has been widely adopted by society. If it is also changed, it will be quite obstructive." As a result, the general meeting decided to withdraw the case.

Failure to Collect Land Value Tax: Councilors Rise Up to Criticize, Special Effort Should Be Made to Supervise the Collection of Old Taxes as a Way to Increase Revenue, and the Embezzlement and Corruption of Tax Collectors Must Be Eradicated

Why the collection of land value tax still cannot be actively carried out has been the most intense criticism from the councilors. Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Bureau, was again asked to come on stage to explain, saying: "The collection of land value tax must first require the completion of land registration. Because Shanghai was a concession in the past, the situation is more complicated, and it can only be handled district by district. This spring, the Land Administration of the Ministry of Finance sent people to discuss a plan with the municipal government and approved funding of 3 billion yuan, which is expected to be completed in the second half of the year. However, this funding has not been received until now, and the municipal government only raises more than 10 million yuan per month to cope, so it cannot be completed quickly. It is hoped that after this budget is approved, a portion can be collected within this year."

Qu Yue walked onto the podium to express his opinion. He believed that they cannot always wait. A transitional method can be set to collect taxes on land that has not been surveyed. The speaker at this time again gave a pertinent and insightful speech, saying: "In addition to opening up new taxes, we should strive to supervise the collection of old taxes as a way to increase revenue. Under the principle of not increasing the tax rate, we can increase revenue. The budgeted income listed now is not necessarily reliable. Many of them may enter the pockets of tax collectors. This situation of embezzlement and corruption must be effectively eliminated. As for land tax, there are clear provisions in the National Father's teachings. Now we should first set a transitional method to collect it." Therefore, he suggested that "The municipal government should order the competent authorities to work hard to supervise the collection of all principled taxes, eradicate embezzlement and corruption, and especially collect land value tax as soon as possible to increase revenue."

Zhan Wenbian added to the speaker's opinion. He felt that under the current unreasonable tax situation, the real burden is borne by the common people. People with real estate may not be unwilling to bear it. The blame lies with the government's incompetence! Therefore, he wanted the Land Bureau to take responsibility and show its ability to sort out the situation in these six months no matter what.

Gu Jinzao believed that the method of household registration is cumbersome and time-consuming and should be improved. Jiang Pingfan advocated that the Land Bureau should immediately handle it according to the bidding method in the National Father's teachings. Xu Yongzuo believed that the bidding procedure would probably take a year and a half to complete, and a transitional method should be set first to truly achieve the goal of immediately increasing tax revenue.

Finally, summarizing everyone's opinions, the principle was passed to suggest that the municipal government order the Land Bureau to actively promote the collection of land value tax, which must be completed within this year.

Special Cash Guarantee: Recommend Adoption by the Central Government

Regarding proposal No. 9 in the gold series, which recommends the adoption of a special cash guarantee system, after being submitted to the Fourth and Tenth Groups for review, it was slightly revised, and Article 3 of the original rules was abolished. The review opinion was to recommend the adoption of the special cash guarantee system by the central government, and the original proposed plan was submitted to the central government for reference. The general meeting resolved to adopt the review opinion.

Widespread Establishment of Dental Treatment Institutions, Establishment of Free Artificial Beds

The Municipal Council held its 19th meeting yesterday morning and continued to discuss proposals related to health and society. Most of them were passed smoothly.

Regarding the health proposals, No. 7: "Please ask the municipal government to establish dental treatment institutions to improve the health of citizens." The determined method is: "Each municipal hospital should also set up a dental department: First, to provide general treatment for those with dental diseases. Second, to assist in the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to various departments." Passed the resolution. No. 8 "Please ask the municipal government to instruct the city police bureau to protect the physical freedom of medical technicians." Passed without objection. No. 9: "Please ask the municipal government to set up free hospital beds for industrial workers to improve worker health." Delete the words "industrial" in the title and pass. No. 10: "Compulsory vaccination against smallpox", passed without objection.

Promote Labor-Management Cooperation, Develop National Industry

Regarding proposals on social relief and labor, the 7th Review Subcommittee summarized them as the 12th case, of which Social Affairs Proposal No. 2: "Promote labor-management cooperation and develop the national industry" was amended and passed by the general meeting. The decided methods include running labor-management cooperative factories, fairly handling labor-management disputes, and implementing factory meetings.

Social Affairs Proposal No. 3 is "Improve the distribution system and suppress prices." The review opinion is "It is proposed that the general meeting pass it and send it to the municipal government for implementation." Mayor Wu asked the speaker to allow him to explain this point, briefly stating: "I absolutely agree with the distribution system, but the current difficulty is that the government authorities cannot fully control transportation, and the city government's materials are not enough for universal distribution. For example, for food rice, merchants are now freely transporting and selling on the one hand, and the city government has a large amount of food rice that can be sold at any time to suppress rice prices on the other hand. If all is distributed by the city government, there may be a risk of panic at present. Please consider carefully." Feng Youzhen proposed that it be sent to the municipal government for deliberation and implementation, and the resolution was passed.

Add Public Pawnshops, Reduce Interest Rates

Social Affairs No. 4, the reason for the case is "Because the monthly interest rate of the pawn industry is huge and the term is short, it is proposed that the municipal authorities re-stipulate and order compliance to help the poor and stabilize society." After discussion by the councilors, it was believed that the interest rate should be reduced as much as possible and stipulated by the Social Affairs Bureau. If there are practical difficulties, the municipal government's competent authorities should borrow low-interest loans from the National Bank or the City Bank to subsidize it. The term is temporarily set at six months, and at maturity, interest payment and transfer tickets are allowed. At the same time, public pawnshops should be added, and the interest rate should not exceed one dime. The municipal government's competent authorities should borrow low-interest loans from the National Bank or the City Bank to operate them. The locations for operation should be mainly in civilian residential areas.

Social Affairs No. 5, "It is proposed that the municipal government handle farmers' welfare undertakings, prosper the countryside, and transfer a part of the Shanghai Economic Agricultural Products received to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as a demonstration agricultural product." Amended and passed. No. 6 "The National Compulsory Labor Law should be promoted to assist in the development of suburban areas." The general meeting resolved that "The Interim Council has already made a resolution on this case, urging the municipal government to implement it." No. 7 "Actively rescue unemployed workers." Six methods were proposed, and the general meeting passed them without objection.

Rebuild Morality, Shift Trends

Social Affairs No. 8 "Rebuild morality, shift social trends, and practice the New Life Movement as an urgent task." Tong Daoyun proposed that the point of "advocating early markets" should be added to the case, and he explained the relationship between getting up early and physical health and saving electricity. Most councilors believed that the regulations already had a provision for "advocating early markets" and did not need to be repeated, so it was not passed. Zhao Yangxiong argued that a clause should be added to the regulations to "Please ask the municipal government to increase the appropriation for the New Life Movement," because the New Life Movement focuses on publicity work, and nothing can be done without money. When the speaker put this point to a vote, Zhao Yangxiong stood up again and said: "Please pay attention, everyone. If you do not agree to add this method, then this case will be meaningless." The majority of the votes passed. Finally, the general meeting resolved to send it to the municipal government to be forwarded to the New Life Movement Promotion Association for earnest implementation. The regulations also stipulate that the first week of each month is the New Life Patrol Week, and all officials and civilians should abide by it, banning all bad films and improper entertainment, etc.

Social Affairs No. 9, the reason for the case is "It is proposed to strengthen social relief undertakings to realize the social policy of the Three Principles of the People." A total of eight points were listed, which were amended and passed by the general meeting.

Eighty-Six Votes Caused the Abolition: The Fate of the Housing Lease Management Committee Decided

When the Ninth Group held its last budget review meeting on the evening of the 19th, Convener Xu Yongzuo reported on the review results, believing that "in order to save money," all municipal government agencies that could be reduced or abolished should be abolished, so the "Housing Lease Management Committee" was also listed as being abolished. At that time, it aroused the opposition of Zhu Fojiu, the convener of the Tenth Group, who believed that the expenses of the Housing Lease Management Committee were extremely limited. If it was abolished, the severance pay and other expenses would leave little left, and the committee's mediation of housing lease disputes was indeed necessary. However, most of the people present advocated cancellation. At the same time, according to Speaker Pan, no matter how much money was saved, this agency should be abolished if it was not indispensable in fact. As a result, this case was stipulated to be reserved for discussion at the general meeting.

Thus, at yesterday's budget discussion meeting, the issue of abolishing the Housing Lease Management Committee once again aroused a heated debate. The result was that the committee should "die a natural death." However, the discussion of this case was very exciting, creating the most lively and tense scene at yesterday's meeting.

Before the speaker prepared to put it to a vote, Tao Baichuan first explained that this issue had taken a lot of time to study when the Tenth Group reviewed the regulations. According to the law, there was a reason for the existence of this committee, and the committee's expenses accounted for only 7/1000 of the total budget. He insisted that it could not be put to a vote immediately before the convener Zhu Fojiu explained it and before the general meeting debated it. However, the speaker reported that after he and Mayor Wu talked, the mayor believed that the Housing Lease Management Committee had no legal basis and could be abolished. Because labor disputes were not accepted by the court, a labor dispute arbitration committee was established. However, housing lease disputes can be accepted by the court, so there is no need to set up another agency, and the council can just abolish it. But according to Zhu Fojiu's statement, there are a very large number of housing lease dispute cases. Although the court can accept them, it will definitely take a long time. It may take a year to handle a case. At the same time, the committee's expenses are only 130 million yuan, less than 7/1000 of the total budget, so the impact on the budget is minimal. Finally, according to the law, before the constitution is implemented, according to the rules for sorting out current laws and regulations of the National Government in the 32nd year of the Republic, for local required laws and regulations, the order of the chairman of the National Defense Supreme Committee has the same effect as laws and regulations. Although the local required laws and regulations have been passed by the local authorities, the legislative procedure should still be completed, but they are still valid before the completion. The mayor said that there is no legal basis, and he hopes that the mayor will study it again. So his conclusion is (1) There is absolutely a legal basis, (2) The expenses are not much, (3) If the current Housing Lease Management Committee's organization is unsatisfactory, it can be thoroughly reformed in the future.

Then Qu Yue said: I have no grudges against the Housing Lease Management Committee, but the establishment of this committee has no legal basis. The Housing Lease Management Committee was established based on the wartime housing lease regulations. Now that the regulations have been revoked, the management committee should also be abolished. Later, someone proposed to reserve it for discussion on Monday, and Miao Jingzhou opposed, saying: An item of 7/1000 still needs to be postponed to Monday for discussion, and I don't know when the entire budget will be discussed. As a result, with a majority of eighty-six votes in favor of cancellation, the fate of the Housing Lease Management Committee was decided, and the committee's fifty-eight employees and twelve workers will also be laid off.

Congratulations to the Head of State on His Sixtieth Birthday: Telegraph the Whole Country to Hold It Unanimously

Social Affairs Proposal No. 1 is a proposal to launch a mass organization from this council to organize a preparatory committee to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of the head of state, establish a permanent memorial, and show respect for virtue and gratitude. Yesterday, it was passed by a majority of 101 votes, and four measures were decided: (1) This council will send a letter to all mass organizations in the city to organize a preparatory committee to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of the head of state. (2) This council will send two representatives to participate in the preparatory committee. (The general meeting decided to elect the speaker and deputy speaker to participate.) (3) The preparatory committee will refer to the example of donating aircrafts to celebrate the fiftieth birthday and devise a celebration method and establish a more meaningful permanent memorial. (4) Telegraph the councils of all provinces and cities to proceed unanimously.

Participation in the Investigation Team: Work Report of Five Councilors

Five councilors Zhao Junhao, He Yuanming, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Jian'e, and Ma Junshuo, who participated in the investigation team's office, reported to the council's general meeting yesterday, saying: "We and others were assigned to attend the receiving and handling work investigation team and participate in the work. We received the team's appointment letter on the 16th of this month and went to report on the morning of the next day. We attended the team's regular meeting for the first time on the 18th. We and others believe that this council is the local representative body of public opinion in Shanghai, and the future investigation work should be targeted at local agencies as more reasonable. After consulting with the team leader, we were instructed that since we have joined the team's work, we are one of the team members and do not need to make rigid regulations. However, we will be assigned local cases for processing as much as possible in the future when distributing work. On the same day, it was also decided to handle two important cases: (1) The case of the city government receiving enemy puppet vehicles and handing them over to Wantai for discounted repairs, (2) The case of the city government selling 4.2 billion yuan of goods from the Central Market. The above two cases had been decided at the last meeting to be sent to the court for investigation. After the meeting, the secretary reported and formally made a resolution. We and others did not express our opinions because we were attending for the first time and the facts were unclear. Later, the team leader designated Wang Jian'e, Ma Junshuo, and He Yuanming to review the entire file of the second case and study it from a legal perspective. All agreed that this case involved more administrative actions and should be handled by the original investigator paying attention to the relevant legal parts. The organization of the first group of the investigation team is three members, namely Zhang Tuanchang Zhiben, Cheng Supervisor Zhongxing, and Wu Committee Wangji, etc. Later, Zhang Committee Qingzhen and Fan Committee Zhengbo joined, so the number of people has increased by two more than the stipulated organization. We and others joined as councilors, so there seems to be a distinction in our duties. In terms of nature, we are only in an assisting position. Since the first group of the investigation team started working in Shanghai, it has been sending letters to the receiving agencies to request receiving reports and instructing them to prepare receiving registers so that they can be called up at any time. Currently, 69 units have submitted reports, and only the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the War Criminals Management Office have not responded. As for the people's secret reports, as of September 19, there were 313 cases, which are listed as follows:

48 cases of secret reports about housing and land disputes, 26 cases of secret reports about receiving corruption, 32 cases of secret reports about improper or illegal corruption in handling enemy puppet goods, 33 cases of secret reports about concealing enemy puppet goods, 43 cases of secret reports about the processing bureau not issuing bonuses, 45 cases of secret reports about requesting the return of occupied property, and 86 cases of miscellaneous secret reports about various corruptions. According to Secretary Xu Longchuan's oral report, the above cases have been processed, and about 80% of the initial investigations have been completed. We and others joined the work in the stage when the investigation team is about to end, so we will no longer re-investigate the cases that have been processed. In fact, we have no right to re-investigate. In the future, we will work under the leadership of the team leader and plan to rotate to the meeting to handle affairs after the adjournment of this council meeting. However, there is no clear regulation on the deadline for the investigation. We and others are very willing to make a concrete report at the next report, and we hope that the speaker, deputy speaker, and all the other members will give instructions and supervision at any time."

### After Wallace's Resignation

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace resigned the day before yesterday. This was not unexpected news. After Wallace delivered a speech in New York and published his letter to President Truman dated August 23 in various U.S. newspapers, not only did it make Secretary of State Byrnes, who was in Paris, feel very uneasy, but also Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Secretary of the Army Patterson felt dissatisfied. They had to jointly send a letter to President Truman, stating that no one in the U.S. Army and Navy departments was planning to take preemptive measures against the Soviet Union. The discrepancies in opinions within the U.S. government were completely exposed, which would inevitably affect the U.S.'s international standing, especially hitting the Paris Peace Conference hard, which would force President Truman to make a choice. Wallace's resignation was obviously the result of President Truman's choice.

President Truman explained the reasons for requesting Wallace's resignation, saying: "The government supports the foreign policy adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes. While citizens are absolutely free to express their disagreement with the government's policies, the government itself must maintain consistency. Now, Minister Wallace has a 'fundamental conflict' with the government, which is very obvious. The only solution is for Mr. Wallace to resign. At the same time, I also believe that he would rather freely express his opinions as a citizen." It is widely rumored that Wallace's resignation was due to Secretary of State Byrnes requesting the President to state his position, and that Wallace was forced to resign. Although this statement has been denied by the White House, in any case, President Truman's decision this time felt like there was no other way to go, and he had to make this decision.

Wallace's resignation will undoubtedly have a far-reaching impact on U.S. domestic and foreign policy. Although Secretary of State Byrnes's foreign policy has gained President Truman's support, leading to the dismissal of opponent Wallace, it cannot be immediately seen as a victory for Byrnes. Because Wallace was the only remaining minister from President Roosevelt's New Deal era and has always been regarded as the successor to the New Deal. His published speeches and advocacy will have some supporters within the United States, especially the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). According to a statement issued by the CIO's Political Action Committee, Minister Wallace's forced resignation is a major blow to freedom and peace in the United States. At the same time, Wallace himself also stated after announcing his resignation: "I am determined to continue to fight for peace, and I believe that the American people can join the struggle I lead with the heroic spirit of the late President Roosevelt." Based on this, Wallace's departure will inevitably have some significant impact on the House of Representatives elections in early winter this year.

However, if we examine U.S. party politics, we can see that the political path Wallace will take in the future is also a serious question. Because for more than a hundred years in the United States, there have only been two major political parties, the Democratic and Republican parties, and a third party has not yet grown. About thirty years ago, Senator La Follette attempted to form a third party, which was the Progressive Party, but its influence was limited to the state of Wisconsin. In addition, there is also a Labor Party, but except for the state of New York, it does not have members in other states, so it is also difficult to become a powerful third party. Let us assume that Wallace will rely on the support of the CIO Political Action Committee, but the general American people regard the CIO as an organ of the Communist Party, so it seems difficult to gain the support of the majority of the American people.

Although the internal divisions within the U.S. government have become unified due to Wallace's resignation, how the United States can create world peace is still the most serious problem at present. Wallace gave a speech after his resignation, saying: "I do not believe in dividing the earth into two worlds, and I will continue to advocate the principle of living in one world. There is no peace except for 'One World.'" He also criticized the Truman administration's foreign policy errors, saying that it failed to recognize the "basic facts" that caused the two world wars, and now it is threatening a third world war, but the third world war will be a "nuclear war." This serious warning is indeed worth pondering by President Truman and Byrnes. But how can the United States create a "One World" world without splitting into two blocs? This is another question worth studying. In his letter to President Truman, Wallace actually declared that some people in the U.S. Army and Navy were planning to use "preemptive" measures against the Soviet Union. No one would believe such remarks, and they have already been denied by the two secretaries of the Army and Navy, which shows that this is just Wallace's sensitivity or fantasy. We believe that farsighted politicians should not have this fantasy in the first place, let alone casually publish it. Because the existence of this kind of fantasy can easily cause unfortunate disasters, not only will international cooperation be hindered and unable to be realized, but also the suspicion and misunderstanding between the great powers will become deeper and deeper, and will never be eliminated.

Correction: In yesterday's editorial of this newspaper, "Why Must Monks Misunderstand in Temples," in the sixth line of the third paragraph, the two characters "zi you" are a mistake for "zi wu." We hereby correct it.

### U.S. and Soviet Leaders Will Not Meet Before the Peace Conference Reaches a Reasonable Result - White House Press Secretary Ross Announced Yesterday

[This Newspaper News] Washington, Emergency Broadcast from Paris on the 21st: White House Press Secretary Ross announced this morning: The statement that President Truman will directly meet with Stalin if the Paris Peace Conference fails to achieve reasonable peace is not true. Ross also stated that since Wallace's resignation, Truman has not received any information from Byrnes. As for Wallace's successor, it will not be announced today.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] It has only been a few months since President Truman ordered Interior Secretary Ickes to resign voluntarily, and now Secretary of Commerce Wallace has been ordered to resign. Wallace was the only remaining minister from the late President Roosevelt's New Deal era, and now he has also left the Truman administration. It is not yet known what political path he will take in the future. For decades, the United States has only had two major political parties, which are limited to the state of Wisconsin. In addition, there is also a Labor Party, but it has no members except in the state of New York. Wallace may later rely on the support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations Political Action Committee, which is almost certain. However, Americans will regard the CIO as an organ of the Communist Party. It is not yet known whether Wallace will move to New York or remain in Washington.

### After Wallace Leaves the Cabinet, U.S. Diplomacy Returns to Normal, Various Committees of the Peace Conference Continue to Meet, and Byrnes Resumes His Active Posture

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The departure of Secretary of Commerce Wallace from the Cabinet has had an impact, causing Secretary of State Byrnes, who is far away in Paris, to become more active. However, the government's foreign policy is still vaguely in a fog. For this reason, senior State Department officials are currently considering launching several speeches to clarify to the American people and the world what President Truman meant when he said that there would be no change in U.S. foreign policy. There are now several opportunities to use to discuss national policy, namely (1) when the United Nations General Assembly meets in New York on October 23, Truman will preside over the opening ceremony and deliver a speech, (2) Byrnes may return to the country from Paris in mid-October and will probably also give a speech. Byrnes has received invitations from all sides to speak on foreign policy. According to responsible diplomatic figures, President Truman's final decision to ask Wallace to resign has allowed U.S. diplomacy to return to normal. This move has the following important meanings: it allows the country to know that the government is not embarking on Wallace's so-called Green Fat Peaceful Policy, and it also makes Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and other representatives of the Peace Conference understand that Byrnes has Truman's 100% support and is the leader of U.S. foreign policy today.

[This Newspaper News] Paris Broadcast on the 21st: The Soviet delegation's attempt to prevent the inclusion of the establishment of the South Tyrol Autonomous Region in the treaty with Italy was rejected. The vote was thirteen to six. Byrnes had not attended the Peace Conference for several days after Wallace's speech, but has now resumed his active posture.

[This Newspaper News] Paris Broadcast on the 21st: Estonian Foreign Minister Kroll presented the issue of the Baltic countries at the meeting for the first time today, praising Russia for incorporating Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Paris, 21st] At today's meeting of the Peace Conference, the disputes caused by the issue of the Port of Trieste and Czechoslovakia's demands seemed to be coming to an end. The political and territorial parts of the draft treaty with Bulgaria were actually completed yesterday, so the representatives can focus on discussing the treaties with Italy and Romania today. The political and territorial issues involved in the treaties with Finland and Romania have been drafted in advance. The Italian Territory Committee changed its discussion to the future international government of the Port of Trieste.

### U.S. Secretary of Commerce Post Temporarily Held by Hettle

[U.S. News Agency, Washington, 20th] Current U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Hettle will take over as Acting Secretary of Commerce, replacing Wallace, who resigned at the request of President Truman. Mr. Hettle is currently giving speeches in various places and will return to Washington today.

### British Fleet Begins Autumn Maneuvers in the Mediterranean, Greece and Malta Are Assumed Targets

[Reuters, British Cruiser Moretheshes, 20th] The British Mediterranean Fleet has begun its autumn maneuvers. The fleet attacked a convoy sailing towards "Malaya" (actually Greece) at night. The convoy departed from "Colombo" (actually Malta). The fleet consisted of the cruiser "English Theshes" and "Li Ente," two destroyers, two submarines, and a squadron of small boats. The "enemy" convoy consisted of the cruiser "Fub," "Liverpool," the aircraft carrier "Ocean," destroyers, and other escort ships, which was stronger than our side. A torpedo launched by our submarine "Danvale" hit the aircraft carrier Ocean.

### Wallace Delivers Broadcast Speech, Determined to Fight for Peace, Uphold the Concept of "One World," Praises Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy

[United Press, Washington, 20th] After resigning as Secretary of Commerce, Wallace broadcasted this morning, stating: "Fighting for peace is more important than high-ranking positions and generous salaries, and more important than the concerns of partisan politics. I promised President Truman on Wednesday that I would not speak for the time being. The President's actions this time have restored my freedom of speech. Some points in my speech at Madison Square Garden have caused great misunderstandings, and should be corrected." Wallace continued, "I will continue to fight for peace, and I hope that people across the nation will join this sacred task. Our current foreign policy does not recognize reality. This reality has quickly led to two world wars, and there is now a risk of another war, and this time it will be a war with atomic bombs. As far back as fifteen years ago, I advocated the One World policy. I do not believe in two worlds. Unless we are in one world, we cannot achieve peace. What I want to make clear again is that I oppose all imperialism and aggression, whether it comes from the Soviet Union, Britain, or the United States. At the same time, it must be stated that the concept of One World must be firmly upheld. If it is necessary to adopt regionalism to give the economic and political reality of the world an implementation method, the interests of small countries must also be taken into account, just as the small countries in the Western Hemisphere enjoy under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy. The success of any policy ultimately depends on the trust and will of the people."

### Democratic Party Split Affects Next Election

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Democratic Senator Pepper said tonight that Secretary of Commerce Wallace's resignation may have far-reaching effects on the country and the Democratic Party. Former Interior Secretary Ickes also said that the President's inconsistency is detrimental to his personal dignity. According to Ickes, he was also forced to resign earlier this year due to a similar political turmoil. The National Citizens Political Action Committee, which sponsored Wallace's speech, also issued a statement today, saying that Wallace's forced resignation is a major blow to progressive elements in the country. Progressives and independents have lost a powerful spokesperson in the government. There is now no leader in the cabinet who opposes a tough foreign policy, which shows that our country is gradually heading towards the path of war.

[This Newspaper News] San Francisco Broadcast on the 21st: Wallace's resignation immediately made all parties speculate whether he would split the Democratic Party and form a third party. However, well-informed sources believe that Wallace will strive for the victory of liberal ideas within the Democratic Party. All parties believe that Wallace's departure from the cabinet will allow the Republican Party to win in the next election because the Democratic Party camp has been split.

### Soviet Union Uses Veto Power in the Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 20th] The United Nations Security Council's U.S. representative proposed sending a three-person team to conduct an on-site investigation into the border disputes in northern Greece, which received eight votes in favor, but was vetoed by the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union's proposal to keep the Greek complaint case on the Security Council's agenda was also rejected by nine votes to two. The case is no longer on the agenda, at least temporarily.

### U.S. Position on Controlling Atomic Energy Remains Unchanged

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 20th] U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee Baruch issued a brief statement last night, saying that the international atomic energy control plan proposed by the United States has not changed. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace discussed the U.S. position on atomic energy control in his letter to President Truman, believing that the U.S.'s demands were too high. When asked about this, Baruch issued the above statement in response.

### Red Army Renamed Soviet Army

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th, United Press] According to a notification from the Soviet military government to the U.S. military government, the Soviet government stipulates that the names of the Red Army and Red Navy should be changed to Soviet Army and Soviet Navy. The notification did not mention the Red Air Force.

### Rumors of Soviet Troops Stationed Outside the Port of Trieste

Yugoslavia Encourages Terrorist Activities in the Port of Trieste, U.S. and British Replies to Protests Released Simultaneously

[United Press, Rome, 21st] According to news from the Port of Trieste, two Soviet divisions have been stationed around Gebzana, 45 miles northeast of Trieste, in Yugoslavia, but this has not yet been confirmed here.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The United States today gave Yugoslavia another diplomatic blow regarding the recent disturbances in the Port of Trieste, and publicly stated to Marshal Tito that the U.S. government is still waiting for Yugoslavia to compensate for the loss of life and property caused by the shooting down of a U.S. transport plane by Yugoslav fighter jets. The State Department announced that the U.S. has submitted a reply to Tito's two protests regarding the conflict between Yugoslav and American troops in the Port of Trieste, rejecting them and stating that Yugoslavia should bear this responsibility. At the same time, it accused Yugoslavia of failing to cooperate in maintaining order in the Port of Trieste and of encouraging terrorist activities by pro-Yugoslav elements.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] After Yugoslavia twice notified Britain and the United States, accusing the Ming, the ruler of the Via region, of mistreating Yugoslav officers and soldiers, the British government sent a letter to the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th of this month. The content was released simultaneously in Washington and London today. The statement stated that the allegations in the Yugoslav notification are either fabricated or exaggerated. Yugoslav officials have repeatedly caused trouble, and Yugoslavia should bear the responsibility.

### King George II of Greece Prepares to Return Home

Macedonian Bridge Blown Up

[This Newspaper News] Paris Broadcast on the 21st: Officials are keeping the news of King George II's return to the country a secret to avoid unexpected incidents. However, sources revealed that the King will probably take a special plane from England today, and two Greek destroyers will meet him in Malta.

[This Newspaper News] Athens Broadcast from Paris on the 21st: The El Taoro Goli Bridge was blown up by "bandits," and traffic between Macedonia and Serie was interrupted as a result.

### Corruption in Soviet Collective Farms, Stalin Openly Admits, Large-Scale Fraud and Embezzlement of Public Property Are Commonplace

[United Press, Moscow, 20th] The Soviet government today frankly admitted to large-scale fraud and incompetence in collective farms, believing that this illegal behavior damages the institutions of socialist countries. Stalin issued a notice in the name of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, emphasizing that the abuse of collective farms has expanded and ordered the immediate cessation of illegal occupation, and those who violate the law will be punished according to law. The Truth Daily's editorial stated that this action has the greatest political effect, harms, and betrays Lenin's doctrine. At the same time, Communist Party Inspection Committee Secretary Zidanov also issued a notice, listing regular examples of violations of collective farm rules, saying that farm managers illegally occupied part of the public property for their own benefit. Farm workers cannot obtain appropriate wages, so they steal livestock, grain, fodder, milk, butter, meat, honey, fruits, and vegetables. In most collective farms, managers are rampant, while there is a lack of work in the fields.

[United Press, Moscow, 20th] Moscow newspapers revealed today that Soviet communism is now encountering an unprecedentedly serious threat in history, which threatens the entire foundation of the Soviet Union. At the same time, there are signs of large-scale purges. The orders signed by Stalin and Shidanov revealed that serious cracks have occurred in the Soviet collective agricultural system, because in fact most Soviet citizens have secretly transformed from the collective property system to the private property system.

### Pacific Typhoon

[United Press News, Guam, 21st] Today, the Mariana Islands were hit by a typhoon, with gusts of wind reaching 100 miles per hour, sweeping over Guam and Hanban Island, causing millions of dollars in damage, but so far, no deaths or injuries have been reported.

### English Channel Waves 60 Feet High

[Reuters, London, 20th] The English Channel was hit by a storm yesterday, with waves up to 60 feet high.

### Days Grow Shorter, Nights Grow Longer: Supply Becomes More Difficult; Urges Conservation of Electricity: Electric Power Company Issues Another Emergency Notice; Prepares to Adopt Expanded Restriction Measures

The Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the approaching winter and the increased electricity needs of citizens, yesterday issued another emergency notice, separately notifying all users that it is preparing to adopt expanded restriction measures for ordinary users, and the supply of electricity for winter heating may also be suspended. A reporter from the East China News Agency learned from the municipal electricity authorities yesterday that the company's pre-war power generation capacity reached 183,000 kilowatts, but now it is only 119,000 kilowatts, of which 26,000 kilowatts must be allocated to the Zhabei Chinese Merchants and the Nanshi Three Electric Companies to supply the residents of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, and Zhenru areas. Therefore, the Shanghai Electric Power Company and its affiliated Huxi Electric Power Company actually have only 93,000 kilowatts, which is far from sufficient each month. It is reported that the current electricity consumption has exceeded the capacity of the company's Yangshupu Power Plant by 15,000 kilowatts. To cope with this situation, the company has agreed with major industrial users, such as cotton mills, on a rotating power outage system, and the daily shutdown time for large cotton mills has been changed to 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. The company has also suspended the approval of new connections or increased electric heating and industrial power loads in order to barely maintain through this difficult period. Although the authorities have assisted the company in various ways to order new machinery and repair damaged parts, it is unlikely that power generation will increase before the end of January next year. As the current situation is difficult to maintain and winter is approaching, with shorter days and longer nights, the electricity consumption of citizens will further increase, and the electricity shortage is bound to become more serious. Therefore, the company urges citizens to conserve electricity, otherwise it will inevitably take expanded restriction measures and other necessary measures.

### Living Buddha; Arrested for Performing Magic; Ignorant People Band Together; Petitioning

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, dozens of ignorant people suddenly came to the Putuo Road Police Station, demanding the release of the "Living Buddha," causing a tense situation. It turned out that a man named Qin Shilong, residing at 3985 Changshou Road in the jurisdiction, came to Shanghai from his hometown of Yangzhou in May of this year, claiming to be possessed by the "Master of Heaven," able to cure all diseases. Coincidentally, the second landlord with whom he lived suffered from severe toothache and tried to have him "perform magic" to cure it, which actually worked. This was quickly spread far and wide, and dozens of people requested treatment every day. The name of the "Living Buddha" became well-known in the area. The Putuo Road Police Station, fearing that there were other circumstances and that he was practicing medicine under false pretenses, specifically ordered the police to summon Qin the day before yesterday to inquire about the details. According to him, he used to be a shoeshine boy, but after losing his job, he returned home and joined the Fushantang as an incense burner. He dreamed at night of the "Master of Heaven" teaching him the art of medicine, instructing him to come to Shanghai to save the people. The police station considered his confession to be absurd and sentenced him to detention for seven days, after which he would be deported. Unexpectedly, just yesterday afternoon, residents came to petition, requesting his release. After the police explained the facts, the residents dispersed reluctantly.

### Meddy Candy Company Bankrupt; Manager and Accountant Flee, Captured; Deficit of Hundreds of Millions

[Our Newspaper] Meddy Candy Company, located at 107 Wenmiao Road, Nanjing, was a joint-stock company selling fresh orange juice, and its business was originally quite good. However, under the collusion of manager Wu Peilin and chief accountant Ye Bangyao, the company went bankrupt. Wu and others secretly concealed this and continued to use the company's name to fraudulently obtain large sums of money, resulting in a deficit of hundreds of millions of yuan, and then fled without a trace. A shareholder of the company, Mr. Liu, learned of this and reported it to the Penglai Police Sub-bureau for investigation. Yesterday morning, Yao Zhilong, the chief of the criminal investigation section of the sub-bureau, along with officers Yang Mianzhi, Zhang Shusheng, Zhang Detong, and Chen Hailin, discovered that Ye Bangyao was having morning tea at the East Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road. They rushed to the address and arrested him. Under interrogation, he revealed that Wu Peilin was hiding in Room 229 of the Zhongzhou Hotel on Shandong Road. They then rushed to that location and captured Wu, who was taking a nap. According to their confessions, the company was in debt for hundreds of millions of yuan due to excessive losses and poor operations. It was also learned that a Mr. Bao, an employee of the Jinlei Advertising Company, was also a victim. The police station is currently summoning the company's shareholders for questioning. It is reported that the two defendants will be transferred to the local prosecutor's office on charges of fraud for legal processing.

### Dispute Over Post-War Reconstruction Association; Eighty-Year-Old Woman Lies on the Ground, Refusing to Leave; Claims She Wants to Reclaim the Lease Rights from Twenty-Eight Years Ago

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the local court of this city tried a case of obstruction of freedom. The plaintiff was Wu Tiecheng, the current Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters (representing the China Post-War Reconstruction Association). The defendants were Zhou Lushi, Zhou Wenying, Zhou Fengqi, and several others. Wu was represented in court by Jiang Hao, the current city councilor, while only Zhou Wenying appeared on the defendant's side. According to Jiang Hao's statement to the court, after the victory, the China Post-War Reconstruction Association moved to Shanghai and leased Room 402 of the Meilun Building at 153 Beijing Road from the American company Taly, paying rent in advance until the end of September of this year. On June 28 of this year, Zhou Wenying, a resident of Room 303 in the building, along with her husband Li Chengfang, nephew Zhou Fengqi, and Zhou Lushi, who was already eighty years old, came and claimed that they had lived in the house in 1939 and wanted to continue living there. Zhou Lushi threatened with her old age and illness, lying on the ground and refusing to leave. The next day, they moved in broken sofas and other miscellaneous furniture. The police station was notified and sent officers to investigate, but Zhou and others could not produce a lease. This behavior clearly constitutes an obstruction of freedom and should be dealt with according to the law. Zhou Wenying claimed that the China Post-War Reconstruction Association's office was not for their own use but was sublet to others to open a trading company. Therefore, she requested the return of the lease rights to the house from 1939. After an investigation by the court, the hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 28th of this month for further questioning.

### Longhua Cement Factory Lays Off Workers; Management Clarifies the Situation Yesterday

The Longhua Cement Factory, belonging to the Shanghai Cement Company in this city, recently laid off workers due to its inability to maintain operations, causing a labor dispute. According to the management yesterday, since this spring, the factory has not only suffered a fatal blow in terms of sales due to the continuous dumping of foreign goods, but also faced layers of torment in terms of production and transportation, forcing it to move towards bankruptcy. Since July 25, the company has suspended production because the business prospects were hopeless. At that time, it originally intended to lay off the surplus workers, but in consideration of the livelihoods of the workers, it still hoped to maintain operations. Now, due to the constraints of the environment, it has to lay them off from the 16th of this month, which is a last resort for the company.

### "Opening Peach Orchard" to Steal Antiques; Thieves Are Active Again; Xie Da Xiang Suffers Great Losses

[Our Newspaper] The ranks of the "Touching and Stealing Brigade" have not yet disappeared from people's minds, but thieves have been active again in the past few days.

Yesterday morning, the home of Liang Zangsheng at 627 West Aihams Road was visited by thieves, who performed two techniques in a row—"Opening the Peach Orchard" and "Polishing Both Sides," meaning they dug through the bamboo fence and then smashed the glass window. As a result, several valuable antiques displayed in the living room, a bronze mirror, a jade water container of both larger and smaller sizes, a blue vase, and two felt hats and seven raincoats hanging on the coat rack, as well as a radio, were all taken away. Such an action would have taken a long time, but it never alerted the owner. It was not until 7:00 AM, when the owner got up, that he discovered that so many things had been stolen and immediately reported it to the police station. He said that the loss of the radio, felt hats, raincoats, etc., was small, about two hundred thousand yuan, but the antiques were difficult to estimate. After the police station sent officers to investigate the scene, they discovered that the cunning thief had left no trace behind, so this unsolved case is indeed giving the police officers a headache!

Also, the Xie Da Xiang store in the Eight Immortals Bridge area was robbed of more than eighty bolts of cloth the night before last, worth more than ten million yuan.

### Finding a Leather Bag in a Car; Opening It Reveals Piles of Legal Tender

Upon opening the bag, it was found to contain a total of 1.02 million yuan in legal tender, as well as a resignation letter from Zhou Shaoxiang to the Central Chemical Glass Factory. Therefore, they immediately called the factory to inquire, and it was confirmed that there was such a person, but he had gone to Beijing.

### Trial of Fake Minister Chuan Shishuo Concluded Yesterday; Four Witnesses Gave Testimony Favorable to the Defendant; Judge Presented Large Volume of Evidence; Adjourned for Verdict on the 28th After Clarification

[Our Newspaper] The case of Chuan Shishuo, one of the giants of the puppet government, who successively served as "Minister of Railways," "Governor of Zhejiang Province and Commander of the Security Forces," and "Minister of Construction," which had been delayed since the first trial by the collegiate panel of the High Court in April of this year, was retried yesterday morning in the Criminal Division 1 of the High Court in Tilanqiao. The debate concluded, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 28th of this month.

At 10:15 AM, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, along with Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huanxing, Prosecutor Dai Rongduo, and Clerk Li Jinzhang, took their seats and ordered the bailiffs to escort the defendant in. Chuan was dressed in a dark gray Chinese gown, wearing brown leather shoes, with a flat-top haircut, his hair already gray, his face pale and yellow, holding a glasses case, and looking mentally exhausted. First, the court asked him his age, which was 56, his place of origin, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and his last puppet post, which was "Minister of Construction." Judge Liu then declared that the case was being retried today in accordance with procedure. During the investigation period, the court had collected relevant evidence from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Ministry of Transportation, and other departments. The evidence submitted by the defendant had also been investigated in Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and other places, and replies had been received. At this point, the defendant's defense attorney stood up and stated that four witnesses had arrived to testify for the defendant and requested that the court call them. Judge Liu ordered them to be seated aside.

Witness He Peirong

Claimed: During the War of Resistance, he served as the chairman of the Kuomintang branch in two locations and as a propagandist for the Third War Zone. In early 1944, he came to Shanghai for secret work and was protected by the defendant. In June, he went to Nanjing with the defendant to discuss a defection plan with the puppet government, but it was not realized due to the sudden surrender of the enemy.

Mao Jingquan

Claimed: His late father, Mao Yun, was responsible for the work of the Military Intelligence Bureau in the Nanjing-Shanghai area during the War of Resistance. When the defendant served as the puppet Minister of Railways, the two sides had contact. At that time, the work agencies in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area were successively broken up by the enemy military police, and personnel were arrested, including his father. The defendant personally went to the enemy military police to intercede, but to no avail. Later, he entrusted someone to bribe the translator and captain inside to destroy the evidence, and he was released. The work agencies in the Shanghai area were also able to be preserved thanks to this. Later, when his father went to Chongqing, the Chairman ordered a commendation. In 1942, he returned to Shanghai to work. At that time, the defendant was the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, so he went to Hangzhou to see the defendant. He personally went to the provincial government three times to negotiate the complete handover of military power in Zhejiang Province to seek defection. However, the enemy learned of this, and the defendant lost his position as governor as a result. Later, during his tenure as the puppet Minister of Construction, he also provided protection for the work in many ways. His father later fell ill and died. Before his death, he constantly instructed the defendant, and the defendant provided information at all times.

Wang Yuxiang

Was one of the founders of Datong University and testified for the defendant on two points: (1) In 1943, the puppet Ministry of Education ordered Datong University to submit a list of faculty and students. The school board decided to ignore it, but when there was really no way out, they closed the door. On the one hand, because the defendant in this case had also served as a professor at Datong in the past, he entrusted him to tell the puppet Ministry of Education not to destroy the education sector. As a result, universities such as Datong and Fudan were able to survive safely. (2) In 1941, the underground workers of the government and the puppet side were fighting fiercely in Shanghai. One day, a student from Datong was shot and killed when he left the school gate. After investigation, it was found that the student was a member of the puppet organization. "76" sent a letter threatening them, which was also resolved with the help of the defendant in this case.

Gong Weizhen

Claimed: In January 1943, because of her participation in Party work, her entire family was arrested by the enemy military police and sent to Changzhou for three months of confinement. Later, because she knew the defendant's wife, she was rescued and released by the defendant. Her husband's sentence was also reduced.

Trying to Shirk Guilt Requires Demonstrating Merit First

After the four witnesses were questioned, the court asked the defendant if he had anything to say. He replied that he had several points to add: (1) When he was initially arrested by the enemy military police and forced to join the puppet government, he had obtained the consent of Mao [Yun]. Mao Jingquan did not know about this. (2) He Peirong only mentioned a part of it. In the second half of 1942, he rescued Kong Jingshi, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Loyal Salvation Army, and more than 30 of his subordinates. He nominally bailed them out to the enemy military police, and they were trained by us. Later, they were transferred to Yuyao and then to Wuhu and released. (3) The defendant had been working in the education sector for 20 years. The puppet government originally invited me to be responsible for education, but I declined. When Zhao Zhengping served as the puppet Minister of Education, the education sector in Shanghai was in a state of panic. I advised Zhao to allow the education sector in Shanghai to maintain its freedom and not to interfere.

Real Evidence

Judge Liu then showed the defendant an article he published in the commemorative album of the puppet national government's return to the capital, "The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and Sino-Japanese Cultural Cooperation," and asked if he had anything to say. He replied: This is an empty article, written by the secretary when I was in the Ministry of Railways. The court then showed the defendant a large number of documents collected from various agencies, including the puppet Ministry of Railways' proposal to the puppet Executive Yuan to collect the shares of the puppet Central China Railway Company, the puppet Executive Yuan's order for the defendant to go to Japan to inspect the railway industry and attend the Second "East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference," the puppet Ministry of Railways' regulations designating various freight rates for the puppet Central China Railway Company, the puppet Ministry of Construction's measures on holding the issuance of construction bonds, and the supervision and management regulations on Sino-Japanese joint ventures, the puppet Zhejiang Province's Clearing the Countryside Plan and its implementation measures, assisting enemy Deng troops in purchasing timber and other military supplies, and implementing a security system and policy guidelines. There were also a large number of files on the focus of the security team plan in the Clearing the Countryside Plan being to cooperate with the Japanese military's military operations to establish security. After reading them, the defendant admitted most of them but stated: The supervision and management regulations on Sino-Japanese joint ventures were drafted by Chen Junhui, the puppet Minister of Industry. The so-called focus in the Clearing the Countryside Plan was issued by the puppet Clearing the Countryside Committee. Nominally, the clearing was implemented by the puppet government, but in reality, it was the Japanese army that was doing it. The establishment of the Zhejiang Province security system was because there were many mixed troops under the control of the Japanese, who were abusing their power to harass the local area. I negotiated with the Japanese and asked the Chinese side to manage it. The Japanese were very opposed to the use of force after its establishment. On average, only two or thirty old guns were given to every hundred people. After the questioning was completed at 12:00 PM, the debate began. First, the prosecutor presented the indictment, then the defendant's defense attorneys, Zhang Shizhao and Gu [Name], responded until about 1:00 PM. The court adjourned for a verdict on the 28th.

### Jiangwan Everywhere Golds Rushed For: Japanese Soldiers Hid Gold, Old Woman Seeks Treasure

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following external rumors that the enemy navy had hidden a huge sum of gold bars on Fuxing Island in this city, which was then swallowed up by someone, another gold rush incident involving hidden enemy gold bars has occurred in the Jiangwan area of this city.

It is said that the Japanese Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, including the To Unit, had purchased a large quantity of gold bars in Taiwan and Shanghai, and last summer, Japanese soldiers loaded them onto several trucks and transported them to the vicinity of the intersection of Jiangwan Yinxiang Road, where they were hidden in an air-raid shelter. This was observed by a farmer nearby, but at that time, due to Japanese sentries enforcing martial law, the distance was quite far, and it was nighttime, so it was not possible to see clearly. Later, the air-raid shelter was filled in, but the old woman had gone alone to dig for gold many times, keeping the matter a secret. After neighbors found out, she revealed the truth, leading to residents carrying shovels and hoes to dig holes in search of treasure in the Jiangwan Airport, former city center, former To Unit headquarters, and Jiangwan Racecourse areas in recent weeks. There were even diggers in Hongkou Park everywhere. How this matter will be handled is of great concern to all parties, and it is currently awaiting investigation and verification by the authorities.

### Fish Market Tricycle Rickshaw Pullers Rally to the Social Affairs Bureau to Petition

During the War of Resistance, goods for fish vendors at this city's fish market were transported by tricycle rickshaws. After the victory, trucks were used instead, causing more than two thousand tricycle rickshaw workers to face unemployment. Yesterday morning, about six hundred workers in the tricycle rickshaw transportation industry drove their tricycle rickshaws in a group to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and distributed a "Solemn Appeal to All Circles to Win Back Rice Bowls for Thousands of People." The person in charge of mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau found this matter quite difficult, saying that it was inconvenient to interfere with the business of truck merchants, but considering the livelihoods of these more than two thousand workers, a solution had to be found. It was not until about 4 PM that the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau persuaded the workers to disband first, and to send representatives to prepare a written report of the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for further mediation.

Shou Jingwei presided over the meeting, and Wu Yunfu gave a speech on behalf of the group, stating briefly that the organization of the International Labor Organization provides a connection between workers in countries around the world. China has suffered threats and destruction from the enemy during the eight years of the War of Resistance, but only the help of international friends (especially in the labor sector) is worth remembering. Allied countries such as Britain and the United States have not only provided spiritual help, but also material help (such as donations), and the efforts of the International Labor Organization in this regard cannot be ignored. This time, Mr. Paul Locher has been invited to China, and it is believed that this will help the welfare of Chinese workers. China is an industrially backward country, and its industrial equipment and worker treatment are not as good as others. We hope that Mr. Paul Locher will provide strong assistance, and we would like to welcome and pay our respects on behalf of the workers of this city. After representatives of the China Labor Association and others delivered welcome speeches, Mr. Paul Locher gave a speech, first expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the joint welcome from the four business and industrial groups, and expressing great pleasure. He then introduced the purpose of the International Labor Organization, which is to seek the welfare of workers. He said that he was invited to China by the Chinese Ministry of Social Affairs, hoping to promote close cooperation between the Chinese Labor Bureau and the International Labor Organization, and that the Three Principles of the People advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen are fully in line with the International Labor Organization's policies, such as protecting labor for nationalism, seeking cooperation between labor and capital for democracy, and improving the lives of workers for people's livelihood. After observing for two weeks since arriving in China, Mr. Locher believes that the current labor situation in China is like the traffic situation on Nanjing Road: rickshaws, tricycle rickshaws, and motor vehicles are all mixed together, in a chaotic mess. This kind of unreasonable phenomenon must be improved. Mr. Locher finally stated that all countries in the world hope that China can become an industrialized country, and China must increase production and work hard. He wished that freedom and democracy could guide China on the road to prosperity. Cheng Haifeng, Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Organization, said in his speech that the four groups present today represent two different positions and interests—labor and capital. He hoped that this would be the prelude to labor-capital coordination in China. Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that the principles for improving the labor sector established by the International Labor Organization are very important for China. For example, the eight-hour work system was decided by the International Labor Organization long ago, and it is now widely implemented in Shanghai. He also stated that China's industry today is facing its greatest crisis. China has been destroyed by a long war, and it should not only be restored, but also exceed its original achievements. This work is difficult, and in this critical stage, labor and capital must understand and cooperate thoroughly. Finally, after Lian Kai, Director of the Industrial and Mining Inspection Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, the conference ended at 5 PM.

### Chen Bozhuang Speaks on the Major Corruption Case in the Two Railway Bureaus: Determined to Replace Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Bokang Early On, Yu Xiangyan's False Accusations Not Worth a Laugh

The major corruption case involving Qiang Hongtu, Director of the Materials Department of the Jinghu Railway Bureau, has attracted much attention from the public since the first trial was held the day before yesterday. This reporter specially visited Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Railway Bureau, who replied as follows:

(1) In the past ten days, I have been following the orders of the department, planning the construction for the entire year of next year, and have been very busy. I have not had time to pay attention to all the news of the trial of this case. However, I read the first paragraph of Zhang Hongtu's defense in the Xinwenbao on the 14th, stating that Zhang Bokang was brought in by me and was not his private employee, and that he had asked to replace Zhang Bokang, but I refused. His intention was nothing more than to wash away his relationship with Zhang Bokang, and I have to tell the truth: (1) Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Bokang were both employees of the Materials Division. Before I was ordered to take over the Jinghu District last year, I had never met them before. Zhang Bokang was assigned by the department as a reception staff member, and Zhang Hongtu was assigned by the department as the Director of the Materials Department, and Zhang Bokang's appointment as the Chief of the Purchasing Section was requested by Zhang Hongtu. (2) In April of this year, there were rumors inside and outside the bureau about the Materials Department. At that time, I asked Zhang Ziyue, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Shen Yi, former Director of the Ministry of Communications and current Mayor of Dalian, and Mr. Yin Zhongrong, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, to recommend candidates for the Chief of the Purchasing Section. At that time, Special Commissioner Zhang had a suitable candidate, but because the candidate was sent to North China by Vice President Weng to handle reception work, the agreement was not reached. I also told Zhang Hongtu about this matter. Since he knew that I was determined to replace Zhang Bokang, whom he had requested to be appointed, he recommended someone from the Materials Division to take over. He probably feared that I would find someone I did not know, so he recommended an acquaintance to resist and cover up. Of course, I did not consider it.

(2) Before this case was revealed, Hua Shousong, Director of the Materials Division, told me that Minister Yu Qiaofeng had heard rumors about Zhang Hongtu's impropriety a month before leaving office, and ordered Director Hua to investigate secretly, but Minister Yu did not issue the same secret order to me. Therefore, I decided to replace Zhang Hongtu and asked Minister Yu Dawei to send someone else, but Minister Dawei did not have a suitable candidate to send at the time. Therefore, on May 28, I ordered that all purchases must be handled by Deputy Director Hou Huahua. After this order was issued, all employees in the bureau knew that I did not trust the Materials Department and had no private relationship. The next day, there were posters attacking the department for corruption. Then, Shen Guizhang, Huang Ruzhen, and others secretly reported the matter, and the bureau immediately tracked down and investigated the case and sent it to the court.

(3) Yu Xiangyan's accusations of bribing me with 5 million yuan and inviting him to meetings three times are completely fabricated and not worth a laugh. I have been working for decades, and the community has its own evaluation.

### Ministry of Education Allocates Temporary Funds for National Education: Print Textbooks for People's Schools, Assign Seven Joint Supply Offices to Supply 350,000 Copies

[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing] The temporary national education fund for this year, i.e., the fund for eliminating illiteracy, was originally approved at 60 million yuan. Because the amount was too small and the needs of various provinces and cities were too great, it was impossible to allocate. It has now been doubled to 120 million yuan. Since the increase is not much, it is feared that there will be little benefit if it is allocated to the provinces in a piecemeal fashion. The Ministry of Education intends to use this fund to print textbooks for people's schools, with 300 yuan per book, planning to print 350,000 copies, totaling 105 million yuan, and the remaining 15 million yuan will be reserved for other uses. The Ministry of Education has recently sent a special letter to the Seven Joint Supply Offices of National Primary and Secondary School Textbooks, ordering them to print 200,000 copies of textbooks for elementary adult classes and 150,000 copies of textbooks for elementary women's classes, and distribute them to the education departments and bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beiping for use.

Extremely Exciting

At the end of the first half, the score was 21 to 15, with Qunsheng leading by three goals.

Soaring Straight Up

After changing sides, the game resumed, and Qunsheng's momentum increased. Yang Renhui, Cai Wenzhang, and Cai Wenhua scored three consecutive points. Huanan quickly called a timeout and replaced Huang Tianlie with Li Xianzheng, and then replaced Shen Pengju with Liu Fuqiang, but they still failed to stop the guest team's momentum. The three musketeers, Jinde, Wenhua, and Wenzhang, were successful from all sides, and the score soared straight up. At the end of the third quarter, the score was 40 to 20, with Qunsheng taking the lead. In the final quarter, Huanan showed some improvement, scoring seven consecutive points. Qunsheng called a timeout and substituted Zhu Shirong for Cai Wenhua. Huanan was still rampant for a while. Before long, Cai Lianke fouled out, and Cai Wenzhang entered the game, stabilizing the situation. When the final buzzer sounded, the score was 53 to 37, with Qunsheng winning two consecutive games.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### Please Let All Citizens Take a Look and Supervise the Temple Regulations

— Zhang Xiaosong

Since the establishment of the city's autonomous organizations at the end of last year, most of them have temporarily borrowed offices from other agencies due to the lack of office space, crowded in a corner, which has affected the promotion of autonomous work. It is difficult to live in borrowed houses for a long time, and there are no houses to move to, and no regulations for renting houses. At this time after the war, when the people's vitality has not yet recovered, how can we expect every autonomous organization to be able to raise funds for construction? Therefore, since the establishment of the district offices, there has hardly been a day without housing problems, and I have been racking my brains for this every day. However, we cannot suspend autonomous work due to the lack of office space. Therefore, the senators, in view of this, proposed to allocate or borrow temples as office space for autonomous organizations. At that time, there were indeed opponents, but the majority supported it. I requested to speak, explaining that this proposal is in line with both reason and law, considering the urgent need to promote autonomous work at present.

Article 4 of the Temple Supervision Regulations stipulates that "Abandoned temples shall be managed by local autonomous bodies." Therefore, if there are temples in this city that meet the requirements of this article, they can be allocated according to law. Article 10 also stipulates that "Temples should, according to their property conditions, engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings," and Article 11 stipulates that "If they violate the provisions of Article 10 (i.e., temples do not engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings), their abbots may be removed." Therefore, the proposal to borrow or allocate temples as housing for autonomous organizations is very much in line with this purpose. Now, the National Government's promulgated Temple Supervision Regulations are published in the newspaper, please let all citizens take a look so that they can understand.

(Article 1) All religious buildings with monks or Taoists residing in them, regardless of their name, are temples. (Article 2) Temples and their properties and religious objects shall be supervised in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise provided by law. The religious objects mentioned in the preceding paragraph refer to Buddha statues, deity statues, ritual instruments, musical instruments, dharma instruments, classics, carvings, paintings, and all other antiques related to religion, history, or art that have always been preserved by temples. (Article 3) Temples that fall under any of the following categories are not subject to the provisions of these regulations: 1. Those managed by government agencies. 2. Those managed by local public organizations. 3. Those established and managed by private individuals.

(Article 4) Abandoned temples shall be managed by local autonomous bodies. (Article 5) Temple properties and religious objects shall be registered with the local government office in charge. (Article 6) Temple properties and religious objects shall be owned by the temple and managed by the abbot. Monks and Taoists with management rights in the temple, regardless of their title, shall be recognized as abbots, but non-citizens of the Republic of China shall not be abbots. (Article 7) The abbot shall not use the income of the temple property for anything other than propagating religious doctrines, practicing precepts, and other legitimate expenses. (Article 8) Real estate and religious objects of the temple shall not be disposed of or altered without the resolution of the Buddhist Association to which it belongs and the permission of the government office in charge. (Article 9) The abbot shall report the temple's income and expenditure, and the undertakings it engages in, to the government office in charge every six months and make them public.

(Article 10) Temples shall engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings according to their property conditions. (Article 11) Those who violate the provisions of Article 5, Article 6, or Article 10 of these regulations may have their abbots removed from their positions by the government office in charge. Those who violate the provisions of Article 7 or Article 8 may be expelled from the temple or sent to court for investigation. (Article 12) These regulations shall not apply to temples in Tibet, Xikang, Mongolia, and Qinghai. (Article 13) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Household Registration Personnel Training; Centralized Locations in Districts 4 and 5; Training Postponed

The municipal government's Civil Affairs Department is organizing centralized training for household registration personnel. The fourth and fifth districts were originally scheduled to hold a four-day training from the 23rd to the 26th of this month. However, due to the investigation of military personnel occupying housing from the 21st to the 25th, all Bao cadres must participate, so the dates of the lectures in these two districts have been changed to the 26th to the 28th for three days. The lecture schedule has also been revised separately, and the department has notified the district offices accordingly.

In addition, the centralized location for the fourth group of household registration personnel training, originally scheduled to be held in the Guanyi Primary School on Qiujiang Road, District 17, has been changed to the auditorium of the Teacher Training Institute at No. 535, Gongping Road, District 18 (north end of Dongyuhang Road) due to the lack of tables and chairs in Guanyi Primary School, which caused many inconveniences.

### Textile Construction Listing Canceled; To Be Handled With Joint Allocation and Sale; Yarn and Cloth Prices Soar, Market Is Quite Chaotic; Both Local and Out-of-Town Sales Are Unusually Active

[Our newspaper's report] The Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association convened a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Twenty-nine member units attended, and they decided to cancel the use of the Double Horse brand as the standard for opening yarn during the second group allocation, and instead use 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard. At the same time, the members discussed the sharing method for the yarn allocation. As for the various procedures for opening yarn, there was not much change from before.

In addition, since the China Textile Construction Company decided to cancel the original weekly Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning listing and allocation system, it has been merged into the Joint Allocation and Sale Committee for unified handling, in order to streamline the process. Therefore, the yarn opening situation of Textile Construction in the future will be delayed until 4:00 or 5:00 PM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before the details are known. It is said that the Textile Company convened a meeting yesterday afternoon to change the allocation and sale system, and the discussion lasted quite a long time.

Yesterday, the yarn market rose crazily. Because transactions in various places were smooth and out-of-town merchants collected spot goods in a particularly eager manner, the yarn price was already extremely hot. In addition, Textile Construction announced the futures allocation price at night, raising it by 60,000 to 190,000 [including 32-count Blue Phoenix, which increased by 60,000, and 20-count and 42-count, which increased by 180,000 to 190,000], which excited people's hearts. It was like adding fuel to the fire, and the rise had the feeling of soaring to the sky, generally rising by about 10%. It is said that yesterday, in addition to the northern road sales still surging and out-of-town sales being smooth, local weaving factories in this city also purchased raw materials one after another to compensate for the shortage of gray fabric they had sold, which has presented a situation of unequal supply and demand. Moreover, the previous Textile Construction yarn opening suddenly changed its policy and decided to sell yarn jointly with commercial factories, increasing prices uniformly. The market price it opened yesterday also soared by 10,000, which led to a jump in market prices and panic among people. In summary, the price of 20-count standard yarn rose by more than 10,000 yuan, to about 1.7 million yuan, and 42-count was more than 2.4 million yuan. The market atmosphere is still looking up.

Yesterday, the price of cotton cloth jumped crazily, and people's hearts were panicked. In recent days, the out-of-town merchants have been moving quite vigorously, and the ban on shipping to South China may be lifted. The market situation had already become firm. However, after the out-of-town sales had been active for several days, the appetite gradually subsided, and the market could have temporarily stabilized. Yesterday's soaring was really due to the change in Textile Construction's opening price. Yanghe fine cloth was 63,000 yuan, which was 10,000 yuan higher than the same grade of five fine cloth opened in the previous period. People's hearts were stimulated by this. At the same time, various gray fabric factories dared not release much because the previous futures had not been cleared, while dyeing factories and this street were searching more eagerly. With the imbalance between supply and demand, the market situation became even more chaotic. Today's opening price for 3A color ball fine cloth is 72,000 yuan, and old goods Four Gentlemen serge is 76,500 yuan.

### Three Points Should Be Improved for Yarn Allocation; Yarn and Cloth Approval for Southward Transportation Must Be Fair

[Our newspaper's report] Yesterday, the supply situation of yarn and cloth and the market situation both underwent drastic changes. The relevant parties are paying close attention. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the cotton textile reproduction industry, this kind of change was expected and there is no need to be surprised. He also said that the supply method is being discussed with the authorities for improvement, and the market should gradually stabilize. According to him, the joint sale of goods by private yarn mills under the control of Textile Construction was originally a proper measure, but there are three points that need to be improved: [1] Futures are sold, but the full payment must be collected. In these days of no industrial loans and tight monetary conditions, it is necessary to consider both and make appropriate adjustments. [2] The price is not opened until the purchase orders are collected, which is inconsistent with trading practices. According to the method, those who withdraw their purchase after submitting it will have their qualifications revoked in the future. Then, how should it be handled when the price is not suitable? And it is also inconvenient to collect orders during the day and open the price at night. [3] Futures warehouse receipts must be cleared within a limited time, otherwise, it will only be enough to create a snowball trade. He also said that in the month since Textile Construction distributed goods after the exchange rate change, although it seemed to maintain the original price on the surface, changing the brand and increasing the premium had already been brewing a price increase. And in terms of the general market price, the low price reduction has indeed made it sacrifice a lot of profits. Now that it has obtained control over the joint sales of private yarn mills, it is understandable to cancel the equal distribution of cotton yarn and follow the prices of commercial factories, but it is a pity that the supply method has also followed the same path. Moreover, in terms of the current selling price of Textile Construction, Yanghe fine cloth is listed at 63,000 yuan, which is 10,000 yuan higher than a month ago, and more than 8,000 times higher than before the war. In order to stabilize prices, effective measures must be taken urgently to avoid further stimulation. It is not a good strategy for the cotton textile reproduction industry to search for purchases on the black market due to insufficient raw materials. Proper preparations should be made for the aftermath. As for the ban on the transportation of yarn and cloth to South China, according to Mr. Pan, lifting the ban is inevitable, but under the system of applying for approval, attention should be paid to the preservation of private production institutions. Textile Construction has now gained control over the yarn and cloth market, which is gratifying. However, the Textile Committee, which controls the approval mechanism, should take a broader view and take fair measures for the approval of southward transportation of yarn and cloth in the future.

### New Banknotes

1,180 boxes were shipped from Liverpool yesterday

[Our newspaper's report] The Taikoo Blue Funnel managed by the Glensturil, Enteel, and our bank's vessel Simjack, shipped a large batch of legal tender from Liverpool, totaling 1,180 boxes, which have already been extracted separately.

### Exchange Rate Rumors; Authorities Will Investigate the Cause

In recent days, rumors have suddenly spread here again that the exchange rate will be adjusted, which has no factual basis. The authorities are very angry about this. President Song today rested at his residence on Qiqi Road due to his political health not yet being fully recovered, but he met with many bankers and also inquired about these rumors. It is said that he will order his subordinates to investigate the cause of these rumors.

### Government Bonds Weak

There were still some scattered sales of government bonds, and they fell slightly after trading at more than 3 million. Tong Bing opened in the morning at 2,000 yuan, rose slightly to a maximum of 2,050 yuan, and then fell again, retreating to a price of 1,840 yuan. The price stabilized slightly near the close, and the result was a drop of 110 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi each fell by 50 yuan, and Ding and Wu fell slightly by 20 yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Lack Change

Foreign stocks saw a decline in large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks saw some Westerners collecting them, showing a slight increase. Large-cap stocks fell slightly after the opening, but lacked major changes. The results compared to the previous close were that British-related Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Wheelock, and A.S. Watson fell slightly, while the steel, shipping, and paper industries rose slightly, and Ye Guang was flat.

### Many Settlements, Yarn Prices Rise, Gold and Currency Continue to Rise

The yesterday was still encouraged by the US dollar, initially flat and then popular, putting the Central Bank in a difficult situation. The morning opening immediately fell slightly to 2.168 million. The Central Bank had some control, and it weakened immediately after the opening, once retreating to within 2.15 million. Soon after, the US dollar followed closely, and buying interest rose again, gradually rebounding. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 183 bars, and the price also rose with the market to 2.1725 million. After entering, it once rose to 2.178 million before being suppressed and gradually consolidated. It once fell slightly to 2.16 million near noon, struggling around 2.165 million at noon. In the afternoon, retail investors heard that Textile Construction had raised yarn prices and started to stir again, once rising to more than 2.2 million, and then slightly rebounded, then rising another 13,000. Ornaments, gold, and silver were unchanged, the selling price of silver dollars increased slightly, and the underground discount rate for money was still high, with the interest rate still only about 13%.

Foreign currencies also followed the US dollar and trended towards profitability. The US dollar opened in the morning, still because the gold price was controlled, there were still some sales. There was supply at 3,680 yuan, and it fell to below 3,600 yuan shortly after the opening before it was maintained. Settlements then came to purchase, and it was immediately raised. Retail investors came to chase after, and buying momentum rose again, rising to 3,750 yuan before there was any stopping. It fell to 3,650 yuan at noon, but still stabilized above 3,700 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, competition for purchases was even more intense, and the price rose to 3,870 yuan before slightly returning. The result was a continued increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange rate against gold was slightly fixed at about 578 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars followed suit and rose by 20 yuan. The selling price of Hong Kong exchange rates rose from 740 yuan to 750 yuan with no supply for demand. The Indian exchange rate rose from 870 yuan to over 900 yuan. The British exchange rate was around 12,000 yuan, and there were no transactions for the US exchange rate because the listed price had not changed.

### Bulls Selling High, Chinese Stocks Difficult to Rise

Chinese stocks still followed the old path of the past few days in the morning, showing glory in the upper market, but only for half an hour. Generally, bulls continued to sell high one after another, and the lifting surface could not support it. After 10:30, it returned to the lower reaches. The rising winds of materials rose sharply, and speculative funds tended to hoard goods. Therefore, those who left stocks to seek goods continued to operate, and the market price declined in each section, becoming worse and worse, and it was difficult to revive. Only China Silk had No. 190 and No. 151 competing to buy each other, and it turned out to be transferred slightly. Other stocks had no way. There were more sales near the afternoon. When the bank came to enter at the close, the United States came to a slight settlement. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn and Jingfu were flat, and Meiya Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. Among the unpopular stocks, only Lian'an fell by half a percent, and the rest all fell slightly. The total transaction volume was 4,744,000 shares, including 1,560,000 shares of Yongsheng Yarn, 978,000 shares of Jingfu, 917,000 shares of Xinguang, 218,000 shares of Meiya, and other stocks generally ranged from tens of thousands of shares to tens of thousands of shares. Outside the market, most stocks were weak and flat.

### New Hopes for International Trade: Price Stability and Improved Transportation

[United Press, New York, 20th] American businesses are closely monitoring China's efforts to level the significant trade imbalance. In recent months, China's exports have only reached 20% of its imports, and foreign exchange reserves are dwindling daily. The future of Sino-American trade seemed bleak. However, two recent developments have sparked new hope: the Chinese government's abolition of export taxes and the nearly 50% devaluation of Chinese currency in the past month. Additionally, American merchants have observed two other favorable signs: relatively stable prices in the Chinese market and the improving Chinese transportation system.

### Rice Prices Remain High Despite Abundant Supply; Flour and Wheat Sales Are Strong, Market Trend Rising

The rice market yesterday saw prices soar by 2,000 yuan in the early market due to high costs in the producing areas caused by rain. The closing market was sluggish. As a result, Du Yang, 秞, and Zha rose by 1,000 yuan, while Ke 秞 and Bu 秞 remained flat. White Yuan also saw little fluctuation. Glutinous rice was very firm. Registered rice from both north and south markets totaled over 11,000 stones. Flour sales were exceptionally brisk, with demand exceeding supply, causing prices to surge by 700 to 800 yuan. The Min gang of wheat showed strong interest, with prices rising by 600 to 700 yuan. Wheat bran prices were steadily climbing, continuing to rise by 200 to 300 yuan. High-quality soybeans saw prices increase by 1,000 yuan, while medium and lower grades remained stable. Raw peanuts from Nanyang were actively sought, and local retail sales were also brisk, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. High-quality soybeans saw a price cut. The oil market saw mixed ups and downs. The supply of Qingdao raw oil was abundant, causing prices to fall by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil was scarce, with prices rising by 1,000 yuan. Vegetable oil also tended to stabilize, while soybean cakes showed a slightly firm trend.

### Long Positions Meet High Offers; Chinese Stocks Struggle to Rise

Chinese stocks opened this morning following the same pattern as the previous few days, showing initial gains. Unfortunately, this lasted only half an hour, as long positions gradually met high offers. The bullish side was unable to sustain the momentum, and after 10:30 AM, the market trended downward again. The surge in commodity prices led speculative funds to seek hoarding opportunities, causing those selling stocks to seek goods, leading to a gradual decline in market prices, worsening with each passing session, and failing to recover. Only China Silk Stocks No. 190 and No. 151, due to competition in purchasing, saw a reversal, while other stocks had no such luck. Near noon, there was renewed selling, with large quantities of American Asian Stocks being sold at No. 233. As the closing bell approached, investors needing funds came in, slightly stabilizing American Asian stocks. In the end, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn and Jingfu were flat, while American Asian, New Light, and Qinxing saw slight declines. Among the less popular stocks, only the silk industry saw a gain of half a percent, standing out like a crane among chickens, while the rest saw slight declines. China Textile No. 5 and Heping were flat, while Tongyi, Datong, Vulgar People, and Arlene fell by half a percent, and the rest saw slight declines. The total transaction volume was 4,744,000 shares, including 1,560,000 shares of Yong Yarn, 978,000 shares of Jingfu, 917,000 shares of New Light, and 218,000 shares of American Asian. The remaining stocks traded from tens of thousands to approximately 120,000 shares each. Off-market stocks were mostly weak.

### Chen Chou Zhen Tea, Needed in Africa, Order Signed

There is continued demand for Chen Chou Zhen and Chen Te Gong tea varieties, and the market is seeing strong sales. A certain tea company in the city has recently received a telegram from Africa requesting Chen Chou Zhen tea, requesting shipments. However, the supplier, seeing no profit, was hesitant. Later, to encourage exports, they became more accommodating. It is said that the two sides have signed a contract, and the goods are expected to be delivered next month. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, stores in this city and in Suzhou and Wuxi are still very brisk. Coarse-haired Wenzhou red tea, in particular, is selling out as soon as it becomes available, with prices exceeding 60,000 yuan per dan, and other teas are also trending strongly.

### Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Trademarks; Trademark Bureau Formulates Three Key Points

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to streamline the procedures for handling enemy and puppet trademarks in the recovered areas, has formulated three points for handling cases, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.

(2) Trademark registration certificates, examination decisions, or review decisions on disputes issued by enemy or puppet organizations, as well as related public documents, shall not be used as evidence to assert usage or other rights under the Trademark Law. (3) Chinese and foreign merchants holding registration certificates or examination decisions issued by the central government's trademark registration authorities that have been examined and stamped or otherwise annotated by enemy or puppet organizations, or documents issued by them, should immediately submit them to the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification and reissuance.

### Economic Zoning System; Shanghai Listed as Fourth Zone

### Japan Refuses to Export Surplus Fresh Cocoons; Our Side Renews Negotiations; Supreme Command's Investigation and Statistics are Inaccurate

[Report from this newspaper] Recently, a United Press dispatch from Tokyo reported that the Allied Supreme Commander in Japan has refused to export surplus fresh cocoons to our country. A reporter inquired with a responsible person from the China Silk Company, who said: China believes that Japan has a large surplus of fresh cocoons, while China is in short supply. Therefore, in April of this year, China first proposed exchanging this batch of cocoons with Japan through barter trade, but without success. Three weeks ago, the same request was made again and is still under verbal negotiation. It is reported that there are three reasons for the US side's delay in approving the request: (1) They believe that China currently has 80,000 dan of cocoons in storage, which is sufficient for the second half of this year. (2) Labor costs in Shanghai are high, and there are frequent strikes, so even if the surplus cocoons are approved, they may not be able to produce silk in large quantities. Moreover, even if silk is produced, the quality may not be good. (3) Shanghai's fuel problem is serious, with shortages of both coal and diesel. According to the responsible person: the reasons given by the US side are all due to inaccurate investigations. It is estimated that this year's autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will not exceed 20,000 dan. The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have a total of 10,500 silk reeling machines. In order to maintain operation until the spring silk season next year, at least 10 million pounds of cocoons are required, equivalent to 75,000 dan. Otherwise, all silk factories will shut down. As for the labor unrest, it has recently eased and will not affect silk production. Moreover, the quality of China's silk is very high. 95% of the silk inspected for export by the Commodity Inspection Bureau meets export standards. There is also no shortage of fuel, and the silk industry is currently approved by the government to purchase coal, diesel, and other fuels. The person also stated: During the war, the cocoon and mulberry equipment in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was destroyed by Japanese invaders. The issue of compensation has not yet been discussed, and instead, China is using urgently needed Chinese goods to exchange for Japan's surplus fresh cocoons. Therefore, this request is reasonable. Therefore, General Zhu Shiming has again approached the Allied Supreme Commander to negotiate the exchange of cocoons. The person said: It is hoped that the US side will conduct a thorough investigation to avoid being misled by distorted information. The person also believes that after verifying all the facts, there will be no problem in shipping Japanese cocoons to China.

### Stamp Tax on Remittance Receipts; Should be Affixed According to Item 15 of the Stamp Tax Rate

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance on July 8 of this year, stating that the remittance receipts issued by recipients of remittances were explained by Ruan Hui to the Ministry of Finance before the war. It was explained that these receipts are issued by the recipients and are different in nature from checks, drafts, and promissory notes issued by banks, money shops, and other businesses for drawing money. They should be stamped at the rate for money receipts, not at the rate for money documents for drawing or remitting money. The Ministry of Finance approved this and circulated it throughout the country. The request inquired whether this interpretation has changed and requested clarification for compliance. The Chamber of Commerce has now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating that the remittance receipts issued by recipients of remittances should be stamped according to Item 15 of the revised stamp tax law rate, which is the example of documents or ledgers for drawing or remitting money (20 yuan per document, 100 yuan per ledger). The Chamber of Commerce will inform all associations and businesses to follow the instructions.

### Flour Industry in Crisis; Urges Stabilization of Wheat Prices

[Report from this newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss ways to save the current flour industry crisis. The directors and supervisors agreed that the current production cost of flour is too high, and small factories are closing down one after another, while large factories are also gradually shutting down. Even if flour exports are decontrolled, the price limit on flour still does not help manufacturers. If wheat prices are not stabilized, flour production in the city will only continue to decline. It is predicted that half of the flour factories will close by the end of this year. Therefore, the most important measure at present is to request the government to stabilize wheat prices.

### White Coal Chunks Soar Again

In the coal market, white coal chunks, although the price is high, due to the lack of hope of delivery, suppliers are few, buyers are eager, and the market price continues to soar. Yangquan screened chunks are priced at 650,000 yuan per ton, and there are few sellers. Smoked coal and coke are also rising due to the increase in the price of white coal chunks. Clear water coal and coke are as high as 600,000 yuan per ton, and ordinary Jingxing coke also requires 330,000 to 340,000 yuan.

### Salt Merchants Request Postponement of Implementation of Merchant Transportation and Sales Method

During the Anti-Japanese War, the government controlled the official transportation and merchant sales of salt. Now that the war has ended, there is no need to continue the controls. The Ministry of Finance previously issued an order to salt merchants in various regions, scheduling the change of the above method starting from January of the 36th year of the Republic, restoring merchant transportation and sales. However, salt merchants generally suffered significant losses during the control period, and their vitality has not yet recovered. If merchant transportation and sales are implemented, capital turnover will inevitably be difficult. They have jointly submitted a request to the salt affairs authorities to postpone the implementation for two years.

### Timber Market Turns Firm

Yesterday, the timber market saw firmer conditions. Although fir wood arrived, the unloading of fir wood shipped by Da Zhonghua was delayed, and sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices due to increased costs. However, market demand was also not high, so prices remained firm.

### Asphalt Gradually Declines

Asphalt prices rose sharply before the festival, but the momentum has weakened after the festival. Initially, the hot weather made loading and unloading difficult, and the supply was scarce. Recently, shipments from various places have gathered, causing the market to decline. As for inventories in various production areas, eastern Zhejiang has long been depleted, and even if there are shipments in the autumn, there will not be many. However, dealers in Jinlan, Hangzhou, and other places cannot accommodate many shipments, selling them as soon as they arrive, with Shanghai as the final destination. Therefore, shipments continue to arrive in this city. As for Hankou, after the goods stored by merchants in this city were continuously shipped to Shanghai, transporters also brought shipments, and the situation gradually became peaceful. Dealers have adjusted their selling prices. Heben oil is priced at 142,000 yuan, Neiping oil at 134,000 yuan, Longjian at 130,000 yuan, Deqian oil at 126,000 yuan, Jianmacheng oil at 116,000 yuan, and ordinary Macheng oil at 110,000 yuan.

### The Only Way to Lower Current Interest Rates

— Cao Yong'an, Xufeng Pawnshop

Is to Obtain Low-Interest Loans from Banks

The pawnshop industry has a long history and is the only financial institution for the common people. Therefore, even small profits are not considered offensive by officials. Although they know they are taking profits from the people, the poor are still happy to use them. Today, pawnshop business is sluggish, mainly because interest rates are too high, and the poor cannot afford them. They have no way to borrow money and cannot cope with urgent needs, which is not good for society. Outsiders do not understand this situation and simply blame the pawnshop industry for reducing interest rates. However, with high borrowing rates and excessive expenses, why would shareholders engage in this loss-making business? Therefore, to help the common people, we must maintain pawnshops. To maintain pawnshops, we must enable the pawnshop industry to obtain low-interest funds. I believe that national or municipal banks should reduce interest rates and lend to pawnshops, and then require the pawnshop association to reduce pawnshop interest rates and enforce them. The pawnshop association should be responsible for reviewing and reporting the organization, financial strength, and management of each pawnshop. The bank should provide low-interest loans, and the association should be responsible for supervision. In this way, the loans will not be wasted and can be supported, and the poor can also enjoy the benefits. I have been in this industry for only a short time, but I know that if there are no low-interest funds internally, there is no possibility of reducing interest rates externally. The common people and the pawnshop industry can only suffer from this problem. I have taken the liberty of expressing my humble opinion, hoping that experts will provide guidance.

### A New Trial for Two Great Nations: Chinese Sovereignty in Hong Kong (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent Ling Fang

Hong Kong Airmail, 19th of this month

After eight years of the War of Resistance and World War II, the status of the Chinese nation in the world has been reassessed. Our policy of peace radiates a special light on the international stage. We have not bullied anyone, let alone committed aggression. On the contrary, regarding any past injustices inflicted upon us, we still adhere to the traditional spirit of peace, seeking to establish understanding with the other party. We clearly understand the difficulties of others. We also know that the accumulated habits of the past, not to mention that the party that has taken advantage of us cannot change overnight, many of our "soft bones" also find it difficult to stand up straight at once. As long as the other party can recognize this new transformation, which is undeniable in both reason and emotion, and treat us with an attitude of equality and mutual benefit, we will never deliberately bring up old scores or make things difficult for others. This fact is even more evident in the Hong Kong issue.

Today, enlightened people all over the world recognize that the Hong Kong issue is the crystallization of a century of stains on Sino-British relations. To ensure a new post-war friendship with China, enlightened British people have long advocated returning Hong Kong to China. However, the transformation of British foreign policy has not kept pace with the transformation of the international situation, and the Hong Kong issue has become a focal point of Sino-British relations. The new aspirations of the Chinese side and the old inclinations of the British side have come into direct contact with Hong Kong as a medium. Since the British army re-entered Hong Kong a year ago, Sino-British forces have clashed due to various unavoidable factors. Small incidents are countless, and there have been several major ones, as I have previously reported in summary. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify a point: Standing on the position of reporting, I have no partiality for my own country and no ill will towards our ally, Britain. Recently, the reason why I have tirelessly reported on the Hong Kong issue, especially on the unpleasant events caused by both China and Britain, is on the one hand to meet the demands of domestic readers who are paying attention to the Hong Kong issue, and on the other hand to seek correction from international people who care about Sino-British relations. Every time I pick up my pen, I deeply hope that this small island of Hong Kong will become the cornerstone of a new friendship between the two great nations of China and Britain, rather than a battleground for the new forces of the two great nations. This turning point relies on a lot of effort on the Chinese side, but it seems to rely more on the effort of the British side. Recently, in the new environment of Hong Kong, the following

Unpleasant Sino-British Incidents

There are two more: the negotiations on the establishment of a Chinese court in Kowloon and the negotiations on the establishment of a government in Kowloon City. The former was revealed on July 29, and the latter occurred in early September, reaching a conclusion only when the Hong Kong government issued a statement on the 14th. When the news of the negotiations on the establishment of a court in Kowloon was released, I did not report it at the time for the sake of Sino-British friendship, because the official announcement had not yet been made. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and the issue of establishing a government in Kowloon City has risen again. These two issues are related to Sino-British treaties and sovereignty, and are long-standing unresolved cases. The matter has developed to the present, and after careful consideration, I believe that reporting is necessary.

The Kowloon City issue was already a topic of national discussion during the time when Gan Jiehou and Zu Ren were special envoys for foreign affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi before the war. Sino-British exchanges and negotiations were frequent, but there was no result. It was not until the outbreak of the War of Resistance that it came to a standstill. According to the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory, signed on June 9, 1898, although Kowloon City is located within the leased territory of the New Territories, its sovereignty still belongs to China. The treaty clearly stipulates: "The Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City shall continue to exercise their functions there, provided that they do not interfere with the military requirements of the defence of Hong Kong." It was also agreed: "It is further agreed that the old jetty near Kowloon City shall be reserved for the convenience of Chinese men-of-war, merchant and passenger vessels, boats and junks, as well as for the convenience of Chinese officials and citizens." The original residents of Kowloon City, by virtue of the above provisions, settled down, not subject to British law, and not paying taxes to the Hong Kong government, for a period of two or three decades. After 1931, the British began to release information about demolishing the city walls and building roads, ordering the original residents (there were hundreds of households) to move out. The residents elected representatives to seek assistance in Guangzhou, and the Kowloon City issue arose from this point. Kowloon City belongs to the jurisdiction of Xin'an County (known as Xin'an County in the Qing Dynasty, Kowloon City is the walled city of Jiulong Division of Xin'an County). Although the treaty stipulates that it is still territory under our country's sovereignty, it is a small place that has long been forgotten by the Chinese people. The original Tonghai Pier (named Longjin Pier) has been filled in due to British land reclamation projects. It is surrounded by leased territory. The city walls are built on a mountain (see circle). There is very little flat land in the city, only two official buildings and one civilian alley. At most, it is like a small village. If the Hong Kong government had complied with the treaty and allowed the residents to live in the city in peace, our authorities would have had no reason to make a fuss or cause trouble. Kowloon City is located in the foothills of the mountains and does not hinder traffic. Why did the British suddenly want to demolish the city walls and build roads when they were living in peace and harmony? It is already incomprehensible. Later, they forced the residents to move out, and were willing to choose another location to build a "new village" for the residents in exchange for their original properties in the city, which is especially unpredictable. At that time, some residents fell for the "inducement and threats" and abandoned their original homes in the city, moving to the "new village" built by the British. However, a small number of people who understood the righteousness could not bear to separate from their ancestral homes that had been passed down from generation to generation, and they were still reluctant to leave. The special envoy for foreign affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi was ordered to negotiate with the Hong Kong government again and again. Although the British demolished some of the houses of those who had moved away, they never dared to demolish the city forcefully. This city that the British were hesitant to

Demolish

Was completely demolished by the Japanese invaders when they invaded Hong Kong in order to develop the Kai Tak Airport outside the city. Kowloon City has been destroyed twice by the British and Japanese, and its appearance has been completely changed. A house that was converted from the former government office into a home for the elderly was renovated by Christians before the war and has now become the only complete building left in the city. Next to it is a free school, which is now dilapidated and about to collapse. All other places are overgrown with weeds and roads are indistinguishable. After the war, in order to ensure sovereignty over the southern border, the Bao'an County authorities, in accordance with the treaty, reported to the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Commissioner's Office for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi. The Guangdong Provincial Government then reported to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They personally planned to establish a law in Kowloon City. Telegrams and letters were exchanged for many months. Recently, the county authorities received a reply from the higher authorities approving the plan and specially sent the chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the county government to Hong Kong to discuss with the Commissioner's Office for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi. As soon as this news was published in the Hong Kong newspapers, the Kowloon City issue was excavated from the memory of the general public. However, this time it has changed from preventing the demolition of the city to negotiating the establishment of a government, which just happened to be published in the newspapers shortly after the news that our government was conducting negotiations with the British on the establishment of a Chinese court in Kowloon. The overseas Chinese could not help but feel a deep yearning for the sovereignty that they had lost. The Xinsheng Evening News of September 14 published a special issue on the establishment of a government in Kowloon City, exploring the issue systematically from a historical perspective.

When this incident had already aroused an unusual reaction among the overseas Chinese, because the "diplomatic position" of our diplomatic mission in Hong Kong had not yet made an official statement, the spokesman of the Hong Kong government issued an official statement on the issue of Kowloon City governance within three hours after the publication of the special issue of the Xinsheng Evening News. We interpret the same treaty as the sovereignty of Kowloon City still belonging to our country. However, the Hong Kong government believes that "in fact, the wording and tone of the treaty do not coincide with the intention of not including Kowloon City." Therefore, "during the lease period, Kowloon City has become part of the expanded territory of the United Kingdom and is subject to British sovereignty." It further explained that "in 1899, the exercise of legal rights by Chinese officials in Kowloon City was no longer compatible with the military needs of the defence of Hong Kong, and therefore the exercise of these legal rights was terminated."

After the Hong Kong government's statement was issued, right and wrong were determined by reviewing the original text of the treaty. The next day, the Xinbao Newspaper's commentary, titled "The Kowloon City Issue," "corrected the original text of the treaty" to the Hong Kong government, believing that "what the Hong Kong government spokesman said seems to be somewhat far-fetched," because "there is only the 1898 treaty regarding the Kowloon City issue, and there have been no other changes since then." The Hong Kong government's statement, "it is not known what other basis there is?" The newspaper made a heartfelt conclusion, saying: "In such close Sino-British friendship, we believe that the words of general spokesmen need to be prudent. Otherwise, misunderstandings will be trapped in misunderstandings, and it will be difficult to resolve them."

On the 15th, the Xinsheng Evening News published a commentary titled "The Hong Kong Government's Statement on Kowloon City," saying: "Although the treaty at the time did not explicitly stipulate that the land rights within the Kowloon City area were outside the scope of the Kowloon leased territory, the legal governance rights within the city were clearly stipulated to be retained by the Chinese side... We are willing to seek the correctness of the facts... We are not satisfied with the Hong Kong government's statement... This issue of the Kowloon Lease Treaty is related to Hong Kong itself, and also to the Sino-British allies. We hope and expect a word from our diplomatic authorities to dispel doubts and correct misunderstandings."

### Regarding Temple Issues

Concerning the Shanghai Municipal Council's passage of "Appropriating Temples," which led to a petition from Shanghai's monks requesting reconsideration and revocation, Tai Xu is currently ill and recuperating. Moreover, the Shanghai incident can be addressed by the Buddhist Association requesting the wisdom of the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government, so he did not intervene. After reading the "Why Must Temples and Monks Misunderstand?" editorial in your esteemed newspaper on the 21st, the concluding remarks mention Tai Xu, mistakenly praising me as a wise man. Overwhelmed with shame and gratitude, I must address some humble opinions while ill, and request that you publish them.

(1) The original article states, "Since the Republic of China, it has been common practice everywhere to borrow Buddhist halls for schools." This follows the flawed policies of the Qing Dynasty, evolving into a bad habit. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, the central government has repeatedly issued prohibitions, but it is still difficult to curb this "evil trend." How can this be encouraged again? (2) The Temple Supervision Regulations were established by the Legislative Yuan in 1929, concerning Buddhist and Taoist temples in the mainland. The law clearly stipulates that "temple property belongs to the temple" – (private corporate entity) – managed by the abbot – (legal representative) – and cannot be altered without the resolution of the affiliated religious association (such as the Buddhist Association for Buddhist temples) and approval from the Ministry of Interior. Therefore, temple property clearly belongs to the "private property of a private corporate entity or private social organization." Public, but public only within its corporate or social structure, like Buddhist temples, Catholic churches, Christian churches, and Muslim mosques. (3) The Temple Supervision Regulations require Buddhist temples to engage in charitable and public welfare activities, encouraging Buddhist monks to initiate these activities voluntarily. Tai Xu, through the Chinese Buddhist Association, has repeatedly advised religious associations and temples in various provinces, cities, and counties to initiate these activities voluntarily, and many have already done so. Previously, the Ministry of Interior established the Implementation Measures for Temples Engaging in Charitable and Public Welfare Activities. The Ministry of Education also involved a clause on encouraging the use of ancestral halls and temples for establishing primary schools in counties and townships. Some provinces or counties, based on this, have enacted separate regulations or illegally occupied Buddhist temples and seized monastic property. Recently, the Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Buddhist Association, addressing these malpractices, consulted and petitioned the Ministry of Social Affairs, which then forwarded it to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has already approved the revocation of the Implementation Measures for Temples Engaging in Charitable and Public Welfare Activities, the Ministry of Education's clause on encouraging the use of Buddhist temples for primary schools in counties and townships, and certain provincial or county regulations concerning "infringement of temple rights." The approval was issued two months ago, and it is assumed that the governments of various provinces, cities, and counties have already been informed of the Executive Yuan's approval. (4) When local autonomous organizations lack office space, there are many ways to appropriate local public buildings, utilize public land for construction, or rent private houses. Buddhist temples, like Catholic churches, are "private property of private corporate entities or private social organizations." Appropriating Buddhist temples is no different from appropriating private property of the people. (5) Although it is explained that "appropriation refers to Confucian temples, Yue Fei temples, and other temples dedicated to sages, or city god temples and other local deity temples, or abandoned temples without owners as defined in the Temple Supervision Regulations, these should be discussed separately," for religious temples such as Buddhist temples, borrowing should be considered. Furthermore, the assertion that Buddhist temples are built with collective funds and therefore belong to local public property is also incorrect. As for requesting a lease, it should be the same as leasing private property of ordinary people. Why specifically single out temples for borrowing, creating room for forced borrowing? To quell the city's monks' shock, anger, fear, and anxiety, I urge the wise authorities of the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government to take the following actions swiftly: (1) The Municipal Council should reconsider the "appropriating or borrowing temples" clause, revising it to "appropriating city god temples or abandoned temples without owners." As for requesting a lease, the person seeking the lease should negotiate with the property owner for consent. (2) The Municipal Government should immediately order those forcibly occupying temples to evacuate, to avoid causing constant fear and anxiety among all the monks and temples in the city. Your esteemed newspaper holds the leading position in public opinion, admired by millions. May it guide the monks and temples of the city to stability, so that they can promote the Buddha's great compassion, serve society, and assist in civil governance. I humbly request your esteemed newspaper to correct and guide me. Sincerely, Tai Xu, September 21st

### Weekly Forum: People Who Oppose Atomic Warfare

— Yuan Dazhong

Those who understand the benefits and harms of atomic warfare invariably oppose it; however, the psychology and effects of their opposition are not uniform. If analyzed, they can be divided into the following three types:

The first type of people neither possesses atomic bombs nor hopes to possess them, and certainly does not hope that others possess them either. They not only oppose atomic warfare, but also oppose all wars. Therefore, they not only do not have any intention or preparation for atomic warfare, but also possess few weapons of any kind for use in war. They can be said to be truly peace-loving; however, how much power do they possess to maintain peace? It is very, very little! Once they encounter the invasion of "barbarians," how will they defend themselves against violence to preserve the lives of their nation and maintain peace for the world? They have no confidence in themselves. At the same time, the ambition of the barbaric invaders is strengthened, and they regard this group of peace-lovers as a delicious and easily acquired prize.

The second type of people already possess atomic bombs, but they do not approve of aggression. Therefore, although they possess this particularly fierce weapon, they do not hope to use it; although they do not hope to use it, they cannot help but prepare for it, lest it be used by others. They are just as peace-loving as the first type of people, but they also have the power to maintain peace; they not only do not allow themselves to invade, but also do not allow others to invade. Therefore, they are often the sworn enemies of aggressors, seeing them as thorns in their eyes and splinters in their flesh.

The third type of people hope that they themselves will possess atomic bombs, while also fearing that others will possess atomic bombs, and even more fearing that others will possess atomic bombs before them. Therefore, they desperately encourage domestic research into atomic bombs and the manufacture of atomic bombs, regarding atomic bombs as their first life, even to the point of neglecting sleep and meals, and being willing to sacrifice everything to obtain this most lethal weapon, even resorting to theft, robbery, deception, and every possible trick to seize atomic bombs from others' hands. However, at the same time, before they have definitely obtained atomic bombs, they are also there opposing atomic bombs and atomic warfare. During the period when they have not yet possessed atomic bombs, they are of course at the forefront of opposing atomic warfare; once they obtain atomic bombs, it is difficult to say whether they will still oppose atomic warfare. They merely advocate that atomic bombs should be openly shared, which is different from abolishing atomic bombs altogether. They do not advocate that all secret weapons should be openly shared, especially those parts that they possess exclusively. They also do not advocate abolishing all weapons that are inferior to atomic bombs, or prohibiting the use of these weapons. Therefore, it is impossible not to doubt whether they oppose atomic warfare for the sake of maintaining world peace and for all mankind, or whether they oppose atomic warfare in order to achieve absolute victory for their own country in future wars. At the very least, their anti-war stance is not necessarily thorough. Are they aggressors? We do not need to criticize or defend them, as the facts will speak for themselves, and future generations will have their own public opinion.

Opposing war, of course, includes all wars, not just opposing atomic warfare. If one only opposes atomic warfare and does not prohibit other lethal weapons, what is the meaning of this action? Mencius asked, is there a difference between killing a man with a stick and with a knife? This is the same principle. The three Axis powers of Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan did not possess atomic bombs, but the entire world had already been disrupted by them to the point of shifting mountains and valleys, and drying up rivers and boiling seas. This proves that the third type of people who oppose atomic warfare but do not oppose all wars have ulterior motives.

Opposing war is opposing unprovoked challenges, not opposing the normal defense of those who are challenged. What is most hateful now is that people do not distinguish between right and wrong, but mix up challenges and responses, failing to clearly distinguish between them. Since there is no public right or wrong in the world, aggressors are able to openly reverse black and white, trying to conceal the truth from the eyes of the world. Like the Axis powers of the past, they clearly invaded the territories of neighboring countries and plundered the property of neighboring countries, but still euphemistically called it self-defense. Such blatant deception is only possible because the deceived are too muddled, giving ambitious people the opportunity to deceive.

Now, among the second type of people, there are actually some who generously propose to take out atomic bombs for open sharing or to destroy them without using them. This theory cannot be said to be ungreat or ignoble. However, at this time, to utter such grand but impractical pronouncements is unavoidable in being impractical, rash, and even muddled. We do not oppose the open sharing of atomic bombs, but there is a prerequisite: all those who participate in this open sharing must first guarantee that they will never individually abuse this weapon. If one does not ask about intentions, does not distinguish between benefits and harms, and engages in open sharing indiscriminately, who can guarantee that this powerful weapon will not be abused by ambitious people taking advantage of the situation? We should not think that once it is openly shared, everyone will possess powerful weapons, and they will naturally restrain each other, and no one will dare to strike first! Consider the past hundred years, among the great powers, have they not all maintained a considerable balance of power, and have not all powerful countries possessed considerable weapons and equal strength? However, war has still not been avoided! This proves that open sharing is not enough to restrain each other and reduce the ambition of aggressors. The reason for this is that while major weapons can maintain a balance of power, other auxiliary functions are inevitably superior or inferior, skillful or clumsy. Even if the advantages and disadvantages are offset and the forces are evenly matched, the role of timing is still very important. Therefore, aggressors often strive for initiative and the first move, as can be seen in the case of the Axis fascist countries. In the case of other weapons, one can still use space to resist time, and those at a distance can still take a defensive posture and gradually seek a turnaround. For example, the conspiracy of Pearl Harbor relied on the distance of the ocean, and Japan could only use a single act of deception to seize an initial victory, but failed to achieve a decisive final victory with it. The future will be different. If those who possess atomic bombs also imitate the conspiracy of Pearl Harbor to launch a sudden surprise attack, then even if the attacked have ultra-special weapons and a large amount of military equipment, they will probably die before they can even resist, or even before they can detect or feel the attack!

The three major culprits of world war have certainly already been brought to justice and perished, but we should not think that there is no one to succeed them. Humans all harbor a sense of superiority, especially those who have just entered civilization from barbarism, who have an even more arrogant view of the world. In the future, even if all nations and humans are civilized and progress to roughly equal levels, the sense of superiority may be reduced somewhat, but the positions of various countries and ethnic groups will still be difficult to force into uniformity, and wealth and strength will ultimately not be equal. The poor and weak will inevitably feel envy and jealousy towards the rich and strong, while the rich and strong will show little sympathy for the poor and weak, or even become arrogant as a result. In particular, countries that are strong but not rich are like gangsters coveting wealthy merchants, always thinking of robbing them for their own pleasure.

Some say that the reason why a few strong countries are suspicious of each other and cannot cooperate sincerely is because atomic bombs cannot be openly shared; therefore, the countries that "have not" cannot help but be apprehensive about the countries that "have." This often has a partial justification in human nature and physics. However, this is not the case in reality. The countries that do not possess atomic bombs account for nineteen-twentieths of the total, and most of them belong to the first type of people mentioned in this article. Their sovereignty and lives are still completely unprotected, but they do not dispute the possession of atomic bombs. They also have very little suspicion or distrust of the countries that possess atomic bombs, and some even want to take shelter under their wings, using their power to maintain temporary peace. At the same time, there are also some who are trembling with fear, feeling that their future is uncertain, but what they find worrisome and fearful is not the people who possess atomic bombs, but precisely those who have not possessed atomic bombs and are trying their best to possess atomic bombs.

The power of atomic bombs is indeed terrifying. The dropping of just two atomic bombs changed Japan's last-ditch resistance and led to its sudden surrender. This is indeed a major threat to aggressive and warlike countries; however, if those who possess atomic bombs can truly work for the common good of the world, it is difficult to predict. However, as of now, the countries that possess this special weapon have not abused their special weapons to invade other countries, and they do not have this intention. Their political systems also do not allow them to harbor this intention. Therefore, I feel that what was said in the previous section, that the suspicion caused by "have-nots" towards "haves" hinders international cooperation, is just a pretext to cover up their aggression. For the past year, whether it is the second type of people who are invading or the third type of people who are invading, the facts speak for themselves, and this article does not need to discuss it further. They are already so rampant even before they possess the most lethal weapon. Once they have it in their hands, what will they do? The few countries that possess this powerful weapon are unable to abuse it due to their special political systems, which is the greatest advantage of democratic countries. However, when it comes to resisting aggression and taking the initiative, the advantages of democratic countries become weaknesses. The third type of people see this point, so they are afraid of it on the surface, but not really afraid of it in reality; although they are not afraid of it, they do not dare to expand too quickly, to avoid provoking it. Therefore, the third type of people can only conspire to cast nets for a few prey at this time, and cannot immediately devour them. This is their greatest regret at present.

In the future, if the second type of people do not consider carefully and only sing high-sounding tunes and talk about openness, this will be exactly what the third type of people want, and will trap the first type of people, who truly love peace and account for the largest number in the world, in an endless sea of suffering!

### The Weak Emperor Guangxu

— Tao Xiong

Reading "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"

Emperor Guangxu, that pitiful soul! He had no opinions of his own, and even when he did, he was never allowed to act on them. If he did, he feared his mother’s [Empress Dowager Cixi's] disapproval. Thus, he could only treat others’ wills as his own, walk the path that others had arranged for him, and await the fate that others had bestowed upon him. In the end, he harmed himself and others. A perfectly good empire was carved up by imperialists from east to west, leaving it in shambles. If only he had decided to do everything according to his own convictions, regardless of the path Cixi had laid out for him, with the country, society, and the people as his priorities. He should have initiated a revolution within his family the moment it was mentioned, preferring not to be emperor but insisting on having his own will! Then, China wouldn't have been reduced to such a miserable state!

Nevertheless, Emperor Guangxu was still a good person, a pitifully useless good person. He had no will of his own and dared not have one. Cixi wanted him to like those he disliked, to marry someone he didn't love, and he dared not disobey, let alone refuse! But only he knew these pains! This was the retribution he deserved for lacking will and perseverance! The bitter fruit he had to eat!

He lacked the courage to resolve these small personal matters, so how could he have the courage to resolve national affairs? Could he only let his mother rule and resolve everything? As a result, this great land was plunged into chaos! Repeated land cessions and indemnities, loss of sovereignty and national humiliation, left the country riddled with holes!

Whether you are a great figure or a small one, you can give up anything, but you must have your own will! You must not lack perseverance! Otherwise, you will end up with endless regrets! People with weak wills and personalities, you can look at Emperor Guangxu in "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" as a lesson from the past!

### Watching the Rehearsal of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"

— Xiao

I just arrived from Nanjing, and before I even washed the dust off my face, I went to the China Electric Theatre Group on Haig Road to see a friend. I didn’t expect to meet so many friends, all from Chongqing. They were rehearsing the first part of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court." In this scorching heat, even fanning oneself felt too hot, yet they were wearing dragon robes and court boots, leisurely making a living in the palaces of the Manchu era! The director was still Mr. Yang Cunbin, who could freely bring his designs to the stage as he both wrote and directed. This group of good actors with a serious work ethic will not let this play fail.

In the rehearsal room, apart from the voices of the director and actors, there was no noise. They were quietly rehearsing, again and again. There was no impatience, no complaints. They were learning humbly because they believed that "true works of art" are not easily produced! It is shameful to use deceptive means to win the audience's applause! Apart from the actors, the enthusiasm of the costume and special effects staff was also truly admirable! So many ancient and colorful costumes, a belt, a hat—they were constantly dressing this person, remembering to modify that one. And the special effects? The drum beats were wrong, again and again… These unsung heroes were working there with their heads down! They were cautiously and tremblingly awaiting the birth of this "work of art"!

After the play was rehearsed, I forgot my dusty face, my tired body, I forgot to leave! I watched these young friends, who had returned to their monkey-like jumping, frolicking, and joking, performing a "comedic relief" after work. I thought, this is true rigorous work, lively life. I said to my friend with lingering attachment:

"Are you rehearsing tonight too?"

"Yes! How can we not rehearse? We haven't even finished five-tenths of the play!" He wiped his sweat while taking off his costume, folding it neatly and handing it to the costume staff.

"This part can be shown! I watched it and forgot where I was!"

"Not enough! Not enough! Far from it! We have to work harder! — I wonder what kind of reaction this first shot will have on the declining drama scene?…" Many thoughts…

From Chongqing, traveling down the river through Yichang, Hankou, and Nanjing, I met many friends engaged in drama work, all shaking their heads and sighing. It's hard to do theater these days, it's a money pit! The plays cultivated with a large amount of capital attract very few audiences. Losing money, accumulating debts, leading to the inability to stage a second play. This was the general situation everywhere I went. I heard that Shanghai is the same. What is the reason? Is it the impact of the civil war, the high cost of living, and heavy taxes that prevent audiences' salaries from affording a theater ticket? Or are the theater workers uneducated and unprogressive, disappointing theater enthusiasts who are unwilling to come to the theater to suffer and would rather seek other stimulation? This is indeed a problem worth studying. Otherwise, the entire drama movement will be unimaginable. I hope that this time, the Audience Performance Company's "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" can achieve success through humble learning! May this first shot be a "shot that soars to the sky"! Let the audience who once abandoned theater return to the theater! This company is prepared for you—dear audience!

The Audience Performance Company's "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" officially premiered tonight at the Lycée Français. This is not only good news for the audience but also signifies a new beginning.

### Performance of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"

— Yu Ping

The theater movement is experiencing a downturn, and the theater world is in chaos. Some are failing, some are changing careers, some are making a mess of things, while those who work seriously and conscientiously suffer endless pain, depression, and persecution. We blame the instability of society for causing such chaos, but theater workers themselves have not contributed much effort. Some escape, some turn a blind eye, some give way, and only a few persevere, holding steadfast to their posts and adhering to a serious attitude. Even fewer, in addition to persevering, devote themselves to hard work, clearing away the haze, and actively building. In this situation, how can the drama movement raise its head and turn itself around under multiple pressures?

The establishment of the "Audience Performance Company" brings new hope to the theater movement. They are the embodiment of the "hard work" and "China Electric" spirit, a group of smart fools. After taking off their old clothes, they immediately stand up and put on new ones. Their past style and artistic attitude have already been praised. Now, they especially emphasize their determination to "exist for, serve, and be loyal to the audience (not just cater to the audience)." Therefore, I believe they will be even more loved by the audience.

Their first performance, "Unofficial History of the Qing Court," is very appropriate. First, this is a historical play with a strong sense of realism, achieving great success in terms of historical perspective and writing technique. Second, this is not a preachy play but is beautiful, vivid, and deeply moving. Third, it has a group of brilliant, living characters. Coupled with the careful creation of a group of outstanding actors and stage staff from Hard Work and China Electric, I believe that this performance will mark a milestone in the progress of the theater movement.

### Blessings and Wishes for the Audience Performance Company

— Jing Wen

The Chinese fear "extinction" the most. Some time ago, when two young and promising troupes in the theater world, China Electric and Hard Work, collapsed, and those who were still alive were struggling and fighting with sick bodies, gasping for breath, sensitive people were worried whether the drama would be "extinct" from then on, becoming silent and disappearing without a trace, turning into a silent theater. Just then, the "Audience Performance Company" was born, which is indeed good news. Finally, someone inherited the "incense" of drama, so that the "lineage" would not be cut off.

Over the years, the persecution that drama has suffered is endless and cannot be fully described. It is truly a story of bitterness and tears. But now that victory has been achieved, all that is wanted is guns and not culture. The fires of civil war have destroyed people's happiness and hope, leaving the theater world devastated and desolate. The "Audience Performance Company" was born in such a time of suffering. We are truly concerned about how this small life will survive this dangerous journey.

However, we have seen that this small life is thriving and endearingly tenacious, not afraid of the wind or the rain, and stands up in the midst of the wind and rain, shouldering a hoe to reorganize and cultivate this desolate and broken land. Their confidence makes people feel that hope and light stand with them.

From the beginning, they knew that drama and the audience are inseparable. What drama would there be without an audience? Drama belongs to the audience, just as a democratic government belongs to the people. With the support and nourishment of the audience, this small life can grow stronger. They depend on the audience for survival. What the audience loves, they love; what the audience hates, they hate.

Now they are going to perform "Unofficial History of the Qing Court," and they will receive the audience's fair examination for the first time.

In addition to blessing them, there are six wishes:

1. May "Audience Performance" live to be a hundred years old.
2. May the theater world flourish.
3. May taxes no longer increase.
4. May theater people have a stable life.
5. May performances not be obstructed.
6. May the drama movement have smooth sailing.

### After Seeing "House of Loyalty"

— Wu Dapeng

Look! Among the films showing in Shanghai cinemas, eight or nine out of ten are appealing with pornography. So many young people are intoxicated in this fog. Aside from this, there are only nonsensical and meaningless films catering to the general low-level tastes of the audience. However, such films are a serious blow to the nation's culture, and can even be described as a fatal wound. But at this time, a domestic blockbuster containing a sense of justice has met the people of Shanghai. This is the performance of "House of Loyalty," creating a rare brilliance in our film industry.

The content of "House of Loyalty" narrates the loyalty of a family through three generations. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, they consistently struggled to the death against the enemy with unyielding integrity in the face of power and unshaken resolve in poverty. This film, relying on the superb techniques of the director and the earnest performances of the actors, has won unanimous praise. The male lead, played by Liu Qiong, is also the most successful actor in the film. He plays two roles, one as Hua Weigang, a patriotic aviator serving in the air force, and the other as Hua Gengzhai, the gray-haired, elderly grandfather. He expresses the spirit of both characters through different actions and words. This success is indeed not accidental, but entirely due to his skilled acting and refined Mandarin. The female lead, Qin Yi, plays Weigang's wife, who is also Gengzhai's daughter-in-law. Several scenes are very moving. Others, such as Ye Xiaozhu, who plays the grandson Damin, Yansu, who plays the Korean youth, and Tian Jun, who plays the air force comrade, all fully express their patriotic emotions. Han Tao, Fang Bo, Zhuang Kai, and others also performed well, adding a lot of color to the film.

After watching this movie "House of Loyalty," the audience will have endless feelings in their minds. Blockades, squeezing household rice – which compatriots in the occupied areas have not tasted this bitterness? Relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, acting as accomplices for tigers and preying on the people, the traitors will certainly be punished by national law. But we can never forget the fascist's cruel trampling. Anyway, with eyes full of blood, we still have to settle accounts with them. The magnanimity of a great nation must have its limits.

In short, this is a true depiction of blood and tears. Finally, I sincerely recommend "House of Loyalty" to all the citizens of Shanghai.

Speaking of Stage Technology

### Costumes and Colors

— Wenquan

Due to the evolution of humanity, the colors in clothing have become the brushes of the new era. They explain the season, illustrate national characteristics, and provide a new demonstration of the human spirit. They imitate nature, compress the splendor of the universe and human thought onto the warp and weft. Density surpasses nature, specificity surpasses historical records; it has become humanity's darling, humanity's good friend!

From a personal perspective, it explains the character's personality, age, identity, season, and sudden events (such as weddings and funerals, etc.), and can predict to others extremely correctly, sensitively, and quickly.

In a materially developed society, it is trying to break the habit of people dressing for the sake of dressing, replacing it with the power of dressing for the sake of color. This power is gradually increasing its artistic value.

In drama, this power will be allowed to be fully exerted and is deeply welcomed by the art of drama. H.K. Moderwell said: "The stage picture is vivid and dramatic; its special beauty lies in action, in the participation of people. It is moving, while painting is static. Therefore, the stage picture has great vitality and sharp contrast." He explained two points here: the stage picture is moving, and this movement must have acting people to participate in, and then can produce the great vitality of the picture. Since the color on the clothing is attached to the body of the acting person, in spirit (drama) and in image (painting), it is a powerful factor that promotes the movement of the stage picture. This factor exudes the conflict of the human spirit, making the imageless picture become tangible, making the environment and characters like the atmosphere and all things on earth, producing inevitable causes and effects, the connection between life and death. At the same time, it stimulates the movement of the characters, making the static art of painting become the moving art of decoration. It acts as a mediator between humans and God, creating all things and glorifying the universe, completing the brilliant art of drama.

Now, take Benois's design for D'Annunxio's La Pisanall as an example to find proof of the great success of costume color in the overall color of the play:

In the prologue, in a rich interior with deep purple and bright green colors, decorated with gold and full of religious atmosphere, he introduced the two main characters with two extremely strong complementary colors: bright yellow (queen's clothes) and fishy red (prince's clothes). Then, in the first act, he laid a warm and hot orange-red on a rough black line, outlining a pier for anchoring ships. On this pier came countless rich and hot-colored, chaotic suitors, proposing to a female slave. Later, the prince came, wearing white clothes and riding a white horse. When the female slave accepted the prince's love, she put on the prince's white clothes and rode away on the white horse.

In the second act, he used calm pure blue, stylized white patterns, and added a little red-orange brushstrokes appropriately. The nuns wore white and gray-blue clothes. The entire monastery was filled with peace and tranquility. When the monastery was blasphemed by Prince Antlock bringing prostitutes in, a fresh, secular color destroyed the tranquil scene.

In the third act, they returned to the palace's glory and cruelty. La Pisanell was about to be executed due to the queen's conspiracy. The curtain used in this act was deep green with golden patterns. The overall color composition was extremely complex, but it is worth mentioning that there was a special red color throughout the act, varying in depth and gradually deepening. Near the end, the red became deeper and turned purple. Finally, the slaves re-entered the stage, all wearing purple-red costumes, bringing a pile of purple-red bouquets. This extremely hot color finally suffocated the woman.

His bold use of color has earned him immortal fame. It also proves that the power of color in clothing does indeed contribute to drama.

### Cleansing of Emotions

— Guanyu

A stain on a piece of white silk can be washed in clean water to restore its whiteness.

In a person's heart, only art can restore peace to emotional troubles.

Dramatic art must have the function of "cleansing." It must make the audience in the theater forget themselves, otherwise the performance of this script is a failure.

We need scripts with progressive consciousness. We need scripts with dramatic quality even more. A script that combines these two must be a successful and good script! It must also be a script that the audience likes and readily accepts!

Many scripts that only have progressive consciousness are welcomed by intellectuals, but they are not necessarily welcomed by all audiences!

Many scripts that have dramatic quality are very popular with the audience, but they are not necessarily liked by intellectuals!

Many audiences go to the theater for entertainment, not to be educated. True artists work for social education, not to be entertained. How to narrow the distance between these two should be the responsibility of the playwright!

The script must have the power to control the audience's emotions! The audience must also feel a force pressing on them when they leave the theater. Otherwise, neither side's purpose has been achieved! The artist has not achieved the purpose of education, and the audience has not obtained the result of entertainment!

The audience only goes to the theater when they are bored and troubled. If the theater cannot satisfy them, they will stand up and leave! The audience who comes out of love is only the smallest number of the total. Treating them as important as eating is the smallest of the smallest minority!

Artists, never face the audience with a stern face and say: I am educating you!

If the audience cannot accept it, don't say: The intellectual level is too low!

Everything, everything should start from yourself. In any case, you should first let the audience accept your things. But you must not cater to the audience!

The audience is a piece of white silk with a stain, and the artist is a pool of clean water. When the audience walks out of the theater, you must restore the whiteness of this piece of white silk!

Spring and Autumn

### Renaissance and Friendship Among Writers

— Hualin

In the last Spring and Autumn supplement, an article was published titled "Literary Friendship and Political Relations," which was extremely sincere. The most precious thing in the world is friendship. Moreover, what literary artists admire in nature are the clear breeze on the river and the bright moon in the mountains, certainly not profit, emoluments and wealth; even if literary artists are involved in politics, they are not the kind of opportunists of politicians. They have a kind of patriotic enthusiasm, or the idea of saving the world and humanity!

Literary artists who become politicians and use literature as a tool for power struggles naturally will not have "true friendship"! Moreover, it is impossible to unite these speculators into one body. What we need now is friendship, to engage in the literary renaissance movement from true friendship, and then our work can begin. Now, let me raise one thing for everyone to discuss and advise on:

We often have opportunities to meet and talk. It is best to solicit and select one or two cafes or tea rooms in a convenient location with convenient transportation, and explain to the owner to cooperate by special appointment one or two days a week as a gathering place for literary artists. Rome's "Gongdao Di" and Paris's "Montparnasse" all have literary cafes. During the Chongqing period, we also had a "Saturday Evening Tea" gathering.

This is just a literary association of writers, but it is our urgent requirement! Starting with true friendship, we will then strive for local cultural construction, establish various literary and artistic societies, and suggest that the state guarantee the lives of writers and subsidize research and publishing undertakings, so that we can then promote it to the whole country to become a unified movement. After this great war, what we have learned is that no one can survive outside the world. The whole world is closely related. Any corner of the world can affect the safety of the whole world! Therefore, we must further communicate Chinese and Western cultures, accept new trends in the world, and wash away the corrupt air of China.

When we engage in the literary renaissance movement, we should of course start with writers' association and aim at the "whole world." We will carry forward China's inherent culture and contribute it to the world. Any academic thought in the world will be gathered in China to stabilize the future destiny of the world!

Political relations are temporary, and friendship is immortal! The expansion of friendship is the interest of life. "Gathering friends through literature, and assisting benevolence through friends." "The wind and rain are like night, but the rooster does not stop crowing." Only a selfless and philanthropic idea can have true friendship! Only true friendship can unfold the literary renaissance movement of the new era!

### Cup

— Haoran

Picking up a bright, clear, pure white and lovely glass, I am silently immersed in a pool of thoughtful stillness! Indeed, I love it, not because it is light and exquisite, noble and rich, but because it deeply represents sincere emotion and the taste of life!

No one can live without a cup for a day, just as no fish can live without water for a moment, because it is closely connected with life. A person who is separated from a cup is like a fish out of water. Even if he can barely survive for a very short time, the lips of death have already unfolded a knowing smile; he will not be able to feel the universal love of God, and a dark world is opening its gloomy walls for him!

However, what people ask for is not a plain and ordinary life, a silent and odorless life...

If life is a blank and smooth sheet of paper, then the cup is a red, yellow, blue, and purple crayon; if life is a bowl of transparent and bland clear water, then the cup is a bottle of sweet, sour, bitter, spicy flavors; it will make the colorless colorful and the tasteless flavorful, even though some tones are strong and some tastes are pungent. This is not because people like strangeness and are unwilling to be ordinary, but because of the irresistible arrangement of the Creator.

Yes, the path of the world is rugged, life is turbulent, and the flow of emotion is the tide of the seashore, not the autumn water of the pond. Laughter, hot tears, sighs, and anger are intertwined to form a pattern of life. The joy of congratulating birth is still there, but the sorrow of mourning death arises again. The banquet for friends to wash away the dust of travel has not yet dispersed, and the farewell cup is about to be raised in a hurry. What power can prompt you to follow a certain life track? What comb can sort out the tangled threads of your mind? Birth, separation, death, farewell, joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, in the hall, in front of the spirit, in the laughter, in the tears, isn't it always and everywhere inseparable from a single cup?

Not only is the source of life, the striker of emotions, but the cup is also a symbol of peace! Barbarian beasts need beverages, but they cannot use cups; soldiers at war long for water, but they do not have the leisure to raise a cup; only the land where champagne is overflowing is the area where peace and happiness reach. With a cup in hand, all thoughts disappear. How much hostility and jealousy, how many sins and conspiracies, how much misfortune and resentment, all turn into nothing in the glittering nectar! If the heads of state of all countries could meet once every Christmas, talk openly and sincerely, and raise a cup to wish each other well, the tragedy of war would inevitably be reduced, and human life might be happier.

Pick up your cup and drink deeply! To celebrate the establishment of peace and the eternity of life!

### Wind and Rain on the River

— Xiaofeng

Angry wind blows over the riverbank, rolling up a piece of waves. Abrupt waves embrace each other, advancing, spreading, heavily pounding the rocks on the shore.

Rain silk, in the gust of wind, like light smoke, like thin mist, is permeated on the Jialing River. Raindrops continuously sprinkle in the river, stirring up dense small circles on the waves. Following the abrupt waves, advancing, spreading.

In the wind and rain, the small shops on the riverbank appear so deserted. Rainwater flows down from the straw-covered roof, pouring into the small ditch, flowing rapidly towards the river. People all hide inside the house, the owner of the shop, has also moved the stall with miscellaneous objects inside.

In the narrow tea shop, the people taking shelter from the rain are like the wind and waves on the river, turbulent, laughing. The noisy sound echoes the wind and rain outside the house.

On the riverbank battered by wind and rain, there are no pedestrians anymore. The boatmen moor their boats near the riverbank, tie the iron chains on the bow tightly on the rocks, and then sit quietly in the cabin, lighting a crude cigarette, silently watching the river battered by wind and rain.

The upward wooden boat slowly climbed over the shoal, the trackers took off the ropes on their backs. In the wind and rain, their naked bodies were soaked in the water, and they ran to the side of the boat in a commotion.

The wooden boat entered the bay, the punter put down the punt pole in his hand, collected the tow rope on the bow, pulled a long tow rope from the river, rolled it into a circle, and placed it on the boat. The boat turned its head and moored in the bay to avoid the wind and waves on the river.

A canopy-less fishing boat is rowing over from afar. The young fisherwoman is pulling up the fishing net with effort, supporting it on the bow. Rainwater soaked her hair, soaked her clothes. The old fisherman is rowing hard with the oars, paddling the boat forward. Raindrops condensed on his beard, rainwater flowed in the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.

"Dad, let's go back!" The daughter turned her head and said to her father.

"What a big rain!" The old fisherman muttered lowly, as if cursing, or as if sighing. The roaring wind answered him.

In the flowing wind, dense raindrops incessantly fall to the river, stirring up infinite small circles on the waves, advancing, spreading, and pounding the rocks on the shore.

### Dance End (Hetian Dance Star)

— Situ Qiao

### Reading in Tuanshan Fort

— Zong Baihua

The year before last, after the Allied forces captured Rome, news reporters went to interview Santayana, a contemporary great philosopher who was living in seclusion in the suburbs of Rome. An eighty-year-old man was still vigorously exploring the mystery of life, without feeling tired. The reporter asked him for his opinion on this World War. The suburbs of Rome were so close to the center of the artillery fire. Santayana replied leisurely: "I haven't had a newspaper for a long time. I now often live in the eternal world!"

What is this lovely and enviable eternal world?

For several years, because of avoiding air raids – not avoiding reality – I lived in a farmer's house near Dabo on the opposite bank of Baixi. In this turbulent era, my life was like a pool, only reflecting the bright moon between the pines and the clear breeze on the river. In the deep dark places of my heart, there is always a lurking desire, longing for hot life, vast world, and the trickling stream yearning for the sea.

One summer evening this year, my brother Situ Qiao suddenly visited. We had been separated for several years. I hurriedly asked him about his whereabouts after the parting. He said that he had been "a person of the east, west, north and south" in these years. He first went to the southeast corner of China, and then traveled to the northwest corner of China. From the scenery of the South China Sea to the desert mood, the breadth of his spiritual experience was both broad and deep, and he made countless paintings. I was extremely surprised when I heard this. I said that I must come to see your creations to fill the loneliness of my spirit in these years. On September 26th, my brother Wu Zixian and I agreed to go to Jin'gangpo Tuanshan Fort to visit Situ Qiao and fulfill brother Fu Baoshi's long-standing wish. Unexpectedly, the scenery around Tuanshan Fort is really picturesque. The high peaks on the back reach into the clouds, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden. The front has a wide view, and the distant mountains are like rings, with a myriad of images. Without the South China Sea and the northern border, this is already his "sea." The moon rises between the pines at night, which is especially quiet. Baoshi came and talked happily. In the morning, I asked Qiaoqing to show his works. Because a large part was being mounted, I didn't get to see the whole picture, which was quite disappointing. However, from what I saw, I deeply felt Qiaoqing's profound vision, broad interest, and skilled technique. And what satisfied me was that he could deeply understand and express the primitive meaning and the simple religious sentiment. This most precious and enviable honest religious sentiment in the northwest desert, this simple vitality, is really flavorful. Looking back at those walking corpses in our cities whose souls have long been emptied, how can we not be disgusted! "Morning Prayer," "Drinking Horses in the Wilderness," "Returning from the Horse Journey," "Autumn Water in the Tianshan Mountains," "Tea Chat," "Returning from the Glacier," etc., their beauty is not only in the image, color, and technique, but in the mood and atmosphere revealed in all of this, the deep feeling and vitality that are not decadent at all. This is what our art needs, and it is what our national character needs even more. Therefore, I hope that Qiaoqing's painting exhibition can have an impact on spiritual education.

But Qiaoqing can both paint passionate and moving, lively and leaping dancers, arousing my desire for life and feeling the rhythm of my body, and he also paints beautiful scenery that is light and dreamy, deep and poetic, which is intoxicating, and its taste is even more lasting. Perhaps because we are Orientals, we feel that there is unspeakable meaning in this "quiet realm," in this "silence," and in that painting "Farewell." The calligrapher uses new composition and new color scheme to write out the deepest music of our hearts here; here, on the surface it seems to be a new form, but in essence it is the ancient world feeling of the Orientals. Here I suspect that Qiaoqing was subtly influenced by his wife Yi Mei, because this has quite the artistic conception of the beauty of the words written by Yi Mei. It is said that Ms. Yi Mei is the first and most profound critic of every creation of Mr. Situ.

I stayed in the studio of Tuanshan Fort for two nights, enjoying the mountain scenery and snowy shadows, the night moon and morning glow, reading Qiaoqing's paintings and Yi Mei's poems. The next day, I went to bother brother Fu Baoshi again to admire his recent works and his wife's cooking. An unexpected gain was to get a booklet of small poems written by Situ Yuan (Qiaoqing's eldest daughter) from the age of four to nine, plus illustrations by Baoshi's son Xiaoshi of the same age. The booklet is named "Waves" and was published by brother Guo Moruo in the Siwei Small Series of the Political Department. This small book is full of innocent inspiration and the purest joy of life. Situ Yuan wrote his first poem at the age of four and a half in a boat from Shanghai to Guangdong:

"White waves, beautiful waves,

Every wave, every white rose."

Innocent imagination, innocent tone, innocent wording, really flavorful. And a poem "Sea Water":

"Sea water, really weird,

Rain comes and causes sores, wind comes and wrinkles the skin."

And a poem "Heavy Rain":

"Heavy rain falls,

The trees admire him very much,

The trees bow non-stop,

Bending their waists to the ground."

This is the real world. The world of childhood innocence is the eternal world where Santayana often lives, right?

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 40

— Ye Jingfeng

Generally speaking, Japanese military and political leaders throughout history have thoroughly studied our country's "Strategies of the Warring States," regarding it as a "sacred典of national strategy." Whether dealing with domestic or foreign affairs, whenever they take action, they invariably extract one or two plans from the "Strategies of the Warring States" and imitate them. The so-called "hostage negotiation案" here is roughly the method of Cao Mo coercing Duke Huan and Lin Xiangru coercing the King of Qin, but with the addition of modern gangster tactics.

The second step, if the kidnapping fails, is to use "forced negotiation," which means "doing it by force." They would assassinate several important figures on the spot. Regardless of the success of the assassination, the second step is to launch a military occupation. The date for formally launching the military force must have an "eight" in it due to historical superstition, so they chose to attack at dawn on the 28th. Therefore, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow (the 26th and 27th) will be a tense moment.

After I informed Mr. W of Tsurumi's secret telegram, Mr. W, because he couldn't explain it in a few words over the phone and was afraid of leaks, asked me to go to Wang Lengzhai nearby to explain and offer some advice on the spot.

From Changxindian to Wanping, there is only a limited short distance. However, at this time, in the Wanping area, there were Japanese "plainclothes sentries," who were actually special agents and ronin, as well as hired Chinese low-class thugs and rascals, lying in ambush on the ridges of the fields and in dark corners. As long as they saw a single pedestrian dressed even slightly neatly, they would either shoot at random or seize them and leave, using them as hostages for extortion. If the kidnapped person was a poor person or a peasant who couldn't be squeezed for money, they would definitely be shot or forced into hard labor. This way, they could create a terrifying and chaotic situation, and people's hearts would be shaken automatically.

Because the matter was urgent and imperative, I discussed a safe method with Number 04. In our station (including Number 04), there were five top shooters, so we arranged a "flexible sentry." Number 04 preceded me, maintaining a distance of about ten meters. The other four took a step further, scouting ahead about twenty meters to the left and right, establishing temporary sentry posts about forty to fifty meters away. Once Number 04 arrived, they would give a signal and continue scouting forward, and so on.

In fact, we could have easily taken a car and rushed straight to Wanping, but we didn't want to alarm the enemy. Moreover, once we alarmed the enemy, they would inevitably overreact and be unable to track our movements. In that case, our radio station would be in danger of being exposed.

Around nine o'clock, we arrived safely in Wanping. Mr. Lengzhai was already waiting there. I first detailed the contents of the secret telegram and then told him Mr. W's plan. Lengzhai was a man of extraordinary bearing. Just listening to him speak, you could tell that his knowledge and experience were unique. No wonder the Japanese had repeatedly tried to argue with him, but he had always refuted them and left them speechless. With such talent, if he were placed in the position of Song Zheyuan or Han Fuqu, at the beginning of the war of resistance, I'm afraid the Japanese invaders would have had difficulty crossing the Yellow River. Even if they crossed the river, it wouldn't have been so easy for them to move south.

We continued to discuss for a while, and I offered another method that could easily crack the Japanese first and second steps of their conspiracy. After listening, he pondered slightly and said, "Very appropriate." We also agreed on the procedure for notifying several important figures of this cracking method through different routes, and the code words we would use to communicate secretly over the phone. If this method was rejected by the local authorities, we would use the agreed-upon remedy.

On the way back to Changxindian, because it was past midnight, the journey was relatively dangerous. I remember we encountered no less than four or five ambushes by special agents, sometimes one person, sometimes two or three. We couldn't be polite about this; we could only eliminate them one by one. Because if even one got away, we would have endless trouble.

When we returned to the radio station, our base of operations, it was already past two o'clock in the morning. Although we were very tired, we still had the energy to persevere. I immediately drafted two coded reports, one replying to Mr. W and the other notifying Tsurumi, explaining the overall method of dealing with the Japanese "Three-Part March" conspiracy. Before resting, I also drafted a note, asking someone to deliver it to Dingyuan after breakfast, inviting him to come and talk.

Free Talk

### Taixu

— Shaofu

Because the Municipal Council passed the "Motion to Request the Municipal Government to Allocate Office Buildings for Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Promotion of Autonomy," which included the item "Appropriate or Borrow Temples and Public Buildings," it caused some monks from temples in this city to petition the Municipal Council in groups.

I thought of Master Taixu of Shanghai. Why is the master silent?

In July of the 32nd year [of the Republic], in Chongqing, I once visited Beiquan and Mount缙云, and visited the Han-Tibetan Buddhist Academy, which was then located in Jinyun Temple, and talked with Master Taixu, the director of the academy, for a few minutes.

I did not explain that I was a journalist. I met him as an ordinary tourist. In the short ten minutes, in addition to him leading me to view some souvenirs he brought back from his visit to India, I spent all my time watching this saint of a generation of Buddhism. I hoped to read from his bearing, expression, physique, and actions the extraordinary qualities of this religious believer. As for his original ideas and explanations on Buddhist studies, his several works are sufficient to explain them.

I have only one impression of the master: he is a person of perfect skill. The four words "perfect skill" may be the general public's view of profound Taoism. Insight, experience, and cultivation, beyond a certain level, a person's bearing naturally expresses a kind of serenity, solidity, and depth. I also felt this way about Bishop Yu Bin.

The master is not only accomplished in religious philosophy, but he also has a profound understanding of politics and society. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he did not spend his time as an outsider traveling to famous mountains and rivers or hiding in deep temples and ancient monasteries to live a life of green chimes and red fish. This is what we all know.

Therefore, regarding the Municipal Council's resolution to "appropriate or borrow temples and public buildings," I hope the master will take this opportunity to explain and convey his personal understanding of current politics to Buddhist disciples.

### Kisses Are Harmless

[Editor's Note] This article was written by the husband of the female writer Xie Bingxin. He studies natural science. In this article, he especially emphasizes that healthy men and women kissing does not carry the risk of transmitting germs on the lips, even if the woman is wearing lipstick.

The naivety and vitality of American children really exceed the ideals of our great power's gentry. They are willing to let rickshaw pullers sit in the rickshaws, and they themselves desperately pull the rickshaws, running and sweating profusely, or get down on the ground and let children who collect coal cinders ride them as horses. This looks a bit uncouth to our dignified gentlemen and ladies with appearances. However, here is something even more surprising to them.

The bacteriology class at the University of Washington recently conducted an experiment to study whether kissing transmits diseases. It is said that this scientific research was the most successful. The results of the experiment can prove that kissing between healthy people does not transmit any diseases.

Four Pairs of Students Kiss

Before the experiment, a professor in the biology department carefully selected four healthy male students and four healthy female students from the class, paired them into four couples, and asked them to hug and kiss naturally on campus and outside the classroom. The kissing method and mood should be as realistic as possible. However, after kissing, everyone had to immediately conduct a bacterial culture.

A bacterial culture dish is a circular shallow glass dish, more than three inches in diameter and less than one inch high. It has a bottom and a lid. The culture medium is made of beef broth with some agar. When heated and poured into the bottom of the bacterial culture dish and cooled, it becomes a jelly-like solid. After being covered and sterilized, it can be used. If bacteria or spores fall on the culture medium and are kept at a suitable temperature, the bacteria can grow. After a certain period of time, each original bacterium or spore can form a cluster of bacteria, which can be easily seen with the naked eye. Carefully counting the number of bacteria can represent how many original bacteria there were. If there are common bacteria on the students' lips, they will fall onto the culture medium after kissing.

These kissed bacterial culture dishes were placed in a thermostat to allow the bacteria to grow, preparing for a rigorous examination to see if the lips of these people who kissed would be infected with pathogenic bacteria.

On the lips of a man named Harrison, there were a few staphylococcus and some penicillin, all of which were harmless. On the lips of a student who had just been discharged from the air force, only a very small number of staphylococcus were found, which was considered the cleanest.

Bacteria on Female Lips

There are far more bacteria on female lips than on male lips, because women apply more powder and rouge, and the bacteria brought by powder and rouge are several times more than those obtained naturally. However, no pathogenic bacteria were found.

This successful study can very well demonstrate the naivety and vitality of American children, and at the same time provide a strong guarantee for those who like to kiss. But I doubt whether such results can be achieved in a hypocritical society.

### Suicide

Not being able to live makes people commit suicide, and not being able to succeed in love makes people take sleeping pills; but I have never heard of anyone committing suicide in anger because of unsuccessful artistic or scientific research!

### Urban Tumor: Venereal Diseases and Prostitutes

— Luo Baoluo

According to an estimate by the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau in June, there are approximately 50,000 to 60,000 prostitutes in Shanghai. According to the regulations of the Police and Health Bureaus, prostitutes in this city must go to the "Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center" on South Huangpi Road to have their bodies examined, and then those without diseases will be issued business licenses. From February 16 to June 6 this year, a total of 601 brothels and 1,777 prostitutes came to the center for examination. The examination results: 805 were suffering from syphilis, and 880 were suffering from uterine diseases. The situation of the remaining 40,000 or more private prostitutes who have not been examined is probably similar, spreading venereal diseases and poisoning society. It is really unthinkable!

Mr. Huake, an American professor at Yenching University in Peiping, traveled around the world in 1934 to investigate the prostitution system in various countries, and compared the number of prostitutes with the population of various cities to create a statistical table. According to the statistics, there is one prostitute for every 960 people in London, one for every 580 in Berlin, one for every 481 in Paris, one for every 430 in Chicago, one for every 150 in Tokyo, one for every 250 in Peiping, and the highest record is Shanghai, with one prostitute for every 130 people.

Terrible Numbers

In June of the 26th year [of the Republic], the Shanghai Times revealed a shocking fact. "According to a survey conducted by women's groups in recent months, there are a total of 349,744 women in the Public Concession, of whom 25,000 are engaged in the sex industry. There are a total of 277,300 women in the French Concession, and the concession has registered 390 brothels. In addition, there are 1,100 people who secretly prostitute themselves at any time." It can be seen that the estimate of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau is based on fact.

Obscene Works

The abundance of prostitutes and the prevalence of licentiousness in Shanghai have lasted for seventy or eighty years. In the past, there were some self-proclaimed romantic, bored, and unscrupulous literati who wrote about the historical facts of prostitutes, no less than dozens of kinds, such as "Shanghai Muddy Lane Miscellany," "Xiepu Fragrant Bush Records," "Shanghai Elegant Hundred Flowers Picture," "Singing of the Prosperity of Shanghai Foreign Court," "Maritime Beauties Records," "Spring River Flower History," "Shanghai Color Art Guide," "Sixty Years of Shanghai Flower World History," "Dream of Maritime Prosperity," "Nine-Tailed Turtle," "Human Hell," "Biographies of Flowers on the Sea"...etc., mostly in the form of novels. Among them, there are also those with the meaning of persuasion, but most of them are frivolous and obscene.

At the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, the general literati and poets of Shanghai had a more whimsical idea and carried out the so-called election of "President of the Flower Country," determining the president and vice president according to the number of votes. The first president elected was a prostitute named Guanfang Lao Wu. There were ten elections in total. This move seems absurd to us. But thirty or forty years ago, it was considered a romantic affair.

In addition to Shanghai, several major cities in our country, such as Nanjing, Hankou, Peiping, and Guangzhou, are almost concentrated places for public and private prostitutes. According to a survey in the 24th year of the Republic [of China], there were more than 20,000 prostitutes in Guangzhou alone.

In today's society, life is difficult. Some women who have nowhere to go are forced to sell themselves. There are also girls from poor families who are sold to brothels. On the other hand, due to the economic downturn, single men have to go to brothels to seek satisfaction in order to solve their sexual desires.

Therefore, economic and physiological reasons have caused the prostitution problem to always become a serious social problem. If you want to remove this urban tumor—prostitution—you must start from the root. First, stabilize people's livelihoods, improve women's education, train their work skills, and establish women's relief homes to settle those lonely and helpless women. This method is at least more effective than simply relying on a ban.

### There Are Many Beasts in Shanghai

— Ling Yun

Senator Wu Zhengxu, in view of the fact that there are too few birds and beasts in Shanghai, advocated expanding the zoo. However, if the authorities are determined to expand the zoo, then not to mention two places, even twenty places can be established immediately. Because Shanghai is full of "beasts in clothing"!

Random Thoughts on Current Affairs

### Puyi and War Booty

— Guizhou

After Japan surrendered, one country acted like a person who had lost their senses and did many inexplicable things. The most prominent of these were obstructing Korean independence, moving our country's industrial equipment in the Northeast, etc., and even hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war were "hidden" in Siberia and not repatriated for years. The world was amazed by this, and the Japanese were even more anxious. Therefore, recently in Tokyo, three thousand women and children marched in a petition. A few years ago, Japanese women organized a "Husband-Seeking Group" to petition the government. Now, there is a need to reorganize the "Husband-Seeking Country"!

The Japanese prisoners of war reminded me of Puyi. Although Puyi was a Japanese lackey, he was still a Chinese and should be subject to Chinese law. We are very grateful that the heroic Red Army "liberated" the Northeast. We also think it is reasonable to detain Puyi, but why does our country repeatedly request the extradition of Puyi, but the Soviet Union refuses to agree? Is Puyi also "war booty"? General MacArthur asked several times before he was allowed to send Puyi to the Far East War Crimes Tribunal to testify. In Tokyo, in addition to testifying in court, Puyi was "hidden" in the Soviet Embassy and forbidden to contact anyone outside. During his testimony, he repeatedly digressed to explain that the Soviet Union had no ambitions for the Northeast. In fact, whether or not it had ambitions was none of the court's business, so the judge became impatient listening to it. This is a rather intriguing matter. I remember when the Lytton Commission went to the Northeast to investigate, Puyi was also intimidated by Japan and said many things against his conscience to the commission!
