### Wu and Zhang Separately Visit Special Envoy Zhou Enlai; Date for Five-Person Meeting Still to Be Determined; Marshall Returns to Beijing to Promote Successful Negotiations

[Special Dispatch from Guling by This Newspaper, 3rd] Special Envoy Marshall left Guling for Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. It is rumored that Chairman Chiang visited him on the evening of the 2nd for an hour-long discussion. Special Envoy Marshall is expected to return to Guling this weekend to facilitate a successful five-person meeting.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Nanjing by plane at 11:15 AM on the 3rd and immediately returned to his residence to rest. At 5:00 PM, the Special Envoy visited him at Haining Road for discussions, departing at 6:30 PM.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Zhou Enlai returned to Nanjing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. Due to the hot weather and the arduous journey, he did not go out. He instructed Wang Bingnan to visit the US Embassy at 4:00 PM to inform them that he could not visit that day. It is learned that Zhou plans to first meet with Marshal Marshall on the 4th to obtain his views from Guling and will also meet with Ambassador Stuart. The date for the informal group meeting will be determined after the Special Envoy exchanges views with both the Kuomintang and the Communist parties. It is generally hoped that the pre-meeting consultations will be satisfactory so that the meeting can proceed smoothly and achieve some results after a single session.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng went to the US Embassy at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd to exchange views with the Special Envoy before the meeting. Wu gave a detailed explanation and analysis of the discussions since the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. Subsequently, the Special Envoy gave a detailed account of his participation in the negotiations over the past month. Wu and Zhang departed at 11:45 AM. Regarding the two preconditions insisted upon by the Communist Party, Zhang stated that these were military issues and that they were currently seeking a solution through political means. According to another source, if the Communist Party's insistence can be discussed outside the meeting and not be the main topic of the meeting, the government is still willing to negotiate with them patiently.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng visited Zhou Enlai at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd for a half-hour discussion. It is reported that the focus of the conversation was an exchange of views. Zhou inquired again about the two preconditions. It is reported that Wu and others did not give a definite answer regarding the ceasefire.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] The date of the informal five-person group meeting, as observed from the situation on the evening of the 3rd, depends on when Zhou Enlai meets with Marshall and Stuart. When Marshall and Stuart suggested to the Chairman to convene this meeting, there were no so-called preconditions. However, Zhou suddenly insisted on the so-called two preconditions, so there will inevitably be some twists and turns.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] It is learned that the informal five-person group will not adopt a formal meeting format but will be in the nature of consultations. There will be no chairman during the consultations, and no fixed format will be followed, hence the name "Informal Five-Person Group Talks." Furthermore, according to a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Party is still waiting for the government's response to the two points it has raised, and has not yet considered whether to participate in the five-person group.

### Central Government Holds Grand Ceremony; Minister Bai Delivers Earnest Speech; Achievements Must Be Guaranteed by Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Today is the anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The glorious victory achieved by the bloodshed and sacrifice of the military and civilians across the country over the past eight years will forever be a bright page in the history of the Chinese nation. The central government held a commemorative ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM. The ceremony was simple and grand, presided over by Chairman Zhang Ji. More than 200 central committee members and civil and military officials attended. After the Chairman led the ceremony, Minister Bai Chongxi delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of the commemoration.

Recalling the Hardships of the War

Minister Bai first stated: Today is the anniversary of the glorious victory of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. In the past eight years of the sacred Anti-Japanese War, due to the government's firm and correct supreme national policy, as well as political and strategic strategies, and the unity of the military and civilians across the country under the leadership of the supreme leader to sacrifice and fight, and jointly fight with the Allied forces, we were finally able to defeat the Japanese and achieve the final victory. Recalling the beginning of the naval war, our country fought alone with Japan. Because of the weak economic, cultural, and various other conditions, it was extremely difficult. However, the reason why we were still able to resist for a long time was partly due to the self-confidence of our thousands of years of nation and the power of our long-standing culture, and partly due to the inspiration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. Even if we encountered all kinds of material difficulties, the spiritual aspect was enough to make up for this shortcoming. Later, the Pacific War and the Soviet-Japanese War successively broke out. The Allied countries fought together. Our war against Japan alone changed to a war in which the Allied countries jointly fought against the enemy. Therefore, we were finally able to achieve victory in the Anti-Japanese War, but the fruits of victory must be guaranteed by construction. During the Anti-Japanese War, we often used the slogan that the Anti-Japanese War must be won and the nation must be built. Now, the second step of nation-building must be carried out in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Plan for National Reconstruction, and in accordance with the instructions of the President, we must use construction to guarantee the fruits of victory and begin the great cause of nation-building.

Future Construction Path

Bai then described the path of future construction, focusing on the four major constructions of politics, economy, military, and culture. Regarding political construction, Bai emphasized that the foundation of local autonomy must be established as soon as possible, and said: The National Assembly has been scheduled to convene, and a constitution will be formulated and prepared for implementation, but the constitution must have the foundation of autonomy, so it is necessary to intensify the implementation of the new county system and implement the Three People's Principles. Regarding economic construction, the Chairman has issued an order this year to resolutely implement the two-five rent reduction. If we talk about economic construction, we must at least start by reducing the burden on farmers. Therefore, the measures for the two-five rent reduction should be implemented urgently. As for measures to improve people's lives and increase people's well-being, they cannot be achieved overnight.

Continue Troop Reorganization

Bai said when discussing military construction: The troop reorganization plan will continue to be carried out. The 54th Army south of the Longhai Railway has been reorganized, but unfortunately, the troops north of the Longhai Railway cannot be reorganized due to some reason. As for the officers and soldiers who are surplus to the establishment, resettlement measures have been determined. In addition, for national defense construction, such as the reorganization of the army, the establishment of the air force, and the strengthening of the navy, all should be carried out in accordance with the established policy, so as to complete modern and scientific national defense. Bai then pointed out that cultural construction should focus on universally improving the level of national education, while developing scientific education to enrich national defense forces.

Eliminate Obstacles to Unification

Bai finally emphasized that the country must be unified, political orders should be unified, and military orders should also be unified. Therefore, all forces that hinder unification should be eliminated. This is the responsibility of the government. As for how to eliminate all obstacles and how to overcome all difficulties, it depends on the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. After the speech, the attendees went to Linggu Temple to pay tribute to the martyrs.

The police officers currently used in the third district are the first to have completed their training.

### US Allows Sale of Civilian Surplus Materials; Supply Bureau Begins Processing; Zhou Zixin Flies to Okinawa to Prepare for Transportation

[Our Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has decided that the Material Supply Bureau will be responsible for handling the US sale of civilian surplus materials. According to the person in charge of the bureau yesterday, the original value of these materials was over 850 million yuan. This amount should be reduced by depreciation and old debts in legal tender that the United States should compensate our country. The amount of the remaining payment has not been fully stipulated in the contract signed by both parties, but the depreciation method should be planned by the United States.

Zhou Zixin, Deputy Director of the Supply Bureau, was ordered yesterday to fly to Okinawa Island with six engineering experts to establish the Okinawa Island Storage and Reorganization Office, with Zhou concurrently serving as director. Eight more people are scheduled to go today. In the future, if transportation is convenient, about forty to fifty people will be dispatched to the office successively. The materials on Okinawa Island are expected to be cleared by February. As for Guam, Saipan, and other places, staff will be dispatched to set up storage and reorganization offices if transportation is convenient. All transportation of materials will be assisted and responsible by the United States.

After the materials arrive, the bureau will classify them and entrust them to designated agencies for processing. For example, timber will be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau, ships to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, transportation equipment to the Ministry of Communications, raw cotton to the China Textile Construction Company, and vehicles to the United Vehicle Sales Office. In addition, large amounts of materials will be put up for bidding, and some materials will be publicly advertised for auction. Rations, etc., will still be allocated to public school teachers at the lowest price. The bureau is currently planning how to store and place the materials. Generally, except for some necessities that need to be stored in warehouses, because there are not many warehouses, other goods that can be left uncovered will be placed in open spaces. In addition, in order to prevent theft and leakage of materials after arrival, the bureau has specially ordered all employees to prepare uniforms and will send a large number of military police to guard the docks at that time. Only employees of the bureau will be allowed to enter and exit the restricted area.

The Material Supply Bureau also announced that it will establish branch offices in Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong, and Nanjing to handle these materials.

New York Times Commentary

[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] The New York Times commented on the US transfer of surplus materials to China, believing that it is a major step in the US accelerating the expansion of China's economy. However, Zhou Enlai believes that this transfer will give the central government the power to attack the Communist forces. Zhou and others believe that this material will give Chairman Chiang at least three years of strength to fight them. It is reported that the Chinese Communists strongly oppose this matter, as this move undoubtedly increases the resources of China's legitimate central government. However, the transferred items do not include aircraft or other weapons. Marshal Ma himself learned of this and expressed his approval. This move shows our true effort, that is, not to incite war, but only to want China to be strong and united so that peace can be realized. At the same time, we obviously cannot do as the Communists demand. We have no intention of withdrawing from China. The newspaper commented on China purchasing these surplus materials for only one-fifth of their cost, saying that the United States should be very satisfied and recognize that this contract is "extremely reasonable" because it allows us to dispose of goods that we would otherwise be unable to sell, allowing us to recover materials dispersed throughout the Pacific, and promoting friendship between us and our allies. At the same time, this move is also extremely beneficial to China's economic recovery, as it can stop China's inflation, and its impact on stimulating industry will be immeasurable.

### Sino-Philippine Civil Aviation Negotiations Establish Only Temporary Agreement; Permanent Agreement to Be Discussed at Length

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Communications who participated in the Sino-Philippine civil aviation negotiations, the Sino-Philippine civil aviation negotiations have come to an end, but only a temporary oral agreement has been reached. The rumor that the two countries have signed a civil aviation contract in the capital is not true. As for a permanent agreement, it still needs to be discussed at length before it can be concluded. It is said that this temporary oral agreement is purely based on the needs of both parties. After its establishment, it will greatly facilitate the return of overseas Chinese to their homeland and the Philippines. After the end of the Pacific War, many overseas Chinese in the Philippines were eager to return to China, and many overseas Chinese stranded in China also yearned to return to the Philippines. At that time, due to factual needs, a temporary agreement was reached with the Philippines that there would be irregular flights between the two countries. However, this was not a long-term solution, so the current temporary oral agreement was established. According to the agreement, aircraft from two Philippine airlines can land in Shanghai twice a week, and aircraft from China National Aviation Corporation can also land in Manila twice a week. In the future, aircraft from Central Air Transport Corporation can also land in the Philippines. This move will not only greatly facilitate overseas Chinese, but also greatly benefit the promotion of trade relations between the two countries.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd] President Yu received a warm welcome from all parties after arriving in Lanzhou. Due to the insistent requests of local people, he agreed to stay as a guest of honor and will first return to his ancestral home in Sanyuan on the 4th before returning to Nanjing. The reporter visited him today, and Mr. Yu happily received him and spoke freely about his impressions of his trip to the west. According to him, the situation in Xinjiang Province shows considerable progress, and Chairman Zhang Zhizhong's policy of governing Xinjiang is also very correct. The central government's established national policy is to support the high degree of autonomy of the people in the border areas. Chairman Zhang has reorganized the provincial government based on this principle, allowing representatives of all ethnic groups to participate in provincial administration, which has given the border people great excitement. He was particularly moved by the patriotic sentiments of the various ethnic groups he saw during his inspection of southern Xinjiang. The slogan "Long live the Republic of China and the Three Principles of the People" can be heard everywhere. The slogan of building a new Xinjiang based on the Three Principles of the People is especially welcomed by the people everywhere. The living standards and cultural level of the people of Xinjiang Province are not backward. If political stability and popular rest are achieved in the future, Xinjiang's future will surely see extremely rapid and great progress.

### Cheng Qian Talks About Optimistic Overall Situation; Only Requires the People to Jointly Abide by Credibility and Peace

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] General Headquarters Director Cheng Qian returned to Hankou from Guling on the evening of the 1st. Our reporter visited him at his private residence in the suburbs this afternoon. The reporter asked about his impressions of this trip, and Mr. Cheng calmly replied that the Chairman inherited the legacy of the Premier and engaged in the work of revolutionary nation-building. The fundamental attitude in his handling of affairs is credibility and peace. This is not only the Chairman's personal virtue but also the consistent spirit of our party. The Chairman's communique on August 14 has already fully explained this. He knew that this credibility and peace has become the only current national policy and has gained the understanding and sympathy of Chinese and foreign people. Government policies and guidelines would continue to be based on this spirit. Today it is clear who is working against this path and will eventually be abandoned by the people. When asked about the overall situation, Mr. Cheng replied, "Absolutely optimistic." The overall situation is of course optimistic if everyone values honesty and loves peace. Even if some people continue to ignore honesty in the future, the overall situation will still be optimistic, because honesty and peace will be jointly followed by the majority of people.

Editorial

### Success Comes from Trying!

The "Five-Person Group" specifically discussing the reorganization of the National Government is said to be starting formal talks in the capital today. During this "all-out martial arts" period of widespread warfare, this unexpected "civilian drama" provides the audience with a clear view. Regardless of its success, negotiation is always better than refusing to negotiate.

However, the mission of this five-person group is viewed differently by everyone. Government representatives state that Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart's original proposal declared that discussions were limited to the number of CCP (Chinese Communist Party) members participating in the reorganized National Government Committee, and nothing else. Not only would military issues not be discussed, but issues regarding various ministries of the Executive Yuan would also not be discussed at this time. Even the number of committee members from parties other than the CCP would not be on the agenda. However, CCP representatives keep insisting on issuing a ceasefire order and demanding that the government retract its request for the Communist army to withdraw from certain industrial areas, as if these are additional conditions for the negotiation. In fact, the views of the two veteran peacekeepers, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart, are not wrong at all. If the National Government is blessed by heaven and reorganized smoothly, with representatives from various parties and social elites gathered together to calmly discuss politics, then all major military and national plans can be decided by this supreme National Government Committee. Why argue so much at this time? Therefore, if both sides have genuine sincerity in the negotiations starting today, a turning point in the overall national situation is not impossible at this moment.

However, although Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng, the government representatives returning to Nanjing from Kuling, vigorously stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had encouraged them to do their utmost to make the five-person group a success, CCP representative Zhou Enlai was still enjoying the film "The Light of the Soviet Union" in Shanghai the night before. When he went to Nanjing yesterday morning, he carried a heavy heart and told people that this negotiation was only an attempt, as if he had no confidence at all. Belief breeds strength. Now, the CCP representatives themselves lack confidence in the five-person negotiation. One wonders what sincerity and strength they have. However, we still remember Mr. Hu Shih, who advocated for vernacular Chinese, writing vernacular poems and publishing a "Collection of Attempts" in his early years, reciting a famous revisionist line: "Success comes from trying." Therefore, even though Zhou Enlai said that today's negotiations are just an attempt, if he has the sincere intention to try, the attempt may not be unsuccessful. Wu Tiecheng's statement that even if there are difficulties, success can be achieved as long as there are sincere negotiations is probably the same as our thinking.

As for the allocation of committee seats in the National Government to various parties, we believe that if we truly want to find a solution, it is not an impossible task. As long as the term "veto power," which is unreasonable and illegal, is not used, a solution may be found through negotiation. Because, according to the government organization plan passed by the previous Political Consultative Conference, Article 6 stipulates that general proposals are valid if passed by more than half of the committee members present. However, proposals involving changes to the governing program passed by the Political Consultative Conference are valid if passed by two-thirds of the committee members present. If there is any doubt as to whether a proposal involves a change to the governing program, its interpretation is still determined by more than half of the committee members present. We believe that since the Kuomintang is sincere in implementing the governing program decided by the Political Consultative Conference, it can be seen that it does not intend to make any changes. In that case, it does not really matter if the CCP has one or two more seats. As long as the Kuomintang committee members are self-respecting, attend every meeting, and maintain a consistent attitude, without inconsistency or even opposition, can a fair proposal not be passed by more than half of the votes? Therefore, we want to say this: what the Kuomintang should strive for is policy, what the Kuomintang should seek is talent, and what the Kuomintang should restrain is its own committee members. If the Kuomintang does not look inward but only argues about the number and proportion of seats of other parties, that is truly a dead end. We hope that the CCP does not get stuck in the "veto power" dead end, and the Kuomintang does not get stuck in the dead end of restricting the number of CCP seats to eight. If both sides are sincere, this negotiation can progress from legal procedures to success.

Starting from the Greek Referendum

Greece held a referendum on the 1st of this month to decide on the country's political system. Ballot counts across various regions are showing that, on average, 75% of the populace favors the return of King George II to restore the monarchy. On the day the referendum was held, competition between the left and right wings was intense. However, under the supervision of British and American observers, no accidents occurred, and voters were able to freely vote according to their own will, without any pressure. The result of this referendum can be seen as an expression of Greek public opinion, enough to clarify the chaotic Greek political situation.

After the war, the Balkan Peninsula has almost become the territory of the Slavic people, with Greece being the only remaining exception. Therefore, Greece has become a battleground for competition between Britain and the Soviet Union. In addition, Greece has territorial disputes with Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, making it a thorn in the side of the Slavic countries. In order to consolidate its position, the Greek authorities had to request that British troops remain in the country to maintain domestic order. The Soviet Union has repeatedly criticized the British troops' presence in Greece in the United Nations Security Council, arguing that it is disrupting the Balkan situation and threatening world peace. This time, the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky accused Greece at the Security Council, also saying that the British troops' presence in Greece interfered with the country's internal affairs, enough to endanger peace.

It is indeed not easy for Greece to cope with the changes in the situation in the gap between the contradictions between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, Prime Minister Tsaldaris has stood firm and has never retreated a step in the face of the diplomatic offensives of the Slavic countries. For example, in the Paris Peace Conference, the representatives of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria often targeted Greece and launched fierce attacks. In the New York Security Council, the Ukrainian representative made anti-Greek remarks, claiming that Greece provoked Albania, causing border conflicts, or that Greece attempted to change the borders of the Balkan Peninsula. However, the Greek government has always been firm and unyielding.

Since Greece has become a target of public criticism in the international arena and is being bullied and humiliated everywhere, it is natural to arouse the patriotism of the people and make them more inclined towards Britain. The victory of the right wing in this referendum was unexpected, but it is also a natural result of the recent evolution of the international situation. Parisian newspapers call it a case of the Slavic group shooting itself in the foot, which implies a profound meaning.

Before the war, Britain's power in Southeastern Europe was originally deeply rooted and unshakable. However, after the Great War, the situation in the Balkans changed, becoming the world of the Slavic people, and Britain's power has been declining. In addition, the Soviet Union has great ambitions for the Turkish Straits issue. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has repeatedly asked Turkey to jointly defend the Straits, putting Britain's position in the Near East under a serious threat. In addition, there is the Iranian issue in the Middle East, as well as the Palestinian issue, which makes Britain feel "headache" everywhere. Therefore, in order to maintain its imperial status, Britain has to hold on to Greece and refuse to let go, not allowing it to fall into the embrace of the Slavic ethnic group, but wanting to keep it as a springboard for Britain to develop towards Southeastern Europe. King George II of Greece is currently in London, and Prime Minister Tsaldaris will also travel from Paris to report the results of the referendum and ask him to return to the country as soon as possible to restore the monarchy. From then on, the relationship between Britain and Greece will inevitably become closer, and the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union may become more acute.

Greek politics has always been known for its democracy. Although it still maintains the form of a monarchy, in essence, it is similar to British politics, and no one can call it an anti-democratic political system. As for the domestic situation, there is a division between the left and right wings. In addition to differing opinions on internal affairs, their diplomatic views are also diametrically opposed. In fact, this is the case in any country today. Taking Britain as an example, the British Communist Party is also there opposing the United States and opposing the Labour Cabinet's foreign policy of assisting Greece. Therefore, we must not divide the left and right wings in Greece by democracy versus anti-democracy. The reason why the Soviet Union opposes Greece holding a referendum and opposes the current Greek government continuing to govern is not so much because the Greek government is undemocratic, but rather because the Tsaldaris cabinet's foreign policy is close to Britain and inconsistent with the interests of the Soviet Union. "One leaf falls and the world knows autumn." The result of this vote in Greece will inevitably increase the tension of the confrontation between the two major forces in Southeastern Europe.

Letter of Correction

To the Editor:

Regarding the report published in your newspaper on August 25th stating that the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau privately hoarded over 2,000 catties of grain during the winter relief efforts last year, which had completely rotted, and that the investigation team sent personnel to investigate, suspecting abuse of power for personal gain, after investigation, the aforementioned grain was leftover from the Tianjin winter relief efforts and was allocated from the old millet and grain in the Japanese puppet warehouse, not wheat. As for the city's handling of millet and grain distribution for winter relief last year, local charitable organizations were responsible for handling it by district. After the conclusion, the remaining grain from the Qiande Zhuang Congee Factory was entrusted to the original organizers, the Huang Society and the Cihui Pujitongshen Society, for safekeeping. The two societies, due to the limited space at their headquarters, stored it in the cellar of the adjacent No. 51 Elementary School, which was reported to the municipal government. On May 28th, it was requested in document No. 542 from the society to the municipal government for approval to sell it by bidding. Approval was subsequently received to temporarily suspend the sale and keep it for this year's winter relief. However, due to several heavy rains in Tianjin in recent months, water entered the cellar, and the stored grain could no longer be kept. A request was resubmitted to the municipal government in early July, approving the delivery of the winter surplus grain to the Doudian Industry Association for transportation and sale. Furthermore, the bureau's handling of the amount and method of disposal of the remaining grain from last year's winter relief efforts were reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the municipal government at any time, and there was no private hoarding or anything like that. Accordingly, this letter is hereby sent, respectfully requesting verification and correction. Tianjin Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau, September 1st

[United Press, London, 2nd] The British Admiralty announced today that the British Mediterranean Fleet is scheduled to patrol the Greek waters from the 18th of this month for six weeks.

The total amount of compensation claims currently made to Italy by ten Allied countries, including the Soviet Union, has reached 18 billion yuan.

According to Reuters, Yugoslavia requested the Peace Conference on the 3rd to allow it to demand 1.3 billion yuan in compensation from Italy. The losses suffered by Yugoslavia caused by Italy were indeed 1 million.

### Five Foreign Ministers Deliver Speeches at Reception of the Sino-French Association, Emphasizing Importance of Maintaining Peace Between the Two Countries

[Central News Agency, Paris, 2nd] Wang Shijie emphasized the importance of maintaining peace between China and France in the East and West at the reception of the Sino-French Association on the evening of the 2nd. Wang stated, "We firmly believe that a prosperous, strong, and democratic France is indispensable to ensuring peace in Europe, just as you believe that a strong and democratic China is a necessary condition for stabilizing the situation in the Far East. We are not only concerned about but also responsible for the future of mankind, and we must cooperate together. I am very pleased to have contributed to the drafting of the recently signed Sino-French agreement, which is the initial result of producing favorable cooperation. We can, based on the great principles revealed by the French Revolution and the principles of the United Nations Charter that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already elucidated, work together to achieve the ideal of human progress." Wang praised the activities of the Sino-French Association, which was established after the liberation of Paris, emphasizing the importance of cultural cooperation and mutual understanding between the two countries.

### Continued Testimony at the International Tribunal: Japanese Atrocities and Poisoning of China

The Number of Drug Addicts in the Puppet State of Manchuria Reaches Ten Million

[Reconstruction Society, Tokyo, 3rd] Today, the International Tribunal prosecutor presented eight statements regarding atrocities committed by several Japanese soldiers in Wuyuan County, Suiyuan Province, in 1940, and two statements regarding looting and arson in the same county. Following this, three charts prepared by the Ministry of Justice of our country were submitted, indicating the classification and number of Japanese military crimes. The presentation of evidence related to Japanese military atrocities has now been completed. Subsequently, various documents related to Japan's poisoning of China were presented. The Director-General of the "Asia Development Board," Kawai, testified, stating that the board was the agency in China that distributed opium.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The prosecution at the International Tribunal presented approximately ten photographic files from the U.S. Treasury Department, proving that Japan protected the trafficking of opium and narcotics in the occupied areas of China and encouraged opium cultivation. One document stated that Japanese and Koreans used brothels as drug trafficking organizations. Pawnshops were also involved in this business, and pitiful drug addicts pawned their clothes to obtain drugs. According to investigations in the four northeastern provinces, one-third of the people were drug users, and the money spent on drugs each year reached 80 million yuan. Japanese selling of drugs resulted in profits six times over.

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The evidence presented by the International Tribunal this morning revealed that because the puppet Manchukuo government relied on opium as its primary source of tax revenue, it encouraged opium smoking. As a result, nearly one-third of the 30 million people in puppet Manchukuo were addicts. Every day, several people collapsed in the streets due to withdrawal symptoms, and their clothes were stripped off by other addicts.

### Indian Government Chairman Nehru Announces Major Policies: India to be Governed by Indians; Ten-Year Plan to Improve People's Livelihood

[Report from this newspaper's combined sources] According to United Press, New Delhi, Congress Party President Nehru was sworn in today as Chairman of the Interim Government of India. He received reporters and stated that he would serve the Indian people and implement a ten-year plan to improve people's livelihood. He further stated that the Interim Government of India had three other policies to mention: (1) We shall discuss all matters in a responsible cabinet system, make decisions together, and be jointly responsible. (2) Foreign residents within India are only temporary residents. We welcome them as ordinary residents, but in official positions, they must withdraw. From now on, India will be governed by Indians themselves for the welfare of the Indian people. (3) Freedom is our highest goal, but we must face pressing issues such as clothing, food, housing, education, and hygiene. Finally, Nehru appealed to the Indian people not to conflict with each other but to cooperate. According to Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, after the establishment of the Interim Government of India was announced, Muslims in various places held demonstrations, all wearing black紗 on their arms, divided into large and small teams, parading through the streets, moving toward the government and the Governor's residence. Although the government had ordered a ban on public gatherings, the police did not interfere. The Muslims then climbed telephone poles in the evening and hung black fire flags to express their mourning, a desolate scene. However, the government authorities and members of the Congress Party were unmoved. Muslims and Hindus walking on the streets did not cause disturbances. The police seemed to have received instructions to take action only when riots occurred.

According to United Press, early in the morning of the 3rd in Bombay, Indian Muslims again caused disturbances. To date, the known number of deaths has increased to 72. Although the riots were quite intense, they were short-lived and ended after the police opened fire. The general situation in Bombay seems less tense than on Monday. Therefore, the hope that the city will return to normal is stronger.

### Gandhi's Sorrowful Words: Admonishing Both Factions to Cease Fighting

[According to United Press, New Delhi] Gandhi stated at a prayer meeting on the 3rd, "The Congress Party must not collude with the British to deal with Muslims. In any case, if Indian Muslims must fight, then let them go forward bravely and decide the outcome themselves. If we continue to rely on British weapons, India will not truly be free. All ministers of the new government must disregard life and death and seek reconciliation between the two religions." Gandhi also stated regarding military assistance to the new government that the new government aims to win freedom for India, including Muslims. If Muslims resolutely regard the new government personnel as enemies, then the government must "prove the inaccuracy of this belief with accurate measures."

### Egyptian Cabinet to be Reorganized

### French Woman Gives Birth to Quadruplets: Mother and Babies All Doing Well

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] A French woman gave birth to quadruplets yesterday morning. Although they were premature, the babies are all very normal and have been placed in incubators. According to the delivering doctor, the babies are not expected to die, and the mother is also doing well.

### Pacific Peace Conference: U.S. Actively Preparing; Japan May Become the Tip of the Spear of Ideological Conflict; Drafting the Treaty with Japan Should be Done with Caution

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. government is currently working hard to prepare for an international conference to draft a Pacific peace treaty, but most of the details, such as when it will be convened and which countries will participate, have not yet been decided. It is also unknown what kind of treaty will be drafted for Japan. It has been a year since the Allied occupation of Japan, and the success of the occupation will determine the nature of the treaty. To date, the occupation has been in good faith, and this can be seen in the fairness of the U.S. attitude in the directives issued by MacArthur's headquarters to the Japanese government. It has previously been stated that the treaty with Japan will not be of a vengeful nature, and it is expected that the victorious countries drafting the treaty will adopt an attitude that allows it to survive. According to senior officials concerned with peace in the Pacific, the State Department and MacArthur are actively preparing to convene the conference. Whether sooner or later, the U.S. will participate in the conference with a carefully prepared, broad plan, using this as the basic condition for peace in Japan and the Pacific region.

Five-Year Term for Overseeing Japanese Civil Administration

According to authoritative sources, under future plans, the U.S. military occupation will last for three to five years, followed by civil administration supervised by the Allied forces for 25 years. By then, the Japanese people's government will have been fully reformed, and in accordance with the aims and principles outlined by the Allied powers in the Potsdam Declaration, Japan will become a member of the international community, accepting and upholding sound democratic principles. It is believed here that the tension caused by the opposition of political ideals makes the Allied measures in Japan even more important. Japan is located in a crucial area and has become a front line for democratic countries. The current Japanese Empire could become the tip of the spear of conflicting ideologies or even the flashpoint for a future world war. The directives issued by MacArthur will largely determine the way Japan is governed in the future, as well as its living standards and social conditions.

Difficulties in Adjusting Strategic Issues

However, strategic issues concerning Japan must be considered when drafting the treaty, and their resolution may inevitably encounter difficulties. The Allied powers may not easily reach agreement on land, sea, and air force issues. Countries with significant interests in Japan and the East must be adjusted in the treaty to avoid conflict with each other. As for who will draft the terms of the treaty, it is still undecided at this time. The Far Eastern Commission may be responsible for convening the conference. It is also undecided whether countries not on the Far Eastern Commission can participate in the conference. The commission is not currently concerned with the terms of the treaty; its primary concern is the Japanese constitution. The commission has not actually passed the constitution, but it wants to ensure that it complies with the Potsdam Declaration. The commission is also studying the Japanese tax system and is expected to make an announcement within days. The statement intends to determine that foreigners residing in Japan will only pay the same taxes as Japanese people in the future, so as to avoid discrimination. Washington officials are quite optimistic about the overall situation in the Pacific and believe that although there may be differences of opinion among the countries concerned, a peaceful resolution will be achieved, leading the countries of the world toward universal peace.

### Roosevelt's Foresight: His Son Writes About His Father's Views

[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The American magazine "Look" today published a section from the book "As He Saw It" by the late President Roosevelt's son, Elliott, which stated: After the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, my (Elliott's self-description) father said that Americans were dying in the Pacific because of the short-sightedness of Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Unless the colonial system is abolished, the world will still face a third war. After this war, if we still leave hundreds of millions of people in a state of semi-slavery, the consequences are unimaginable. Elliott further stated: Churchill always thought that we should enter Central Europe and meet the Red Army, so that the British sphere of influence could be expanded as far east as possible. After meeting Churchill, Mountbatten, and other leaders, my father told me that Britain wanted to recover Burma for its colonial empire. Burma could affect Vietnam, India, and Indonesia. If one of these countries gains freedom, the others will follow suit. De Gaulle also disregarded the disappearance of other colonial powers. In India, Java, Burma, Vietnam, and other places, only goods are shipped out, and no compensation is shipped in. This is a distant cause of another war. If we win the war, the four powers will be responsible for peace, carrying out tasks such as development, education, and raising living standards. When backward areas have matured, they should be allowed to become independent. My father made it clear to Churchill that America's participation in the war was not to help Britain and others maintain the imperial ideas of the Middle Ages.

### Committee Members of the Investigation Team Personally Visit Mayor Wu to Request Three Case Files to Investigate Major Corruption Cases; The Informant is a Former Senior Official of the City Government

[Report from this newspaper] In the corruption case involving 4 billion yuan worth of materials from the Municipal Government Receiving Materials Management Office, which was reported, Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the investigation team, personally visited Mayor Wu to conduct an investigation. A reporter visited Mayor Wu at 6 PM yesterday to inquire about the details of the case. According to Mayor Wu, during Mayor Qian's tenure, following the instructions of the Chairman, he did a lot of welfare work. He originally intended to allocate materials to the city's public school teachers and staff, but because it was inconvenient to distribute physical objects, he changed to issuing rice loans of 20,000 yuan per person per month. The funds were derived from the proceeds of the bidding for the materials received from the pseudo-Central Market, totaling more than 3.1 billion yuan. Mayor Wu said that after taking office, because he felt that the police and street sweepers were poorly treated, the rice loans could not be canceled for the time being, but the funds were not available, so he continued to bid for the materials. However, all bidding during his tenure was attended by the Audit Department, totaling 1.12 billion yuan. In addition to allocating 50 million yuan to the Consumer Cooperative Fund, the rest was used for rice loans. At 7 PM, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen visited Mayor Wu and told this newspaper's reporter that Mayor Wu's explanation of the case was very detailed. As for the 3.1 billion yuan obtained from the bidding during Mayor Qian's tenure, 200 million yuan was allocated to the Youth League's expenses, and the rest is unknown. Mayor Wu also submitted three city government files to Committee Member Zhang for review, including one for the Agricultural Products Market, one for the Xingye Trust Company, and one for the Shanghai Municipal Government's receipt of the pseudo-Central Market file. Committee Member Zhang attached great importance to this case and decided to request the entire list of materials received from the pseudo-Central Market from the Municipal Government Receiving Materials Management Office this morning as a basis for investigation. However, Committee Member Zhang does not intend to express his opinion before the investigation is completed. It is reported that the informant is a former senior official of the Municipal Government, reporting that the former Receiving Materials Management Office colluded with businessmen to illegally bid for materials, arbitrarily distributed the proceeds, and said that the evidence of operating for personal gain and corruption is conclusive.

### The Investigation Team Believes that the Case of the China Textile Company is Not Over

It had published an investigation report. Yesterday, the reporter asked Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen whether the case would be concluded. He said that after Officer Zhang investigated the case, it still needs to be reviewed by the committee members, so it has not been concluded as of now.

### Japanese War Criminals: Tanaka Hisaichi and Fukuchi Harunami Sentenced to Death by Hanging by the U.S. Military Tribunal; The Remaining Three Criminals Sentenced to Prison; Asakawa Hiroko Acquitted; The Two Devils in Zhejiang Have Been Publicly Prosecuted by Our Side

[Report from this newspaper] In the case of U.S. Fourteenth Air Force pilot Major Hawke, who was killed by the Japanese army after his plane crashed in Hong Kong in January 1945, after half a month of continuous court hearings, interrogation, and debate by the U.S. Military Tribunal here, a verdict was announced yesterday morning: Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisaichi was sentenced to death by hanging, Major General Fukuchi Harunami was sentenced to death by hanging, Lieutenant Colonel Kubo Higai was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, Captain Yamaguchi Kyoichi was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, Major Watanabe Masamori was sentenced to hard labor and imprisonment for 50 years, and Captain Asakawa Hiroko was acquitted and released after being sent back to Japan.

The verdict stated that the trial of Hawke by the Japanese military court that day was illegal and unfair and violated the laws of war. Tanaka Hisaichi, as the Governor of Hong Kong, failed to prevent this unfair judgment and should be held responsible. Fukuchi Harunami was the commanding officer responsible for actually ordering the trial and execution. Kubo Higai was the presiding judge in the court at the time. Yamaguchi Kyoichi and Watanabe Masamori were both jurors. Because Yamaguchi was a member of the 23rd Army Military Law Office, he should have been aware of the law, but he still gave Hawke an unfair judgment, so his crime was more serious than Watanabe's. As for Asakawa Hiroko, she was assigned by Saboru Shii, the head of the judiciary of the former Japanese government in Hong Kong, who had committed suicide out of fear of guilt, and was innocently implicated, so she was acquitted. This verdict can be executed after approval by the U.S. military headquarters. Yesterday, when the criminals heard the verdict, except for Asakawa Hiroko, who was overjoyed and bowed frequently to the court, the other five criminals, including Tanaka Hisaichi, all had pale faces and did not say a word. They were escorted out of the court by military police.

[Report from this newspaper] Japanese war criminals Lieutenant General Funabiki Masanaka, former commander of the 60th Division of the 20th Army, and Major General Kurose Heiichi, brigade commander of the 57th Brigade of the 68th Division, were stationed in Zhejiang Province during the invasion of China, leading their subordinates to rape, plunder, and do everything. The Ministry of National Defense War Criminals Management Office has completed the investigation and yesterday noon escorted them to the First Pacification District Military Court and detained them in the Tilanqiao Prison, and will soon file a public prosecution in accordance with the law.

Representatives of the Allied Nations Receive Flags at the Assembly (Photo by This Newspaper)

The Entire Shanghai Market Celebrates the Anniversary of the Allied Victory; National Generals and Envoys Participate in the Assembly; The Mayor Delivers a Speech Elaborating on the Two Factors of Victory

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the anniversary of the Allied Victory. The various sectors of this city held a celebration assembly at the Majestic Theatre at 9 AM. The party, government, and military leaders of this city served as the presidium. Allied diplomatic envoys, generals, and representatives of national troops and various organizations and groups, totaling about 1,000 people, attended. Before 9 AM, Mayor Wu had arrived first. Those who arrived later included Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiluo, Xuan Tiewu, and the consuls of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Shanghai, Davis, Ogden, Bayern, and Enerliv, and Allied generals Lieutenant General Gillon, Rear Admiral Duer, and Rear Admiral Aiki. In the center of the auditorium hung a portrait of the Prime Minister and the party-state flag. Below hung a specially made victory emblem, and on both sides were arranged 46 Allied national flags. Various potted flowers were placed in front of the stage.

The assembly began in a solemn and respectful atmosphere. Led by Mayor Wu, the attendees performed the rituals. After a minute of silence for the national and Allied soldiers who died in battle, he gave a speech, saying: Everyone present must have many thoughts today. I also have two thoughts: First, China was able to achieve victory thanks to the leader of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang, because we had such an indomitable leader who insisted on fighting the war to the end and finally won victory. Second, it should be attributed to the assistance of the Allied nations. On the anniversary of the victory, looking back, the domestic ideals of nation-building have not yet been achieved, and there are still many misunderstandings internationally. However, we have confidence that the domestic and international prospects are bright. Under the wise and outstanding leadership of Generalissimo, there will be a peaceful nation-building plan. Internationally, based on the past spirit of joint operations of the Allied nations, we will still be able to cooperate. Looking forward to the future, we have infinite hope and firm confidence.

### Pan Gongzhan Recalls the Anti-Japanese Spirit of the Citizens

Speaker Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, saying that the 3 million citizens of Shanghai followed the Supreme Commander to participate in the War of Resistance from the beginning, firmly believing that the Supreme Leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was the most faithful executor of the Prime Minister's teachings. The Prime Minister said that in order to achieve China's freedom and equality, we must awaken the people and unite the world to treat our nation equally and struggle together. Chairman Chiang faithfully executed these two points without error and achieved a great victory. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Shanghai was originally an unprepared city. The citizens of Shanghai fought the enemy with flesh and blood. The citizens of Shanghai did this to call on the people of the country and the world to participate in the anti-fascist war. The citizens of Shanghai, even during the occupation period, were always thinking of the central government (audience applause). In the future, we hope that the citizens of Shanghai will continue to build a peaceful and democratic country with the spirit of participating in the War of Resistance (applause).

Then, Chen Baohua, the secretary-general of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, first detailing the origins of the victory of the War of Resistance, saying that the work of nation-building, it cannot be denied, has not yet reached the ideal stage, and we especially need to work together. Du Yuesheng also gave a generous speech yesterday. Du emphasized that although the victory has been one year, the comparison between today last year and today this year is very different. Last year today, the violent enemy had just surrendered, and there was jubilation and excitement throughout the country. But today this year, there is a lack of unity in political and military orders, transportation is destroyed, and there is economic panic. At present, we really need peace. Who is destroying peace today? Xu Jiluo also expressed his feelings on the first anniversary of the victory on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, hoping to work together to make nation-building the first priority.

### General Gillon's Address: Striving for Lasting Peace

Finally, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Gillon, representing all Allied representatives, spoke, saying that the Allies initially concentrated their forces against Germany because the Allies' supreme strategy required the destruction of the German sea, land, and air forces. Only by destroying Germany's sea and air forces could materials be transported to this side of the Pacific. He then analyzed Hitler's strategic mistakes, and said that in the Allied operations, the cooperation of China had always been valued. Under the leadership of its wise leader, the Chinese people went through the darkest period and achieved victory. Because of the cooperation of the Allies, our descendants will have a bright future, and we can stand under the beautiful flag of the United Nations to celebrate victory. Never in human history has there been such great unity. We have a sacred mission, which is to eliminate violence from the world. Now that we have won, we need lasting peace to repay the millions of United Nations soldiers who sacrificed their precious lives. We must do our best to ensure that the sacrifices were not in vain. We need tolerance and trust, and all countries working together, researching, trading, and living in peace. Cruel wars are by no means a tool for civilized nations to resolve disputes. We want to build lasting world peace.

### National Anthem Played as Boy Scout Representatives Present Flags

After General Gillon's speech, the national anthem was played, and Girl Scouts and Girl Guide members presented flags to representatives of the National Army and the Allied forces. The flags were made of blue silk and decorated with victory designs. Commander Xuan accepted the flags on behalf of the National Army. U.S. Army Lieutenant General Gillon, U.S. Navy Admiral Duer, British Navy Rear Admiral Aki, and representatives of the U.S., British, French, and Soviet consulates-general in Shanghai accepted the flags on behalf of the Allied forces. After the flag presentation, Mayor Wu respectfully read a telegram of respect to the chairman: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government: Victory in the War of Resistance, after eight years of hardship, our rivers and mountains are restored, and the sun and moon shine again. We admire your dedication, working tirelessly day and night, making wise decisions in advance, promoting divine martial prowess, unyielding and unwavering, overcoming difficulties and dangers, persevering, and finally eliminating the brutality of aggression and washing away the national humiliation. The foundation of the country is consolidated, and the nation is secure. Recalling your great achievements, we cannot help but admire you. We respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your wise consideration. Shanghai's celebration of the anniversary of victory." After reading, the whole venue applauded and passed the motion unanimously. After this, the music ended, the ceremony was completed, and entertainment began. Historical films of the War of Resistance and newsreels taken after the victory were shown, and the event ended at noon.

### Ye Yansun, Who Accepted Bribes from Traitors, to be Executed by Firing Squad Today

### Wen Lanting Trial to Open Tomorrow, Family Makes Third Request for Bail, Shen Siliang Case Still Under Investigation

[Our Newspaper] The case of Wen Lanting's suspected treason will continue to be heard at the High Court at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The defendant seems to still intend to refuse to appear in court.

This is the third time this request has been made. The previous two times were rejected by the High Court. The outcome of this request is still awaiting deliberation and ruling by the High Court's collegiate panel.

Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was detained and investigated by the High Procuratorate of this city for suspected collaboration with the enemy during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Two months have passed, but no prosecution has been filed.

### Chen Bohua and Zhao Yu Both Scheduled for Sentencing on the Ninth

Chen Bohua, 43 years old, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, followed Ding Mocun and served as the deputy director of the puppet Ministry of Transportation's Shanghai office, a counselor in the puppet Ministry of Social Affairs, and a standing committee member of the puppet Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Branch. After the victory, he was arrested after being reported by the Party Branch and sentenced by the High Court. Chen refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing, which remanded the case for retrial. The High Court retried the case yesterday morning.

Answer: Soldiers who voluntarily stay in the camp after the expiration of their service period have fulfilled their obligation of service and should not be regarded as "military service" but should be included in the scope of "military." (18) Question: In the supplementary explanation for filling out the form, does the so-called family management include housewives in general families, or does it specifically refer to those who are served at home and receive work remuneration? Answer: The determination of whether there is a profession should be based on whether remuneration is obtained. Family members who specialize in housework are non-remunerated operations and should be regarded as "unemployed." (19) Question: Is there an error or other meaning in the revised supplementary explanation for filling out the form, Article 12, which stipulates that the filling method for "concubines" and "family members" should be determined according to the date of promulgation of the Civil Code Family Law? Answer: The date referred to is the date of promulgation of the Civil Code General Provisions and should be changed to May 5, 1931, in accordance with the date of implementation of the Civil Code Family Law. (2) The price of each copy of the book "Interpretation of the New Household Registration Law" is 1,200 yuan, which can be purchased directly from Yu Sijin of the Civil Affairs Office of the Municipal Government.

### New Cotton Textile Construction Policy Becomes Clear, Yesterday's Cloth Posting Price Has Increased, Double Horse Intends to Reduce to 1.35 Million

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the opening price of cotton textile construction was 53,000 yuan for 20 count warp and weft 12 pound unbranded fine cloth, 72,000 yuan for Four Gentlemen Nafuto Big Red, and 69,000 yuan for Jumping Carp Yuan Straight Silk Satin. Before the exchange rate change, the Five Blessings fine cloth of 23 count and 22 count New Zealand weave was only 53,000 yuan, while Nafuto Big Red was 68,000 yuan. The increase in the opening price shows that the market is becoming more clear. This strategy was brewed a few days after the exchange rate change. The method is to hang the price of the original genuine brand on the second-rate goods and sell them at prices close to the black market. However, before the private cotton mill's allocation of yarn is controlled, they still dare not openly raise prices significantly. Now that the yarn market has been centrally managed, the opening price has been reduced from 1.4 million to 1.38 million. Our newspaper had predicted the price increase of cotton textile construction in the last issue, so it is not surprising. Before the cotton textile construction was posted yesterday, the cloth price on the market had already dropped by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan. When the posted price was seen to rise, the market immediately fluctuated. Fortunately, there was not much real money before the holiday, and the money market was very tight, so the increase should still be limited. In terms of the price sold by cotton textile construction yesterday, those who do black market still have a slight profit. So, the increase in the posted price does not seem to be able to stimulate the market. What is regrettable is that the root of the cloth is too tight, and people's hearts are inevitably upward. The fact that the delivery location of the 12-pound unbranded fine cloth opened yesterday is far away in Wusong Yuncaobang, but those who requested to purchase it still rushed forward, which can be taken as clear evidence. Four Gentlemen Zhun  is a popular  commodity, and it was also suspended yesterday, which is bound to cause price increases in the colored cloth market. The control of the cotton textile construction over the yarn opening of private cotton mills is being rectified. According to well-informed sources, there is a possibility that the Double Horse standard will be reduced to 1.35 million. Some yarn mills transfer their yarn to self-weaving cloth, and they are not happy to accept yarn distribution orders in attitude. However, selling yarn is ultimately more profitable than selling cloth, so the root of the cloth is difficult to loosen. Observers with status also pointed out that cotton textile construction is working hard to lower the black market and raise the Ming market, but it is feared that the Ming market's price increase will inevitably stimulate the black market due to supply and demand.

Yesterday, yarn and cloth turned sharply downward. The sailing schedule to South China is uncertain, so the Cantonese gang is watching and waiting, and there is no rush to enter. The Xiang, Han, Tianjin, and Beijing gangs also have little appetite. The colleagues all have the intention of selling goods to make money, so they tend to sell. Therefore, Double Horse re-entered the 1.6 million mark and finally closed at 1.556 million. People's hearts turned pale, and the trend is still fragile. Statistics show that miscellaneous 20 count fell 350,000, Double Horse fell 890,000, and 42 count fell a huge 120,000.

### Gold and Paper Money Rise, Market Situation Very Firm

Hanchi had a reaction yesterday, and the money market eased slightly near noon, so the buying momentum was strong, but the Central Bank was still controlling the market. It opened at 2.02 million in the morning and was sold. People's hearts were afraid of pressure and constrained by the money market. It fell to 2.003 million before it became fixed and rose slightly. After 10 am, the Central Bank allocated 127 items at a price of 2.02 million. After that, it gradually changed from peaceful to stable. After 11 am, the money market eased, and buyers were active, and there was a lot of re-transfer. The market rose to 2.058 million. The Central Bank adjusted from time to time and continued to sell vigorously. After the high, it fell back to 2.04 million. At noon, it stood at 2.045 million. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery was pushed up to 2.06 million, but it was still suppressed. As a result, it rose 24,000 compared to the previous closing. The decoration gold rose 18,000, and the silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. The dark discount loosened, but it was still faint. The dark interest ranged from one corner six to two corners one.

Foreign currencies also rebounded after fatigue. The US dollar opened at 3,240 yuan in the morning and was bought. This price once struggled slightly upward. It did not start to rise until after 10 am. The short sellers were in droves, approaching the 3,300 yuan mark near noon. It settled slightly at noon. It was initially firm and then settled in the afternoon. As a result, it rose 60 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong dollar was initially reported to be as low as 660 yuan in Guangzhou and was still around 670 yuan. Later, it followed the progress of gold and paper money to over 700 yuan. As a result, it rose 25 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 690 yuan to 700 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 840 yuan to 850 yuan, the British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan to 11,500 yuan, and there was not much demand for the US exchange rate.

### Buying on Dips, Government Bonds Stable in Black Market, Various Rumors in the Market, Authorities Consider Nonsense

Large government bond holders came and went differently, but people's hearts were still stable. It was easy to pull up after the dip. The overall C was initially sold off heavily by a large household to a counterparty Lin, shrinking repeatedly from 2,400 yuan. It did not stop falling until it retreated to the 2,000 yuan mark. After a short period of hesitation, two major households on the fifth and seventh floors moved together and gradually rebounded. In the middle, it rose to 2,800 yuan. At the close, it still fell back to around 2,650 yuan. As a result, it rose 170 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B rose 100 yuan, and D and E rose 50 yuan each.

[Nanjing, 2nd] Recently, the black market for government bonds in Shanghai has fluctuated again. The reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Monetary Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. According to him, the government has not considered changing the government bond repayment method. The various rumors in Shanghai are all rumors from speculators. Legitimate merchants should not catch shadows and make trouble for themselves.

### Woolen Cloth Pricing Reports Rise

Recently, the wholesale price of woolen cloth in this city has been unstable due to high-interest loans. Except for large-scale and five- or six-year-old stores, all are turbulent. Both domestic and foreign companies are selling goods. If there is a reliable recipient, they are happy to accept half-month or one-month term checks. Looking at the future, although the customer gang and the local street continue to purchase, their appetite is far weaker than in the past. Due to the continuous arrival of goods, buyers are delaying purchases and hoping for a decline. However, for orders from foreign firms, merchants from the United States and the United Kingdom have received telegrams from abroad stating that prices will all increase from this month, and each yard will increase by 2 cents to 5 cents compared to the previous price. Irregular small businesses even want to add additional orders to those who have already received fixed orders. It can also be seen that the business of doing woolen cloth business is difficult these days.

### Manufacturers Purchase Production Raw Materials, Bank of Communications Can Provide Loans

Since the Bank of Communications has been organizing loans for public and private enterprises and institutions to purchase production raw materials, manufacturers have called it useful and there have been many who have gone to negotiate and request loans. According to the reporter, the main points of the loan application method are as follows. When public and private enterprises and institutions apply to the Bank of Communications for loans to purchase and transport production raw materials, they should first fill out a true application form. After the Bank of Communications approves it, they will sign a formal contract and calculate interest from the date of the loan. The amount of interest is negotiated by both parties in advance, and the interest rate is mostly around five percent.

### Sugar Price Review Council Decides on Wholesale and Retail Prices; Taiwan Sugar Corporation Will Distribute as Much as Possible; China Sand at 140,000 Yuan Per Dan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Social Affairs Bureau and Taiwan Sugar Corporation jointly arranged for the distribution of sugar in the city, the distribution price has gradually been reduced to 70,000 yuan per dan. The profits for wholesale and retail have been regulated. However, with distribution prices like 150,000 yuan and sugar powder reaching 310,000 yuan, most of it flows into the black market, where the price has risen to over 200,000 yuan per dan, and retail sales have risen to over 2,000 yuan per catty. The general public does not enjoy the benefits of fair prices. Therefore, the bureau consulted with the company and convened representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Industry Association, and the Dried Goods Industry Association at 4 PM yesterday to discuss improvement measures. Attendees included Taiwan Sugar Corporation executives Shen Zhennan and Song Yixin, medical industry representative Chen Nanzhou, Dried Goods Commercial Guild Executive Director Chu Rupin, and City Chamber of Commerce representative Luo Qinghua, among others. First, Bureau Chief Wu Kaixian chaired the meeting and decided on the following: (1) To establish the Shanghai Fair Price Sugar Review Council, with all representatives present being appointed as members. (2) To adjust the distribution price to 140,000 yuan per dan for medium sand sugar and 130,000 yuan for raw sand sugar. (3) To set the retail price at 1,000 yuan per catty, with sugar purchase certificates issued to citizens and a reasonable profit margin given to the selling stores. (4) Wholesale to other cities will be handled by sugar merchants. (5) Sugar distribution to other cities will be directly applied for from Taiwan Sugar Corporation. (6) The company will increase its allocation after this adjustment and distribute as much as possible.

Another report states that the price of medium sand sugar in the sugar market yesterday exceeded 180,000 yuan, reaching over 10,000 yuan. The opening price for first-grade Qing was 134,000 yuan, and Huanggang Qing was 132,000 yuan, with a few hundred packages traded. Two hundred boxes of Shimen sliced Qing were traded at prices ranging from 100,600 yuan to 8,000 yuan. Although enemy-produced sugar was auctioned, with over 4,000 pieces, it also fetched good prices. For example, four and a half cars of white sugar went for 257,500 yuan, three and a half cars of white sugar for 225,000 yuan, and sugar powder reached 310,000 yuan, with slight reductions for lesser qualities. Taiwan Qing was priced at 110,500 yuan.

### New Glutinous and Indica Rice Weak; Oil Prices Continue to Rise Outside the Market

The rice market's digestion remains sluggish. Old glutinous rice is stable due to scarcity. New indica rice from various sources continues to decline, with medium and lower grades dropping by 1,000 yuan. New glutinous rice also weakened by 1,000 yuan. Yesterday's registration of buyers and sellers in the north and south markets totaled over 7,900 stones. Flour mills continue to produce little, but retail sales are still strong, with prices rising another 100-200 yuan outside the market. Wheat from Fujian and Ningbo is moving but not strong, while northern wheat is also weak, showing a slight sluggishness with a drop of 500-600 yuan. Soybean shipments from Shantou have stopped. New beans are arriving in large quantities, while old beans from Wang An are also available, leading to sluggish digestion and a sharp drop of over 2,000 yuan. Raw kernels are stable, and yellow hemp is down slightly by 1,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao is not moving and has fallen another 1,000 yuan.  Beans are also down by 1,000 yuan. The oil market is experiencing scarcity from Qingdao, with the local factory shipping little and production areas charging high prices, leading to a reverse flow and demand exceeding supply, with prices continuing to rise by 1,000-2,000 yuan outside the market. Soybean cake sales are weak, with a slight drop of 100-200 yuan.

### New Food Oil Prices Raised by 12%

### Equivalent to Double Business Tax; Banquet Tax Should Not Be Excessive; Legislation Should Be Easy for People to Understand and Follow; Leave Some Room for Those Seeking Mere Sustenance

[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce, acting on behalf of the restaurant industry's request to reduce the banquet tax, has submitted a letter to the municipal government and finance bureau with four proposed measures, appealing for their joint support. The letter states: "The Restaurant Industry Association of this city has requested four matters from your office (department): (1) To reduce the banquet tax to 10%. (2) To establish a daily food standard so that meals other than banquets are not subject to the banquet tax. (3) To reconsider the penalty measures for restaurant merchants failing to register invoices. (4) To exempt restaurant merchants from using unified invoices. These requests were submitted to your office (department) on August 31st. The facts and reasons presented are extremely detailed. The banquet tax currently levied in Shanghai has uniformly changed the method of apportionment previously used to a method of reporting and levying based on issued invoices. The method of collecting from customers has been canceled and replaced by merchants bearing the tax themselves, effectively paying double business tax. The burden is heavy and indeed difficult. Currently, various industries pay business tax at half the statutory rate. Therefore, the association's request to change the banquet tax to 10% of the tax rate is not without precedent and is consistent with the actual collection situation before January 1946. It is requested that this reduction be approved to allow the industry to breathe. The banquet tax is levied to restrict extravagant consumption by the people, and daily meals should not be included in the levy. Even if to prevent evasion of taxes by breaking up banquets into smaller meals, the starting price for taxation should be set according to current prices and the proportion of the gap between last September to avoid the current phenomenon of every restaurant being taxed, leaving some room for ordinary people seeking mere sustenance. The third and fourth points are purely procedural issues, but the methods are complicated and strict, akin to nitpicking, making people hesitant. The internal organization and personnel of restaurants cannot be like those of modern corporate stores, with complete accounting procedures and trained accounting personnel. If the originally planned methods are implemented, it will inevitably lead to frequent mistakes and heavy penalties, which is not in line with the state's original intention of enacting laws to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. The association's request to supplement taxes and discuss penalties based on the discovered invoices is sufficient to demonstrate punishment and warning. The use of estimation methods will inevitably lead to large-scale harassment, akin to the fabrications of the past. Invoices are only used to record the number of meals and should only be clear enough to be effective. If a unified format is issued, it will inevitably lead to difficulties in use due to the uneven level of education of the users. All measures established by the government should be easy for the people to understand and follow, avoiding trivialities. The government's order to unify the invoices of merchants, starting with the restaurants with uneven levels of education, will create endless difficulties. It is suggested that it be exempted for public convenience."

### Verdict of Japanese War Criminal Sakai Takashi

[Continued from the August 31st issue of this newspaper] While supervising the battle in the Nanhai area of Guangdong from November 1941 to March 1943, he allowed his troops to massacre countless villagers. The names of those who can be identified include Cai Li Shi and Tang Di Xiang, along with over a hundred others who were shot with machine guns or stabbed with swords. Civilians were subjected to cruel tortures such as waterboarding and hanging, resulting in severe injuries to nineteen people including Li Yong Gen and the deaths of Po Huo, Shen Qiang, and Lu Yong Lu. The most brutal methods of killing included hanging Li Hui in Shipai Village, Shatou Township, setting him on fire, throwing him into the river, and shooting him to death with machine guns.

Furthermore, in Huangsha, Guangzhou, the pregnant villager Ma He Shi, who was six months pregnant, was severely injured and suffered a miscarriage after being struck with an iron rod. Ouyang Liu Shi was beaten and thrown into the river to drown. In the valleys near Sanshui County, two young women were gang-raped by fourteen of his subordinates, who then cut open their abdomens and fed their blood to dogs. In Nanwen Village, villagers Xing Yi Mei and her husband were brutally dissected alive with kitchen knives, and died in agony. He also allowed his troops to drive civilians out of their homes in various parts of Nanhai County, leaving the elderly, women, and children displaced. He burned down over 700 houses, confiscated over 100 acres of paddy fields, and plundered countless amounts of food, poultry, and livestock from the people. On December 8, 1941, he personally led a large army to raid Hong Kong, assuming that the isolated island was defenseless and easy to conquer. He ordered his troops to conquer it within two days. However, due to the fierce resistance of the Hong Kong garrison, they did not land until the 17th of the same month. In anger and resentment, cruel thoughts arose. During the half-month after entering Hong Kong, he allowed his subordinates to carry out large-scale massacres, rapes, and looting in order to retaliate and display their power. British, Canadian, and volunteer soldiers stationed at Hong Kong military bases were killed after surrendering as prisoners. For example, on December 17 and 18, 1941, over thirty prisoners were massacred in a row at Lei Yue Mun. Twenty-four prisoners were massacred at the West Point battery. Those whose names can be verified include British gunner Macdonald and volunteer Guo and five others. On December 19th, already captured British soldiers Gosling and Mackechnie and volunteer K. Lim were massacred on Stanley Peninsula. On December 27th, fifteen prisoners were massacred at Yu Dong Xuan's villa in Repulse Bay. On December 29th, over fifty prisoners were massacred in Wong Nai Chung Gap. Many captured British Royal Scots were massacred in Repulse Bay, including Lieutenant Colonel Macpherson. Six officers and soldiers of the British Middlesex Regiment were massacred in Deep Water Bay. Most of the aforementioned victims had their hands tied behind their backs and were stabbed to death from the back with bayonets. Some were decapitated, and their skulls were crushed, and their brains were splattered. As for non-military bases that were purely Red Cross aid agencies and military hospitals, not only were all the captured wounded soldiers massacred, but the police officers and nurses who were engaged in treatment were also poisoned. For example, on December 19, 1941, near the Methodist Church in Shaukeiwan, members of the British Royal Army Medical Corps who surrendered were massacred, including Buchan, Watt, Newton, Mohan, Williams, Macforquhar, Dunne, Reid, Langley, Harrison, Kelly, and an Indian soldier, as well as five Chinese stretcher-bearers and Dr. Oroff and Brigadier Laurson, totaling about twenty people. They were either driven to the reservoir and stabbed to death from behind with military swords, or they were taken to the mountains and machine-gunned to death. From December 24 to 26, at St. Stephens Hospital on Stanley Peninsula, 60 to 70 captured wounded soldiers and 25 hospital staff were massacred. The method of killing was to massacre them in order from the sickbeds. The sounds of knives, swords, explosions, moans, and wails were deafening and unbearable. The nurses Miss Gordon, Mrs. Fidoe, Mrs. Simmons, and four Chinese women were raped in the hospital. Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Buxton, and Mrs. Begg were chopped into several pieces, their blood and flesh a blur. Lieutenant Colonel Black and Captain Witney, who were hiding in the toilet, were also found and stabbed to death with swords. J. Mokay, a Canadian rifleman, was brutally gouged out, his ears cut off, his tongue cut out, and slowly tortured to death. At the Catholic Maryknoll Church hospital in Stanley, three captured wounded British soldiers were thrown out of the window from a high building and fell to their deaths on the ground. Twelve captured wounded British officers and soldiers were beheaded. As for the Blue Pool Road in Happy Valley, which had nothing to do with the military and was the residence of Chinese people, groups of soldiers were sent to carry out atrocities. For example, at 6 PM on December 22, forty-eight residents were massacred at No. 2 Blue Pool Road, including Zou Yue, the son of Central Committee member Zou Lu, as well as Xie Fencheng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, and Wang Zhongchang and his son. Pregnant women were raped, and girls as young as twelve or thirteen were gang-raped. Their property was looted. On the same day, cavalry rushed to No. 42 Nanpu Road and massacred over thirty Chinese residents. Mai Zuoheng, an employee of the Central Trust Bureau, was also stabbed nine times but escaped because the wounds were not fatal. In addition, on December 18 and 28, 1941, multiple women were raped in Anle Village, Fanling, Kowloon. The sound of screams never ceased at night. He also incited wolves to bite pedestrians, which was inhuman. Furthermore, he paid special attention to seizing our country's cultural treasures. After occupying Hong Kong, he ordered Major Miyaki Hiroshi to lead a team to the Fung Ping Shan Library of the University of Hong Kong on Bonham Road to search for and seize 111 boxes of rare books from the National Central Library. He also seized 20 boxes of Western books and magazines deposited in the Wing On Warehouse in Sai Wan that belonged to the National Peking Library. The various atrocities are too numerous to record. After the end of the war, he was captured by the 11th War Zone Command and transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.

Reasons

The defendant and Meijiro Umezu were both major figures in implementing Japan's aggressive policies in China. During his time as the commander of the infantry unit and chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison Army, he violated international conventions and engaged in undermining the integrity of our country's administration and territory. Initially, he used treacherous parties to organize plainclothes teams to disrupt Tianjin and Beijing and secretly set up assassination agencies to assassinate key party and government officials. He then used force to threaten our military and political authorities to dismiss the administrative head of Hebei Province and withdraw the Hebei garrison, in an attempt to realize the proposition of the five provinces of North China separating from the Central Government and independently exercising autonomous political power. This fact is not only substantiated by the secret telegrams from former military and political leaders of North China to our Supreme Military Authority, the telegrams from former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting-e describing the situation in Tianjin and Beijing at the time, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Substitute Telegram No. 1005, which detailed the hard demands made by the defendant and Major Akahashi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, to the Beijing Branch of the Military Affairs Commission on May 29, 1935, but can also be verified. Furthermore, Gao Xingya, who often participated in the investigation of party and government affairs in North China, testified clearly in court. It is also consistent with the statement made by "Major General Tanaka Takayoshi of this army in Tokyo on July 9th of this year before the Far East International Tribunal, which stated that 'Colonel Sakai was a subordinate of Umezu Mijiro and was the most ardent advocate of separating the five provinces of North China from the Central Government and establishing five independent autonomous political powers.'" (See Attachment A) As for how the defendant, while serving as the commander of the 23rd Army stationed in Guangdong, organized a peace army to support a puppet regime, there are secret telegrams attached in the dossier from Chen Niaozu, the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, to Wang Niaoming and Chen Niaojun reporting on the political situation supervised by the defendant's subordinates Yazaki. Next, during the defendant's operations in the Nanhai area of Guangdong, he allowed his troops to massacre over a hundred innocent villagers, including Cai Li Shi and Tang Di Xiang. He also abused his power by applying cruel punishments, abusing and killing women and children, displacing civilians, plundering property, burning down over 700 houses, and confiscating over 100 acres of paddy fields.

Do Not Let Prices Cause Disturbances

Prices had finally stabilized for a while, and the labor unrest that had been emerging here and there had fortunately subsided. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, the increase in the exchange rate was announced, and all kinds of prices experienced huge fluctuations. Of course, the authorities have legitimate reasons for increasing the exchange rate, and it has been seriously discussed by many experts. The intention is to curb the dumping of American goods, encourage the export of domestic goods, stop the leakage of national funds, and save the precarious domestic manufacturers. It can be said that this is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

However, what is the reality before us? Not to mention foreign goods, even goods that have nothing to do with foreign exchange have risen by several times. Even firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and even the vegetables in the vegetable market, have followed suit and increased in price. Although the authorities have repeatedly admonished businessmen, those who speak earnestly are met with disdain. What can be done? Only the workers who live on meager salaries are suffering. Their monthly income was already insufficient to cover expenses, and now it has been discounted by 20-30%, which is truly heartbreaking!

Now, we can only appeal to the authorities to use decisive measures to suppress the unreasonable price increases. Otherwise, the hidden worries for the future are just beginning!

### Answering Readers' Legal Questions

(1) Redemption of Farmland

Asked by Song Youwen of Wuxing

My friend Mr. Wang, being unable to repay the debt he owed me in 1929, used one mu of rented inheritance land to repay the debt at an agreed price. My mother handled this matter (I was still a minor). At that time, no contract was drawn up as proof, and Mr. Wang soon passed away. Unexpectedly, in 1942, Mr. Wang's nephew, using evil forces, wanted to redeem it at the original price (one silver dollar counted as one legal tender). I refused because the value of the currency then and now differs by thousands of times. I would like to ask (1) How should this be handled legally? (2) If he agrees to redeem it, how should the currency value be calculated? (3) Can I ask him to collect rent and public grain rice during his management period?

[Answered by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] Since the transfer of ownership of this land was not legally established, although he occupied it peacefully and continuously for ten years with the intention of ownership, and did not request registration as the owner, its nature can only be recognized as a pledge payment, occupying another person's real estate and having the right to use and profit from it. When Mr. Wang's nephew forcibly occupied the land, he could claim restitution as the occupier and remove the obstacle, but this right to claim has already expired due to not being exercised within the statutory period. For the current disposition, if Mr. Wang's nephew is not a legal heir of Mr. Wang and does not have ownership of the land, he can negotiate with Mr. Wang's legal heirs, and let them come forward to claim ownership and take back the forcibly occupied land from the nephew. If he is a legal heir of Mr. Wang, and the land has been taken away, evidence or proof of the price Mr. Wang pledged the land for during his lifetime should be provided to be compensated. (2) You can request the court to fairly rule and make a judgment to increase the payment in accordance with the law. (3) If Mr. Wang's nephew is not a legal heir of Mr. Wang, then the legal owner can collect it from him.

(2) Housing Dispute

Asked by Chu Songyin: In 1937, I rented out my extra house to someone, stating at the time that it was temporary, so no contract was signed and no lease procedures were completed. Unexpectedly, they have lived there for several years, and both parties' children have grown up. The housing is not enough, and I have repeatedly pleaded with them to move out and take it back for my own use. They said that they did not have suitable housing at the time and would move out immediately when they had a house. They suddenly moved out last month on the 25th, leaving behind a few broken odds and ends, and did not return the lease. After checking the household registration, I learned that two people were still not reported (eight people in total). Can I set a deadline for them to return the lease? Is there any conflict with the Lease Law?

[Answered by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] If the situation of taking it back for self-occupancy is necessary and true, and there are ways to prove it, the lease can be terminated, and the house can be taken back. The deadline should be notified at least one month in advance and the end date of each rental payment period should be the termination date of the contract.

### New China Bank Holds Student Loan Program

The New China Trust & Savings Bank has been holding student loan programs for underprivileged students for many sessions, with excellent results. Starting this year, in view of the expensive tuition fees and the difficulty of entering school, it has decided to entrust the Bank Association to continue running the program. Registration has already begun. It is reported that the loan program held by the bank this year is limited to senior accounting, banking, and applied economics majors. Those interested can request the regulations from the Bank Association at 59 Hong Kong Road and go through the registration procedures.

### "Eye Disease Prevention Campaign" Registration Deadline Tomorrow

The "Eye Disease Prevention Campaign" jointly organized by this column and the Relief Hospital at 547 Xizang South Road has received an enthusiastic response since applications began on the 23rd. The first batch of 150 people is about to reach the limit. We hope that middle school and university students and faculty members with eye disease will apply for registration at the hospital as soon as possible. The deadline is 5 PM tomorrow. Please do not miss this opportunity.

### Relief for the Lonely and Destitute: Sixth People Approved in the Fifth Batch

Entrusted by Elder Qingxia, this column is managing the relief effort for the lonely, destitute, and sick. In the fifth batch, twelve people applied. Except for those residing outside the area and those whose procedures were incomplete, which were temporarily delayed, six applicants were approved. These include: Chen Zhenqiu, 60,000 yuan; Liu Axiang, 50,000 yuan; Chen Zhangzhenying, 70,000 yuan; Wang Jimin, 70,000 yuan; Xu Qianru, 80,000 yuan; and Du Licai, 60,000 yuan. The above-approved individuals should bring their original neighborhood head and guarantor-signed and sealed receipts to the office to collect the funds after receiving the notification letter from this newspaper. Furthermore, the relief fund is about to be exhausted, while applications continue to arrive daily, creating a "no rice to cook" situation. The plight of the lonely, destitute, and sick, teetering on the brink of starvation, is truly miserable. We hope that kind-hearted individuals at sea will generously donate to prevent any interruption. This would be a great act of kindness.

### Service Briefs

Lost Money to be Claimed: Mr. Fang Jin feng of the Shanghai Post Office Western Orchestra, while passing near the Social Affairs Bureau on Lin Sen Central Road, found a bundle of banknotes and a seal. The owner is requested to prepare a receipt and come to the office to claim them. Mr. Fang's honesty in not pocketing what he found on the road is commendable and worthy of respect.

Free Clinic and Medicine: The grass shacks and sheds in the Jum en Road area of this city are densely populated with impoverished people who lack health knowledge, making them susceptible to illness. Recognizing this, the Guan Sheng Charity Association, with the support of Mr. Wang Huiting of the Construction Industry Association, established a free clinic and medicine dispensary at No. 7, Lane 360, Jumen Road, with the contributions of various members. They have appointed two traditional Chinese medicine physicians, Ma Wenwo and Sun Siqing, to provide consultations from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily.

### Soviet Russia in 1946: The Kremlin's One-Party Rule, but Not Against the Will of the People

— Written by Atkinson, New York Times Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Translated by Dong

To discuss friendship and cooperation with the Soviet government, we must abandon our conventional notion of "friendship." We usually think of friendship as a close relationship or a politically well-intentioned compromise—such friendship is neither necessary, possible, nor existent in Soviet relations. Because the Soviet government is a political machine, various interpersonal approaches are ineffective.

Generally speaking, the Russian people are admirable—sincere, hardworking, practical, powerful, sensible, and courageous. But to establish relations with the Russian people, we must first engage with the Soviet government. This government, despite its high-sounding rhetoric of "democracy," is actually a one-party dictatorship. The so-called dictatorship of the proletariat is, in practice, a dictatorship by the thirteen members of the Communist Party Politburo.

There is no freedom to speak of within the Soviet Union. To the best of my knowledge, this government does not act against the will of the people, nor is it corrupt, although there are occasional irregularities, such as the recent factory fraud case and the Crimean rebellion. My overall impression is that the Soviet people largely believe in and respect their government authorities.

However, because the Soviet government is essentially a machine, its task is to generate power and exert influence both internally and externally. Therefore, any strategy based on friendship is bound to fail. We are not enemies with the Soviet Union, but we are not friends either. In the coming years, we can only achieve a state of "armed peace" at best.

Never Scruple to Use Any Means to Achieve the Goal

When dealing with the Soviet Union, we must adopt their customary power politics when faced with conflicting interests. Of course, this is an extremely reactionary approach, but we must recognize that the spirit of the Soviet government is fundamentally reactionary. This can be seen in its attitude towards defeated nations and the Red Army's actions in the Northeast. The Soviet government, having become accustomed to using force internally, naturally thinks the same way externally. Westerners who have witnessed the Soviet Union's actions are often horrified.

Why is the Soviet Union so difficult to deal with? There are many reasons, of course. One is that the current Soviet leaders rose to power through violence. During the revolution, they had to seize power in a hostile environment. Even now, they believe that the methods of 1917 are the shortcut to success. Under the tyranny of the old Russian emperors, they developed a habit of absolute obedience to discipline for the sake of revolutionary work, and they also learned how to operate secretly. The Soviet leaders owe their current position to this vigilance and obedience to discipline, and they firmly believe that they must continue to do so to expand their authority.

A common belief among Soviet government officials is that they never scruple to use any means to achieve their goals. Perhaps it is for this reason that the first socialist country in history has not only failed to liberate workers, but has instead turned workers' labor and thoughts into slaves.

The Russian Revolution was originally a large-scale underground operation. It was planned underground, using deception, violence, and secret maneuvers. This approach still exists today. The Soviet government still keeps everything secret. Foreigners don't know what the Soviet government is doing, and even the Soviet people don't necessarily know much. Sometimes, they know even less than foreigners, because some information leaks abroad. The violent methods of the revolutionary era also persist. No one can say how many millions of political prisoners are imprisoned or exiled. Estimates range from ten million to fifteen million. No other government in the world has so many problems waiting to be solved. The Soviet government not only has to carry out an industrial revolution and a political revolution, but also needs to find effective and rapid ways to educate the people.

The Soviet government's domestic policies can be said to have achieved great success, but the general leaders always feel insecure, which is difficult for foreigners to understand. Stalin is probably the most heavily guarded person in the world. In Russia, every citizen and foreigner must carry identification cards and passports at all times. These measures, which we consider wartime measures, are the daily security guarantee in the Soviet Union.

No Resistance Movements in Various Parts of the Soviet Union

To the best of my knowledge, there are no open movements resisting the Soviet government. It is widely rumored that the island of Crane is dissatisfied with the current government, believing that the island of Crane suffered excessive losses during the war and that the government should be held fully responsible. Last December, the Soviet Communist Party headquarters was burned down, which is generally believed to be an anti-Soviet conspiracy. However, the Soviet government's position is solid and it has the ability to subdue all reactionary forces. This is because it led the Soviet people to victory in the war against Japan. The Communist Party naturally takes credit for itself, even denying the contributions of various allied countries in defeating Germany, and claiming credit for defeating Japan.

Except for sometimes blaming the government for the hardship of life, the general public believes in the government. However, the Soviet government authorities always feel insecure. They probably believe that the country is so backward that they should have full authority to implement national policies in a short period of time in order to improve its status, and should not allow criticism or opposition. They treat domestic affairs in this way, and foreign affairs as well, except that they do not have the guarantee of news control abroad, nor the means to prohibit opposition.

Part of our difficulty with the Soviet Union is due to the ignorance of the Soviet rulers. Most of them have never been abroad, and have developed a morbid fear of the outside world after being isolated for so many years. The spirit of the Soviet government is xenophobic. Since the bloody purge of 1936, they have always had an inexplicable fear of foreigners, considering them either spies or enemies. Therefore, Soviet people who contact foreigners are regarded as betraying the Soviet Union, and the rulers are the same. Intimate contact with foreigners carries the risk of being relegated to the cold palace.

Most people believe that Stalin is the most knowledgeable person in the Soviet government. However, he still does not understand freedom or democracy. His understanding of foreign countries is mostly based on his past Marxist indoctrination and the unfair reports of his current ambassadors and journalists abroad. The leaders of the Soviet Union are all eating "isolated" pies. Despite having information about foreign countries, they lack the experience to analyze it. Because they have always lived behind the "Iron Curtain," they lack what we consider normal judgment in all foreign affairs.

After the Moscow Conference last December, many foreigners believed that Soviet decision-making was returning to the pre-war situation, recognizing capitalist countries as the inevitable enemies of the Soviet Union. In this atmosphere of fear of the outside world, it is naturally much easier to rule the people.

The atmosphere in Soviet Russia is fundamentally abnormal. The result of isolation has made its ideas and culture stagnant. The result of news censorship makes the general public have a neurotic reaction to rumors. For example, when Churchill gave a speech in the United States criticizing the Soviet Union, the news was withheld for many days. When it was finally released, the general reaction was so intense that it seemed like an atomic bomb was about to be dropped. With the experience of World War II, we all know that international political and economic cooperation is the only way to avoid war. But the Soviet Union's experience tells us the importance of global cultural and intellectual cooperation.

Soviet Xenophobia is Actually Neurotic

There are no new ideas in the Soviet Union, always rehashing old patterns. All the newspapers say almost the same thing on the same day, in almost the same way. With few exceptions, every writer's work is similar. Because of the Soviet government's isolationist and xenophobic policies, and because it strictly enforces censorship of news and prohibits the publication of news, Soviet culture has become lifeless and mired in customs.

I don't understand science, so I can't judge Soviet industry. I only know that the level of Soviet art is very low. From all aspects of observation, I can say with certainty that the level of Soviet drama, art, and music is low. I suspect that the Soviet people themselves are aware of this. In general, Soviet literature and art lack vitality and have reached a state of stagnation. Under the power of political suppression, people have few opportunities to develop their individuality. In this abnormal atmosphere, all mental illnesses flourish. The most unreasonable thing is the pathological fear of the Soviet government authorities. They are afraid of everything, thinking that everyone is an enemy, and fearing that they are in danger of being surrounded and attacked at any time. But in fact? With the vast territory, rich resources, and courageous people of Soviet Russia, this mentality has no basis at all.

There is a common cliché in the United States that the Soviet authorities are a group of extremely cunning and outstanding talents, but I believe that they are actually mediocre, do not understand democracy, and cannot see clearly the actions of democratic countries.

The fundamental reason for the disharmony in international relations is that the Soviet Union is a socialist country that is seeking development and a way out in a capitalist world. According to the Communist Party, as long as capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States are in a dominant position like the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is in danger of being invaded.

Now, the Communist Party's view is still the same: The fascism of "monopoly capital" is preserving the power of fascism in preparation for attacking socialism. The Soviet newspapers portray the United States as a militaristic imperialist country, expanding its influence in all directions in the world and infringing upon the sovereignty of small and weak countries. The "monopoly capitalists" of the United States? They are the enemies of the world's peace-loving people.

International Week

### A Series of International Conferences, A Series of International Issues

— Chu Yuchen

Although the world's political situation after the war is constantly in turmoil, the waves have never been as turbulent as this week. There is a sense of one wave not settling before another rises. In the middle of last week, the Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, suddenly sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations General Assembly, Trygve Lie, regarding the continuous border conflicts between Greece and Albania, accusing Greece of endangering peace to the United Nations Security Council. He also accused British troops of staying in Greece, interfering in Greek internal affairs, and creating a turbulent situation in the Balkan Peninsula. This was a bolt from the blue, throwing a bomb at the Paris Peace Conference and causing the representatives of the 21 countries to panic and not know how to deal with it. However, the Security Council had no choice but to include this complaint in the agenda of the 28th meeting. The Soviet Union's diplomatic counterattack has thus begun.

Four Foreign Ministers Reopen Meetings

The Paris Peace Conference has been meeting for thirty days, and only heard the grand theories of representatives of the various countries. There has been no success. The proposed amendments to the peace treaty submitted by the representatives of the various countries are piled up like mountains, totaling more than 250. Taking only the draft treaty for discussion, almost every article needs to be amended. Assuming that these amendments are all proposed for discussion and representatives of the various countries are allowed to express their opinions freely, the conference will probably not be able to "successfully close" by the end of this year. However, the objective international environment does not allow the conference to be delayed in this way. First, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open in New York on September 23, so whether these two important international conferences will be held simultaneously has become a serious issue. According to the current situation, the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States advocate holding the conference and the United Nations General Assembly simultaneously. The Soviet Union believes that the United Nations General Assembly can only be held after the conference ends; China and France are in the middle, advocating that the conference should proceed slowly during the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, in any case, the conference will lose its importance during the United Nations General Assembly, and at least international attention will be diverted. Therefore, the conference should try to speed up its work before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Second, Europe and the Far East are closely connected under the current international relations. If the stalemate in Europe cannot be broken, the problems in the Far East cannot be solved early. If the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland cannot be established, the peace conference with Japan cannot be produced. Therefore, for the sake of the entire world's future, the Paris Peace Conference must speed up its work and complete its tasks as soon as possible.

The Security Council Has Another Dispute

The United Nations Security Council also held a meeting in New York on the 28th of this month, first discussing the issue of several non-member countries requesting to join the United Nations organization. The countries requesting to join the United Nations organization include Afghanistan, Iceland, Sweden, Transjordan, Southern Ireland, Portugal, Albania, and Outer Mongolia. The United States representative, Johnson, advocated allowing all eight countries to join the organization, but this was opposed by the Soviet representative, Gromyko, who advocated handling them separately. Therefore, the United Nations organization membership qualification review committee of the Security Council began its work. First, it unanimously passed the admission of Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden to the United Nations organization. Later, when discussing the issue of the remaining five countries requesting to join the organization, opinions diverged and another dispute arose, preventing these five countries from getting what they wished.

Among these countries applying to join, the most noteworthy is Outer Mongolia. With the support of the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian Republic, she applied to the United Nations Security Council for membership. The United Nations Secretariat considered that the situation in Outer Mongolia was not well understood and needed to be investigated, and raised three questions for it to answer; The Chinese representative also requested the Security Council to postpone the discussion; However, the Soviet representative insisted repeatedly, so we abandoned the previous proposal. When voting, China and the Soviet Union voted in favor, and the United Kingdom and the United States voted against, so Outer Mongolia was still not approved to join the United Nations organization.

Accusing Greece: Britain and the Netherlands Oppose

The representative of the Ukrainian Republic, Manuilsky, accused Greece to the Security Council of endangering world peace due to the border conflict between Greece and Albania. However, when this issue was submitted to the Security Council for discussion, it was first met with opposition from Britain and the Netherlands, who both said that the Ukrainian representative's accusation against Greece was neither sufficiently justified nor sufficiently evidenced. Although the Soviet representative requested to invite representatives from both Greece and Ukraine to the meeting to state their opinions, this was also opposed by representatives of various countries. Therefore, this accusation was shelved.

Person of the Week

### George Bernard Shaw, Still Vigorous in Old Age

— (Translated from the "New York Times" by Xi Jie)

At the age of ninety, George Bernard Shaw is still as witty as ever—his sharp wit, gentle smile, and upright posture are still those of a straightforward thinker, forever a traitor in thought.

His life is serious and disciplined, and his living habits are largely the same as they were forty years ago. It's just that you will no longer see him riding around on a bicycle, or giving speeches in public; you won't run into him packing luggage, preparing for a trip around the world; and you won't see him swimming in the morning. He has long given up all of this, because he has other things to do. His day's work is quite tense, and he feels that he is too old to do those things again, while he feels that he is not old enough to deal with the intricate and complex affairs of the world. After starting a job, it takes him a long time to complete it. When that job is completed, he tells us what else needs to be done.

The issue that Shaw is least interested in is the issue of death. His vitality is so abundant that he wouldn't worry about such things. Many people who have long since died—William Morris, Nansen, Oscar Wilde, Wagner, Rodin, etc.—become lifelike after being touched by his few words. In his eyes, these people are still alive. Although he lives in seclusion in a remote rural area and is isolated from the world, he is actually at the heart of world affairs and has never left them.

Shaw is an optimist. His view of life is completely optimistic. He once said, "Life, whether it is happy or sad, successful or unsuccessful, is always very interesting."

Look at his daily life. He starts his day's work with intense interest. He gets up very early and doesn't go to bed until late at night. Every night, he listens to news reports from radio stations around the world, not letting a single word go easily. Regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, snowing or stormy, he always runs to the small house at the end of his garden to work, where he sits quietly writing until noon. After meals, he closes his eyes and rests briefly on the couch. When work is particularly busy, he sacrifices his afternoon nap. In the evening, he always sits in an armchair, reading newspapers and books to relax, or listens to music or talk shows on the radio with great interest.

Although Shaw likes to lock himself in a room to continue writing books and articles, his life is not lonely. He often tells his friends in the old place, "I am starting to write a new drama!" In fact, the world is also eagerly waiting for him to write some new creations.

He is a realist. He is never pessimistic, never disappointed. He believes that everything in the world has hope of being saved, and he feels that he himself has many shortcomings that need to be corrected. He feels that as long as mankind has determination, it can also save its many shortcomings in the same way. He has tried various ways to save mankind. He has repeatedly ridiculed us, but still holds great hope, and is confident that his views are correct. He is always ready to listen to the opinions of scientists, preachers, artists, and philosophers, and pool their wisdom in the hope of finding a solution to save mankind. Shaw can be said to be a truly courageous fighter.

George Bernard Shaw is studying and creating a new type of writing that saves time and effort. He believes that language and writing should be as simple and expressive as the chirping of birds.

When I see Shaw's tall and upright figure, or when he sits comfortably and talks about world affairs, I get a new era consciousness, a simple and goal-oriented era consciousness. He may not have achieved his ideal, but he has already used his laughter and roar to make us move forward one step.

Spring and Autumn (History)

### Trajectory

— Hong Wei Fa

A person's rise and fall, honor and disgrace, often relies on luck, just like gambling, and this is especially true for men of letters. For example:

"When Yi Fu first met the emperor, Emperor Taizong ordered him to compose a poem about the island. Yi Fu said, 'In the sun, the morning colors rise, and in the zither, night cries are heard; The imperial garden has so many trees, yet I don't share a branch to build a tower.' The Emperor said, 'I will give you the whole garden, not just a branch.'" (Records of Tang Poetry, Volume 4)

This is the story of Li Yifu.

"Emperor Ming summoned Hao Ran to recite his work. He recited, 'I have given up writing to the emperor in the north, and returned to my humble cottage in the south. The talentless are abandoned by enlightened rulers, and the ailing are alienated by old friends. White hair urges old age, and the green sun approaches the end of the year. I yearn with sorrow and cannot sleep; the pine moon shines through the empty night window.' The Emperor said, 'Did you not seek me, or did I abandon you? Why didn't you write of vaporous clouds rising over Dongting Lake, and waves rocking Yueyang City?' Therefore, he became an official." (Records of Tang Poetry, Volume 23)

This is the story of Meng Haoran. In fact, regarding "The imperial garden has so many trees, yet I don't share a branch to build a tower," and "The talentless are abandoned by enlightened rulers," one could say that both express resentment, or one could say that both express a desire for position. However, one met Emperor Taizong, and the other met Emperor Ming, resulting in one rising and one falling, one honored and one disgraced. Because the power of rise and fall, honor and disgrace, lies in the hands of others, and depends solely on their momentary likes and dislikes, there is naturally no trajectory to be found. If this lack of a traceable trajectory constantly occupies one's mind, it will lead to sadness and resentment, increasing the speed of one's own destruction.

Lu Zhaolin, one of the Four Paragons of the Early Tang, was naturally very pitiable in terms of his life experience. According to the Old Book of Tang, he "resigned from his official position due to wind sickness, and lived in the White Mountain, focusing on taking medicine. Later, his illness worsened, and he moved to Mount Jucishan in Yangdi, writing 'Discourse on Relieving Illness,' 'Five Laments,' and other works, with the style of a poet, and was highly regarded by scholars. Since Zhaolin was bedridden and disabled, unable to bear the suffering, he bid farewell to his relatives and then threw himself into the Ying River to die. He was forty years old at the time." What a tragic scene of a tragedy's ending! However, the New Book of Tang says, "Zhaolin believed that during Emperor Gaozong's time, officials were esteemed, while Empress Wu Zetian esteemed the law, and he alone esteemed Huang-Lao (Daoism); After the Empress sealed Mount Song, she repeatedly recruited virtuous scholars, but he was already abandoned. He wrote 'Five Laments' to express himself. As his illness persisted, he said farewell to his relatives and drowned himself by the Ying River." According to this account, his tragic destruction of himself was not only due to the unbearable suffering of wind sickness, but also greatly related to his constant preoccupation with the untraceable trajectory of rise and fall, honor and disgrace. This is truly self-inflicted suffering.

The Stories of Emperor Wu of Han says: "The Emperor once arrived at the Langshu office and saw an old man with white hair and beard, and incomplete clothing. The Emperor asked, 'When did you become a courtier, and why are you so old?' The man replied, 'My name is Yan Si, from Jiangdu. I was a courtier during Emperor Wen's reign.' The Emperor asked, 'Why have you not been successful?' Si said, 'Emperor Wen liked literature, and you like military affairs; Emperor Jing liked the elderly, and I was young; Your Majesty likes the young, and I am old: Therefore, I have not been successful in three reigns.'" The "Miscellaneous Records of a Rustic Guest" says: "This matter is very similar to Feng Tang's situation. The Bai Tie says that during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, Feng Tang was a courtier with white hair. The Emperor asked him, and he replied, 'I have not been successful in three reigns.'" Whether it is Yan Si or Feng Tang, their spirit of not complaining about themselves and doing things their own way is always worthy of admiration. I think writers who are faithful to literature and art should continue to advance along their own trajectory!

### Professor and Daughter (Novel)

— Shi Bei

Today at noon, Professor Sun returned from teaching at school, having to walk more than four li to get back to this house. This house was on the edge of a small village, with a row of low fences surrounding a corner of vegetable garden in front. Under a camphor tree on the side of the house was a wooden cage; leaning against the wall were several rows of bamboo poles for drying clothes. These were all things that Professor Sun and his daughter, Mei Jing, had put together to make the place more orderly.

Although the village was far from the school, the preparatory class attached to the school was located here, and every three days, people from nearby villages came here for the market, so on Sundays and market days, the place became lively. There were many osmanthus and maple trees in the village, and there was also a small river in the front village, with dense weeping willows on both banks, covering the river with green shade in the summer, making the river water look like a piece of green jade. Professor Sun's house was right next to the riverbank. To those who love rural scenery, this was a very quiet and elegant place, but some people who were used to living in urban mansions would not even be willing to take a single step inside.

Due to the impact of the war, Professor Sun had wandered from the coast of Central China to the southern border. One year, his wife died while fleeing, and his eldest son was studying at a university in Sichuan. Now, only sixteen-year-old Mei Jing was left to accompany him.

At the school, he taught courses in the history of English literature and selected English poetry. He had to go to school early every morning to teach. He once said to his students in the classroom, "I will still come as usual in stormy weather, but I will only not come if there is thunder and lightning during the storm. You can use this time as a standard for when I will be teaching. Because it is dangerous to run four or five li in the suburbs in stormy weather with thunder and lightning." He said this with a smile, but it was indeed his principle for teaching.

Now, he was walking closer and closer to home, dragging a faded coffee-colored cane, carrying a cloth bag containing a roll of English lecture notes and forty or fifty student attendance cards in one hand, and a bottle of oil in the other. Although he was over fifty years old, he was energetic, and his vigorous steps seemed to be measuring out the predetermined distance. His appearance and demeanor were completely that of an old English gentleman.

"Ah Mei! Is the rice cooked yet?" Professor Sun walked into the house, put down the things in his hand, turned around and went out the door, looking at his daughter who was drying clothes.

"It's already cooked, Dad. I even fried eggs for you! Waiting for you to buy oil, I can cook the vegetables and then we can eat... Rest for a while, and I'll pour you a cup of tea." Mei Jing didn't finish drying the clothes completely. She wiped her wet hands with her apron and walked briskly into the house.

She brought a cup of tea to her father, and then twisted the clothes in the basin dry and hung them on the bamboo poles before going back to cook.

It was already half past twelve, and the sun was scorching hot. There wasn't a breeze. His work at school and his life back home were as heavy and stuffy as the weather. He took a sip of tea, and beads of sweat dripped from his forehead. Mei Jing's figure, which had been turning around outside the door just now, was now active in the house. He watched silently. Although he had never mentioned his inner feelings for her to his daughter, every time he saw his daughter's thin figure, a painful scar was etched in his heart. This was something he couldn't express clearly, and he didn't know when this scar would heal.

He sat on the low stool in front of the door and wiped the sweat from his forehead and face with a handkerchief. The ancient red muscles of his cheeks, like the long ears of a Buddha, drooped downwards. They had once been very full, but now they were folded up. The thick lips under his mottled beard sighed softly.

He turned his face and looked at the clothes his daughter was drying on the bamboo pole. These were all washed for the students in the preparatory class. The monthly wage for washing clothes for the students was eight hundred yuan. At first, he didn't want his daughter to become a laundry woman, but for the sake of life, and because his daughter was born to be a diligent child, she always wanted to find some work to do at home to feel comfortable, and she also hoped to earn some rewards with her own labor to help her father. In this situation, even though he didn't agree, it had already become a reality. Now, Mei Jing was already washing clothes for more than a dozen students.

He saw the water dripping from the cuffs and edges of the clothes, like cold, clear teardrops falling on his heart, one by one. Gradually, he widened his eyes in pain and stared at them. He stood up, wanting to run over and twist the clothes drier for his daughter, but he saw a figure walking past outside the fence. He instinctively froze for a moment, and then suddenly sat back on the stool. The sweat on his forehead, like blooming flowers, overflowed and rolled down, overflowed and rolled down...

"Dad! Dinner is ready!" Mei Jing called out loudly from inside the house, and the sound of moving bowls and dishes could also be heard.

"Dad!..."

"Oh! I'm coming!"

"Dad, look, these two eggs were laid by our hen. These small white vegetables were sown ten days ago. I transplanted the seedlings, and they've grown so big in just a few days. Once they're cooked in oil, they're as green as a cat's eyes!"

He didn't say anything. He took off his glasses, which were covered with moisture from the hot rice, and moved the plate of eggs in front of his daughter.

"Dad, are you unhappy today?"

"No,... eat more eggs."

The scene outside the door just now continued to form a deep impression, stimulating him.

At dusk, a gentle breeze blew from the shade of the weeping willows on the riverbank, lightly brushing the leaves of the camphor tree, making a rustling sound. The distant clouds should have painted a beautiful picture for the late-blooming life!

At this time, Professor Sun looked relaxed, sitting on a bamboo recliner under the camphor tree, smoking a cigarette. He had already smoked three in a row.

Mei Jing was wearing a long dress with small blue flowers on a white background that she had worn two years ago. But she had grown quickly in the past two years, and the clothes no longer fit well. Because of this, her innocent and lively nature had returned to that of a child from a few years ago. She brought out a thick old photo album of her father's from the house, and also walked to her father's chair with a cup of tea in her hand.

"Dad, look, the cover of this photo album has fallen off. We haven't looked at this album since we left Xiamen that year," Mei Jing sat down on the stool next to her father and opened the photo album, placing it on the armrest of the recliner.

Mei Jing cherished this photo album the most, because it contained the shining brilliance of her golden childhood and recorded the traces of her father's dreamlike past life. Professor Sun also loved to recall past joys from this photo album. From many photos, he loved to tell about his life abroad, or the exotic customs and scenery he had personally experienced, which were things that Mei Jing never tired of hearing and had endless novelty and attraction. Professor Sun could also temporarily dissolve into the pleasure of old memories. The so-called transcendence of life is sometimes really about being able to gain imaginative satisfaction from other people's descriptions of pleasures that cannot be obtained, or being able to relive pleasures that have already disappeared. These two father and daughter gained the highest comfort at this time.

They talked about interesting things and looked at the old and beautiful photos. The cool evening breeze blew through their mottled white hair and dark black long hair intertwined together. Only on evenings like this could they forget the heaviness and suffering of daytime life, but this time was only a fleeting moment, and then the shadow of the night came up.

"Ah Mei, you go to sleep first. I still have to correct some practice notebooks."

"Dad, you have to go to sleep early too!"

After these two sentences were spoken, the shadows of the father and daughter under the tree outside the house disappeared.

Usually, Mei Jing was as busy as her father, doing the laundry, planting vegetables, raising chickens, and managing the household chores all by herself. She didn't mind the busyness of work, because lately her father often came home with a silent and melancholy look, so she pretended to be lively and happy. She knew that this could reduce her father's troubles. She had once thought: Why is Dad a returned student and has been a university professor for more than ten years, but she has been deprived of the opportunity to receive an education? This kind of thinking has long been driven away by her current work. Having wandered with her father for many years, she was no longer a girl who only knew how to act spoiled.

But her father's melancholy did not decrease. When he woke up in bed the next day at dawn, he heard the sound of his daughter washing clothes by the river. He wanted to call out "Ah Mei," but the sound reached his throat and was swallowed back down.

The sun rose, and morning dew covered the grassy path. Professor Sun's slow footsteps were heading in the direction of the school.

### Outside the Door

— Hao Ran

Under the scorching sun of midsummer, trudging like a camel across thousands of mountains and rivers, I finally arrived safely in front of my former residence, from which I had been separated for nine years. In an instant, my spirit became unusually tense, and my hot blood boiled, as if a commoner who had lived in the city for a long time had stepped into the deep palace of a despotic emperor. In that solemn and quiet atmosphere, I deeply felt my own insignificance. Indeed, it seemed that I was no longer the owner of this house. Otherwise, why would I hesitate again and again, pacing back and forth?

Outside the door, everything around should not be unfamiliar! At least, in the hazy dreams of the past, a faint impression remains. After being ravaged by countless storms of wind and rain, and smoked by the daily setting sun, the red paint on the door panels has peeled off piece by piece, which is the same as the possible scene I imagined. But the two bright and shiny large copper rings are still firmly embedded in the door, radiant and shining, like a pair of giant eyes watching the distance. I reached out and gently touched them, and then retracted my hand, because I was afraid of damaging their majesty. Copper rings! Haven't you resounded in my childhood dreams? Why are you silent now?

Outside the door, this semi-circular, slightly raised cement stepping stone used to be the temporary bed of many beggars. Now it is still white and solid. Every square and every line on its surface is familiar in my memory. Being in this area, even without entering the hall, I have already felt a warmth that is not found outside! Because inside this door is my home, home, the tailboard of the spirit! Home, the source of happiness!

I stood uneasily, imagining the tense and intimate scene of our first reunion. I must cherish this scene and engrave it in the depths of my heart, so that I will never forget it even after a lifetime! Is it a dream? Is it an illusion? Or is it iron-like reality? At this moment, I doubted a little again, because in countless dreamlike scenarios, I had also experienced standing outside the door. So, I turned my head and looked at the small car repair shop opposite, at the row of slender and distracted plane trees on both sides, and at the cloud of dust rolled up by the cars passing on the dirt road.

Driven by some unknown force, I suddenly realized that the place where I was standing was under the scorching sun. I felt the bursts of stimulation of ten thousand silver needles all over my body. My sweat had already penetrated a layer of undershirt, and my shirt was also a little damp. Moreover, a traffic policeman cast his eyes on my hesitant expression. I could no longer appreciate the scenery outside the door, so I pressed the doorbell, preparing to let my brothers and sisters, whom I might not recognize, come out and ask the guest's surname and name in surprise.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 22

This situation lasted for at most five minutes, and the gunfire stopped. Suddenly, I saw the searchlight in front of the truck light up again.

"Old man! Come quickly!" the child's high-pitched voice called out.

Before I could run close to the truck, Little Tiger had already greeted me, handing me the pistol in a relay race style. I saw that he seemed to be holding a Mauser pistol in his other hand.

"Tidy up here, I have to chase after them for a while, several Japanese devils have run away." Before he finished speaking, he had already run off.

"Tidy up!" This was the order the child gave me. I should do it as quickly and as well as possible to satisfy him; what if another truckload of Japanese soldiers chased after us?

I quickly inspected the truck. Except for the light on top of the cab, which had been destroyed, everything else was intact; it could be driven. I used the simplest and clearest language to explain to the drivers that the Japanese soldiers had been driven away; I told two people to carry the driver's body off the truck and throw it away (this was Little Tiger's first shot). I also told them to carry all the wounded soldiers onto the truck. We tore off the Japanese flag hanging on the truck and replaced it with a white handkerchief to avoid misunderstandings at the National Army checkpoints.

"What about the dead, sir?" the crowd asked me noisily.

"Carry them on too, as long as they are our people... Hurry... You are all patriots!" I encouraged them.

I saw that more than half of the drivers had blurry patches on their faces. I knew that those were wounds caused by bayonet stabs or rifle butt strikes, and the blood flowing from them was the result of the "Imperial Army's" bravery. Some of them were limping with every step; presumably their legs were injured.

"Did the Japanese hit you?" I asked a driver who was walking past me, staggering.

"Yes, sir... These past few days, it's been happening every day. I just won't let them check, can't I still pull the wounded soldiers?"

Listening to his tone, it seemed like this action was of a voluntary nature. "That can't be, can't you still eat?" I asked myself this question in my heart.

"How much should I pay? Let me pay!" I was preparing to pay them.

"Money? We can't fight the Japanese, can't we still be patriotic?" He stubbornly answered my insult to them.

### Traffic, Traffic

— Shao Fu

The terrible condition of Shanghai's traffic is unsurpassed today. This situation is not only deeply felt by us pedestrians, but also deeply understood by the mayor in his car.

In all honesty, the environment is complex, the funding is tight, the public morality of the citizens is questionable, and there are many difficulties. Improvement is not something that can be achieved overnight. However, people will remember the words spoken by Beethoven—a great musician of the world—to the Vienna City Government in 1819:

"I wish to prove that those who act with kindness and nobility will surely be able to bear hardship because of it."

Regarding the traffic problem, which is closely related to the personal safety of all citizens, I don't know how many times it has been bothered to listen. The reason for this is nothing more than that the first responsibility lies with the municipal authorities. We even think that whether the Shanghai municipal authorities are derelict in their duties can be used as a touchstone for traffic; we even think, how was it during the Concession era, and how is it now that it has been recovered? Please take a little care of your face and stop letting people laugh at you!

We dare not say that it is the result of our nagging. We can only think that it is something that the municipal authorities have long been harboring. In the past few days, the efforts of the authorities, people who have passed through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, as well as the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, can talk eloquently, proving that there are planned resolutions to rectify and actively improve the situation.

It is said that Police Chief Xuan Tiewu said at a graduation reunion of military academy classmates:

"If military vehicles continue to drive without license plates, please don't blame me for not considering the relationship between classmates!"

This conscientious attitude, combined with the planning of the Public Works Bureau, is also a major reason why the city's traffic can gradually get on the right track. We not only praise, but also are equally willing to support the efforts of the municipal authorities in this regard!

The municipal government has just started to do it, and it is worth our praise if it can do it, but we are willing to reserve the greatest cheers until after achievements have been made.

### Inside Story of Pickpockets

— Jin Lu

When you discover that the valuables in your pocket have disappeared, you don't have to be upset. The most appropriate way is to be careful next time!

The Lao Zha District Branch of the City Police Department recently arrested fifty-two "pickpockets," including men, women, old, and young. In order to promote public awareness, they held a grand performance of pickpocketing techniques in the open space of the bureau, which was also fresh, interesting, and eye-opening. It is said that there are as many as a dozen different methods of theft.

"Pickpockets" can be divided into two categories: those who specialize in picking money are called "claws"; those who specialize in pushing people or obscuring movements are called "decoys." In some cases, many "claws" act alone, without the help of decoys. Moreover, "claws" are mostly dressed neatly, looking very much like "young masters"; "decoys" always look like guys who make people hate them. In popular places and dark places, these "experts" can be divided into "trouser pocket hands," "flies," "watch pocket hands," and "beer hands" due to different skills.

"Trouser pocket hands" are the most skilled tycoons in the pickpocketing industry, with extremely nimble hands and feet. "Flies" are roles who specialize in stealing women's handbags, mostly mingling in department stores and other popular shops. "Watch pocket hands" specialize in picking pockets inside men's coats. The worst is "beer hands." The so-called "beer" refers to drunks and sleeping travelers. Pickpockets who do this business don't need any skills at all, so this is also the first step in becoming a pickpocket.

"Pickpockets'" methods of pickpocketing also advance with the times. Sometimes, they are also very good psychologists. They often hang around places where there are signs that say "Beware of Pickpockets" because when people see these signs, they always have to touch their pockets, and the more money they carry, the faster this reaction is. This is equivalent to telling the pickpocket, "My money is here." Detectives in Cannes, France, once discovered that "pickpockets" had opened a shop that specialized in selling ties at particularly cheap prices. When customers were crowded, the store clerk shouted, "Beware of Pickpockets." At the train station in St. Louis, a vendor's balloon flew into the air by accident. People were attracted by the balloon and looked up into the air, so the "pickpockets" took the opportunity to carry out their activities on a large scale.

"Pickpockets" also worship "old men." The river water does not interfere with the well water. Each has its own territory, so sometimes the stolen goods can be found. Sometimes you have important documents stolen, and when they find them useless, if there happens to be your business card inside, the pickpocket will mail them to you according to the address. This is pickpocket "morality."

The best "fat meat" for "pickpockets" are elderly people, blind people, nearsighted people, or people with several children.

When we go out, we should not carry too much money with us except for what we need. In short, you should pay attention at all times. When you are pushed in a crowd, or someone uses a newspaper or other covering to block your view, or someone asks you for a light for a cigarette and leans over, you should pay attention and take precautions. Don't think he is a respectable upper-class person, because you will be fooled if you only observe the other person's appearance.

Dear readers, beware of pickpockets!

### Prediction

— Qi Xian

At major tram stops such as the Bund on Great Horse Road, Seymour Road, and Baidu Bridge, a large number of portable travel benches or rattan chairs will be set up for the rest of light tram passengers, charging fifty or one hundred yuan per person. Passengers will have the convenience of "sitting and waiting," and those who set up the chairs will also have considerable income, which will be a win-win situation.

After rickshaws and pedicabs are eliminated, new-style rubber trams will arrive in Shanghai. The carriages will be stretchable and have three to five times the capacity of existing trams.

### The Hope to Make Good Use of the Baojia System

— You Jin

Now that we have the organization of the Baojia system, I hope we can make good use of it.

Currently, the people can probably still name the head of the Jia, but as for who is the head of the Bao, if you ask any commoner, they probably would be dumbfounded and not know what you're talking about.

I have several friends who are heads of Jia, and they all say in unison: "We only did something when investigating the population during January this year. Now, only the head of the Bao has relations with the district office, and the head of the Jia is just a title without substance."

This phenomenon is, of course, due to a lack of good use of the Baojia system.

For example, why not use the Baojia system for the subsidized sale of sugar to ensure universal and fair distribution, instead of going through merchants? Once white sugar and brown sugar reach the hands of merchants, they all become "black sugar." Please see the news on the second of this month, "Corrupt Merchants Illegally Selling Subsidized Sugar, Ten More Businesses Punished, Citizens Encouraged to Report at Any Time." Previously, six businesses were punished, and now ten more have been punished. This was discovered after investigation, but who knows how many more there are that have not been investigated or discovered? The white sugar has turned into black sugar, and the people cannot taste any sweetness. Yet, you still expect the people to do the reporting. While this hope is good, it is a double hardship for people who only taste bitterness, sourness, and spiciness, but not sweetness.

Therefore, I hope that for all subsidized goods, it would be better to use the Baojia system and distribute them according to the population. For example, I live in the 15th district, which has 35,718 households and 178,411 people. The population of each district in the city is certainly clear, so wouldn't distribution be fair and efficient? It would save the people from having to report and the authorities from having to investigate. Is it that the district and Baojia heads are not trusted, and it is feared that they will "annex the six states"? Or is it because the merchants have not yet made enough money?

### The Most Interesting Thing

— Xiao Yi

Tao La Sai Fei You Si, a famous songwriter of popular songs, was very naughty as a child. Once, in the sixth grade, her teacher asked her to write an essay with the topic "The Most Interesting Thing I Have Ever Seen." She handed in her paper after one minute. The teacher took her paper and saw that it read: "The most interesting thing I have ever seen is so interesting that it cannot be described."

### Comic Strip: Sanmao Joins the Army (92)

— By Zhang Leping

### Filler

— Suo Bei

The glamorous world, the dazzling Shanghai, there are too many fascinating places, too many fascinating things. However, after thinking for a long time, the most precious things are only two: knowledge and health. The former enriches life, so that you do not come empty-handed and leave quietly; the latter gives you more time to enrich life. Scientists believe that we should live for more than just a few decades, but because of excessive enjoyment, excessive "heartbreak," we are so short-lived, which is a pity. We must strive for health. But just being a workhorse is too meaningless. Besides health, we must know the most and understand the most. If you ask what is life? The answer should be: "Knowledge plus health."

### Talking About Long-Lived People

— Gan Lai

The famous biologist, Mr. Bo Zhuhong, published his research results in 1935: believing that the standard for human life expectancy should be seven times the growth period. For example, a horse needs four and a half years to mature, so its average lifespan is exactly 30 years. A person reaches adulthood at the age of twenty, and should live to 140 years old. However, in reality, human lifespan is far below this standard. Most biologists and medical experts believe this is due to excessive mental and physical labor.

On March 26th this year, Moscow announced: Soviet scientists have completed a longevity serum that can slow down the rate of human aging. After a certain number of years, it is hoped that the average human lifespan can be extended to 100 to 150 years. This serum is called ACS and functions to preserve the connective tissue between continuous human cells and blood vessels, stimulate cell activity, thereby improving the work of various organs and prolonging life. This serum has passed the experimental stage and is being widely used throughout the Soviet Union.

If it is effective, then not only will sayings like "seventy is rare since ancient times" be overturned, but "five generations living under one roof" will also be commonplace.

In the past forty or fifty years, there have been many "long-lived people" in various countries. For example, in the "Abkhazia" region of the Soviet Transcaucasus, there are several centenarians: the oldest one is Mr. Ai Zhen Suya, who lives in Gevada Village, and is 157 years old. The second is Mr. Ge Shiba of Garizhen, who is 132 years old, with a total of 102 descendants. He created a town with his own hands. The third is Mr. Xia Zhijukefu of Kardakfa Village, who looks no more than sixty years old, but has actually lived for a century and twenty-six years. He has written several novels and is a brave hunter.

The oldest person in Egypt was named Ma Kefu, who died on September 1, 1935, at the age of 153. He had a son when he was 80 years old, and his son was already 73 years old when Mr. Ma passed away.

We also had a centenarian, a man named Wang Daochang from Kaifeng. In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), he was already 108 years old, with clear eyesight and hearing, and good spirits. He ate one catty of steamed buns per meal. It is unknown whether he is still alive.

As for the title of "the country with the most long-lived people," it belongs to Bulgaria. Bulgaria has a population of only six million, but according to official surveys, there are 162 centenarians. This percentage of "human rui" (people of exceptional longevity) is truly unprecedented. There are several points about these Bulgarian centenarians that are worth studying: (1) All 162 people are farmers, and most are herders in mountainous areas. (2) Their bodies are not tall. (3) They all married between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. (4) Ninety-five percent of these centenarians do not eat meat throughout their lives. (5) They mostly like to drink alcohol, with only 20% not drinking. (6) Among these 162 people, 77 are men and 85 are women.

In Mumbai, India, there is also a "village of long life" - Belgariib - the village head is an old man of 110 years old. House number 12 in the village is home to a family of seventy, with an average age of ninety years old. The oldest in this family is an old lady, who is already 125 years old. She fell from the window of the building to the ground, although she suffered minor injuries, she soon recovered. The name "village of long life" is well deserved.
