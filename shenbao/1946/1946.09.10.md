### Intense Fighting Outside Koupei Pass; National Army in Eastern Sui Marches South Apace; Already Pressing Near Pingtichuan, Fengchen, and Jining

(Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, September 9th) Recent newspaper war reports have been largely inaccurate. Five days ago, it was reported that Koupei Pass had been recovered, but fierce fighting is still ongoing in the outer areas. The 93rd Army has advanced to Liangjianfang, ten kilometers from Koupei Pass, while the New 6th Army is advancing south from Luanping to attack Koupei Pass directly, currently crossing the He River and moving south. The National Army moving north from Chengteh, after garrisoning Lungwha, immediately began clearing the countryside and consolidating the outer areas, and has not yet advanced towards the encircled area. Reports from Peiping officials on the 6th regarding the recapture of Chifeng are inconsistent. A large army has now gathered in Jehol, with the 93rd, 53rd, New 6th, and part of the 13th Armies seemingly forming the main force, possessing considerable strength. Transportation in Jehol remains paralyzed, with 85 kilometers of the roadbed between Chengteh East and Pingchuan completely destroyed, making military access impossible within the month. Only 15 kilometers of damage exist between Pingchuan and Lingyuan, which can be repaired and reopened to traffic within days. The tunnel structures between Peiping and Chengteh have also been destroyed. Even if the Peiping-Chengteh land route is cleared and transportation restored, it will still take considerable time.

(Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, September 9th) According to reports from relevant agencies here, Fu Tso-yi's troops, moving east along the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway to aid Tatung, engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist forces yesterday outside Pingtichuan. Another report claims that another part of General Fu's troops has reached the vicinity of Fengchen, but this has not been confirmed. The situation in Tatung has indeed eased due to General Fu's actions, and the defending troops have telegraphed requesting continued replenishment of ammunition.

(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taiyuan, September 9th) On the night of the 8th, over two thousand Communist troops attacking Tatung continued their assault on the city walls, engaging in fierce fighting until the morning of the 9th, but were repelled each time. Furthermore, the National Army recovered Yicheng at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 4th.

(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taiyuan, September 8th) On the nights of the 5th and 6th, Communist troops south of Tatung City continued their attacks on the South Gate and Wayaocun. Communist troops north of the city attacked Tsaoyangcheng twice on the 5th, using intense artillery fire and attempting to climb the city walls with scaling ladders, but were repelled each time. The "Victory Regiment," "Iron Regiment," and "Rectification Regiment" of the 358th Brigade under Ho Lung's command suffered heavy casualties and morale is low. The National Army, reinforcing Tatung from Suiyuan, after recovering Tsocishan on the 8th, is pressing near Jining, Wulishuting, Yehyehcheng, Tianchiachen, and other places, continuing its southward advance.

(Reuter's Dispatch, Nanking, September 9th) It is learned that Changkiakow holds daily air raid drills, and the "join the army" movement is proceeding enthusiastically. The city is preparing for a defensive battle, and factory workers have been evacuated. Families of Communist officers have been moved to the northern suburbs. Military figures in Peiping claim that the fate of Changyuan can be decided within ten days, as the National Army is relentlessly advancing towards Changyuan from both the east and west.

(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taiyuan, September 9th) Communist troops in the suburbs of Tatung shelled Wayaocun southwest of the city and the city proper on the night of the 7th, continuously until dawn on the 8th, when it gradually subsided. That night, they again shelled Wayaocun and Tsaoyangcheng north of the city, while a portion harassed the southeast gate, but were repelled. It is also reported that the Communist troops have recently transferred two regiments from Ningwu and Shuo County north to besiege Tatung.

### Communist Troops Release Large Amounts of Poison Gas; Groups in Shansi Request Military Mediation Department to Intervene

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) The Communist troops besieging Tatung have launched 27 attacks, all of which have failed. On the 2nd and 3rd of this month, under intense artillery fire from Chahar, they released large amounts of poison gas, causing heavy casualties among the defending troops. The Shansi Provincial Federation of Commerce and various civic groups have jointly telegraphed the Military Mediation Department, requesting them to find ways to stop it.

(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taiyuan, September 9th) This office has just received confirmation of the use of poison gas by Communist troops attacking Tatung: (1) During the battle of the North and South Yueh Temples on the 1st of this month, Communist troops released large amounts of poison gas, resulting in the sacrifice of over a hundred National Army soldiers, including Battalion Commander Li. (2) On the evening of the 2nd, Communist troops used poisonous gas shells to cover their attacks on the Tatung Railway Station, airfield, and National Army positions along the Railway Station-Airfield section. Governor Yen is currently investigating the casualties among officers and soldiers due to poisoning and will submit a request to the Central Government for generous compensation.

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) Today's evening papers here carried a dispatch from Shenyang stating: Communist commander Lin Piao convened the Northeast "Democratic Allied Army Supreme Military Conference" in Tsitsihar. After the meeting, he issued a so-called "defensive" full-scale counter-offensive order. When reporters inquired about this with the spokesman for the Communist Party delegation in Nanking this evening, he replied that he was currently unaware. However, this news is a sufficient indication that the Communist troops in the Northeast will launch a fierce offensive.

### Focus of Northern Kiangsu Battlefield Shifts North; Communist Offensives in Outer Areas of the Eastern Front Ease; National Army in Honan and Shantung Prods Close to Hotze

(Special Dispatch from Our Chenkiang Office, September 9th) According to official sources, the focus of the Northern Kiangsu battlefield has now shifted to the vicinity of Hsuchow and the eastern section of the Lunghai Railway. After recovering Tsaohsien, the National Army established close contact with National Army troops stationed in Kaocheng, Lanhfeng, and Minchuan. Continuing their northward advance, a fierce battle is expected at Hotze, the capital of the Communist-controlled areas of Southern Shantung, Northern Kiangsu, Southern Anhwei and Eastern Honan.

(Special Dispatch from Our Taichow Office, September 9th) On the Eastern Front, the fighting has been quiet on the eve of this Mid-Autumn Festival. The Communist offensive at Taszchuang has been contained by our troops and has eased slightly. County Magistrate Ting of Taichow went to the area this morning to inspect.

### Communist Troops in Jukao Introduce New Tactics; Advocating Terrain Alteration Movement

Communist Troops Harass Bailung Temple in Nantung Again (Special Dispatch from Nantung on the 8th) To prevent the National Army from advancing and carrying out restoration work, the Communist troops are now mobilizing militiamen to launch a terrain alteration movement, damming large rivers to create passages, or digging up main roads to form ponds or small rivers. Villages, schools, temples, or larger residences that could serve as road markers are being demolished. The intention is to make those who were once familiar with the roads unable to recognize them today. This movement has been widely launched in areas such as Tungchueh Port and Matang.

(Another Dispatch) Around midnight last night in this city, the lights suddenly went out. Upon investigation, it was discovered that several hundred troops from the Chiang Nien-tseng unit of the Communist forces had harassed Bailung Temple near Tangcha, cutting down four electric wire poles.

(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Peiping, September 9th) Chu Chan-kuei, the Communist Vice Commander of the 14th Sub-district stationed in Eastern Hopei (formerly Commander of the 10th Military Sub-district), defected because he saw the Communist forces destroying peace.

### Admiral Cooke's Remarks in Peiping; US Troops Will Not Withdraw Temporarily; Anping Incident Can Reach a Reasonable Resolution

(Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, September 9th) Admiral Cooke, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, hosted reporters at the Peking Hotel on the morning of the 9th, accompanied by Major General Lockard. Cooke first stated that he did not say that the United States would change its attitude towards the Chinese civil war based on changes in the Chinese civil war. He said: In Tsingtao, someone asked whether the US troops stationed in China would participate in the Chinese civil war. He replied that they had transported many things to supply the Military Mediation Department and the US troops, but he did not believe that anyone accused these materials of having any purpose other than peace. The Anping incident has an investigation team. The US side reported that they were attacked while transporting supplies, but the other side claimed that the US side fired first, and pointed out that these materials were transported to help China fight a civil war. However, we firmly believe that this incident will have a reasonable resolution and will not affect the work of the Military Mediation Department. In answering reporters' questions, he said: The mission of the US troops in China is mostly completed. In the future, they will help China train its army and handle the transfer of materials. The US troops in Shanghai will be transferred to Tsingtao. One reporter asked about the duration and purpose of the US military presence in China. Cooke said: In order to protect the interests of American merchants in China, it is temporarily necessary to stay. When the situation in China improves, they will be withdrawn immediately. Finally, one reporter asked how much the US maintaining the transportation route from Chinwangtao to Tsingtao had to do with supplying the Military Mediation Department. Cooke said: In addition to supplying the Military Mediation Department with materials, there are of course other purposes. Cooke will fly to Tsingtao on the 10th, and his flagship is waiting in Tsingtao.

(United Press Dispatch, Peiping, September 9th) Admiral Cooke said: Regarding the Anping incident, if the Military Mediation Department's ruling is in favor of the Communist side, then the supply of materials to the Military Mediation Department may be cut off in the future.

(United Press Dispatch, Peiping, September 9th) Major General Lockard, Commander of the US Marine Corps in China, announced today that his successor, Major General Howard, will arrive in Tsingtao tomorrow, and he himself will return to the United States within ten days.

(United Press Dispatch, Peiping, September 9th) Brigadier General Beall Smith, Chief of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department, has been ill for more than two months recently, but has now fully recovered and will travel with his wife on a Navy transport ship on the 25th of this month.

### Cheng Chien Returns to Hankow and Writes Poems with Emotion

(Special Dispatch from Our Hankow Office, September 9th) Since returning to Hankow from Kuling, Director Cheng Chien has been feeling emotional about current affairs for days, writing three poems. One of them, written on the boat, is quite well-structured. The original text reads: "The boat flows smoothly eastward, the fires burn fiercely in the south, the owls and flutes fly north, the beasts retreat west in pretense, the fields of Lai have new grass, the burdens of levies have not ceased for the people, I sadly remember the numerous hoofprints, and am saddened to see wounds everywhere. I take on the difficult heart of relief, and hope to ease the original desire. I rely on the wisdom of the people to hold back the dangers, I hear of good advice and thinkers, I, personally, hope to hold back difficulties and hoarding, observe customs in Lang County, not fearing the heat of summer, nor the autumn sun, the cool breeze relieves the heat, and timely rain eases the drought, I lift my head to look at Mount Lu, and my worries are scattered with the wind."

### Political Negotiations at a Standstill; Five Representatives in Nanking Had No Activities Yesterday; Special Envoy Marshall Spends the Mid-Autumn Festival in Kuling

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) Political negotiations are at a standstill. The five representatives of the informal five-person group had no activities in Nanking. Ambassador Stuart went to the embassy on the 9th to work, reportedly the first time he has been to the embassy to handle official business since taking office. Chou En-lai went to Lingku Temple for an outing on the 8th and did not go out all day on the 9th, waiting for instructions from Yenan. Government representatives Wu Tieh-cheng and Chang Li-sheng also worked as usual. Special Envoy Marshall was originally scheduled to return to Nanking on the 9th, but it is reported that he postponed his return for two days because the Chairman invited him to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival in Kuling. It is also learned that Special Envoy Marshall's delayed return to Nanking was not only due to the Chairman's invitation, but also possibly because the negotiations in Kuling had made no progress, so there was no need to rush back to Nanking.

(United Press Dispatch, Nanking, September 9th) Communist spokesman Wang Ping-nan issued a warning last night, stating: If the five-person committee unfortunately "dies prematurely," it means that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have broken up and the American mediation has finally failed. He said: The committee can only convene if the government issues a ceasefire order. He also said: If the committee does not convene, it will inevitably lead to the final split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. As of now, the government has not expressed any intention to guarantee the issuance of a ceasefire order.

(United Press Dispatch, Nanking, September 9th) According to political observers here: The government's successive military victories in the past two months have made the Communist position even more unfavorable. As a last resort, it seems to have adopted a last resort, and if the government does not agree to an unconditional ceasefire, it will threaten to form another government and convene another National Assembly. The most significant development in the current political situation is the change in the military situation.

### Central Committee Meeting

Unlikely to be Held in the Short Term

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) A plenary session of the Central Committee is unlikely to be convened in the short term.

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) The regular meeting of the Central Standing Committee this week will reportedly discuss the restoration of the Central Party Headquarters and its affiliated agencies, and Commissioners Chen Kuo-fu, Hsiao Tung-tzu, and Pai Yun-ti will report on the progress of the handling.

### Chairman Plans to Inspect Nanchang; All Sectors in Kiangsi Province Are Preparing to Welcome Him; Chairman and Mrs. Chiang Invite Marshall et al. to Tour Hanhopow

(Special Dispatch from Our Kuling Office, September 9th) The citizens of Nanchang are overjoyed to learn that Chairman Chiang plans to come to the province for an inspection after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all sectors in the provincial capital have organized a preparatory meeting to welcome Chairman Chiang. Wang Ling-chi, Chen Chao-ying, Chan Jung-chien, Wang Chen-hsin, Wang Yu-lan, and others serve on the presidium of the meeting. The city appearance of this birthplace of the New Life Movement will be extremely clean in the coming days, and the social order will show a fresher and more solemn atmosphere than other provincial capitals. Our reporter stationed in Kuling is scheduled to accompany the Kuling reporters group to visit Nanchang on the 10th.

(Special Dispatch from Our Kuling Office, September 9th) Chairman and Mrs. Chiang invited Mr. and Mrs. Marshall, Generals Gillen, McClure, Rooks, and Morehead to Hanhopow at 6:00 PM on the 9th to view the moon and have a picnic on the spot. It is rumored that General Gillen and others are scheduled to return to Nanking on the 10th.

(Special Dispatch from Our Kuling Office, September 9th) It is learned that Mr. and Mrs. Marshall will return to Nanking after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

(Special Dispatch from Our Kuling Office, September 9th) The 13th of this month is the best day to watch the tides. It is rumored that a large number of foreign dignitaries will go to the banks of Hai Ning Jiang to watch the tides at that time.

### Foreign Minister Wang Departs for Home; Discusses the Issue of Japanese Reparations in Paris; We Will Not Make Excessive Demands

(Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Paris, September 9th) Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh is scheduled to return to Nanking via London on September 10th. During his absence, the position of our country's chief representative will be assumed by Mr. Kuo Tai-chi.

(United Press Dispatch, New York, September 9th) The New York Times today published an interview with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh in Paris, stating: China does not intend to make reparations demands on Japan that Japan cannot afford, or to adopt retaliatory policies against Japan. Foreign Minister Wang will leave France for Nanking on Tuesday. He predicted that five peace treaties will be concluded in Paris, but insisted that this does not necessarily guarantee that the five powers can reach an agreement on the issues of Japan and Germany. He said: The Japanese issue "should be simpler than the German issue, because Japan itself has no disarmament to speak of, and at the same time, the United States and China, which should receive the largest amount of compensation, will not make excessive demands. The war losses suffered by major Chinese cities have been severe, but so far there is still no number for compensation. At the same time, we are currently studying how to dismantle Japan's industrial equipment to prevent Japan from rearming. The only important issue facing the Far Eastern powers is the issue of control after the conclusion of the peace treaty. The United States' proposal to lift Japan's military equipment for 25 years should be accepted by China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. Since the Soviet Union has not occupied Japan, it should be simpler for it to accept this Far Eastern treaty than to accept the German treaty. In addition, the Korean issue is of course a difficult issue."

### American Government Association for China; Exposes the Communist Conspiracy; Points Out That the Current Negotiations Are Deceptive; Sends Letter to the President Requesting Support for the National Government

(United Press Dispatch, Washington, August 8th) Several Americans who formerly resided in China today sent a letter to President Truman, calling the Communist Party "treacherous rebels" and urging full and unconditional support for the legal government led by Chairman Chiang. The American Policy Association for China, including Representative Judd, a member of the association's board of directors, and the wife of the publisher of "Time" and "Life" magazines, Luce, also requested the Soviet Union to return Chinese territory that it should not control to the Chinese government in accordance with the Yalta Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The letter was accompanied by a translation of Notice No. 16 of the Central Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, which pointed out that the negotiations between the Chinese Communist Party and General Marshall "are deceptive in nature and have no intention of reaching an agreement. The purpose is only to buy time" to consolidate the strength of the Chinese Communist Party in order to occupy the whole of China. The association believes that this document is sufficient to show that the Soviet Union still controls the Chinese Communist Party, and that the Far Eastern Bureau of the Third International, which was nominally dissolved in 1943, still exists in fact, and that the actions and policies of the Chinese Communist Party are still subject to the control of the Third International. The letter also requested the reorganization of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, and that key positions in the Division should be filled by individuals who fully agree with the above-mentioned American policy.

(United Press Dispatch, New York, August 8th) The American Policy Association for China today released what it called evidence that the Chinese Communist Party is controlled by Moscow and has no intention of reaching an agreement with Chairman Chiang. It is claimed that the CCP intends to use peace talks to delay, so as to take the opportunity to consolidate its territory, obtain military equipment from the Soviet Union, train troops in the Northeast, some of whom are Japanese, Koreans, and puppet troops, infiltrate the territory controlled by the Kuomintang, and try to alienate the United States' sympathy and assistance for Chairman Chiang. This conclusion is said to be based on Document No. 16 of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP, which was decided on March 12 and has now been translated into English. Signed by the Association's Secretary-General, Loomis, a copy was sent to President Truman. The president of the association is Powell, publisher of the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai. According to the talk, the association currently has more than 100 members. Loomis did not explain how the association learned of Document No. 16 of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP. He only said that the person who provided this evidence was extremely reliable. Judging from the wording of the document, it can be known that it is controlled by Moscow. The document has pointed out that the plan it proposed has been agreed by the Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist Party. It is claimed that the Bureau is an organization under the Communist International, which was dissolved in 1943. The document mentioned the strategy of negotiating on one hand and continuing to fight on the other, and said; The Northeast is the best area to launch a local offensive, because it is "close to our great ally, the Soviet Union, and we will not have problems obtaining supplies in that area." In addition, the CCP representatives negotiating peace were advised to use revolutionary tactics to alienate the relationship between the United States and Chairman Chiang. It also stated: "At the same time, we should adopt a delaying policy, and not resolve any issues when negotiating with the Kuomintang, in order to shake people's confidence and make the Kuomintang's political position unstable." The Policy Association for China urged President Truman to demand that political control over the Chinese people be abandoned.

### Mechanized Units

Will Be Equipped with Thirty Divisions

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) Our country will train and equip 30 of the most modern mechanized divisions. In the first phase, 12 divisions will be trained.

They will be elected at the ninth session tomorrow, and the session will be closed the day after tomorrow. Chairman Chiang will personally attend to give instructions at that time. If not necessary, the meeting will not be postponed.

### Adjustment of Tariff Rates Must Go Through Legal Procedures

Implementation Period Will Be Several Months Later

(Special Dispatch from Our Nanking Office, September 9th) Consultant Chou of the Ministry of Finance said that the adjustment of tariffs is under the jurisdiction of the Customs Administration. The tax rate will be formulated by the Customs Administration according to the actual situation of all parties, and then the Department of Finance will sign and comment on it, and then the Minister will make a decision. Before implementation, it must be passed by the Executive Yuan meeting before it can be promulgated, so it will take at least a few months, and it cannot be decided hastily in a short period of time.

### Talk by British Ambassador in Shanghai: Seeking to Enhance Sino-British Friendship, Trade and Industry Delegation to Visit China This Month

[Central News Agency, London, 9th dispatch by United Press] Mr. Thornton, an official of the Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers' Union, stated today that he will accompany the British trade delegation to China within the week. The delegation consists of six businessmen representing the engineering, textile, and food industries, led by Mr. Bowes, Chairman of Grosvenor, Chater & Co.

[Our Correspondent] Sir Steven, the new British Ambassador to China, hosted a reception for reporters at the Cathay Hotel yesterday afternoon. The Ambassador, accompanied by Mr. MacDonald, the head of the Information Section of the British Embassy, appeared energetic and cheerful. After a brief introduction by Mr. MacDonald, the Ambassador delivered a speech, saying: "I am extremely pleased to be in Shanghai. Shanghai is not only the trade center of China but also the premier commercial port of the Far East. From what I have seen, I deeply feel that the past achievements are already numerous, and the future development is undoubtedly limitless. The United Kingdom has also assisted in the construction of this metropolis, and as a British national, I am proud of this. The United Kingdom is very willing to continue to do its best as a friend of China, and this effort will only serve to increase the mutual benefits of the two countries and will not contain any other purpose. My visit here is to enhance the friendship and mutual understanding between China and the United Kingdom, which I regard as my responsibility." When mentioning his impressions of Shanghai, the Ambassador said in a humorous tone: "Shanghai is full of vitality, life, spirit—and also full of noise." He continued: "This abundant vitality and spirit will undoubtedly be beneficial to the revival of China." The Ambassador then announced that the United Kingdom will send a delegation to China in the latter half of this month. The delegation will include many representatives from the British light and heavy industries and will be led by Mr. Boyce. They are expected to stay in China for about three months to investigate industry and commerce and strive to find better ways to develop Sino-British trade.

(The photo shows the Ambassador's expression when hosting the reception for reporters, taken by this newspaper.)

### Negotiations on Sino-British Commercial Treaty Have Not Officially Begun; Believes China Must Curb Internal Conflicts Itself

At this point, the reporters asked questions one after another, and the Ambassador answered them one by one. The main points are as follows: (1) Question: What is the situation of the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations? Answer: The negotiations have not officially begun, but several months ago, the British side submitted a full draft of the commercial treaty to the Chinese government. (2) Question: Do foreigners currently residing in China also need visas when traveling within the country? I wonder if the UK will take similar measures when signing the treaty, so that Chinese living in the UK also need visas when traveling in the UK? Answer: Foreigners in the United Kingdom do not need a visa to travel from London to Liverpool. If China wants to open up, it should provide some convenience to foreign guests visiting China. (3) Question: What is the situation of remittances from the UK to the Far East? Answer: Remittances are already available in Hong Kong, and it is planned to extend them to Shanghai soon. (4) Question: What is the progress of the previous rumor that the UK intends to lend China 50 million pounds? Answer: No progress has been made, because the UK is not very wealthy at the moment. (5) Question: Does the UK intend to participate in mediating the Chinese war? Answer: No, I am very impressed by the perseverance and efforts of General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. Marshall is the most ideal foreign person to mediate this matter. However, internal conflicts can only be curbed by the Chinese people themselves. Marshall and Stuart can only assist. (6) Question: Has the Chinese government mentioned any negotiations regarding Hong Kong? Answer: Never. (7) Question: Please tell us about the Ambassador's past experience. Answer: First in Bulgaria, then to Spain. I witnessed the tragedy of the civil war and was busy evacuating British citizens. In 1940, I traveled around the Mediterranean with Mr. Eden and Chief of the General Staff General Dill. At that time, the crisis of German invasion was imminent. This trip involved Egypt, Greece, Turkey, and other countries. Greece's determination to resist Germany was strengthened by this trip. Mr. Eden's negotiations with Yugoslavia were successful. I have also met with Marshal Tito. The Ambassador then said with a smile: "That's all there is to my life's work!" (8) Question: Are there any major problems between the two countries before the signing of the Sino-British commercial treaty? Answer: Even if there are problems, they are all domestic rather than international. The current situation of various British enterprises in China is not satisfactory. I am eager to improve this situation, but it is difficult to say whether I will succeed. Arriving in Beijing by ship on the 20th of this month [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Lieutenant General Power, the new commander of the British Pacific Fleet, Captain Pursley, commander of the British 19th Destroyer Squadron, the light cruiser HMS Belfast, and the destroyer HMS Trafalgar are scheduled to visit the capital on September 20 to formally pay respects to the government and pay their respects to President Chiang.

The driver was unharmed and immediately fled, fearing punishment. After receiving the news, Benniu Station immediately sent a vehicle to rescue the injured. The train was delayed by one hour as a result.

### Steel Rails Originally Intended for China Diverted to Southern Europe by UNRRA; US Senator Brewster Protests to State Department

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Republican Senator Brewster protested to the State Department today against UNRRA's decision to divert steel rails originally intended for China, worth US$45,000, to Yugoslavia. Mr. Brewster told reporters: "I have also asked UNRRA to explain this move. Ships are carrying the bodies of Americans shot down by Yugoslavia across the ocean back home, while other ships are carrying goods to Yugoslavia, as if nothing had happened." According to reports he received, Marshal Marvel managed to have the steel rails declared surplus property of the Army Corps of Engineers in March, after which UNRRA acquired them. When UNRRA took over the task of acquiring the steel rails, it obtained special priority from the War Assets Administration, with the understanding that the steel rails would be shipped to China and not elsewhere. At the same time, it began to freeze all available materials. However, by August 7, the plan had changed. Of the 10,789 tons of steel rails and accessories acquired by UNRRA, 8,215 tons were designated for shipment to Yugoslavia, with a value of US$337,348. At that time, there were still 2,538 tons of steel rails in the warehouse designated for shipment to China, with a value of US$112,661. Before long, an order was apparently issued to divert these 2,583 tons of steel rails to Yugoslavia as well. Subsequently, he heard that UNRRA had tried to find steel rails in the US surplus materials in Europe to supply to China, but had not achieved significant success. UNRRA Director La Guardia ordered a halt to the shipment of all materials to China except for essential food in July. However, Mr. Brewster said that he did not believe that the steel rails were diverted to Yugoslavia because of this suspension order, because he received reports that the person who ordered the diversion of the steel rails was the UNRRA Industrial Rehabilitation Division's representative in Yugoslavia. American sailors are currently on strike, so some of the steel rails may not have been shipped yet. If so, he hopes that the State Department or UNRRA will take action to prevent their shipment."

### Government Negotiating with US on Medium Landing Craft

[United States Information Service, Washington, 9th] According to a report by the US Navy Department, US Navy landing craft have solved the long-standing problem of Yangtze River navigation. The problem of Yangtze River navigation lies in the extremely rapid currents of the upper reaches of the river. The US medium landing craft No. 470, when fully loaded with materials, only draws eight feet of water. It has recently navigated the Hankou-Chongqing section twice with great success. As such, the Chinese government has negotiated with the US to purchase several surplus US medium landing craft to facilitate navigation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

### Jianghan Customs Commissioner Elaborates on Embezzlement; Claims Allegations by Investigation Team Are Based on Conjecture from Records

[Our Correspondent, Hankou, 9th] Mr. Chen Yingkun, the Commissioner of Jianghan Customs, recently issued a statement elaborating on the allegations of embezzlement made by the investigation team. He stated briefly that each time the customs office auctioned materials, it was reported to the Special Commissioner of the Executive Yuan. The allegations made by the investigation team were entirely based on conjecture from the numbers in the records and were not thoroughly investigated. The reason for selling by installments and gradually reducing prices was to comply with the regulations of the Executive Yuan to avoid manipulation and hoarding by those with strong capital.

### Layoffs in Telecommunications; Three Standards Proposed

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 9th] A responsible person from the Ministry of Communications said on the 9th that the standards for layoffs in telecommunications are: (1) Redundant personnel in administrative departments will be appropriately laid off; (2) Senior technical personnel who are encountering challenges to their physical strength will be paid retirement and pension funds; (3) Senior personnel with technical skills who are physically strong, will receive further training after their selection. Those who have served in the puppet regime will be laid off first. This standard is partly a personnel adjustment and cannot be called a layoff. In addition, in terms of performance in completion, it will be used to restore national communications. Existing communication personnel are still insufficient. It is unnecessary to cut personnel. Telecommunications colleagues should respect the government's orders. However, to prevent malpractices during future implementation, the National Telephone Workers' Union Preparatory Committee has launched local groups to assist and supervise the implementation of layoffs in the telecommunications industry and follow-up work in various places.

### Philippine Authorities Announce Reasons for Searching Overseas Chinese Newspaper Office; Military Police Headquarters Apologizes to New Min Times

[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th] The Philippine Presidential Palace announced today: The reason why the Philippine government searched an overseas Chinese newspaper office was because several people complained that some of the people who frequently visited the newspaper were related to illegal elements and a certain kidnapping gang. The kidnapping gang has traditionally targeted prominent figures among the overseas Chinese, so the arrest has nothing to do with the newspaper's editorial policy or newspaper policy.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th] The Chinese-language China Guide and China Commercial News, run by overseas Chinese here, were searched by the military police, and the Communist Party's mouthpiece, the China Guide, failed to publish today. Reporters have learned that the New Min Times was also searched, but the Philippine Military Police Headquarters apologized to the newspaper this morning. The Military Police Headquarters issued a statement this afternoon stating: "The Military Police Headquarters has quickly interrogated and reviewed the certificates and activities of the arrested foreign residents. They have all been released within the six-hour time limit, and there will be no more arrests today."

### Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Passes Important Resolutions; Sends Telegrams to US President and Mao Zedong; Elects Xu Shaodi to Fill Vacancy on People's Political Council

[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, 9th] Luo Xia, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Political Council, previously resigned due to participating in the election of the chairman of the Provincial Assembly, and her resignation was approved. The Executive Yuan limited the by-election to be held before September 10. The Provincial Assembly has now elected Mr. Xu Shaodi to fill the vacancy as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Political Council.

The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly continued its general meeting today, listened to the report from the Health Department, and passed two telegrams to Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong and US President Truman. The former appealed to the Communist Party to rein in at the brink of the precipice, sincerely implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, immediately stop the all-out offensive, and resolve all issues through peaceful methods. The latter stated that they were grateful to the United States for its spiritual and material assistance in achieving victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but opposed domestic division and separatism, and sincerely hoped that the United States would implement its past policies and continue to assist the National Government in building a democratic, unified, peaceful, and strong nation.

The General Assembly also discussed the issue of reducing land tax collection and adjusting tariffs, and resolved to elect two representatives to go to Beijing to make a plea, and to cooperate with representatives of fellow villagers in Shanghai to strive for a 40% reduction in land tax collection, the same as in Jiangsu Province.

### Yang Yanbin Confesses in Wuxi; Says He Has Always Kept to Himself and Never Became a Bandit in the Lake; Willing to Engage in Pacification Work Under the Leadership of the Government

[Our Correspondent, Wuxi] Yang Yanbin, the bandit leader in Taihu Lake who surrendered, arrived in Wuxi at 9:00 AM on the 7th with General Mao Sen, Director of the Second Division of the Capital Garrison Command. On the same day, he went to the city defense command, visited the commander, and Commander Chen. He also met with County Magistrate Xu at the county government, and the meeting was very pleasant. He expressed that he was willing to engage in pacification work under the leadership of the government to protect local security. According to him: "I have absolutely no knowledge of the Taihu Lake bandits attacking villagers in Southern Quanzhou and Wutangmen. Moreover, I have never been to Taihu Lake. The rumors that I and Wu Zilong are both bandits in Taihu Lake are completely untrue. In early December last year, after I attended the Third Front Army Security Conference in Wuxi, my troops were incorporated into the 71st Army on the 26th of that month. I was transferred to be a major general senior staff officer of the Third Front Army. Later, in order to fulfill my filial piety as a son, I went to Chongqing on January 1 this year to run around because my father Shou was detained in a case. I returned to Shanghai in early April, hiding in the suburbs and keeping to myself. In April of this year, a former district chief of Wujiang County told me: "The current situation is unstable. We have already organized ourselves in Taihu Lake. Please, boss, go to the countryside and enter the lake immediately." I strongly refused. Later, I lived in seclusion in the countryside of Xujiahui. Unexpectedly, my residence was discovered again, and I was persuaded to enter the lake, saying: "If you don't go, that's fine, but you must use the name Yang Yanbin as a banner." But I still firmly refused to go. After that, whenever those people took any action, they claimed to be subordinates of Yang Yanbin, which led to rumors outside, even saying that I had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Democratic Allied Army, which is not true. Now, I have been recruited by Ren Yuandao and can dedicate myself to the country. I reported to Commander Tang and expressed my heartfelt feelings, and General Yang has approved it. As for the bandits in Taihu Lake, there are two factions, old and new, with more than 8,000 people and well-equipped weapons. I have sent personnel into the lake to recruit the old troops, hoping to influence them with emotion and make them abandon evil and return to righteousness to serve the country."

[Our Correspondent, Suzhou, 9th] The families of all the traitors in custody in Jiangsu Province recently jointly telegraphed officials of various ministries and commissions of the central government, appealing for the inclusion of traitors in the amnesty to open a path to self-renewal and provide an opportunity for provincial development. The telegram traced the history of pacifying rebellions and governing the world, stating that the focus was on eliminating the ringleaders and not punishing those who were coerced. It also cited the amnesty decrees of 1932 and 1944, in which various criminals were pardoned. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has been won, we should even more enjoy high favor and start anew with the people.

Editorial

### Reform and Innovation in Shanghai Municipal Administration

The first Shanghai Municipal Council opened at Yiyuan yesterday. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the councilors will surely have enthusiastic discussions on various aspects of the municipal facilities that should be promoted and reformed. At the same time, the measures for regulating traffic in the central district announced by the municipal authorities were also declared effective yesterday; it is expected that the traffic congestion in the central urban area will be greatly improved thereafter. At this juncture, it would not be unhelpful for us to conduct a review of Shanghai's municipal administration.

First of all, we must point out that although Shanghai's municipal administration in the past year since the victory has not been able to fully meet the ideals of the citizens of Shanghai, the municipal authorities have indeed been working hard in the past year. Many of the current problems in Shanghai are, in essence, not entirely problems of Shanghai alone, but are inextricably linked to the overall national situation. Economic problems, caused by the fluctuations in the value of the legal tender, are not something that the municipal authorities can completely and satisfactorily solve unilaterally. The same is true of problems such as transportation. The solution to these problems lies in the whole rather than the part. As long as there is a comprehensive solution, the problems of a single city or a single point will not be difficult to solve. Therefore, we cannot expect the municipal authorities to completely solve the many problems that have arisen in Shanghai. Only within the scope of purely municipal affairs is this the responsibility of the municipal authorities. Since Mayor Wu took office, his efforts and achievements in this regard in the short period of a few months should be worthy of our praise. However, Shanghai has been occupied for eight years, and the situation has changed significantly since this restoration. The concessions, as symbols of semi-colonialism, have now been eliminated due to our eight years of hard struggle. Today's Shanghai has a completely unified municipal administration. From now on, the rise and fall of Shanghai's municipal administration will not only affect the welfare of the citizens, but also the international perception, which is sufficient to affect our country's international status. Therefore, our concern for Shanghai's municipal administration is naturally particularly keen.

At the beginning of Shanghai's recovery, due to the special circumstances, the municipal institutions and organizations were often adapted to the times and circumstances, and could not fully comply with the central government's regulations. Since Mayor Wu took office, he has been committed to rectifying this aspect; the abolition of the deputy mayor and the merger of the General Affairs Office are all aimed at ensuring that Shanghai's municipal institutions can comply with the central government's regulations. However, as of now, Shanghai's municipal institutions still do not seem to fully comply with the central government's legal standards. Those that cannot be retained due to special circumstances should be passed by the Municipal Council, requesting the central government to change the legal provisions to make them more flexible, so that each city can have room for flexibility due to different local circumstances. Otherwise, the municipal government should quickly change its current internal organization, so that the central government's laws do not become mere formalities. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, we should build the country with the rule of law, and we must not stand outside the law again.

Speaking of the current Shanghai municipal administration, the most shameful thing for Shanghai is the congestion and disorder of traffic. Now that the measures for regulating traffic in the central district are being implemented, according to our observations, this method of regulating traffic in the city still does not touch the heart of the problem. What is the heart of the problem? This is because Shanghai has a large area and a large population, but the number of public vehicles is too small, so all kinds of vehicles are squeezed together on narrow roads. The vehicles of the former British-owned China General Omnibus Company have now disappeared in Shanghai; the routes of trolley buses have been reduced a lot; and the number of trams has also been reduced a lot. In order to solve the problem of "travel," citizens have pedicabs, rickshaws, carriages, "tiger cars," and jeeps. As long as the number of public vehicles is increased as much as possible, the number of other vehicles will decrease. The Founding Father added the word "travel" in addition to food, clothing, and shelter, but "travel" is the most problematic thing in today's Shanghai. Shanghai originally had a fairly convenient public transportation system, but at that time, the municipal administration was not unified. Now that the municipal administration has been unified, it should focus on the entire Shanghai, planning and establishing a sound public transportation system. Regarding traffic, we hope that the municipal authorities can do more positive work and less passive banning.

As for other matters that should be promoted and reformed in municipal administration, there are many, and we do not need to list them one by one. The municipal councilors come from the people and are deeply aware of the hardships of the people's livelihood. They must have long had plans for the various aspects of municipal administration that should be promoted and reformed. At this meeting, it is said that there are more than 300 proposals, which shows that there are quite a few measures that should be taken in the municipal administration. What we want to emphasize is that Shanghai is an international city, and any measures must not only not violate the spirit of our founding, but also take into account internationality, so that Shanghai's position can continue to develop and can set an example of local autonomy for our Three Principles of the People to build the country.

### Will the Five-Person Committee Be Stillborn?

Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan warned yesterday that if the five-person group were indeed stillborn, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would eventually break up, and the United States' mediation in China would ultimately fail. This is a report from the United Press Nanjing telegram.

Due to Wang Bingnan's warning, we, who had originally placed some expectations on this five-person group, could not help but feel the fear that the five-person meeting would be stillborn.

As far as we know, the focus of the KMT-CPC dispute originally lay in military issues, namely, the reorganization and unification of the army, the withdrawal of the Communist army from certain areas, and the implementation of a ceasefire between the two sides. The government's intention was to implement these matters first, and then discuss political issues and implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, the Communist Party firmly opposed this. Therefore, Ambassador Stuart suggested to Marshal Ma, and with the consent of the Communist Party representatives, to change the steps and first discuss the reorganization of the National Government, believing that as long as the National Government could be reorganized to accommodate the participation of the Communist Party and other parties, then all subsequent disputes could be discussed and decided in this supreme National Government Committee. The mediator's ability can be said to have been exhausted, and China's peaceful unification would have bright hopes. Ambassador Stuart previously went to Lushan six times to make sincere suggestions to President Chiang for this matter; he finally obtained President Chiang's consent, and then happily went down the mountain to make arrangements and negotiations. Ambassador Stuart was naturally particularly happy and increased his optimism. Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng also went to Gu to ask for instructions, and returned to Nanjing to prepare for discussions. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, there is another village with bright willows and blooming flowers;" our ordinary people have even greater expectations.

Unexpectedly, Zhou Enlai first had to say to people that this was just an "attempt," and later insisted on first discussing the preconditions, which are the platitudes of unconditional ceasefire that are contrary to actual actions. As soon as we heard this kind of platitude, we felt that the future was not good. Now Wang Bingnan has indeed shouted again, warning that if it is stillborn, there will be a breakup, and mediation will fail. To be honest, the Communist Party probably had no sincerity in negotiating success from the beginning!

The Communist Party originally thought that the government would not be willing to discuss the issue of the reorganization of the National Government first, so it suggested to Ambassador Stuart to discuss this issue first to stump the government and make the government bear the responsibility for not being able to negotiate peacefully. When the government expressed its willingness to negotiate, it had no other ideas and returned to the old path of preconditions. They kept going around in circles, just not wanting the KMT-CPC dispute to have a day of resolution, just not wanting the Chinese political situation to have a day of peaceful unification, and even more not wanting the internal disputes in China to be compromised and pacified due to the mediation of the United States.

Wang Bingnan's words made the Communist Party's intentions, like Sima Zhao's heart, known to everyone. Their only hope is: that the United States' mediation in China will ultimately fail. They can have three kinds of fluke ideas because the United States' mediation has failed: (1) that the United States will be moved by anger, withdraw from China, and no longer care about the affairs of the Far East; (2) that the Communist Party can let go and fight the National Government, fighting for a divided China; (3) that in this Chinese mainland that has become a "vacuum" due to the withdrawal of the United States, it may be filled by the forces of the Soviet Union.

We have long understood the Communist Party's desire for the five-person meeting to be stillborn, but the peace elder Marshal Stuart still does not quite believe it. In fact, American friends who are more familiar with the situation in China and the true face of the Communist Party, such as Mr. Powell of the American Policy Association, Mrs. Luce, and Senator Trued, have also spoken out more than once. Recently, they revealed the conspiracy of the Communist Party based on the CCP Central Committee Political Bureau Document No. 16 of March 12, which is even more concrete. We want to ask people at home and abroad to pay attention: if the five-person meeting is stillborn, it is the Communist Party that deliberately made it stillborn, and the responsibility for the Chinese situation not being peaceful should also be borne by the Communist Party.

### Six Foreign Ministers' Late-Night Consultation Results in One-Month Postponement of UN General Assembly; Final Vote by Fifty-One Nations

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: Yesterday's foreign ministers' meeting lasted five hours, adjourning only at 1:00 AM this morning. At that time, it was decided that the question of whether to postpone the United Nations General Assembly, scheduled for September 23, to October 23, should be voted on by the United Nations' fifty-one member states. It is understood that the voting method was strongly advocated by Mr. Wang Shijie. Furthermore, after receiving official notification from Paris, UN Secretary-General Lie is expected to solicit the opinions of various member states today.

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: British representative Alexander recently received a reply telegram from Foreign Secretary Bevin, expressing his support for the proposal by China, the Soviet Union, France, and Belgium to postpone the United Nations session to October 23. This reply has been immediately forwarded to UN General Assembly President Spaak.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] Last night, the six foreign ministers held a meeting in the study of French President Bidault. The attendees included British representative Alexander, Minister of the Navy, Vice Minister MacNeill, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Vice Minister Vyshinsky, US Secretary of State Byrnes, Senators Vandenberg and Connally, French President and Foreign Minister Bidault, Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jing Weir, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and Belgian Foreign Minister and UN General Assembly President Spaak. The governments of China, the Soviet Union, France, and Belgium formally proposed that the next session of the United Nations General Assembly be postponed to October 23 of this year (originally scheduled for the 23rd of this month). The meeting decided that Spaak should immediately notify UN Secretary-General Lie of the decision to postpone the meeting via long-distance telephone to the United Nations Secretariat in Lake Success, New York, and authorized Spaak to contact the representatives of various countries. Yesterday's meeting adjourned late at 1:00 AM, with the representatives of various countries frequently requesting instructions from their governments by telephone, causing the meeting to be interrupted from time to time.

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] Well-informed sources here said that the four foreign ministers decided to submit the peace treaties currently being drafted with the former enemy states at the Council of Foreign Ministers to the United Nations General Assembly and begin drafting peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Official sources said that the United States has issued a statement declaring that it does not object to the foreign ministers' resolution. The British side temporarily created the demand for postponing the General Assembly but did not take final action, awaiting instructions from British Foreign Secretary Bevin, who has returned to London to attend the Palestine conference. The telegram from the foreign ministers' meeting to UN Secretary-General Lie has been sent to Lie's headquarters on the shores of Lake Success, New York State. It is noted that China, the Soviet Union, France, and Belgium are crowded with this move.

[Associated Press, Munich, 8th] After a two-day vacation in Bavaria, Byrnes flew to Paris this afternoon to continue participating in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Byrnes' advisors said that Byrnes believes that the issue of postponement should be decided by a majority vote of the representatives of the fifty-one countries, and should not be decided unilaterally by the four powers.

### Soviet Union Agrees to Discuss German Issues; Officials from Four Occupation Zones to Confer on Unified Economy

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: The Soviet Union today agreed to hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the future of Germany. The plan for a central German government proposed by Byrnes in his speech in Stuttgart last Friday will be one of the main topics of discussion.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th, Associated Press] Today, the American military administrative officer in Germany, McNaney, requested that in addition to economic unification, the four German occupation zones must also be accused of political unification. His statement is included in his July administrative report.

[Agence France-Presse, Stuttgart, Germany, 8th] According to well-informed sources here, the German political leaders in the British, American, French, and Soviet occupation zones will hold a meeting in Kissingen in the American occupation zone to discuss the issue of economic unification proposed by US Secretary of State Byrnes, but it is still unknown whether the German officials in the French and Soviet occupation zones will accept the invitation.

### Four Powers Hold Secret Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Italian-Southern Boundary Issues; Numerous Difficulties in Peace Conference Remain to Be Solved

[This newspaper's dispatch] Paris, 9th: Today, the four powers held a secret meeting to discuss the Italian-Southern border issue. If the four powers can reach an agreement, it is expected that the political and territorial committees on Italy will be able to accept it. It is generally speculated that the four powers will finally agree to the boundary line proposed by France.

[Associated Press, Paris, 8th] As the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference enters its seventh week, international animosity has reached its peak. Decisions on the Trieste port and the Italian-Southern border still require some debate. Bulgaria's demands for western Thrace in Greece have also become more serious. These two major Balkan border issues have caused conflicts between the Slavic bloc led by the Soviet Union and Western countries in the political and territorial committees of the Italian-Bulgarian peace treaty. The two committees will continue to meet on Monday. In addition, the border dispute between Hungary and Czechoslovakia regarding the border near the confluence of the Hungarian Slavkaga and the Austrian Danube River has also been added to the agenda of the peace conference at the beginning of the week, and Hungary's appeal to prevent Romania from expelling 200,000 Hungarians is also enough to cause fierce debate.

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] Outsiders have already called the Paris Committee merely a "rubber stamp." In fact, it is difficult to make significant modifications in the committee to the various articles that the four powers have already reached an agreement on, because the majority required to modify a certain proposal is not enough to defeat the united front of the four powers. Of the twenty-six points on which the four powers have not agreed, the most difficult one, such as the Trieste port issue, remains unresolved. In terms of quantity, the Finnish Political Committee has been the most successful.

### Austrian Nationalization Act Takes Effect

[Reuters, Vienna, 8th] The Austrian Nationalization Act will take effect tomorrow. The United Kingdom and the United States have requested the Austrian government to postpone the nationalization of factories previously owned by the United Kingdom and the United States in Austria until the compensation issue is resolved. The United Kingdom believes that although Austria has the right to nationalize, the compensation should be reasonable. The Soviet Union previously protested that the Austrian Nationalization Act affected Austrian factories that had been taken over by the Soviet Union, but now it has also allowed the act to be implemented in the Soviet military zone.

### Southern Army Obstructs Traffic; Allied Nations Lodge Protest

### US Renews Broadcasting Law Using Radar Principle; Hundreds of Programs Can Be Broadcast Simultaneously

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 8th] The United States has newly invented wireless broadcasting technology, adopting the "radar" principle of radio wave emission, using the cycle wave to emit a series of radio wave vibrations, replacing the continuous radio waves that are currently used for radio or television broadcasting. This new design allows the same radio station to broadcast as many as one hundred programs at the same time, using cycles as high as nine hundred and thirty large cycles. The only drawback is that the broadcasting range is currently limited to sixty kilometers.

### Palestine Conference to Be Held in London Today; Jewish Groups Express Conditional Participation; Sabotage Cases Occur Throughout Palestine

[Reuters, London, 9th] The London conference to discuss the Palestine issue is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Lancaster House. The British authorities are making final efforts to get representatives from both the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine to participate, but in any case, the first meeting will only have representatives from the British government and various Arab governments in attendance. A British colonial department spokesperson confirmed this morning that the British government has not yet received a reply telegram from Jewish representatives outside the Jewish Agency in the suburbs, promising to participate in the London conference. Representatives of various Jewish groups in London will design this matter tonight. Arab people in London are waiting for the decision of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee on whether to send observers to attend. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Colonial Secretary Hall met with Prime Minister Attlee today, and both will attend the meeting tomorrow.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] Jewish sources here announced today that if British Foreign Secretary Bevin can attend the representatives of Arab countries at the London conference and consider establishing a Jewish state in Palestine (but not necessarily immediately), then the Jewish Agency can reconsider refusing to participate in the negotiations.

[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 9th] The Palestinian government announced today that saboteurs carried out acts of violence in the dark, using mines and bombs to sever thirty or forty railway lines. The launch of the violence clearly coincides with the start of talks between the British and Arabs in London. In the early morning, some laborers were riding in a car to repair it and triggered a landmine, injuring several people.

### US Government Approves Expanding Trusteeship System to Liberate People Worldwide

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] Mr. Griggs, Director of the Trusteeship Department of the US Department of State, recently delivered a radio address announcing that the United States approves of expanding the scope of the United Nations trusteeship system to cover the entire world. He also said that the world's colonial people, totaling 300 million, of whom 40 million will be liberated by the United Nations trusteeship system in the next few years. As for the territories not included in the trusteeship, advisory committees will also be established in various regions. The United States has decided, in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, to take bases needed for security in various territories around the world. With the efforts of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand, the people who have not been accused of autonomy will be liberated. Therefore, we cannot be pessimistic about the trusteeship issue, because the Caribbean Sea Committee organized by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Tea is enough to constitute a major step in solving this problem. The four countries will also agree to cooperate in an attempt to solve all health, education, and agricultural problems in various territories. From the decision taken by the United States towards the Philippines, we can see that the US government is very willing to assist other territories in gaining independence and promoting the liberation of all people in the world.

### Nehru to Send Invitations to Convene Pan-Asian Conference; Gandhi Calls on People to Unite; Indian Congress Party Opposes Governor-General Presiding Over Constitution-Making

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] It is learned that Nehru, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of India, will soon send invitations inviting all Asian countries to come to India before 1947 to participate in the Pan-Asian Conference, which will be chaired by Nehru himself. In addition to the leaders and representatives of Asian countries, the leaders of national movements in various countries under foreign rule, especially President Ho Chi Minh of the Vietnam government and President Sukarno of Indonesia, will also be invited to participate. At that time, the Pan-Asian Conference will study the relations between Asian countries, especially on economic, defense, and cultural issues.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] According to the BBC, Indian Mahatma Gandhi yesterday called on the people of the country to unite, saying that India needs peace. It is wrong for Muslims to achieve their goals by iron and blood, because the doctrine of Islam lies in peace, not war.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] According to reliable sources, the Indian Constituent Assembly will be held in October. Because the Democratic Party will firmly oppose the convening of the Constituent Assembly by Governor-General Wavell, the Governor-General represents the highest authority in the United Kingdom and cannot participate in the work of the Constituent Assembly, because this is an accident for the entire country. The National Congress Party intends to write to the Governor-General stating its reasons, firmly advocating that the convening of the Constituent Assembly should be led by the leader of the association. In addition, the government also issued a communiqué stating that the Indian government should be called the cabinet from now on. In the past, it was called the Governor-General's Administrative Department, which is enough to cause external criticism, especially the Muslim League, which even called Nehru and his colleagues "British officials."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] The Birmingham Indian Association convened a meeting of more than 400 representatives of overseas Indians from all over the United Kingdom, expressing their support for the policies adopted by the Indian National Congress Party.

Muslim League Plans to Take Direct Action

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 8th] The Muslim League Pan-Indian Action Committee is holding a meeting here. A committee member recently told reporters that the purpose of this meeting is to make the Muslim League adopt a wartime establishment. Muslim leader Jinnah will deliver a speech at the meeting this morning, saying that the actual work of the Muslim League is to promote Pakistan (that is, the separation of India and the Muslims) and overthrow the British trusteeship system and the Hindu class. The committee immediately studied the plan to take "direct action" and the consequences of this "direct action" in various provinces of India. The Muslim League also intends to promote the "people's disobedience to orders" movement in accordance with the movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. The parliament is also discussing the supplement of volunteers, planning to reorganize it into a quasi-military organization, so as to prepare to sacrifice for the Muslim mission. In addition, the Governor of India met with Khan, Secretary-General of the Muslim League, today, and warned the Muslim League that the influence of "direct action" may spread throughout the country. People are anxious about the actions that the Muslim League may take.

Some Suggest Seeking Help from Soviet Union

### US Land's Secondary Claim: Armed Maintenance of Peace

[United Press, La Riviera Beach, Northern California, 8th] US Land Secretary Royal has stated: A strong and peace-loving America is the greatest force in preventing war, and the US is intensifying the accumulation of rare materials to prevent another world war from occurring. In addition, plans for rapid mobilization and the training of 4.5 million soldiers have been completed. He said: We are now accumulating, training, and striving to ensure that US weapons production remains ahead of all other countries in the world. The research and application of atomic bombs cannot be abandoned until all other countries in the world have confirmed that they are no longer researching atomic bombs and will never use them. He admitted that the above remarks seemed to be warmongering, but in fact, they were not. The main point is to explain that a weak America is enough to invite aggressive wars.

### New Method of Fly Extermination

Electric Current Through Screens Kills on Contact

### US Amphibious Operations Unit to Japan for Landing Exercises

[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 9th] According to a report from San Diego: Part of the US Navy's amphibious operations team departed from San Diego on the 7th for Japan to participate in landing exercises conducted by the US Eighth Army in the Sagami Bay area of Japan in late September.

### New York Truckers Strike; Food Supply Faces Serious Crisis; Maritime Union Strike at a Standstill but Not Leading to a General Strike

[United Press, New York, 8th] New York, the largest city in the United States, is facing the most serious food and industrial crisis in recent history today, as the truckers' strike shows no sign of resolution. The food supply situation is rapidly declining, and industry has also encountered significant threats due to its inability to obtain raw materials and ship out finished products.

[Associated Press, New York, 8th] Hundreds of New York grocery stores plan to close this week unless the strike of 25,000 truckers is resolved. Goods arriving have been greatly reduced for a week, and most stores have begun to lay off employees because they have no goods to sell. Since the seamen's strike, activities have almost completely stopped. According to union sources, at least 15,500 tons of food are still being transported daily, but normally 20,000 tons are moved.

[Associated Press, New York, 8th] The impact of the US seamen's strike on industry strengthened today, but it will not lead to a nationwide general strike. Although a certain seamen's leader said that a general strike would occur, the union believes that this threat is "ridiculous." Approximately 1,500 to 1,600 ships have stopped sailing along the coast, and national water transport remains at a standstill. The union is currently delaying, waiting for the Wage Stabilization Board to decide on the 10th whether to withdraw its order to reduce wages and increase standards. Federal Director Garcia stated that the New York Seamen's Union has agreed to notify members to continue sailing federal ships as usual, and hopes that the same method can be negotiated on the West Coast.

### Southeast Asian Food Conference Believed to Be Held in Singapore

The resolution stipulates that 16 aircraft engines will be sold to the United Nations and transported to Yugoslavia. At the same time, ten other international organizations, including national organizations, will ensure their right of first refusal. The items purchased by the United Nations range from ice-making machines to Chinese fishing boat sails.

### International Court Reads Hoshino's Testimony; Purging Japan's Economic Aggression; Japan Exploited Occupied Territories' Resources for Long-Term War

[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 9th] At today's Far East International Tribunal regarding Japan's economic aggression, the prosecutor read the testimony of defendant Naoki Hoshino to the US Pacific Fleet Bombing Operations Investigation Office. The content involved the Pacific War, Japan's economic policy toward Manchukuo, and Japan's economic aggression in Korea. The content of the testimony is as follows: (Q) What were the main problems of Japan's war economy after 1942? (A) 1942 was a period of active advancement in the war. The most important issue that year was how to utilize the resources of the occupied areas. It initially proceeded smoothly, but after the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal, it suddenly became unfavorable due to obstructions such as submarines. The industrial production of "Manchukuo" did not develop much in the early stages, but increased rapidly after 1942 because the basic iron and coal industries were completed. One of the purposes of Japan's invasion of the Northeast was to seize mineral and industrial raw materials, and the second was to transplant the population. At the end of 1941, the army and navy had secretly stored oil, believing that they could continue fighting until they obtained oil produced in the South Seas. The utilization of ore in North China was also formally considered. After 1944, Japan and "Manchukuo" strengthened their wartime economies, and the economy of "Manchukuo" cooperated with the war to the greatest extent.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] The International Court convened today, and defendant Naoki Hoshino testified, admitting that Japan never hoped to defeat the United States, nor did it hope to invade the United States, but hoped to force the latter to hold peace talks. Japan believed that the United States could not reach the Far East, so it decided that regardless of victory or defeat, rather than withdrawing from China, it would rather fight a war.

### Iran Discovers Reactionary Conspiracy

[Associated Press, Tehran, 8th] British Ambassador to Iran, Mr. Monckton, went to Isfahan in southern Iran yesterday with his wife and daughter for a vacation.

### British Meteor Aircraft Sets Speed Record of 616 Miles Per Hour

[Reuters, Tangmere, Essex, 8th] Royal Flight Captain Donaldson yesterday set a new speed record of 616 miles per hour here in a Meteor jet-propelled aircraft, which is ten miles faster than the original world speed record of 606 miles per hour. The new record has been submitted to the International Aviation Association for approval. However, due to the poor weather yesterday, the organizers plan to hold another test when the weather improves, in order to reach the highest new record of 630 miles per hour. Air Force Fighter Command Commander, Marshal Ross, announced that as a result of the flights of Captains Donaldson and Walter yesterday, the four speeds created by Mr. Tang were 623 miles per hour, 610 miles per hour, 623 miles per hour, and 609 miles per hour. The average is 616 miles per hour, 606 miles per hour, 608 miles per hour, and 620 miles per hour, which are also calculated four times, so the average speed is 614 miles per hour.

### Soviet Purge Movement Spreads to Cultural Circles

[French News Agency, Moscow, 9th] A new novel by the famous Soviet satirical writer Shashi Chenko, entitled "Memoirs of a Man-Ape," was deemed by the Soviet Writers' Association to "satirize Soviet society unreasonably and ignore the Soviet people's claims during the war" and was therefore "illegal and expelled from membership." At the same time, the female poet Amaduva was condemned for revealing a petty bourgeois boudoir style in her poems. Several other writers were reprimanded for other reasons, and the Writers' Association decided to appeal to all Soviet writers to first promote the Soviet political system, fight against capitalism, and educate young people.

### Opening of Municipal Senate General Assembly; 164 Senators Present; Harmonious Atmosphere; Discussion of Rules of Procedure in the Morning, Mayor's Report in the Afternoon; Hearing of Police and Health Reports Today

[Our newspaper] The first general assembly of the city's first Municipal Senate was held at 9:00 a.m. yesterday on the second floor of the Yiyuan Restaurant on Fuxing Middle Road. A total of 164 people, including Speaker Pan Gongzhan and senators, as well as more than ten city government leaders and the mayor, attended. Dozens of alternate senators, newspaper reporters, and guests were present to observe. A total of 341 proposals were received at the conference. The layout of the venue was simple and dignified, with small party and national flags fluttering indoors. The podium faced north from the south, with senators' seats set up in three directions, and the reporter and audience seats arranged on the left and right sides of the podium. After the ceremony at 9:00 a.m., Speaker Pan reported that the conference was originally scheduled for one week, but due to insufficient time, it was decided to change it to two weeks. Regarding the conference schedule, in addition to being printed and distributed, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan recited it again. After Xiang finished, a lottery was held to determine the seat order of each senator. Deputy Speaker Xu Jilong drew one by one, and senators would be seated according to the drawn seat order starting from the second meeting in the afternoon. The meeting officially began at 10:00 a.m. The agenda in the morning was to discuss draft rules of procedure, draft agendas, and draft organizations for review committees, and to elect councillors. The rules of procedure were formulated with reference to the rules of procedure of the provincial senate, with a total of 35 articles. The Secretary-General read them once first, and then the Speaker read them article by article, with senators raising opinions and amendments at any time, and speaking very enthusiastically. Among them, Article 34 "The motions, inquiries, and other documents of this council shall be published after being submitted to the Chairman for approval by the Secretary-General" was deleted, and a new article was added: "Matters not covered by these rules shall be referred to the Preliminary Regulations of Civil Rights." Then, the agenda was discussed. Several senators proposed to postpone the election of councillors. After a vote, it was rejected by 79 votes to 59. After the agenda was passed, the draft list of members of the review committee was discussed. Senators expressed many opinions on the number of groups and the candidates for each group. Some people advocated adding three special review committees for food, transportation, and rent, but only 22 votes were in favor, and it failed to pass. Finally, the candidates for the review committee were determined according to the draft list. Those with opinions could submit them before the second general assembly in the afternoon. By noon at 12:00, after a majority vote, the Chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the election of councillors was changed to the afternoon.

### Resumed Second Meeting in the Afternoon

At 3:00 p.m., the second meeting continued. After the Speaker announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan recited the minutes of the morning meeting. Then, the supplementary election of councillors began. This was not held in the morning and was postponed to the afternoon. Some senators advocated nomination and introduction, and some senators expressed opposition. As a result of the vote, opponents of nomination passed with 90 votes. (See separate article for election details) Speaker Pan then invited Mayor Wu to give a report.

### Mayor's Policy Report; Problems with Food Registration; Coarse Rice Policy Fails

Amid enthusiastic applause, Mayor Wu stood up and reported: I am very pleased to be able to attend the Senate today. What I am reporting now is to supplement the shortcomings of the written report. In China, in order to achieve democracy in politics and any other aspect, those who bear administrative responsibility must make honest reports, and even more so must make honest reports on the errors of policy implementation. Therefore, I will now report on the errors in policy implementation in the past three months and the policies that should be implemented in the future as follows:

There have been two major shortcomings in the past three months: (1) lack of knowledge of the current situation in Shanghai, (2) most policy implementations are to deal with temporary emergencies. The report will be divided into two parts. The first part is the handling of emergency events in the past three months, and the second part is the policy direction of each municipal department.

Regarding the first part, the first is the food problem. First, the food registration was organized incorrectly. The method was correct, but the result was problematic because there was duplicate registration. Rice shops, rice companies, rice mills, and warehouses were all registered at the same time. As a result of the registration, Shanghai had a food reserve of 400,000 to 500,000 dans, enough for two months, but in reality it was only more than 200,000 dans, so there was a black market trend at the end of June and the beginning of July. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Food were urgently requested to provide assistance, and a telegram was sent to the Chairman to quickly transport Sichuan rice to Shanghai. The city's rice shortage was resolved. Second, the coarse rice policy failed. Coarse rice is indeed more nutritious, but the citizens of Shanghai usually eat white rice, so it could not be implemented. The municipal government has the ability to suppress the price of medium-grade rice and will never allow it to rise. The municipal government owns a large amount of coarse rice, which can be sold at any time. As for white rice, the price will be negotiated. The Ministry of Food will transport Taiwanese rice and Brazilian rice, which will also be sold when necessary to maintain the price of white rice. By the end of September, the price of rice may fall.

Labor Unrest

The second is the issue of labor unrest. Labor unrest is a general phenomenon in the world after the war. The government's policy is labor-management cooperation and increased production. The capital side maintains the labor side's legitimate life, and the labor side observes the capital side's regulations and discipline. The principle regarding wages is that the base salary is not increased, and adjustments are made according to the cost of living index. However, the previous municipal government has already increased the base salary. The municipal government first mediates labor unrest, and then arbitrates. The result of the arbitration must be accepted by both labor and management.

Housing Shortage

The third is the housing shortage. There are three reasons: one is the increase in population. Although the city's household registration survey only shows 3.7 million people, it is estimated that there are as many as 5 million people. The second is the reduction in housing. Many houses were bombed and damaged during the war. The third is illegal occupation. The fourth is illegal leasing. The inevitable result is a reduction in construction, because large landlords have no profit to make, and building houses is not as good as lending money. I hope that the senators will provide more guidance on this point. The current policy of the municipal government is (1) to crack down on illegal occupation, (2) to crack down on secondary landlords and transfer fees, and (3) to encourage construction.

The director of a certain municipal department gave a brief report, saying that since the restoration, the municipal government's staffing and budget have not been finalized, and everything is not easy to put on the right track. The municipal government has now decided that the total number of all personnel must not exceed the sum of the former French Concession Board of Directors, the former Municipal Council, and the former municipal government as a principle. Regarding the social sector, labor unrest has been reported. The Social Affairs Bureau is actively handling relief work, and I hope that all senators will enthusiastically promote it. Regarding the police, the current difficulty is that the number of people is insufficient. The city's police force currently has only 12,000 people and must be increased to at least 15,000 people.

### Today's Agenda

The Municipal Senate will hold its second meeting this morning, with a report by Police Chief Xuan Tiewu. The third meeting will be held this afternoon, with a report by Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei.

### Few Municipal Schools; High Tuition Fees for Private Schools

Regarding education, the city's education budget has been appropriately increased from 9% to 19%. The two major difficulties at present are that there are too few municipal schools and private schools charge exorbitant fees. Regarding public works, there are currently two urgent projects: one is to reinforce the seawall and the second is flood control. The municipal government has allocated huge sums of money and has established a urban planning committee to seek improvements urgently. Regarding public utilities, the most difficult problem is transportation. We are now seeking to develop transportation with private capital. Regarding land administration, we will speed up the completion of land registration, reduce land value tax, and protect people's property rights. Regarding hygiene, we will work hard to prevent epidemics and solve sanitation problems. Regarding civil affairs, we will use the Baojia system to complete household registration surveys and assist in sanitation matters. Regarding finance, the municipal government's budget for the 35th year is 30 billion short. How to make up for it and achieve balance is urgently awaiting the senators' contribution of opinions. At present, most of the finance relies on entertainment tax, which is unreasonable. Finally, Mayor Wu made a statement on the case of the liquidation team investigating the municipal government's handling of 4 billion worth of materials from the false Central Market. He expressed a warm welcome to the liquidation team's investigation of accounts and welcomed the Senate's investigation.

### Jiang Jianbai and Jin Zhenyu Elected Councillors; Resolved on Shanghai's Quota; Requested Increase to Nine People

[Our newspaper] After the city councillors Tao Baichuan and Xi Yushu resigned from the position of councillor due to their full-time positions as senators, their vacancies were filled yesterday afternoon in the Municipal Senate General Assembly by Jiang Jianbai (107 votes) and Ms. Jin Zhenyu (83 votes). The election took a non-nominating introduction style. After Shen Chunhui, Wang Zhuyi, Zhu Yakui, Zhu Wende and other four senators supervised the votes and opened the votes, Chen Baotai, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang and other fifteen senators made a temporary motion to ask the municipal government to forward the Central Government to consider increasing the quota of councillors in the city. If calculated according to population ratio, Chongqing has 1.31 million people and 4 councillors, then Shanghai should have 9 people. Former Councillor Tao Baichuan explained that there are three standards for electing councillors: (1) based on population (but not an absolute standard), (2) provinces with provincial senatorships have more quotas, and (3) cities in occupied areas have fewer quotas than those in the interior. However, this is based on wartime regulations, and now the number of senators in the northeastern provinces has increased, and the quota for Shanghai should also be revised. It is also reasonable to request an increase. As a result, it was resolved to request an increase to nine people and ask the municipal government to telegram the Central Government for instructions.

Jiang Jianbai

### Tradition to Be Hired as a Legislator First; Going to Beijing After the End of the General Assembly

[Our newspaper] Mr. Fu Tongxian, a city councillor, has recently been hired as a legislator by the Legislative Yuan. This has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council. According to Mr. Fu, he returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago.

### Shanghai's Budget for the Second Half of the Year; Strive to Tighten Administrative Expenses

[Our newspaper] It is reported that Shanghai's budget policy for the second half of the year is to first seek the restoration of the city's appearance. All matters relating to the repair of roads and bridges, the police force to maintain public order, and the basic education, culture, and health undertakings for national construction will be relaxed as much as possible. As for administrative expenses, we will strive to tighten them, and all units that have no urgent relationship with the policy direction of the year will be merged and reduced as much as possible to save public funds. Regarding the income side, the current taxes and levies in the city will be the mainstay. However, since Shanghai has just been recovered, there are many things that need to be done urgently, resulting in a huge shortfall in revenue and expenditure. In order to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure, we should formulate adjustment measures and propose new taxes to increase revenue in accordance with the principle of living within our means established by the Central Government.

The estimated ordinary revenue for the second half of this year is 84.7175218 million yuan, of which the current revenue from various taxes and levies is 50.190363015 million yuan. Borrowed income is 1.2 billion yuan, and newly added taxes and adjusted revenue is 33.327158785 million yuan to meet the needs of the undertaking. The adjustment method will be formulated separately and implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Senate for deliberation and decision.

The expenditures for the second half of this year are divided into two major categories: ordinary expenditures and business expenditures. Ordinary expenditures are divided into regular and temporary categories. The regular category is estimated at 5.900464310 million yuan, including a reserve fund of 1.5 billion yuan. The temporary category is estimated at 78.303878790 million yuan, including a living allowance of 44.6502047 million yuan. Business expenditures are estimated at 5.09 million yuan in public business funds.

Tax revenue in Shanghai accounts for more than 80% of the total revenue in the second half of this year. Among them, those listed at more than 5 billion yuan are business tax, banquet tax, and entertainment tax. Those listed at more than 2 billion yuan are land value tax, house tax, slaughter tax, and hotel tax.

The four largest items in the total budget expenditure for the second half of this year are public works expenses, accounting for 21.24% of the total budget, public security expenses, accounting for 20.93%, education and culture expenses, accounting for 19.17%, and health expenses, accounting for 16.07%. This is also the various undertakings that the city urgently needs to carry out.

### Disorder: Hope for More Attention in the Future. Tao Baichuan Points Out Nine Types of Disorder. Councilors Raise Inquiries, and the Mayor Responds with Three Points.

After Mayor Wu reported on the city government's administration, councilors raised written inquiries, totaling forty-five items. Due to time constraints, the mayor first answered the following three questions orally: (1) Chai Zifei asked: What is the progress of the demarcation issue between this city and Jiangsu Province? After that part of the area is assigned to this city, what are the advantages and disadvantages to the city's finances and public security? Before the demarcation issue is resolved, various bureaus have already started education, civil affairs, and other undertakings in the area. What is the intention? The mayor replied: Regarding the demarcation issue between the province and the city, Jiangsu Province sent personnel to Shanghai to observe and make decisions, but there were no concrete results. Now, we have submitted two more reports urging them to do so. After the provincial government has handled the demarcation, the city’s financial, public security, and other tasks can be actively promoted.

(2) Chai Zifei asked: Collecting "Respect Teachers Money" in elementary and middle schools, a portion of which must be handed over to the city government, seems inconsistent with the meaning of respecting teachers. Has the city government considered this? The mayor replied: The "Respect Teachers Money" in elementary and middle schools is for increasing the number of school classes and should originally belong to the city government. However, nominally, middle schools take increased tuition fees, and elementary schools take "Respect Teachers Money." The name has been considered many times. If it is inappropriate, it can be modified. The treatment of teachers and staff in municipal schools should be the same as that of civil servants, according to central regulations.

(3) Zhang Zhusan asked: Regarding the fifth clause in the second item of the municipal gazette's measures for handling labor disputes, which stipulates that factories and labor should hold factory meetings, what is the extent of its implementation since March? If one party does not comply, how should it be handled? The mayor replied: Factory meetings are based on the Factory Law. Since they are stipulated by the central government, they should be strictly enforced. However, despite the laws, it is often impossible to fully implement them in Shanghai. Since March, the city government has not perfectly implemented this case. In the future, all city government regulations will be reviewed by the council, and after a decision is made, they will be handled in accordance with the law.

Among the other inquiries, the more proactive ones include: Hou Jiyuan asked: Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Government's Receiving Materials Management Office, for each house (referring to small shops with few people), there are two million yuan in handling fees. What is the effect of the word "handling," and what will this handling fee be used for? Tao Baichuan stated: My impression of the municipality over the past year is that I can't get rid of the word "disorder." Leaving home early, the road traffic is chaotic, the market situation is chaotic, the factories are chaotic, the city government organization has not yet been decided, which is also chaotic, the lack of financial policy is also chaotic, changing mayors twice in a year is also chaotic, the proliferation of central agencies in Shanghai is also chaotic, and the reception situation is even more chaotic. How can we get by if this continues? I hope the mayor will pay more attention to the word "disorder." I don't know if you have noticed it? Zhang Xuelian suggested: Can the mayor be more accessible to the public? For example, the district chiefs should be elected by the district residents as soon as possible. The district chiefs are locals, and the mayor's access to the district chiefs is equivalent to being close to the public at any time, which can not only complete self-government but also reduce barriers. Yang Fusheng asked: How does the city government handle the auction procedures and valuation procedures for the property of the former puppet government? Shi Zongde asked: What is the number of materials confiscated in this crackdown on vendors? How will they be disposed of? Gu Jinzao suggested: The increasing theft at the docks is due to the inability to centrally manage port affairs. However, the anti-smuggling personnel's inability to abide by the law and acceptance of bribes has become a public fact, and there should be concrete measures for the aftermath. Tong Nang asked: Did the Shanghai Municipal Government go through formal procedures for taking over the old two concessions, and for the formal transfer of the property of the two concessions? Wang Nai and Chen Gao asked: What is the nature of the Shanghai Corporation in the city government's organizational system, and what are its main businesses?

### Improving Traffic: Day One. Cars Like Flowing Water, Horses Like Dragons. Shouting and Yelling Are Still Chaotic.

[Our Newspaper] The serious traffic problem in this city has always been the most painful problem for citizens and the most thorny problem for the municipal authorities. Narrow streets cannot be widened immediately, and elevated and tunnel construction is not easy to build in the short term. How can these 200,000 vehicles be arranged? The authorities came up with an improvement method in the absence of any other options. Although it is not perfect, it is still somewhat satisfactory. After weeks of planning and preparation, traffic improvement began yesterday. The police bureau mobilized all traffic police and volunteer police to participate in directing traffic, especially on Nanjing East Road, where there was virtually a post every three steps and a sentry every five steps. Police officers with gold-edged hats and three gold stars constantly patrolled back and forth. Cars and trams moved forward carefully, head to tail, indeed in good order. However, in several notoriously congested areas, such as Risheng Building, Bowling Green, Baidu Bridge, and Nicheng Bridge, cars were still like flowing water, horses like dragons, with shouting and yelling in a mess. On several one-way traffic roads, such as Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, and Sichuan Road, looking along the road during the busiest times for vehicles going to and from offices and at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, it was like a long line of snakes. Sometimes the traffic police were also overwhelmed. For example, pedestrians do not pass in the middle of the designated yellow lines, and cars do not stop on the white lines. These all add to the difficulties in traffic. In addition, rickshaws and tricycles cannot find parking places because the new traffic rules do not allow empty cars to park randomly. As a result, many empty cars are mixed in the traffic flow and squeezed. Rickshaws had their cushions taken away by the police, and they did not know what rules they had broken. After six o'clock, there were fewer cars, the one-way streets were opened, and the police and drivers breathed a sigh of relief. Under the neon lights, 200,000 vehicles continued to gallop. The first day of traffic improvement has passed. Let's see about the second day today!

### Traffic Police Are Overwhelmed

[Our Newspaper] The measures to improve traffic in the central district have been implemented since zero o'clock yesterday. The person in charge of the Traffic Section of the Police Bureau was dispatched to supervise the roads. The Huangpu and Laoza two sub-bureaus each added 120 traffic police officers, and the Xincheng sub-bureau added 30 officers. In addition, Fang Zhichao, director of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, personally went to the central district for inspection yesterday afternoon. Because yesterday was the first day of implementation, many drivers were not accustomed to it, so the situation was still slightly chaotic.

### Two Traitors Sentenced: Chen Bohua and Zhao Yu Are Punished Separately

(2) Shen Guanquan, acting warden of the Puppet Shanghai Prison, transported prisoners to Sijiaoshan in Ningbo to build military projects for the enemy, resulting in many deaths and disabilities. He also stole and sold a large number of materials left by the Public Works Bureau in the prison. Shen claimed that he was acting under orders. Yesterday, Wu Songgao, the puppet Minister of Justice and Administration, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, was specifically brought to testify and questioned. (3) Tao Zhongli, the former owner of the Oriental Shenqu Theater in this city and head of the enemy gendarmerie's secret agents, and Xue Youwen, a detective from the Puppet Shanghai Putuo Police Sub-bureau, framed our underground workers and the puppet police Zhang Yifeng, Zhang Liansheng, and Gu Jingen. After questioning, all were adjourned for further questioning.

### Haiyue Ship Encountered Danger

[Our Newspaper] According to shipping industry sources yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's Haiyue ship, on its return trip from Haiphong to Shanghai, also stopped at Haikou on Hainan Island. It was anchored outside the port when a typhoon suddenly struck on the 8th, and the ship bore the brunt. The captain of the ship tried his best to save it, but due to the terrifying wind and waves, it was difficult to maintain. The bureau received a report yesterday that the ship had not yet escaped danger, and the ship's anchors and chains had been broken. Further details are still pending. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau dispatched the Haixia ship to open the China-Philippines route. All departure procedures are being processed.

In addition, there is one water dock (which has also been repaired). Director Zhao is preparing to report the above-mentioned dock repair work to the City Council. The small number of docks that have not been repaired are awaiting funding to start construction.

### Shui Xiangyun of 76, Also Known as Qiao Tong and Jin Suqin

Speaker Pan, wearing a grey silk long gown, sat upright on the chairman's platform with a cordial smile. He folded [blanks] at times, his attitude was calm and unhurried. A reporter from a certain newspaper said, "He looks a bit like [blanks]."

When Speaker read the rules of procedure item by item, he took off his glasses. Whenever a councilor stood up to speak, he put them back on. He put them on and took them off again, took them off and put them on again, more than twenty times in total.

Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing drew lots on behalf of the councilors to arrange the seating order, drawing a total of 175 times, frequently wiping the sweat from his hands with a handkerchief.

The regulations stipulate that councilors must first report their number and name before speaking, but most speakers ignored this procedure. The first person to report was Mr. Shui Xiangyun, but his number was "Number 76."

Before the election of the senators, someone was distributing the name cards of Jiang Jianbai and Jin Zhenyu in the arena. Jin Zhenyu is the wife of Xi Yushu, and the name card also has the alias Suqin printed on it. A reporter from a certain newspaper said, "Isn't there also a singer called Jin Suqin?"

### Sidelines at the Meeting

Jiang Jianbai was elected as a senator with 107 votes, and Xi Zhenxia was elected with 83 votes. The first person to be defeated was Lian [blanks] with 46 votes. Someone voted for Yan Huiging with one vote, and someone voted for [blanks] Jin Rong Xu Chedaigu with one vote.

Two votes for Jiang Jianbai were written as Jiang Jian"jian" Bai and Jiang "jian" Bai, and they were counted separately when counting the votes. Fortunately, Jiang Jianbai didn't care about these two votes, otherwise, wouldn't it be "wrongful and unjust"?

The meeting discussed until twelve o'clock in the morning, and the chairman announced that it was getting late and asked whether to adjourn the meeting. Gu Zhuxuan stood up and shouted loudly, "I agree to adjourn the meeting, I'm hungry!"

The mayor's report lasted for a full hour and five minutes, and he [blanks] his head more than ten times during the report.

The councilors asked as many as 40 written questions to the city government. When the chairman [blanks] reviewed them one by one, the mayor borrowed a match from Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau to smoke a cigarette, looking very relaxed, as if he was "confident."

The first councilor to speak was Ma Junshuo, the first councilor from the press to speak was Zhang Zhihan, and the only female councilor was Lu Huimin.

Each seat in the council hall had a pen holder, an inkstone, ink, a writing brush, a pencil, and a [blanks], but if there was no ashtray, it would look a bit like the old days.

Yesterday afternoon, when electing the senators, Miss Xi Yao, the third daughter of Xi Yushu, attended the hearing. She was very happy to hear that her mother had been elected as a senator.

Before the meeting started, the Shanghai Municipal Council distributed a large kraft paper bag to each person, with [blanks] printed inside, which was very convenient.

Xu Jiqing Sweats While Drawing Lots, Gu Zhuxuan Shouts That He Is Hungry

There was a large [blanks] piano next to the chairman's platform in the meeting hall, which was not moved away. The secretariat staff used it as a writing desk, which was "recycling waste."

Most of the municipal councilors took cars to the meeting, and the new and old cars were of various shapes and colors, all parked in Yiyuan Square. However, some councilors also went by tram and on foot.

### Fellow Villager Is Actually a Bandit: Kidnapping and Extortion Cracked

Recently, his family property was destroyed when the countryside was occupied by the Communist Party, so he brought his family to Shanghai to live. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, he met Tan Jiaxi, Xu Dafu, and Zhao Yushan, who were acquaintances from his hometown, at the Sun Temple. Tan knew that Ni was quite wealthy, so he invited him to Yuan Youshao's house at No. 292 Jingjiang Road. Using the excuse that it was difficult to get through the festival, he asked Ni to borrow one million yuan. Ni said that he did not have such a large sum of money, and promised to raise 300,000 yuan, with Yuan guaranteeing payment within three days. When the time came (i.e., the 8th), Ni went to Yuan to explain that he would delay for a few days because he had no money. Unexpectedly, Tan and others led a group to break into Ni's house at 5 p.m. that day, accusing him of hiding "twenty Benke guns and one thousand bullets," forcing him to hand them over. Ni replied that he really had no guns or bullets. They used threats and violent means to tie Ni up and take him to the back of the Dafeng Yarn Factory, hired a ferry to cross to the other side, and then took a tricycle to hide Ni in the Sun family house on Yuyuan Road, planning to extort a large sum of money. After the incident, Ni's younger brother Zhaorui reported to the Zhabei Sub-bureau for help. After the sub-bureau chief personally led the investigation for a day and night, Yuan Youshao was first arrested, and then Xu Dafu and Zhao Yushan were arrested in western Shanghai, and Ni was rescued from danger.

### Director Li of the Zhejiang Education Department Announces the Teaching Guidelines for All Levels of Schools; Hopes to Establish More Private Schools to Relieve the Education Famine

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent] The autumn enrollment season has arrived in the municipality, and schools are actively enrolling new students. However, due to the difficulty of school restoration after the victory, the capacity is limited, and the number of transfer students in each school is mostly up to twenty (very few) and at least three or four, resulting in a large number of students unable to continue their studies. During this period of high prices and expensive tuition, many have already been excluded from the school gates due to economic difficulties. According to the preliminary estimate of our reporter, the number of those who have not been able to enroll due to the limitation of quotas has reached about 2,000. At this time of national revival, the occurrence of an education famine is a serious problem. Therefore, our reporter paid a special visit to Li Chaoying, Director of the Education Department. Director Li, who has only recently taken office, claimed that he is not yet fully familiar with Zhejiang's education. He also said that since the victory, the flames of war have not ceased, and the government has difficulty in raising funds and is unable to establish new schools. Therefore, he is determined to "emphasize quality over quantity" and devote himself to the education of Zhejiang Province. At present, there are only two universities in Zhejiang Province, Yingshi and Zhejiang, both of which are national. In secondary education, there are only fifteen public schools and sixty-five private schools, with approximately 60,000 students, and 8,640 students are allocated public funds. The future teaching guidelines are "teaching according to talent and combining teaching with application." In terms of normal education, there are eleven provincial normal schools, sixteen county normal schools, and sixty-one simplified normal schools, guiding seventy-six counties throughout the province. The future teaching guidelines are (1) to eliminate the education of slavery and (2) to teach according to local conditions. In terms of national education, there are 2,222 central national schools, 12,256 Bao national primary schools, and 1,514 other primary schools, totaling 15,992 schools, with more than one million children enrolled. The future teaching guidelines are (1) to enrich the content and (2) to improve the quality of teachers. In terms of social education, there are now 101 people's education centers, 22 libraries, 28 gymnasiums, and 1 children's education center in the province. The future teaching guidelines are (1) to promote national integrity and (2) to emphasize the concept of the country. In terms of vocational education, there are six provincial schools, four county schools, and four private schools, all of which are agricultural, industrial, and commercial in nature.

### Women's Volleyball Finals, Three Strong Teams Compete Again, You Team Meets Youlian Today

There Are Two Acts of the B-Group Replay Before the Game

[News from Our Office] The group champions of the B-group of the volleyball league have been produced successively. Starting today, the overall finals will be held. Also, because the You Team, Wuben, and Youlian have created a three-legged situation in the women's group league, they will start a single round robin again today to determine the championship. There are three games in total, starting at 6:15 p.m. at the gymnasium. The tickets are all 1,000 yuan.

The first game is the replay between the champion of the B-group 5th Division, Huaguang, and the champion of the B-group 2nd Division, Soviet B. The latter is tall and strong, and its technology is not bad, so Huaguang may not be its opponent. In the second game, the champion of the B-group 1st Division, Renyu, will fight against the champion of the B-group 4th Division, Huayan Hua. Renyu has more than enough defense, but lacks attackers, so Huayan Hua is likely to win. In the last game, the three strong teams of the women's group will compete again. Youlian and You Team will play against each other first. You Team was frustrated in the last game when it was most likely to win, and the championship, which was about to be won, became a pending case. Now that the opportunity is good, it will definitely go all out. Only Youlian has considerable strength. After defeating You Team, it is ambitious and should have a big battle.

(You Team) Front row: Rong Shujian, Zhang Yixuan, Liu Zhenbao. Second row: Wu Lielie, Wang Weizhen, Huang Mingyuan. Third row: Yang Wenjuan, Xiang Yulin, Situ Mei.

(Youlian) Front row: Zhu Jinhu, Chen Meizhen, Lu Cuifang. Second row: Chen Liuzhen, Shen Meiying, Du Yueduan. Third row: Lu Zhaoshan, Chen Jieshu, Rong Zhusi.

Renyu——Huayan Hua (B Group Total Replay) 7:00 p.m.

You Team——Youlian (Women's Group Finals) 7:45 p.m.

When registering, they should be entered into the temporary residence registration book or the mobile population book according to the time of residence.

(72) Question: Can the mobile population registration book be based on the household registration book, or should a separate book format be used?

Answer: The mobile population book does not generate statistical reports, and the registration book format can be determined by the local authorities.

(73) Question: Can temporary residence registration be incorporated into migration population registration?

Answer: The registration of temporary residents and migrants aims to clarify the actual population of each locality in order to supplement the deficiencies of household registration and personnel registration. Although there are two types of regulations, the registration is not duplicated, and it should still be handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry, without the need for summarization.

### Stock Exchange Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday, Central and Municipal Leaders Delivered Speeches of Encouragement, Stocks and Bonds Divided into Two Markets

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Stock Exchange, which has been in preparation for more than five months, finally held its grand opening ceremony yesterday in a warm and solemn atmosphere. At around 9 o'clock, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Mayor Wu, Governor Bei of the Central Bank, Chairman Li Fuxun of the Banking Association, and others arrived one after another. Chairman Du of the Stock Exchange, Acting General Manager Wang Zhixin, and others personally welcomed them. They immediately convened all the directors and important staff members, and the leaders delivered speeches on the spot. During the meeting, Chairman Du Yong of the Stock Exchange first delivered a welcome speech, followed by Minister Wang, Mayor Wu, Governor Bei, Li Fuxun, and others. After the meeting adjourned at 10:30, all the leaders and important guests, led by Du Yong, Wang Zhixin, and others, visited the market and various facilities. By this time, guests from all walks of life and brokers had arrived one after another. This newspaper specially presented each guest with a copy of our newspaper at the signing desk. However, due to the enthusiastic arrivals, the newspapers were quickly distributed. The trading counters in the market, the brokers' telephone seats, the market quotation boards, and other facilities were all brand new and complemented the stream of congratulatory guests. At that time, the atmosphere in the market was unprecedentedly warm. At around 11 o'clock, the leaders and distinguished guests left one after another. By noon, the congratulatory guests in the market gradually dispersed. The speeches of the officials and guests are recorded as follows:

Chairman Du Delivered a Welcome Speech

In May of this year, the government, recognizing the urgent need to prepare for the establishment of a securities trading market in Shanghai, appointed Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiying, Xu Weiming, Gu Shanchang, Xia Pingfang, Qu Jigang, Yu Huancheng, Wang Zhixin, and myself to organize the Shanghai Securities Trading Market Preparatory Committee to establish the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which has now been formally established. However, due to time constraints, it has not been possible to achieve perfection as expected. The mission of our exchange is extremely arduous, and the government and society have high expectations for us. The urgent task at present is to guide idle funds and gradually bring them into the market after the opening. Securities prices should gradually stabilize. The completion of this initial task depends on the supervision of the government's competent authorities and the assistance and cooperation of all sectors. In short, the purpose of our market is to curb speculative activities and encourage the concentration of capital. In the future, our exchange must cooperate with national policies to complete its mission. I can guarantee that I will do my best to lead my colleagues to move forward unremittingly in this direction.

From Supervised Progress to Autonomy

Minister Wang said in his speech: The stock exchange is a thorough economic organization. Stock exchanges in the United States and the United Kingdom adopt an autonomous legal system, while stock exchanges in continental Europe adopt a government-supervised legal system. The policy of our government is to temporarily adopt the supervision method. When the foundation of the stock exchange is consolidated and the methods are improved in the future, we will move towards autonomy. I hope that the stock exchange authorities and the brokerage firms will implement the spirit of the rule of law, so that the stock exchange can be successfully completed and the Shanghai Stock Exchange can become a model for stock exchanges across the country.

Stabilizing Finance and Securing People's Livelihood

Mayor Wu said in his speech: The government's economic policies currently have two goals, namely, stabilizing finance and securing people's livelihood. If the stock exchange is to be run well, it needs to help the government achieve these two goals. The directors, supervisors, assistant managers, etc. of the stock exchange are all leaders in various fields and are highly respected. Therefore, I firmly believe that the stock exchange will be well run. On behalf of the local government, I express my sincere congratulations.

Carefully Select Securities and Maintain Close Contact

Governor Bei said in his speech: The function of the stock exchange is to guide idle funds and support industrial and commercial enterprises. It has a great function. Therefore, I hope that the stock exchange will pay attention to two points in the future: (1) The securities listed on the market should be carefully selected. (2) For the securities that have been listed, I hope that the stock exchange will maintain close contact with the companies that issue them and learn more about the content of each company. Finally, I sincerely hope that the Shanghai Stock Exchange can become a model for stock exchanges across the country.

Supporting the Government and Supporting Industry and Commerce

Li Fuxun said in his speech: The responsibilities of the stock exchange are important. On the one hand, it can support the government, and on the other hand, it can support industry and commerce. Therefore, the stock exchange should do its best. I just heard Minister Wang talk about the government's policies for the stock exchange, which will gradually move from supervision to deregulation. I express my admiration for this policy. Looking at the sound and complete stock exchanges in the world today, the first is New York, followed by London. I sincerely hope that China's stock exchange can rank third in the world.

Finally, General Manager Wang delivered a speech of thanks: Today's opening of our exchange has been encouraged and shown great concern by the officials who came to give speeches. I am very grateful. Zhixin followed Chairman Du in preparing for our exchange, and it has been hastily completed. There are many shortcomings. I have also been entrusted to serve as acting general manager. I can only do my best to take charge and adhere to government laws and regulations. I will earnestly abide by the points made by the leaders and strive to do my best. However, I feel that my responsibilities are heavy and my abilities are limited, and I am deeply afraid of failing to meet expectations. In the future, I hope for more guidance to correct my shortcomings. Now, on behalf of the colleagues of our exchange, I express my thanks to the leaders.

Also, at around 11:00 yesterday morning, Chen Jixun, the manager of the Stock Exchange, represented Chairman Du and Acting General Manager Wang, and addressed the guests and brokers in the market with a loudspeaker, saying: The weather is hot today, and I am honored by your presence. However, due to limited space, there are many guests, and I apologize for the many shortcomings in the reception. There will be no ceremony today. Please feel free to visit. The first floor of the exchange is the stock market, the second floor is the bond market, and the third floor is the office. Please visit the market and various facilities. If there are any shortcomings, please offer your opinions for improvement.

If the drills are satisfactory, it is decided to officially start trading on the 12th. However, the staff of the Stock Exchange's Market Affairs Department began practicing their work in the market yesterday afternoon. The first batch of securities to be traded are the 20 types of Chinese stocks that were disclosed in yesterday's newspaper for trial listing.

When the stock market officially opens, each broker can have a maximum of three people enter the market (including one broker, one agent, and one telephone operator each). Other people are not allowed to enter the market. As for the salespersons affiliated with each broker (i.e., the so-called securities firms and small companies), the Stock Exchange will also convene a board meeting within days to make regulations. The salespersons affiliated with each broker must be registered with the Stock Exchange. If any illegal behavior is found by the salespersons, the Stock Exchange will notify the affiliated brokers to stop it. Otherwise, the affiliated brokers will be punished. At the same time, the government will also be asked to assist in eliminating the black market trading of stocks.

Also, yesterday afternoon, the staff of the Stock Exchange's Market Affairs Department began practicing their work in the market.

In order to prevent the sharp rise and fall of stock prices, the Stock Exchange has recently stipulated that there are daily price limits for each type of security. The regulations are based on the following standards: (1) For stocks with a price below 100 yuan, the price limit is 20%. (2) For stocks with a price between 100 yuan and 5,000 yuan, the price limit is 15%. (3) For stocks with a price above 5,000 yuan, the price limit is 10%. The daily price limits for each type of security will be announced by the exchange on a daily basis before trading. All transaction prices must not be higher than the announced high price limit or lower than the announced low price limit. If this limit is reached, the exchange will suspend the trading of that security for the day.

Opening of the Stock Exchange (Brokers and Guests in the Market)

### People Excited About Stock Exchange Opening, Unpopular Small Stocks Showed Best Performance

Chinese stocks were excited about the opening of the stock exchange, especially the unpopular small stocks were the most popular. The shortage of chips led to the most active and strongest gains. The popular stocks opened firmly in the morning, but later due to the trading of popular stocks for unpopular ones, there was more lock-in, and there was also no lack of profit-taking at high prices. As the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, the money market tightened in the middle of the day and saw a decline. The unpopular small and medium-sized stocks were still strong and unmoved. The popular stocks also saw lower prices at the close. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsheng Yarn rose slightly, Meiya was slightly lower, and Jingwei was stable. Xinguang rose by half a percent, and the less popular medium-sized stocks were stable and changed.

Foreign stocks slightly declined from high prices. Yishas' yarn opened at 10,300 yuan, but the trading volume was small. Except for Zhiya and Yipi stocks, which had news of applying for listing and slightly rose, they were all dragged down. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Ye Guanggang's shares fell by a weak half a percent. Although Yisha and British United Airlines fell not much, Jardine Matheson was flat, and Yipi Zhiya rose by about half a percent.

Government Bonds Hovered

Government bonds hovered yesterday. Someone came to the 7th floor to trade, and it was slightly popular in the middle of the day. There were many longs taking profits on the 5th floor, and it fell back after the high. Tong Bing opened at 2,450 yuan in the morning, and once rose to 2,580 yuan. Many longs took profits at high prices, and it fell back to below 2,300 yuan in the middle of the day. It finally struggled at around 2,350 yuan. As a result, it rose by 100 yuan compared with the previous close. Jia Yi rose slightly by 20 yuan, Ding fell by 50 yuan, and Tong Wu fell by 100 yuan.

### Shops Open as Usual During Mid-Autumn Festival

Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all banks and money shops in the wood market will still be open as usual. Bill and note exchange will also be exchanged as usual. It is reported that the money market has been slightly looser than in the past few days because the banks that handle loans have released a lot of small industrial loans recently, and idle funds have been slightly more active, so all banks and money shops can safely pass the Mid-Autumn Festival.

### Establishment of a Sound Securities Market (Continued)

— Yang Yinpu

B. Expanding the Funding Source Base Investors who have funds for long-term investment know that the existence of a market means that they can recover their funds at any time. They have no worries when investing, so they can invest as much as they can. This allows those who hold long-term funds to fully supply long-term funds. This is one aspect. Those who have funds for short-term use can take advantage of the existence of the market to conduct securities arbitrage and earn risk-free profits; short-term investors are also not worried about not being able to recover their funds when they need them. In this way, a portion of social short-term funds can also be used to meet the needs of the long-term market. This is another aspect. Idle funds are scattered in society, seeking a way out. They will go here if it is easier to make a profit, and they will go there if it is more dynamic. The conditions of the securities market are generally quite suitable for the needs of those who hold such idle funds. It is possible to guide a portion of the idle funds in the market and put people on the right path. This is another aspect. In short, the existence of a formal market allows funds that do not have long-term characteristics to flow into the long-term market; allows flames that originally had long-term characteristics to be used more fully and without worries. Expanding the base of funding sources increases the amount of funds that can be absorbed. This is its second function.

C. Indicate Effective Investment Paths The market quotations issued by the sound securities market every day are a good indicator of investment paths. The long-term trends of various securities market prices can generally be regarded as a reflection of the prosperity and decline of the respective enterprises. Moreover, the exchange often conducts precise investigations on the listed securities. This credit investigation material, if used well, can be of reference value when investing. In short, the market price of a sound market is the crystallization of the concrete opinions of the majority of actual operators, and invisibly has the power to influence market investment. The existence of the market leads to hints of investment paths, thereby affecting investment trends. This is its third function.

3. The Necessity of Future Efforts

If the securities market is to fully exert its functions, it must first seek the soundness of its own organization, which depends on efforts in many aspects.

A. Soundness of the Market Itself In this regard, there are three aspects that should be given special attention: (1) Strive for meticulousness in market management; (2) Devise ways to improve the level of operation; (3) Select listed securities carefully.

(1) Strive for meticulousness in market management The layout of the new market should strive for modernization and make use of mechanical equipment as much as possible to reduce the chaos when trading is done in the market and increase the efficiency of business processing and message transmission. All illegal actions in the past, such as private off-market transactions, repeated "flying accounts," trying to evade transactions, agents doing their own buying and selling, outsiders mixing into the market, intentionally raising or lowering the market price at the close, etc., damage the credibility of brokers and also damage the credibility of the exchange, and should be strictly prohibited. It is also extremely important to check brokers' accounts from time to time, and for the brokers' association and brokers to actively assist in making continuous improvements to market affairs.

(2) Devise ways to improve the level of operation Help brokers gradually improve their general level of operation, so that brokers' credibility in society will become more and more important; to assume the major responsibility of regulating long-term funds. We should shift some brokers' concepts of near-term and high profits, and pay more attention to the cultivation of strength and credibility to make long-term plans. On the one hand, under the premise of considering the interests of customers, give play to their service spirit; on the other hand, under the new understanding of maintaining the stability of the securities market, change their trading style. This will surely bring a new vision to society and put the securities business on the right track. This depends on the advocacy of the Exchange and the self-awareness and struggle of brokers.

(3) Carefully select listed securities The most important task of the securities market is to benefit the market and channel funds into proper investment paths. If the securities selection is improper, sound and proper enterprises that should be assisted are rejected, while the securities issued by enterprises that are full of fluke and risk-taking fill the market. Not only does it lose the original intention of creating a stock exchange, but it also promotes speculation and cannot escape the blame for wasting social capital. The selection of the types of listed securities is the selection of the types of enterprises to be assisted. Those who are allowed to be listed can obtain the funds they need through the market through the securities they issue; those who are not allowed to be listed cannot use this only institution for financing long-term funds. Therefore, in this regard, the degree of soundness of the future development of the exchange's business can be measured by the degree of appropriateness of the selection of its listed securities as the most accurate test standard. The more appropriate the listing selection, the sounder the development of its business will inevitably be.

B. Guiding Company Organizations The object of market transactions is securities, and the issuance of securities relies on companies. Therefore, developing company organizations is a prerequisite for developing securities and developing markets. With sound companies, there are sound securities, and there may be sound markets. The more sound companies there are, the more sound securities there are, and the more opportunities there are for the sound development of the market. Conversely, due to the existence of the market, securities have the convenience of circulation; due to the convenience of securities circulation, company organizations and securities issuance have been effectively stimulated. Therefore, the sound development of the securities market itself is an important factor in guiding company organizations. Moreover, the Exchange has the power to review the listing of securities. If used properly, it can not only affect the business policies of some existing companies, but also imply the path that future new companies should take, that is, it has an impact. How to use this indirect force to gradually guide company organizations to the right track, so that their internal mechanisms gradually become strict; accounting systems gradually become sound; financial conditions remain fluid; and company content gradually becomes public, so that they know that what gains the position of the market is what gains the belief of society. In this direction, there is indeed the possibility and value of adding effort.

C. Advocating Issuing Institutions Although securities trading institutions have been established after the official opening of the Exchange, the support institutions needed when securities are first issued are still lacking to this day. Such as capital raising on behalf of companies at the time of establishment, acting, underwriting, or private placement when companies issue stocks and bonds, in addition, such as maintaining the market for securities sold on behalf, and assisting in the listing of securities already issued, etc., should be contacted with national financial institutions that have special tasks in this regard, such as the Central Trust Bureau and the Bank of Communications, so as to advocate. With issuing institutions as the assistance of enterprises, the difficulties when securities are first issued can be solved; there is a buying and selling market to maintain its market, and the ability of securities to circulate continuously can be maintained. The two are indispensable and complement each other, so in this regard, there is also a need to add effort.

D. Correcting Wrong Ideas Society in general has wrong ideas about exchanges and brokers because they do not understand them properly. For example, they regard the exchange as a purely speculative place, as a wealth-making institution, and the brokers as the initiators of market speculation, as rumor-mongers, etc. Various rumors gradually become public opinion. It is necessary for the exchange authorities and brokers to work hard to show the facts, I am afraid that it will not be enough to correct this deep-rooted misunderstanding for a while. This requires special effort, and it is even more urgent. (End)

### Establishing an Investment Market - A Talk by Supervisor Wang

[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter interviewed Wang Aotang, the supervisor sent by the Ministry of Finance to the Stock Exchange yesterday. He stated that he was appointed as the supervisor of the Stock Exchange by the Ministry's order last Saturday. However, because the supervision laws and regulations and the regulations on responsibilities have not yet been formally promulgated, it is inconvenient to make unfounded statements. However, he firmly believes that the government must have a minimum expectation for the Stock Exchange, that is, to hope that the Stock Exchange can become an investment market, not a speculative market, so as to establish a sound capital market and guide social funds into the right path. The personnel who are in charge of the Stock Exchange this time are all carefully selected. They should be able to use their strengths to serve the industrial and commercial circles wholeheartedly.

Tea Market is Strong

B.P.P. The Indian traders are not hesitant to seek good prices for the fine Taiwanese red tea, but due to the long depletion of stock, the industry has contacted the producing area to inquire about the situation to purchase. For other colors, exporters are still keen due to the imminent shipping schedule. The production of Bai Lin new red tea has stopped in the producing area, so the idea of hoarding and speculation has doubled. The closing price has reached a new high. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, the Taibei shops and the Suzhou and Wuxi areas are still continuously buying.

### New Xian Rice Arrived in Large Quantities, Oil Market Supply is Weak

The rice market's digestion turned sluggish. The market sentiment was still firm in the early market. A considerable amount of new Xian rice arrived. More than 10,000 stones were registered in the north and south markets. Sellers competed to sell. Du Xian rice fell sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and Anjian rice also fell slightly by 1,000 yuan. The new Japonica rice was nominally firm but secretly sluggish. High-quality Bai Yuan rice was still stable, but there were few buyers in Zhongguan. Transactions were quite rare. The new Yin Yuan rice continued to arrive sporadically, forming a situation of rising and then falling. Old Japonica rice has dropped, and new rice is mainly traded. The flour shop's digestion was weak, and it rebounded by 300 to 400 yuan. Bran was continuously connected to the countryside for digestion, and the price rose step by step, rising by another 100 to 200 yuan. Buyers from Nanyang, Fujian, Ningbo, Shantou, and Xiamen eagerly purchased wheat, but the source was not large, and the price rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. It was still strong, but the sales of white wheat were normal because the north was not moving. The high-quality soybeans in Shantou were slightly picked up, but the second-grade and lower-grade soybeans arrived in large quantities. The digestion was light, forming a situation of high prices and sluggish sales. Both the arrival and sales of broad beans were weak. The high-quality goods were firm, but the medium and low-quality goods were flat. The price of corn in Qingdao did not move. Groundnuts were once again inquired about in Nanyang, and the price rebounded by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The oil market's supply was in short supply, and the shops were active, rising by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan step by step.

### Allocation of Applied Amounts in Full; Yesterday's Yarn Allocation Maintains Original Price; Spot Market for Loans Rises Again by 100,000 Yesterday; Cotton Fabric Sales Revive, but Leading Brands Remain Sluggish

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Mill Joint Sales Committee held its sixth committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. All committee members attended and immediately resolved: to open sales of 2.763 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn at the standard amount, with full allocation according to application amounts. The selling price is set at 1.3 million yuan per piece, based on the standard of 400 pounds of Shuang Ma (Double Horse) 20-count yarn, maintaining the same original allocation price as the previous time. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the next sales opening date is rescheduled to the 13th.

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to rise. Both coarse and fine yarns surged upwards. The spot price of 20-count yarn rose by 35,000 yuan. Shuang Ma (Double Horse) yarn returned to the 1.6 million yuan mark, with the final transaction at 1.62 million yuan. Market sentiment was bullish. Sales of 20-count miscellaneous brands and 16-count yarn were exceptionally smooth. Because the Jian Yu (Construction?) mill had not allocated 42-count yarn, the inventory of the same types of goods among dealers was extremely scarce, leading customers and fabric mills in need to raise prices in search of supply. Prices rose gradually from 2.32 million to 2.4 million yuan, an increase of over 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 31-count Yin Yue (Silver Moon) yarn was being collected by Guang Bang (Guangdong dealers), and the price rose back to 1.7 million yuan. Overall, transactions in the market were based on spot goods, indicating genuine sales. As a result, no one paid attention to the warehouse receipts for forward goods allocated by the mills.

Furthermore, yesterday the market speculated that the China Textile Mills (Zhong Fang) had been opening goods with skipped allocations, while yarn shops had not received a single package in two weeks. Yarn shops generally believed that there was little hope for yesterday's allocation, so market sentiment was uniformly optimistic. Additionally, various dealers had a strong appetite. If Shen Fang (Shanghai Textile Mill) were to loosen credit, the price of goods would definitely approach the opening price. As for the fabric market, due to Zhong Fang not fully allocating twice recently, and the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, both long and short positions had been squared. The Jin Lian Miao Wu (Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance) fabrics that arrived the day before were prepared for filling in. Later, the Hankou dealers raised prices to collect them, with a price difference of 4,250 yuan. Sellers slightly sold off, and then the price rose to 5,000 yuan. Many were collecting. Because of sluggish sales, the leading brand (Long Tou) showed no improvement, and the price remained at 64,000 yuan. Wu Fu (Five Blessings) increased by 5,500 yuan. According to sources close to He Dao (Hedo) Trading, the market price of cloth, before the foreign exchange adjustment, could be sold for 2.600 NT dollars. At an exchange rate of 27 yuan, this equaled 70,200 legal currency. Now, after the adjustment, the market price in that area has fallen to 2,000 yuan. Although the exchange rate has improved, the legal currency is more than 3,000 yuan higher. However, based on the price level in Shanghai, there is no profit to be made.

### Artificial Silk Slightly Lower

Artificial silk opened this morning at 2.75 million yuan for 120-count Tian Qiao (Sky Bridge) Guang (Bright) brand, but due to a lack of buyers, it declined. In the end, it closed at 680,000 yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan compared to last weekend. In the afternoon, sellers were asking 700,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Miscellaneous Guang (Bright) brands were down 50,000 yuan, while semi-bright and other brands remained unchanged. Transactions were very rare. Although factory dealers had few transactions, due to loose credit, there was no shortage of buyers inquiring. Yesterday's prices were all raised. High uniformity was raised by about 100,000 yuan. A few packages of ordinary five-dan goods were transacted at a price of 2.4 million yuan, an increase of about 150,000 yuan compared to last week. Dried goods also saw a price increase of 50,000 yuan. The overall trend for goods remained stable. However, Hua Jin (China Brocade) crepe was down 50 yuan due to abundant spot goods.

### China Trust to Purchase Raw Silk Starting Today

Regarding the government's purchase of raw silk, it has been decided to implement it starting today. The Central Trust Bureau will purchase the silk, initially calculating based on the "kou" (口) grade, paying 3.8 million yuan per dan (担). It will be handed over to the Central Bank, which will deduct the amount owed by the factory from the loan. Half of the remaining amount will be deducted as a 30% advance for autumn cocoon loans, and the other half will be returned to the manufacturers. It is reported that the first batch of raw silk to be purchased is about 4,000 dan. Subsequent purchases will be settled as they arrive.

Coal Allocation for Silk Mills to Continue

In order to solve the fuel difficulties of member factories in the silk reeling industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the Third District Silk Filature Trade Association requested an allocation of coal from the Fuel Committee. After several rounds of negotiations, the Fuel Committee approved an allocation of 1,700 tons of coal, which will be distributed by the trade association according to the amount of spring cocoons reeled. The price is 99,000 yuan per ton. The allocation will be made this week, ensuring that silk mills will not lack fuel for reeling after purchasing autumn cocoons.

### American Lumber Arrives in Shanghai; Totaling Over 4 Million Feet

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fortune Shipping Company's manager announced that the ship "Cecil H. Holmes" arrived from Houston and Seattle carrying 2 million feet of lumber, and 32,000 boxes of relief milk powder. In addition, the company's "Demmanmenf Hentuo" also carried 2 million feet of lumber, and 2,023,000 feet of lumber. This was Jiaoji (Jiaozhou-Jinan) lumber. The ship first went to Qingdao to unload before sailing to Shanghai, and it is expected to arrive today.

### Bituminous Coal and Hongji Dust Sales Gradually Become Active

The white coal market remains firm and popular, with prices steadily at a high peak. Sales of various bituminous coal grades are gradually becoming active. According to statistics from the Coal Business Joint Sales Office, only over 8,000 tons were allocated last month, while this month, the daily allocation has been in the range of 500 to 600 tons. The main raw material for briquettes, the Economic Ministry's Fuel Committee, reduced the allocation price by 10,000 yuan this month. As a result, various briquette factories have increased the coal content or reduced the selling price. Due to the impact of foreign exchange adjustments, the selling price of various liquid fuels has increased, causing more users to adopt briquettes. Therefore, various briquette factories are actively applying to the Fuel Committee for the allocation of Hongji dust (Hongji mining coal dust).

### Gold Price Rises Slightly, US Dollar Falls Slightly; Market is Full of Stability

The ingot market was also very stable yesterday. It suffered a slight setback due to pressure from the Central Bank, but market sentiment remained stable and sustainable. It opened at 2.125 million in the morning, and then there was pressure. It gradually declined from 2.13 million, retreating to 2.105 million before stabilizing and slightly rising. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 81 bars at a price of 2.12 million. After that, it returned to stability. Credit was stable, and market sentiment was optimistic. At noon, it stood at around 2.13 million. In the afternoon, next-day delivery continued to rise to above 2.05 million. The Central Bank continued to respond before it slightly leveled off. As a result, it was 34,000 better than last Saturday. Ornamental gold also rose to 22,900. Sycee silver was flat, and silver dollars rose slightly. Black market interest rates ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 jiao (角).

Foreign currencies were calm, and the situation showed signs of exhaustion. US dollars opened at 3,450 yuan for sale in the morning, retreating to 3,420 yuan. After that, it consistently hovered around 3,430 yuan, with no significant change. In the afternoon, the gold market showed much encouragement, advancing to 3,450 yuan. As a result, it was slightly down 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Hong Kong dollars once fell to 680 yuan in the middle of the day, then rose to over 700 yuan. As a result, it was 5 yuan lower than last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was similar. Indian exchange rate was 825 yuan to 835 yuan. In the afternoon, there were buyers but no sellers. The British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan to 11,500 yuan. The US exchange rate still stood around the posted rate.

### This Year's Mid-Autumn Festival

— Written by Our Reporter Ping Qi, Photography by Chuang Shuo

This year's Mid-Autumn Festival is quite different from previous years.

First, the weather is exceptionally hot. Tonight, there must be many Shanghai residents sleeping on sidewalks, who need only turn slightly to look up at the bright moon.

Second, what deserves special mention is that Guanshengyuan mooncakes actually sold out yesterday afternoon, with many customers lining up to wait. This sight has probably not been seen in many years. No matter what everyone says about the decline in people's livelihoods, the purchasing power this year is indeed somewhat higher than in previous years.

Third, we may record a few prices: Rice, 60,000 yuan per dan (担); the largest mooncake, 500,000 yuan; ordinary "luo pen huo" (落盆貨, common breed) crickets, 20,000 yuan each, exactly the same as the price of a dinner at the International Hotel's 14th floor, but in addition to this 20,000 yuan meal fee, a 30% donation is required.

Fourth, before last year, Shanghai did not have jeeps or the so-called "atomic tigers."

However, this year's Mid-Autumn Festival is still not different from previous years. War fires are everywhere, and cries of sorrow are heard all around, no better than before. When "looking down and thinking of home," just like in previous years, the heart is still heavy!

Social Services

### "Anonymous" Gentleman Donates a Large Sum and Proposes Launching an Emergency Loan Fund Campaign

This Column Expresses Strong Support, but Sufficient Funds Must Be Raised in Advance

To the Esteemed Editors: Your newspaper has spared no effort in advocating for social services, which is truly touching for all in Shanghai! Recently, it has often been heard that there are emergency cases requiring immediate surgery, but due to being sent to the hospital late at night, patients are unable to pay in cash, which often delays treatment and even leads to death. I feel extremely regretful about this! I am sending 2 million legal currency, requesting your newspaper to handle a temporary guarantee method to avoid delaying emergency treatment. (1) For emergency cases sent to the hospital for surgery, etc., where cash cannot be paid late at night, this fund will serve as a guarantee; (2) Please have your newspaper preside over all methods, such as how to notify the hospital, how to quickly contact the guarantee, etc.; (3) If 2 million yuan is not enough, please notify "Anonymous" in your newspaper's social services column, and I will immediately send more; (4) The trial period is tentatively set for three months. In short, I sincerely hope that you will approve the trial operation. With respectful regards for your well-being in the summer heat. "Respectfully submitted by Anonymous"

(Editor's Note) After receiving the letter and donation from "Anonymous," this newspaper believes that the intention is good and worthy of advocacy. Recently, there have been facts of patients losing their lives because their families could not pay in cash. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to plan ahead and find ways to remedy this situation. The colleagues in this column have discussed this matter and all agree that in a large city like Shanghai, emergency cases are often heard of. If we follow the proposal of "Anonymous," it would not be easy to cope without a fund of 20 million yuan. Therefore, it has been decided to first disclose the original letter, hoping that "Anonymous" will continue to solicit donations, and that enthusiastic readers will contribute within their means. If a substantial amount can be raised within a week, we will immediately formulate regulations and proceed with the matter as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will return this amount to the original donor or transfer it to another donation. As the ancients said, "Although it may not have a beginning, it can have an end." It is better to be cautious from the start than to continue halfway without sufficient strength. We believe that "Anonymous" and the readers will understand this. (The Editor)

### Recruiting English Teachers

The World's Chinese Students' Association, located at No. 191, Zhongzheng North Second Road in this city, has been entrusted by a certain school to recruit several English teachers who are qualified to teach English at the junior and senior high school levels. Those who are interested in applying should immediately submit their resumes in person to the association for an interview.

### High School and College Students: Trachoma Goes Unnoticed; Examination Will Reveal It

Mr. Editor: I am a student who has trachoma, but I did not know it beforehand. Recently, due to taking the college entrance examination, I learned that I had trachoma after a physical examination by the school. Today, I received a letter from the school stating, "You should cure it yourself before the start of school, and then come to the school doctor's office for re-examination to be eligible to register and enroll." After receiving this letter, I felt very distressed because it is difficult to get into college this year. Wouldn't it be a great pity if I were rejected because of trachoma? I know that your newspaper's social services column has a charitable initiative to provide free treatment for trachoma for students, and I admire your newspaper's spirit of serving society. Unfortunately, the registration date has passed. If you, sir, can forgive my plight and allow me to register for treatment again, I would be endlessly grateful. With respectful regards for your well-being, Yours sincerely, Wu Houxing

Registration for trachoma prevention and treatment has already been closed after reaching the quota. Considering the special circumstances of this student, we have obtained the consent of Director Wang of the Relief Hospital to grant a special accommodation. Please come to the clinic for an interview as soon as possible.

### Colleagues at Lian Shang Bank Save Mooncake Money to Help Those in Need

Dear Editor: Our colleagues at the bank have saved a small amount of money from mooncake expenses, totaling 100,000 yuan, and would like to donate it to the loan fund for the lonely, widowed, poor, and sick. Although we are small merchants with a meager income, more than a dozen of us at the bank are all like brothers, and at the same time, we think that each of us is a cell of society and should not only work hard to solve our own food and clothing, but also think with a loving heart. If everyone can think of the greater good, not be selfish, and walk on the path of loving others as ourselves, we believe that everything can be solved. This is our hope.

### Repercussions of the Land Reform Theory

On August 28th, I expressed dissatisfaction with the land reform article advocated by the Land Administration Society. Now, I will briefly state my reasons as follows:

(1) The original text stated that after land reform, the majority of farmers can achieve a life of peace and happiness, as if the inability of farmers to live in peace and happiness is entirely caused by landlords. This is truly unjust! Facts tell us that the inability of farmers to live in peace and happiness is actually due to the following reasons: (1) inflation, (2) soaring prices, (3) social unrest, (4) heavy taxes, and (5) high-interest loans in rural areas. To be honest, the living conditions of good landlords in recent years are not much different from those of farmers (in the occupied areas, the plight of loyal landlords is beyond description). The truly comfortable people are corrupt officials, profiteers, and district and bao chiefs. Now, the Land Administration Society, disregarding the actual situation, pushes the inability of farmers to live in peace and happiness onto the heads of good landlords. Isn't this extremely unfair?

(2) The value of bonds is not as good as before. The one-to-one redemption of government bonds is clear evidence. Now, collecting land with land bonds is just a nice name, better than nothing, but in reality, what difference does it have from confiscation? Even traitors who collude with the enemy are allowed to keep some living expenses and are given preferential treatment. But now, we want to deprive the source of livelihood of good landlords who have been oppressed by the enemy and have not made war fortunes or victory fortunes. There is nothing more unfair than this!

(3) The system of perpetual tenancy rights and the regulations on 25% rent reduction already provide great benefits to farmers. If taxes can be reduced, the value of money stabilized, and high-interest loans abolished, then the peaceful and happy life of farmers can be expected in the near future. Why make things difficult for small landlords?

In short, in this era of declining morality, it is better to do less than more. We will only give intermediaries an opportunity to make money, and law-abiding small landlords can only sit and wait for death. How can we achieve social stability in this situation? I hope that our wise authorities will deeply understand the hardships of the people, and then our people will surely be grateful to the end. (Xu Bai)

The Cry of Refugees from Taixing

Dear Editor: The relief flour that the poor people of Taixing have been longing for has been delayed for months before it can be transported to Taixing. The first batch of flour issued was only four catties for large families and two catties for small families, which is not enough for the poor to eat for a day. Such relief is truly a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem! If the poor people have to rely on relief flour as their staple food, the people must die in large numbers! What is most strange is that wealthy families have received many bags of flour, while most of the poor have not received any flour at all! Now, it is reported that the second batch of flour has arrived, and it is said that only two catties will be issued per person. Talking about relief in Taixing is truly tragic! The government and local authorities urgently distributed a total of 70 million legal currency in disaster relief funds for the two phases of the war disaster. According to a public notice published by the Relief Association, more than 15 million yuan in relief funds have been issued. How the rest of the funds will be distributed is still unknown.

Public Water Taps Have Been Opened

August 30th Your newspaper's readers' opinions column published a section where citizens Zhao Yongnian and others requested the installation of public water taps on Meijia Bridge Lane, Zhuan Anbang, East Jiangsu Road. The water pipes laid in the Jiangsu Road area have small diameters, resulting in insufficient water pressure and difficulty in water output. If more taps are installed, it will inevitably affect the taps in the vicinity. Therefore, it is currently difficult to install taps in that area. However, in order to take care of the drinking water of the poor, our bureau has now notified the Shanghai Waterworks Company to open the fire hydrants at (1) Zhuan Anbang, East Jiangsu Road, (2) Zhongzheng West Road (between Dihua Road and Jiangsu Road), and (3) near Magu Village, Jing'an Temple Road free of charge to meet the urgent need. Please publish this notice to the Shen Bao newspaper office. (Municipal Public Works Bureau)

Women and Family

### The Various Aspects of Love

— Yan Juan

(1) The Importance of Love

If there is no love in human life, it is like removing green from nature, which spoils the scenery so much. In human society, if love is dried up, it is like skeletons dressed in clothes, like packs of jackals and tigers. Therefore, love gives warmth and color to life.

Love can be roughly divided into romantic love, maternal love, and friendship. The promotion and brilliance of these loves make human life unfold a colorful picture. Therefore, poets sing of it, and all of humanity praises it in various languages. I dare not make a comprehensive discussion of this profound and complex issue of love. I will only contribute some opinions from a physiological perspective.

(2) Sexual Love and the Cult of Romantic Love

The instinct of sexual desire brings the opposite sexes closer together. Initially, it is a vague yearning for the opposite sex, gradually entering into admiration and finally romantic love.

Choosing a unique object based on an ideal is the spiritual prerogative of mankind. Animals do not have this choice; as long as it is the opposite sex, it is their object. Human love adds a beautiful spiritual function to the sexual desire aspect, so romantic love can also be divided into many kinds. Some fall into pathological perversion, some are close to licentious games, and pure love is really a necessary thing for reproduction. It can make mankind move upward. However, perverted love and playful love are enough to harm mankind.

Those who believe in the cult of romantic love are really the ultimate in spiritual games. They believe that nothing in the human world is more noble or supreme than romantic love. This is really a wrong concept. Pure romantic love is indeed worthy of respect, but to think that it is supreme and indulge in it is completely a game of pursuing pleasure. In any case, we must not forget the eternal life, that is, the prosperity of the race.

(3) Maternal Love and Other Loves

Whether mothers or fathers, there is no one who does not love their children. The love of parents for their children is generally called maternal love. Maternal love is different from romantic love, but it also originates from the instinct to preserve the race.

Maternal love is purer than romantic love. Romantic love is mixed with competition and vanity, but maternal love does not have this ingredient. The extension of maternal love is like a grandmother's love for her grandson, and the love and affection of the family. The idealization of maternal love cultivates the spirit of loving the hometown, loving the country, and universal love.

Instinctive love, such as romantic love and maternal love, as long as it is pure, cannot be swayed by interests, reputation, status, etc. However, the romantic love of people in general now is often mixed with the above-mentioned ingredients, and playful love is not uncommon. Therefore, we really cannot agree with the above-mentioned cult of romantic love.

(4) Romantic Love and Marriage

It is very natural for people who love each other to want to be close to each other and live together forever. Therefore, romantic love and marriage are the greatest happiness of mankind. However, the highest point of romantic love is before marriage, and cracks often occur in romantic love after marriage. What is the reason for this?

Because the keynote of romantic love is the instinctive attraction of the opposite sex, and other aspects are accompanied by psychological and emotional problems. Therefore, if pure love is lacking, all kinds of cracks will occur in the emotions after sexual desire dissipates.

The union between husband and wife must be due to pure and innocent love.

(5) Creation of Marital Love

Since husband and wife are combined because of pure love, they must strictly abide by the monogamous system. However, some people say that pure love is indeed an ideal thing, but humans may not all be able to walk the path of idealism. Moreover, from the perspective of sexual desire, men's sexual desire often has a tendency to shift, from A to B, from B to C. In terms of this tendency, the monogamous system is unnatural.

But this argument is wrong. The dignity of mankind lies in having the spirit to restrain the unrestrained nature of instinct. If mankind is left to its own devices, what is the difference between it and other animals?

Therefore, husband and wife must maintain a monogamous system and constantly create pure love for each other.

### Stain Removal Methods

— Jiang Wu

(1) Blue Ink Stains First wash with a warm solution of sodium carbonate (one to fifty), then soak in a warm solution of tartaric acid (one to fifty) for a few minutes, and then wash with clean water. The stain will disappear.

(2) Sweat Stains These can be removed by washing with a dilute solution of ammonia water (one to one thousand).

(3) Fruit Juice and Wine Stains First wash with borax water (one to two hundred), and then wash with clean water.

(4) Soy Sauce Stains Wash away immediately with soapy water before it dries. If it has been a day or longer, you can first apply a solution of potassium permanganate and then wash it off with clean water.

(5) Acid Stains You can use a dilute solution of ammonia to apply to the stain, neutralize the acidity, and then wash it off with clean water.

### A Model Children's Newspaper

— Sincerely

Newspapers are the spiritual food of the people, tools for educating the public, and vanguards for transforming society. The same is true of children's newspapers. They not only increase children's knowledge, train their minds, and guide them forward, but also inspire their thinking, encourage their aspirations, and even lay the foundation for their future character. Therefore, the relationship and influence of children's newspapers on children are even greater than the relationship and influence of larger newspapers on adults.

Since children's newspapers bear such a significant mission and have such remarkable effects, how should those who run children's newspapers collect manuscripts, organize, edit, arrange, print, so that it becomes a model children's newspaper?

To date, there is no decent children's newspaper in China. However, according to the results of research and discussion among several friends who care about children's newspapers, several identical rules have been produced. Now they are disclosed here for the reference of colleagues in the education field and for joint research:

Format: The format is like a newspaper, making it easy to read. The area does not exceed quarto size, making it easy to fold and unfold. The layout is not rigid, and it is divided into four pages or ten columns according to the nature, so that the mood is lively and systematic. Using No. 5 lead type makes the characters large and pleasing to the eye. The space between the two lines is slightly empty, so that they are not crowded together, creating a sense of fear. Use more head flowers and small pictures to increase the attraction of the articles. The paper must be clean and white, and the ink must be thick and obvious, so as not to harm eyesight. The newspaper header is simple and generous with color printing to enhance children's love of newspapers and collect more effects.

Content: Current events 12%, children's news 4%, guidance 5%, children's services 2%, riddles 2%, poetry 3%, jokes 3%, stories 8%, pictures 10%, intelligence tests 3%, travelogues 5%, scripts 4%, scientific knowledge 8%, biographies of celebrities 5%, selected texts 4%, manual labor 3%, games 3%, local descriptions 4%, historical facts of the War of Resistance 4%, children's creations 8%. (This proportion is applicable within three years)

Writing: The articles should be short, concise, simple and clear, with more facts and less empty talk and theory. The sentences should not be verbose and lengthy, and the words should be popular, with strokes that are not complex but not unfamiliar, so that children can read without much difficulty. News about current events should be described in a child's tone, but there must be absolutely no misspellings, typos, omissions, or ungrammatical errors.

Judging from the current economic situation in China, the affordability of parents and children, and the amount of children's need for children's newspapers, such children's newspapers will definitely be welcomed by elementary school children in grades 4 to 6, and they can also be of practical benefit to them.

### How to Use a Thermometer

— Deling

In modern families, in addition to the daily necessities such as medicines: absorbent cotton, gauze, mercurochrome, etc., a thermometer for checking body temperature—referred to as a thermometer—is indispensable. It can tell the temperature of the human body, whether the body is healthy and normal. Although you can also touch the temples or palms of your hands to measure whether the human body has fever or cold, this is unreliable, because sometimes your hands have just come out of hot or cold water, either hot or cold, and are not as accurate as a thermometer. The normal body temperature of a healthy person, regardless of gender, age, or size, is certain, usually between 36 degrees-37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). There is a slight change during the day, slightly lower at night and slightly higher during the day, but the difference is less than one degree. If the body temperature is below 36 degrees or above 37 degrees, it is a sign of illness.

In addition to the type used in the mouth, there is also a type used in the anus for thermometers, which is suitable for children. The function of measuring body temperature is the same. On weekdays, you can often check your body temperature to know whether the human body is healthy or not. When sick, check once every three hours, record it, and use it for the doctor's reference to understand the changes in the disease, so that the doctor can prescribe the right medicine and recover as soon as possible.

If unfortunately a member of the family gets sick, you can infer which disease he has from his body temperature record. If the fever does not subside for three or four days and is often around 38 degrees Celsius, it belongs to the typhoid fever category. If the body temperature is as high as 39 degrees Celsius, there is little fluctuation, and the nostrils flicker, it belongs to pneumonia and other diseases... The patient's body temperature is checked every three hours. After three checks, if it is normal at 37 degrees Celsius, there is generally no major problem, and the illness will soon recover. Pay attention to diet and there is no need to bother with medical treatment anymore. However, after each use of the thermometer, it should be wiped with alcohol-soaked cotton to disinfect it to prevent the spread of germs.

### Family Entertainment

— Zhuang Wenzhi

We want to make the family happier, so that every member of the family can reduce psychological pain and increase mental activity due to happiness, so as to make the body healthy. Only entertainment can achieve this purpose. However, in Chinese society, most of the common forms of entertainment are improper, and most of the entertainment of people in Europe and the United States is too noble and not allowed by our environment; therefore, we adopt a compromise method, regardless of Chinese or Western, and write down the proper and achievable ones below:

1.  Calligraphy and painting: Spend some spare time every day writing and painting, or appreciating famous Chinese and foreign calligraphy and paintings, which is indeed the most noble entertainment.

2.  Music: Music can clear people's minds. For example, , flute, erhu, harmonica, harmonium, accordion, etc., choose one to learn according to your preferences.

3.  Singing: Learn Chinese and Western singing, choose according to your preferences. Once you get started, the fun is endless.

4.  Chess: There are many kinds of chess. Play a game of your favorite every day, which will be beneficial to your body and mind, but don't waste too much time.

5.  Stamp collecting: Collecting Chinese and foreign stamps, classifying them and pasting them in a book is also a kind of family entertainment.

6.  Photography: When traveling, prepare a camera to capture ancient sites, portraits, landscapes, etc., which is also a pleasure.

7.  Antiques: All ancient objects can be called antiques, and scholars and elegant people like to collect them.

8.  Gatherings: The whole family, or invited friends, can talk, laugh, and tell stories, which can all be refreshing.

9.  Reading: Reading morning and evening newspapers, new and old novels, or biographies of celebrities, reading for a while every day, there is really unexpected fun.

10. Watching dramas: Shanghai has all kinds of theaters, and we can spend a little money to appreciate them, which can always increase our knowledge.

11. Ice skating: Ice skating has been popular on the sea recently. The way to play is not difficult, the cost is not much, and it is also very beneficial to the body.

12. Ball games: It is advisable to choose ball games that are not intense, such as net ball, billiards, badminton, golf, etc., which are all very suitable.

13. Chinese martial arts: Chinese martial arts are China's inherent technology, and can be practiced indoors, in open spaces, or in parks.

14. Gardening: It is best to have a garden at home. If not, you can put some potted flowers on the balcony or desk to decorate it.

15. Birds and animals: Raising cats, dogs, black carp, rabbits, and geese to play with is also a good way to pass the time.

16. Horse riding: Spend some money to rent a horse and gallop in the suburbs is also very good.

17. Driving: Drive a bicycle, motorcycle, or car and take a breeze on the road at sunset, which is also good.

18. Hiking: Hiking is indeed the happiest thing in life. If you don't have many days off, you might as well visit several nearby public countries.

19. Dancing: Although dancing in Shanghai is not a proper form of entertainment, if you are not addicted to it, it is not unpractical for couples to act on the scene occasionally.

20. Radio: Turn on the radio or listen to the phonograph, but it is advisable to choose noble ones to listen to, which is not necessarily a beneficial pastime.

Spring and Autumn

### Monk Shitao

— Wen Zhaotong

The tip of the brush knows no Chan master,
The silent illumination approaches nature.
I only feel the moist vitality dripping,
I don't know if it's ink or cloud and mist?

The author Ju Chao, who is known as one of the four great painting monks of the early Qing Dynasty, the author of "Tonight's Inscription on a Painting Quatrain," used such a poem to praise this unparalleled talented artist, and put this poem at the very beginning. We can know the author's utmost admiration, and even shook the supreme position of the four Wang Wu Yun, which we have to admire Ju Chao's unique insights.

Although Shitao's paintings can be included in a system of the Southern School, they are completely different from the style of the four Wang Wu Yun at that time. Shitao created unrestrainedly, while the six masters of the early Qing Dynasty simply regulated the Song and Yuan dynasties and inherited traditional techniques in a regular manner. Wang Taichang and his grandson also admitted that they were not as good as him. Yan Ke said: "South of the Yangtze River, no one can surpass Master Shi on the right." Lu said: "South of the Yangtze River, Shitao should be ranked first. I and Shigu are not as good as him."

What is his art like? Zhang Pushan's "Continued Records of Paintings" said: ""He also paints landscapes, orchids and bamboos, with unrestrained brushstrokes, shedding the clichés of painters. Duke Wu Wensu said: Master Shi's paintings look down on ancient and modern times, and the rules are overflowing."

"Records of the Yangzhou Painting Academy" said: He is skilled in landscapes, flowers and plants, and can wield them at will, with clouds and air bursting out.

Qin Zuyong's "Discussion on Painting in the Shade of Tung Trees" praised him as a "divine product," commenting: "The old man Qingxiang Daoji has unrestrained brushstrokes, shedding the clichés of painters, and is comparable to Master Shixi. Shixi is calm and happy, winning with strictness, while Shitao is unrestrained and unrestrained, winning with boldness." He also said: Landscapes become a school of their own, with elegant brushstrokes and extraordinary ideas. Every time he makes a painting, he combines with the ancients. The depth of his skills cannot be achieved without a deep understanding of the various masters of the Tang and Yuan dynasties. Bamboos, rocks, orchids, and chrysanthemums are all extremely wonderful."

What kind of person was Monk Shitao? From the above books, we can find simple records of "the descendants of Chu Pan of the former Ming Dynasty" and "the descendants of the Chu Fan of the Sheng Kingdom," that is, the descendants of the Ming Dynasty. Although his birth and death dates have not been determined for a while, judging from his: "In the winter of Xinwei, Mr. Zhang Ruzuo was invited in the snow, and talented people and heroes crowded the seats for a while. The first sentence of the poem "Half a Lifetime in the North and South, Old Wind and Dust" shows that that year was the fourth year of Chongzhen (1631). He should have been in his thirties or forties, that is, a chaotic world figure born in the late Ming Dynasty and early Qing Dynasty. He was unwilling to see the turmoil of his homeland and the autocratic rule of the Manchu foreign race, but he was also a weak person who was unable to resist. Escaping reality was the best way out. This is the consistent style of the Chinese petty bourgeoisie. The reason why his painting style is different from the four Wang Wu Yun is that he showed a strong non-cooperation attitude with the Manchu Qing government and expressed his revolutionary spirit.

Shaving his hair and becoming a monk in Huangshan seems to be a thorough way to escape reality. Although his non-cooperation and revolutionary spirit are expressed in the unrestrainedness of his paintings, they are still passive. Therefore, his fatalistic thoughts and outlook on life constitute the same passive and evasive tendency in his expression of being a monk and artistic style, which is revealed in the following many poems, such as:

"...Heavenly immortals come to earth, truly talented and outstanding, my lord's heart is able to surpass the group, you regard wealth as floating clouds, playing in the air and selling tombs. He loves guests and is willing to offer a thousand days of wine, his romantic spirit overwhelms the gates of the five marquises, fishermen from all over the world guide him together, and he returns as a long-term prince. Life is fleeting and equal, let's follow the drunken pleasure and look around..."... Previously quoted "In the winter of Xinwei, Zhang Ruzuo..."

"Strange peaks in the open ground are level to the top, the listening pavilion is subject to the spring breeze, white clouds are inherently ruthless objects, and they drift in my withered heart. The wind is urgent and the tide is wide, and the waves hit the head. The fishing boat is small and it is difficult to collect the interest. Please take off your black gauze hat and wait for the moon to rise on the silk wheel before reorganizing the tour." - "Inscription on a Painting".

"Sitting quietly under the forest, watching the clouds and listening to the water, I spend my days leisurely, enjoying a volume of green mountains." - "Inscription on a Painting".

Shitao saw the chaos and ugliness of reality. He thought of reforming, but he was already a monk traveling around the world, so he could only vent his anger through poetry and painting, so he wrote: "In the third month of Renwu spring, the Begonias under the Dadi Hall are enchanting, playfully writing and imitating the posthumous meaning of Huang."

"Thousands of flowers are dyed red, stop drinking and hate the east wind, the thin cold is still sad for the flowers, not to mention the magpies in the opening."

The enchantment of Begonias probably represents the reality at that time. He wanted to change, but he was very timid, and only had the courage to apply a little powder to the color. Let's look at the poem "Retitled the next day":

"Begonia asks Chun Gui on the school, unexpectedly the spring breeze is full of snow on the branches, it should be because of the red makeup and great enchantment, so apply a little powder to put on rouge."

Renwu was the fifteenth year of Chongzhen (1642), which was when the Ming Dynasty was about to perish. The world was in chaos, so of course he would have such resentment.

Shitao lived an isolated life in contradictory thinking, and he never wanted to find an accurate way out, but this way out was only developed intricately in his painting theory. Here, the poem "Title Spring River Picture" is used as proof:

"Calligraphy and painting are not small things, the world only looks at the form, the pen is chaotic, and intelligence dies when entering clumsiness, the principle is exhausted and the law is endless, and the law is exhausted and the principle is born, the principle and law have no transmission, and the ancients have no choice. ..."

In this poem, "principle" and "law" only become dialectical development, but when "principle" is born, there is no courage to make it develop further, and finally it stagnates in the category of fatalism.

Therefore, everyone believes that "Bitter Gourd Monk's Painting Quotations" "The words and meanings are mysterious, and they all come from the classics." It is doubtful. Because the "One Painting Chapter" of "The method of one painting is to generate law from no law; and to penetrate all laws with law." is nothing more than the same tendency as described above.

### Shitao: Landscape

(Collection of Dafengtang)

### Pond

— Chen Ji

In this remote and barren countryside, there are no rushing rivers; there are only many lovely small ponds.

Standing on the top of a high mountain, looking at this green countryside, the shining ponds are like a handful of stars scattered in the night sky. It's also like someone's eyes in our memory...

The pond is silent, like a philosopher; the pond water is clear, like a philosopher's state of mind. How many changes in the wind and clouds in the sky are seen in his eyes; how many times of washing away the snow and suffering, freezing his body. But the pool is still silent——

So, some people say that the soul of the pool is stiff. The emotion is numb!

But when the warm days come, the pond grows lush reeds around it, emerald-like duckweed; and purple small flowers, white small flowers, golden small flowers, and tender red small flowers swaying on the water. Lively dragonflies and butterflies fly in groups. At night, fireflies carry small lanterns and sit on the tips of the industry, in twos and threes, listening to frogs singing folk songs.

These are the lives that the pond nurtures, the eastern garden that the pond creates, and the flowers and plants are so prosperous! However, the pool is silent, still like a philosopher.

Often some women come to the pool to wash clothes, shepherds come to wash the dirt on their feet, and people take the water from the pool, no, the blood from the pool, to wash themselves clean, but the pool water is made so dirty and turbid! The pool is still silent, and in the silence, it settles the dirty things down, and gradually the pool becomes clean and bright again.

When the drought came, the sun was burning green fire in the fields, the soil was cracking and the rice was weakly falling down, everyone was squeezing against each other, groaning slightly in the hot wind. So the farmers put the mouth of the waterwheel into the pool; only saw a waterwheel on the east side and a waterwheel on the west side, only heard the waterwheel squealing, and the pool water was silent.

The next day, the blood of the pond flowed in the veins of the fields, the soil was moistened, and the rice stood upright in the morning light. But the pool dried up, and the flowers and plants in the east also withered!

Now, this pond, which sacrificed itself and used its blood to save people, has died silently!

Standing on the top of a high mountain, looking at this green countryside, those small ponds are like the lost eyes of someone after death in our memory... We think of his life.

### The Life of a Musician

— Jiahui

Mozart (Wolfgang Amadeus Moazart) was extremely poor. He had no money to buy firewood to warm his simple house. He could only wrap his hands in wool socks to keep warm, and then create sacred music, making his name immortal.

At the age of thirty-five, he died of tuberculosis. His vitality was depleted due to constant hunger, cold, and lack of nutrition.

His poor funeral really only cost three yuan and ten cents. The cheap pine coffin was only followed by six people—even they dispersed due to the rain.

### Lady Wei's "Diagram of Brush Formation"

— Zhou Shushan

Lady Wei of the Jin Dynasty was good at official script and regular script. She was the teacher of Wang Yishao (Xizhi) of the Right Army and also made "Diagram of Brush Formation" which has been passed down to later generations. It can be seen that Lady Wei was good at writing, just like the great writers of the Han Dynasty were good at writing. Lady's name was Shuo, courtesy name Mao Yi, and she was the daughter of Li Ju, the prefect of Ruyin. Therefore, she was also called Lady Li. Her father, Wei , and her brother, Wei Heng, were both good at cursive script and official script. It can be said that her family had a profound academic background.

But Lady's teacher was , and there is a letter from her to her teacher in the post. It also mentioned her disciple Wang Youjun. Her book says: "Recently, I was ordered to write "Rapid Success Chapter", so I could not write to my teacher. But Wei has learned from the world and imitated , so it has been many years. At the age of twenty, I wrote a poem and discussed the general solution of cursive script, but I did not dare to present it. Wei has a disciple named Wang Yishao, who is very able to learn Wei's regular script. He is aggressive, his brushstrokes are exquisite, and his calligraphy is . The teacher can go to the Jin Shang Library to write books. I rely on your high judgment, which is beyond words." Zhang Huai瓘 of the Tang Dynasty said in "Book Breaking": "Lady Wei's official script is especially good at rules. Zhong Gong said: It is like broken jade in a pot of ice, the moon on the Yao Terrace, gentle and fragrant trees, and gentle like a clear wind."

The "Diagram of Brush Formation" made by Lady Wei is to explain the method of writing characters, but Sun Guoting of the Tang Dynasty said in "Book Spectrum"; "The Diagram of Brush Formation has been circulated in the north and south, and it is suspected that it was made by Youjun. Although the truth is not known, it can still enlighten children." Wang Youjun served Lady Wei as his teacher and once wrote "After the Inscription on the Diagram of Brush Formation," which may have led to Sun Guoting's suspicion.

According to Lady's note after the "Diagram of Brush Formation Record," she made it in the fourth year of Yonghe (348 AD), which is nearly 1,600 years ago. The first sentence of this record says: "The mystery of the three ends is none other than using the brush; the mystery of the six arts is none other than the silver hook. In the past, Prime Minister Si of Qin saw the book of King Mu of Zhou, and sighed for seven days, worried that it had no bones; Shangshu Cai entered Hongdu and watched the code, and did not return for ten weeks, lamenting its excellence; therefore, those who know its source are few, and those who are concerned about its principles are many. Since modern times, they have not learned from the ancients, but have abandoned the Tao because of their emotions. They only remember their names, or their learning is not comprehensive, and their knowledge is limited, so that they cannot achieve success and waste their energy in vain. If they are not spiritually enlightened, they cannot be talked about this Tao."

Before this, it also said: "The brush should be made of rabbit hair from the steep cliffs of high mountains, collected in August or September. The brush head should be one inch long, and the shaft should be five inches long. The inkstone should be made of newly mined stone that is dry and smooth, with floating saliva and black ink. The ink should be made of pine soot from Mount Lu and deer glue from Dai County, which is stronger than stone after ten years. The paper should be made of fish roe from Dongyang, which is soft, smooth, and clean. When learning to write characters, first learn to hold the brush. If it is regular script, hold it two inches and one minute from the brush head. If it is cursive script, hold it three inches and one minute from the brush head. When writing, painting waves and curves, you must use all your strength to send it. If you are a beginner, write big characters first, not small ones. Those who are good at appraisal do not write, and those who are good at writing do not appraise. Those who are good at brush strength have more bones, and those who are not good at brush strength have more flesh. Those who have more bones and less flesh are called tendon script, and those who have more flesh and less bones are called ink pig. Those who have more strength and tendons are saints, and those who have no strength and no plate are sick. One or two follow their news and use them." After the picture, it also says: "There are seven ways to hold the brush: some are anxious and hold the brush slowly, and some are slow and hold the brush quickly; if the grip is close but not tight, the heart and hand are not in sync, and the meaning is behind the pen, which leads to failure; if the grip is far and fast, the meaning is ahead of the pen, which leads to victory. There are also six ways to use the brush: the structure is round and complete like seal script, fluttering and scattered like Zhang Cao, fierce and terrifying like eight points, graceful and elegant like flying white, upright and independent like a crane's head, and luxuriant and unrestrained like ancient official script. However, the heart is twisted and each character is made, each resembling its shape, which is ingenious and the way of calligraphy is complete."

As for her disciple Wang Youjun, he said in the inscription: "Paper is the formation, brush is the knife, ink is the helmet, inkstone is the city, heart and mind are the general, skill is the deputy general, structure is the strategy, Yangbi is good and bad, entry and exit are orders, and twists are killing." This is the explanation for why it is called "Diagram of Brush Formation." As for those who doubt that this was not written by Lady Wei, it is nothing more than a kind of traditional prejudice, which need not be repeated.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 28

I introduced myself again, supplementing Little Tiger's meager vocabulary, and introduced Yaoqun and Mr. W as well, of course, adding a few extraordinary words about Little Tiger. At the same time, I had to explain to Yaoqun the "why" of this visit, which was because Tsurumi had said that it was a place where we could talk—because the location had been arranged by him.

"You probably already know why we're so late," I said to Yaoqun, glancing at Little Tiger at the same time. He nodded cleverly with his big round eyes, indicating that he had told Yaoqun everything that had happened on the way. "The reason we had to trouble Mr. W to come here in person is partly because of Gu Jun's idea, partly because of Mr. W's idea, and partly, perhaps more importantly, because of your ambition, knowledge, and ideas, all of which are superior to others..."

"I dare not," he interrupted me crisply, not letting me ramble on. "Both of you are elder statesmen. If you put it that way, we can only feel ashamed as mere children. Gu Jun explained many things in his letter. Tiger and I are now prepared to receive instruction, training, cultivation, and orders." His voice was gentle but with a hint of strength. "Tiger" of course, refers to Little Tiger.

"You're too kind, too kind." Mr. W opened his mouth with a smile; then, he paused and put away his smile; "Mr. Yue just mentioned that we are here partly because of my own intentions; that's right, it was my request to Gu Jun. Because of our bureau's rules, whether someone volunteers or is introduced, anyone who joins our bureau must go through three steps: first, an investigation of the participant; second, testing—of work ability—those with special abilities are of course directly appointed, otherwise they must undergo some considerable training; third, formal appointment..."

"Regarding points one and two, with Gu Jun's introduction and explanation, we don't need to bother with them. So, I came here partly to express our sincerity in seeking talent; in addition, I also want to fulfill the formalities stipulated by our bureau. In any case, before formally joining, we must have a conversation—at a suitable location outside any office of this bureau..."

Assuming you are a writer, or a news agency reporter, or a special correspondent for a newspaper, assuming you have been introduced to Mr. W or an important figure in the Military Intelligence Bureau's counter-espionage organization for an interview, I think, no matter how talented or capable you are, this dedicated visit of yours is bound to fail, or at least be a waste of effort.

You may be able to get some "material" through careful thought and indirect questioning, which is the price of your efforts, but the moment you leave, you are bound to hear a sentence: "Because we are still 'continuing to work,' please do not publish what we just talked about"!

Okay, you admit that you are somewhat disappointed with this trip (if you are not willing to admit failure immediately.) On the way back to the hotel (newspaper office), or on the way home, you must be thinking, "At least I can circle around his residence, his demeanor, his something-something, and add a few of my own feelings, can't I still say it's an interview?"

### Vigilance

— Shao Fu

Yesterday, September 9th, I attended the surrender ceremony of the China Theater held at the Central Military Academy (formerly the Army Headquarters) on Huangpu Road in Nanjing. As a news reporter, I witnessed this historical scene that ended eight years of bloody war.

The layout of the entire venue was overseen by engineering expert General Ma Chongliu, and it was solemn and dignified. The atmosphere that permeated every participant and the inside and outside of the venue was beyond my ability to describe the mixed emotions of sorrow and joy. Everyone's heart was heavy, a little dazed, and a little joyous, but eight years of time, millions of lives, vast territories, and the construction of the future were all flashing in their minds, and everyone became solemn!

The two protagonists of this historical drama were indeed the most distinct contrast, the most appropriate illustration: General He Yingqin, with his graceful demeanor, gentle and refined manner, and amiable demeanor; Okamura Yasutsugu, gloomy and composed, like a wounded beast, superficially submissive, but with a bellyful of stubbornness and unwillingness. To be honest, from the ceremony's beginning at nine o'clock in the morning until fifty-two minutes later, I focused all my energy on observing the actions of these two protagonists.

I only have one thought, a thought that I clearly remember today, a year later, and will always remember, and I am willing to offer it here for everyone's reference.

That thought is: the Japanese nation is not to be underestimated. Although they have now been defeated and surrendered, they are by no means convinced. They are determined to rise again, and they have the confidence to do so. Although we now clearly reside in a victorious country, if we do not put in painstaking efforts in the next ten years, there will never be peace, and we will sink into an irrecoverable abyss.

When celebrating victory, we should understand this point more deeply!

### Talking About Cheating on Exams

— Ling Ren

The trend of students cheating on exams has been prevalent in Shanghai since it became an isolated island. Recently, it can be said to have reached its peak.

Moreover, the methods of cheating are carried out on a large scale, almost a collective action. There is organization, there are institutions, and the methods are extremely "clever." Teachers cannot ban it, cannot catch it, and some simply have no ability to ban it at all, and can only turn a blind eye, hoping that the cheating students will leave a little leeway, "bestow" some face, or not be too rampant.

However, they have reasons, half-true and half-false reasons:

"What can we do? If we don't cheat and our grades are failing, we have to repeat a grade, we have to take remedial classes, where does the money come from?"

"If the exam does not reach the required level, then how can the scholarship for the next semester be approved?" This is the "righteous cause" of cheating.

"What can we do? If I don't cheat, others cheat, and they score better than me."

Oh my God!

Please, education experts, pay attention to these things! Do not think that students with good grades are necessarily more capable. Grades, these false things, are corrupting the students!

### Died So Wonderfully

— Ying Ying

A certain private middle school in this city usually teaches quite strictly. If a graduating student fails one subject, a diploma will not be issued until the student passes a makeup exam. A year ago, the old principal of the school passed away, and soon a new principal was born, along with a new director of education. The old director of education had no choice but to retire. Before leaving, unwilling in his heart, he issued all the diplomas of the graduating students who had failed the exam. The students all raised their hands to their foreheads and said that the old principal died so wonderfully.

### Auction Stories – The Myth of Reality

— Zhong Shi

China is the most magical ancient country, and summer nights are the most suitable for myths. Therefore, in the past few days, under melon sheds and bean trellises, after tea and wine, friends have been idly recounting many incredible stories—or, more accurately, true stories that are stranger than stories.

A small businessman named Mao bought five wooden boxes of glass tubes and other miscellaneous items in a public auction from a wharf warehouse in Yangshupu for 1.8 million yuan. After a few days, he resold them to a machine factory owner and earned 8 million yuan. Unexpectedly, the old owner was a discerning person who unpacked and inspected them and knew that they were valuable chemical factory instruments. Coincidentally, a foreign factory urgently needed them recently and agreed to a price of 300 million yuan. What about the boss? He's not that stupid! He bargained for 500 million yuan.

On another occasion, a used goods dealer obtained 18 boxes of water-damaged goods in an auction for 1.11 million yuan. Upon opening the boxes, he found that they were actually bristles, worth more than 80 million yuan. There was also a Mr. Xu, an iron merchant, who was a friend of a friend. He was also visited by the god of wealth. One day, he wandered around the auction site with several colleagues and bought a few barrels of oil for more than 800,000 yuan. His colleagues opened them and found water, but he was lucky enough to open the barrels and get tung oil, thus inexplicably and effortlessly earning more than 20 million yuan.

China originally had many folk legends such as "Jiangxi people know treasures," but unexpectedly, the real "knowing treasures and getting rich" would happen today. The auction organization lost a fortune in vain, but a few merchants got rich. I don't know if this is their fortune or the misfortune of the country?

### Low Profile

— San Gong

"When Will the Takeover and Investigation Team Return?"

One of the slogans for the September 9th Sports Festival is "Education First, Sports First." This reminds us of the great mission of the "sun-drying platform exercise fields" in some elementary schools today!

Lawyers from the enemy-puppet period have now been allowed to resume appearing in court. This should be a target for suspected traitors to hire defense lawyers, because only these lawyers are the most "understanding" people.

From a sports perspective, some people consider horse racing "normal entertainment," and it also has an income of 300 million to 500 million yuan per month. In addition, the municipal conference has already approved it, so some people speculate that the resumption of horse racing is almost a certainty. Those who are enthusiastic about champagne tickets, why not come?

Chinese people have a "mouth that is good at lecturing," and Americans have "hands that are good at implementing." Therefore, China's export goods have only been preparing for an exhibition for a few months, while American import goods have silently overthrown the five-thousand-year-old history of sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and soybean milk.

The investigation team has gone to Hangzhou. Before leaving, they told reporters: "Less than one-tenth of the cases have been handled in Shanghai." Then what about the remaining nine-tenths? One cannot help but miss "When Will You Return"?

### Request to Mr. Rong Desheng

— Ren Ziguang

Using one-seventh of the Redemption Money to Restore Four Schools in His Hometown

Now the Rong case has become a thing of the past, and the government has returned the 250,000 US dollars in redemption money. According to reports, Mr. Rong intends to use a portion of the money to reward the military police who solved the case, and the remainder will be used for good deeds. However, how to allocate the money is still awaiting Mr. Rong's approval. Will it be used for refugee relief or for education? I believe that refugee relief is certainly important, but education is even more important. Therefore, we absolutely sympathize with Mr. Shao Fu's proposal to establish the "Desheng Scholarship."

However, I have another suggestion for Mr. Rong. Because Mr. Rong has always been very enthusiastic about education, he founded four elementary schools and one middle school near his hometown (Rongxiang, Wuxi) thirty years ago. Over the years, he has cultivated countless talents. In recent years, talents in the industrial and commercial circles have emerged in his hometown, which cannot be said to be unrelated to this. During the Anti-Japanese War, local bandits ran rampant, so these schools were disassociated from the Rong family and barely maintained in a semi-open and semi-closed corrupt state. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, Mr. Ying may be busy restoring his business, so the four elementary schools, except for one middle school, have not yet been taken over. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mr. Rong to set aside one-seventh of the redemption money, totaling 100 million yuan, to restore the four schools. Setting aside 100 million yuan to purchase school property, based on the price of land in Wuxi, can buy 80 mu of land, 20 mu per school, which is enough to maintain them permanently.

I venture to make a plea for my hometown and ask Mr. Rong to resolutely promote education to restore the four schools in my hometown before the war, and then use most of the money to establish the "Desheng Student Loan." If so, it will definitely have infinite value for society and the nation.

### Du Yuming, Who Fought Bravely in the North and South

— Younan

—The First Commander of the National Army's Mechanized Division—

In 1924, "the cradle of the Chinese Army," the Whampoa Military Academy held its first graduation ceremony. In a long list of graduates, one line read: Du Yuming, from Shanxi, currently 21 years old. It was not until more than a decade later that this name shone in China.

Rich Emotion

He has a burly figure and strong physical strength, but he is full of emotion. Whenever he is troubled by sorrow and pain and cannot vent it, he often sheds a few "heroic tears."

After graduating, he joined the army as a platoon leader and was promoted to company, battalion, and regimental commander for his military exploits. In 1937, he led the tank regiment to participate in the Battle of Shanghai, fighting in the north and south, and was promoted from brigade commander to chief of staff. In 1939, the Chinese Army established its first mechanized unit—the 200th Division—and Du was appointed as its commander. In the winter of 1939, he was promoted to commander of the Fifth Army and participated in the Battle of Southern Guangxi and Kunlungan Pass; our army's shift from defensive to offensive against the Japanese invaders began with Du's unit. In 1942, he led his troops on an expedition to Burma and then to India. Midway, it was the rainy season, with poisonous miasma. After experiencing all kinds of hardships, he returned to China, crossing mountains and ridges on foot for three months. Although Du was physically strong, he felt overwhelmed. Upon reaching Kunming, he fell ill.

Wounded in Western Yunnan

In the spring of 1945, Du was wounded in the leg during the Western Yunnan Campaign. He did not recover until before the Japanese surrender. In September, he was ordered to go to the Northeast. In January of this year, Du personally drove a jeep to inspect the Chexin. The wind and snow outside the Great Wall were bitterly cold, so he felt uncomfortable and his right leg ached. After a doctor's diagnosis, it was believed to be kidney inflammation. On February 18, he was sent to the Peking Central Hospital for treatment. On March 12, he underwent surgery to remove the left kidney and was discharged from the hospital on the 28th. After two months of recuperation, he returned to his defense area.

Du is knowledgeable and speaks frankly. Every word has the power to move people. He is already 43 years old this year, but he looks very young. Writing this, I wish this model soldier of the new China good health!
