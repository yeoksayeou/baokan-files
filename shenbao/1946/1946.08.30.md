### Discussing the Reorganization of the National Government Committee; The Selection of the Five-Person Group is Determined; The Government and the CCP Each Have Two Members, with Stuart as Chairman; Not Involving Military or Executive Yuan Matters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Discussions regarding the reorganization of the National Government Committee are showing signs of progress. It is reported that the selection of the five-person group has been decided. From the government side, the two members are Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, and Zhang Lisheng, Minister of the Interior. The two members from the Communist Party are Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu. The American side is represented by Ambassador Stuart, with Special Envoy Marshall not participating.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The government has recently agreed to the proposal by Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart to reorganize the National Government Committee and has decided to establish a five-person group to conduct discussions. After some progress is made, the matter will be handed over to the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Comprehensive Group to study issues concerning the reorganization of the government. The idea of this small group meeting was proposed as early as when Marshall was in China, but it did not gain the Chairman's approval. After obtaining approval, both sides immediately began discussing the selection of personnel on the 29th. The government decided on Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng. However, this has not been finally approved by the Chairman, so many reporters who learned of this news have been cautious and have not published it immediately. According to reliable sources, the Chairman has agreed to the two representatives and summoned them to Guling on the 30th to carefully discuss the content of the upcoming small group meeting. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing on September 2nd, and the meeting will commence on the 3rd. The meeting will be chaired by Ambassador Stuart, and the topics for discussion, according to the Communist Party, are roughly the following: (1) The distribution of seats on the National Government Committee; (2) Discussion on changing the one-third veto power in the Outline for Peaceful National Reconstruction.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Representatives of the government to the PCC held a meeting at Secretary-General Wu's residence on Ling Road at 6:00 PM on the 29th. Those present included Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Chen Cheng, Sun Ke, Lei Zhen, and Wu Tiecheng, totaling six people. Chen Lifu was absent due to illness, and Wang Shijie was absent as he is in France. It is reported that the main focus of the discussion was to study the attendees and topics for the five-person group meeting, and the meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The five-person group will focus solely on discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee and will absolutely not involve military issues or Executive Yuan matters. The government and the CCP will first exchange opinions.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] It is reported that the veto power demanded by Yan'an is not simply a majority, but a two-thirds majority. It is said that Ambassador Stuart is quite optimistic and believes that these procedural details can be resolved by benevolent individuals. It is hoped that the establishment of the National Government Committee may bring an end to the war and allow Special Envoy Marshall and his three-person committee, as well as the KMT and CCP representatives, to proceed with reorganizing the military and restoring transportation.

Stuart Visits President Song

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Ambassador Stuart visited Jinling Theological Seminary at 9:45 AM on the 29th to give a lecture on religious doctrine, lasting half an hour.

### Canadian Ambassador Issues Statement; Only Listening to Our Political Negotiations; Wyatt Also Denies British Participation

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Canadian Ambassador Major General Odlum issued a statement on the 29th denying that he had, at the request of Special Envoy Marshall, explained anything to Chairman Chiang. He stated: "If I had said or done any part of what is described in that report, the Canadian government would consider me to have overstepped my authority and would recall me." "If I were engaged in political activities, it would not be on behalf of the Kuomintang, nor on behalf of the Communist Party, but on behalf of the people of China. The fate of China rests in the hands of Chairman Chiang, Zhou Enlai, Marshall, and Stuart. I understand and admire the talents and patience of these gentlemen, and I have great confidence in them, but I am not within their circle. My position is the same as the general public, merely occupying a small seat in the front row of the audience. I can applaud, and I have indeed applauded, but I must not step onto the stage. If I did not have admiration and love for the Chinese people, and deep friendship with some of the leaders, I would have already packed my bags and returned home. I am staying here because I believe that the development of China has a significant impact on the entire world, including Canada." Previously, Odlum also stated: "My task is that of a researcher and observer, standing in the position of a friend. Although I have close personal relationships with leaders of all factions in China, I do not intend to participate in Chinese politics, nor do I have the authority to participate."

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] According to Reuters Nanjing, the British Prime Minister Attlee's personal representative in China, Wyatt, has denied reports in the Chinese press that Britain will participate in the new peace talks between the Chinese government and the Communist Party.

[Central News Agency Guling Dispatch, 29th] British Prime Minister's personal representative General Wyatt left Guling in the morning of the 29th for Xunyang and then flew to Nanjing.

### Convening the National Assembly; The Communists Still Oppose

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] CCP Spokesperson Wang Bingnan stated: If Chairman Chiang convenes the National Assembly on November 12th without first establishing a coalition government, the CCP will convene leaders in the CCP-controlled areas in Yan'an to discuss the second step of action. Yan'an opposes the unilateral convening of the National Assembly and the adoption of a constitution, and believes that this move is an attempt by the government to politically divide the country. Until now, all political institutions in the Communist areas belong to local governments, because we hope for a unified coalition and have not established a central government. If the government proposes to convene the National Assembly before the cessation of hostilities and excludes the CCP, we are prepared to convene a meeting of all border area governments in response. What Mr. Wang said is sufficient to prove the rumour that if the government insists on convening the National Assembly before the resolution of major issues such as peace talks and government reorganization, Yan'an will consider establishing a separate CCP central government.

### Mao Zedong Provides the Communist Army with Offensive Methods

[Central News Agency Xi'an Dispatch, 29th] Since the release of the general mobilization broadcast from Yan'an, Communist troops in various locations have been actively moving. It is reported that recently, Mao Zedong specifically provided his subordinates with four key points regarding the current situation: (1) Launch offensives; (2) Advocate for peace; (3) Be proactive in advancing; (4) Negotiate passively. At the same time, the CCP also gave its subordinates four instructions: (1) Launch a comprehensive offensive and conduct localized negotiations; (2) Consolidate the Northeast, expand into the Northwest, and make every effort to advance into the provinces of Suiyuan and Shanxi; (3) Use the Northeast as the strategic outer perimeter of the revolution and North China as the source of the revolution; (4) Unite all revolutionary forces, overthrow the notification of imperialism, and skillfully use the method of armed uprising by the masses to seize power.

### Central Bank Advisor Yang Wo-de to Return to the US

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Yang Wo-de, economic advisor to the Central Bank, visited Special Envoy Marshall on the morning of the 29th.

Also, Mr. Yang will be going to California for recuperation due to illness, and will return to China in half a year. His visit to Marshall was to bid farewell.

### Comprehensive Streamlining of Government Agencies; Various Agencies Draft Plans; Design Bureau Formulates Next Year's Policy Guidelines

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The central government's design work for comprehensively adjusting government agencies is still in progress. The two small groups in the National Government responsible for studying this work have notified all agencies to draft streamlining plans, referring to the number of personnel in the 26th year of the Republic and the current business needs, and submit them for review. According to general observations, streamlining agencies is inevitable.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] It is reported that the Central Design Bureau has formulated the policy guidelines for the 36th year of the Republic, with the content focusing on stabilizing people's livelihoods and implementing constitutional government. It has been submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for discussion and distributed to specialized committees for review.

### Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Withdraws from Baimi Town; National Army Enters Sucheng; National Troops Pressing Close to Chengde

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 29th] Military sources report that the National Army in northern Jiangsu entered Sucheng County Town at 2:00 PM on the 29th. The Communist army is collapsing towards the northeast.

[Our Taixian Dispatch, 29th] The Communist army that attacked Baimi Town did indeed enter the urban area for a time, but has been repelled by the National Army. Fighting is still ongoing near the town. The Communist army that attacked between Qutang and Haian has been repelled by the National Army and is collapsing. The Qutang-Haian Highway has also been repaired by the authorities, but traffic on the Jiangqu Highway has been temporarily suspended due to damage by the Communist army.

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 29th] The Communist army facing the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou launched a small-scale harassment today, which may be a prelude to a large-scale offensive. Also, there has recently been Communist army activity in the southwest area of Shaobo Lake. According to refugees who escaped from Shaobo, Qiaoshe, and other places, the Communist army is currently carrying out large-scale massacres in these areas. The so-called "pro-government" people, including women and children, are not spared. In Liujiazhuang alone, there were more than 300 people. Their methods of killing are appalling. One person, after being arrested, was pushed into a cesspool and soaked for about half an hour. They were then taken out and forced to look at cotton clothes under the hot sun. This was repeated again and again. The victim screamed in agony, and the Communist army took pleasure in this.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] According to military authorities, the situation in Rehe is quite serious. The executive group in Chengde has lost contact with the Military Mediation Department. Although the power supply in the city has been destroyed by the Communist army, it does not affect the group's use of dry-cell-powered electrical equipment, so it is difficult to judge whether there is a problem with the group. For this reason, the US proposed yesterday to send a plane to Chengde to make contact. The Communist side said that because the situation was serious, they could not guarantee the safety of the plane. However, the US finally sent a plane yesterday with government personnel on board. As of 6:00 PM this evening, there has been no news of its return. The US side of the Military Mediation Department inquired as to why the Communist army destroyed the power supply in Chengde. The Communist side replied that not only this, but everything in Chengde would be destroyed. It is reported that there were originally three regiments of Communist troops in the city of Chengde, but the current number is unclear. Some people say that it will not be difficult for the National Army to recover Chengde, but the fate of Chifeng, the second key point in Rehe, is also uncertain. Communists are now jokingly saying that the Chifeng issue, which Marshall considered to be a masterpiece, was resolved at the beginning of the Military Mediation Department, but today's Chifeng issue may be the end of the Military Mediation Department. Zheng Dongguo and Da Wang, a member of the Northeast Political Committee, both arrived in Chaoyang on the 27th. With the progress of the military, the politics of the Mongolian banners will also have significant developments. Da Wang will also make a trip to Pingquan. Wan Guobin, the director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, also arrived in Lingyuan on the 28th to plan and supervise the repair of the railways along with the army, as well as the Pingquan to Yebai Chifeng line. The Jin-Cheng Railway has been repaired to Shuiquan west of Lingyuan and can be repaired to Pingquan recently. The Ye-Chi line can also be repaired in the short term.

### CCP Denies Attacking Datong; The Peiping Headquarters Specifically Refutes This

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 29th] A spokesman for the CCP delegation issued a statement in Shanghai denying the attack on Datong. The Beiping Headquarters specifically refuted this. According to a spokesman for the Headquarters, the Communist army attacked Datong Ying County from the beginning of July, mobilizing tens of thousands of troops. The defending troops in the two places have been besieged for more than a month. The fighting has been brutal. The Communist army has also repeatedly fired artillery shells into the city after occupying Qilicun and Baimacheng. Residents have also been injured and killed. This is an undeniable fact, and yet the CCP spokesman still says that they did not attack Datong, trying to cover it up. This kind of self-deceiving tactic that violates the facts is really unwise. The Headquarters has decided to publish the details of the siege of Datong Ying County tomorrow (30th), which will further prove the CCP's consistent deception of the Chinese people.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] (1) The National Army in Xinxian County, Shanxi Province, launched an attack in two directions on the 26th and 27th. The Communist army fled in disarray. (2) The section of the Zhengtai Railway east of Yangquan has been fully opened to traffic.

According to a qualified person, the Congress may close before the 10th. In addition, Zheng Yanfen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, flew to Xunyang via Guling on the 29th to attend the National Congress of the Youth League.

### New York Times Editorial Refutes Zhou Enlai's Explanation; Yan'an Imitates Soviet Policies Everywhere

[Central News Agency New York Dispatch, 27th] The New York Times published an editorial today refuting Zhou Enlai's statement of the 26th, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of launching a propaganda war to force the United States to withdraw from China. The newspaper's editorial, titled "Propaganda Weapons in China," stated: "The new offensive of the Communist troops in the Northeast against the National Army, and the intensified fighting in several other areas, need not necessarily mean that China has been plunged into a full-scale civil war. This is part of the Communist Party's movement to force us to withdraw from China. All Communist spokesmen emphasize this point. Yan'an's current policy seems to have this as its main goal."

"Anyone can point out the parallel actions of the so-called 'peace front.' The steadfastness of the United States is being tested by tactics of aggression everywhere in Europe. Our interests there are in danger. The Communist Party in China also speaks of peace and accumulates some obstacles to peace, just as it does in Paris. Zhou Enlai in Nanjing is carefully maintaining his position in the talks and has not closed the door to further negotiations, while shifting the main responsibility for the breakdown of the talks to the United States. Mr. Zhou said that if we stop selling surplus supplies from the South Pacific to China, withdraw our troops, and end our support for the Chinese government, then peace talks may be reopened on a more reasonable basis. What Mr. Zhou calls 'reasonable' means strengthening Yan'an's position and infinitely weakening Nanjing's position." "Since the end of the war against Japan, the flames of war in China have been flashing from time to time, all related to the Communist Party's progress on the political front. Whenever the Communist Party is blocked, as it has been in the Northeast, the war will temporarily calm down. The Communist Party's renewed offensive in northern Jiangsu and the siege of Datong are both reactions to its political progress. In recent months, Yan'an has become closer to Moscow and has imitated Soviet policies everywhere. The Chinese Communist Party is currently using the most powerful propaganda weapons against the United States. This is very obvious."

### Tianjin Arrests Personnel in Major Embezzlement Case: Liu Nai Released Under Escort Yesterday Morning; Investigation Uncovers Jewelry and U.S. Currency

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] As of 1:00 PM on the 28th, the investigation into the Liu Naiyi case has uncovered over one hundred taels of gold, ten thousand U.S. dollars, fifteen catties of pearls, and over one hundred and fifty pieces of fur goods. All of the above items were found in the residences of his three current wives. The investigative agency has sent a report on the case to the Ministry of National Defense. Mr. Liu is scheduled to be released under escort to the parallel institutions on the morning of the 29th.

Purchasing U.S. Surplus Materials: A Way for Sino-American Mutual Assistance
Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Announces to Reporters

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] A Central News Agency reporter, concerning the central government's purchase of U.S. military surplus materials and the consultation on civil aviation matters, visited the spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department, who stated the following: The purchase of U.S. military surplus materials has been under discussion for half a year and has been frequently reported in the newspapers; there is no secrecy involved. It is not cost-effective for the U.S. military to transport surplus materials from Pacific islands back to the United States, so they wish to sell them locally to China. The U.S. military in Europe also sold surplus materials to countries such as France and Italy. China, due to a shortage of materials, is willing to purchase them if the prices are low. It's a case of one side wanting to sell and the other wanting to buy. Rather than calling it U.S. aid to China, it would be better to call it Sino-American mutual assistance. As for the consultation on civil aviation, that is an entirely separate issue. This matter is still in the preliminary exploratory stage, and no agreement has been reached. If an agreement is reached in the future, it will definitely be based on complete equality and mutual benefit. During the international civil aviation conference three years ago, China had many reservations and was very cautious. The Chinese Communists are confusing these two unrelated matters, hence their immature and absurd statements.

Local Correspondences
Bankruptcy of Rural Areas in Northern Jiangsu; Central Government Emphasizes Agricultural Loans

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondence] The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously drafted a plan to revive the entire rural area of Northern Jiangsu and requested an emergency agricultural loan of 10 billion yuan from the central government for Northern Jiangsu. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has submitted the opinions signed and annotated by the Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The central government is deeply concerned about this, but due to the numerical issues, it is still under close study. However, this matter is expected to be approved, or at least a portion of the funds will be allocated for this purpose first.

Occupation of Airfield Without Payment; Supplementary Procedures for Compulsory Purchase to Be Handled

[Our Wujin Correspondence] The Haitang Township in the Second District of Xidamiao in this county originally encircled civilian farmland before the war to build an airfield. However, the area occupied was relatively small. After the fall of the area, the enemy greatly expanded it, forcibly occupying a large amount of civilian farmland and destroying eighteen nearby residential villages. After the victory, citizen representatives from the eighteen villages, including Zhou Chuanliang, repeatedly petitioned the authorities to return the land encircled for the airfield. Recently, the county government approved a statement from the Third Air Force Regional Command: "The Changzhou Airfield is currently in use and should be retained. In addition to separately telegraphing the Executive Yuan's temporary office in Shanghai, you are instructed to investigate and clarify the property rights. If the land for the airfield was occupied by the enemy or their puppets without paying the land price, the department will review and approve the price, jointly handle the supplementary procedures for compulsory purchase with the local government, and submit a report for approval."

Rampant Banditry in Wuhu; Two Command Headquarters to Be Established for Security

[Our Wuhu Correspondence] Wuhu is the leading port in Anhui Province. Since the victory, there has been a lack of National Army troops stationed there, leading to chaotic security conditions in the urban area and surrounding regions. The people are fearful, and no one dares to make constructive investments in industry and commerce. Robberies are reported daily in both urban and rural areas. First Pacification Commander Tang Enbo, recognizing the significant impact, plans to establish the Jing-Wu Garrison Command and the Wuhu City Defense Command in preparation. Tang plans to recommend the Deputy Commander of the 58th Army, Zhang Wenxin, for the position of commander of both commands. This may be realized in the near future. Furthermore, on the 24th, over a hundred armed bandits appeared in Dufeng Township, fifteen miles from the city in this county. Additionally, a gang of bandits, numbering over two hundred, also fled from the north bank of the Yangtze River to Yanzishan in Nanling, all carrying rifles and machine guns, extorting and killing people, causing great suffering to the people. The local authorities in each county are currently working together to suppress them.

Restoration of the Jinlan Highway; Traffic to Resume on September 1st
Ministry of Communications Approves Allocation of Funds for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

[Our Hangzhou Correspondence] The person in charge of the Lan-Shou Road Restoration Project of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation stated: "The highway from Lanxi, Magongtan, to Jinhua has now been completely restored and is scheduled to officially open to traffic on September 1st." Furthermore, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, due to the construction costs for sections such as Zhuji, Jinhua, and Pingxiang exceeding the original budget significantly due to price increases, and the current operating income from the Hangzhou-Zhuji and Jiangshan-Raozhou sections being insufficient to cover expenses, Director Zhang Zilie personally went to Nanjing to request Minister Yu Dawei to increase the construction budget and allocate monthly funds. This has been approved, but the figures are still awaiting review by President Song Ziwen.

Hangzhou Clears Public Land
Much of Hangzhou's public land was illegally disposed of during the enemy and puppet occupation. After the city government's restoration, it began clearing the land based on the Provisional Regulations for Clearing Public Funds and Properties and the Regulations for Leasing Public Properties, and announced that all disposals during the enemy and puppet period were invalid. It is now known that the cleared public land in each district totals 2,207 mu. Those that meet the needs of municipal construction will be retained, with only short-term leases permitted. Leases for 1,701 mu of public land have already been granted, limited to self-cultivation and not for subletting for profit.

Wuxi: Rewarding the Elimination of Rice Borers by Exchanging Borers for Flour
The Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the head of the first agricultural work team stationed in Wuxi, Cheng Shouhua, recently decided to purchase rice borer eggs, moths, and withered ears of rice with goods to encourage people to eliminate rice borers. It is currently tentatively set at two catties of flour for one liang of rice moths, one catty of flour for three catties of withered rice ears, and one catty of flour for sixty egg masses. Recently, over three hundred bags of flour have been distributed in the Yanqiao area. On the 28th, another one hundred bags were transported to Liucang Township, and fifty bags were transported to Yanqiao. The work is very busy, but due to a shortage of personnel, a request has been made to the Construction Bureau to send technicians Wu and Zhao to Wuxi for assistance. The county government has also dispatched four police officers to maintain order in the townships. If any are found in the townships and towns of this county, they can be handled in the same way to promote the program widely.

Editorial: Prerequisites for Land Reform
Recently, there have been rumors that the government will implement a land reform policy to provide a good start for post-war rural reconstruction. This is naturally welcome news. Moreover, we believe that the fact that the National Government is only now "thinking about" land reform should be seen not as a new policy but as an "old tune," because today the land reform issue should not only be a problem that the government should "think about" but a problem that the government should actively "do."

It is said that Chairman Chiang is very concerned about this land problem and summoned Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Farmers Bank of China, and Li Shuming, General Manager, to Lushan to discuss how to proceed with the reform. President Song also mentioned this issue during his recent trip to Guling to seek instructions. The Central Standing Committee meeting on the 21st and the temporary discussion meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 22nd both discussed the implementation plan for this land reform. When President Song came to Shanghai last week, Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Food also came, further deepening the study of this issue. Furthermore, Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the China Land Administration Society, made specific suggestions to the central government, taking "land to the tiller" as the principle of implementation. We have heard this series of news and firmly believe that this urgent land reform issue will soon be transformed from an ideal into a reality due to the government's determination. For the sake of the lives of Chinese farmers, for the sake of Chinese agricultural production, and even for the future of China's industrialization and modernization, this is truly welcome news.

As of yesterday, we have not yet seen the central government's proposed plan for land reform. The content is unknown, so it is not appropriate to comment on it. However, this matter is of great importance and urgency. We would like to offer a few opinions on the prerequisites:

First, the government must recognize that land reform is proactive rather than reactive. What does this mean? Because "equalization of land ownership" is the main policy of the Kuomintang's Principle of People's Livelihood, "land to the tiller" is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching, and the Land Law was promulgated by the National Government more than ten years ago and amended again in April of this year, with its implementation methods already announced. From any point of view, the National Government has no reason to postpone its implementation indefinitely. Furthermore, looking at the situation in rural areas before and during the war, the majority of self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers in China, except for a few large landlords, are indeed suffering from the inability to make ends meet despite their hard work. The equalization of land rights is truly unavoidable. In the past, it could be said that the delay was due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, which was an extraordinary event; but now that victory has been achieved, the country's major reforms should be undertaken, and the government should especially start anew with the people. How can it not implement land reform in response to the current situation in rural areas? Therefore, since the government has this determination, it should proactively and positively shoulder the responsibility of implementing the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and implementing national policies, advancing bravely, persevering, and doing everything possible, and must not regard such a fundamental matter related to the livelihood of the people as some kind of reactive and decorative routine matter.

Second, the government's measures should be comprehensive rather than partial. What does this mean? Recently, there has been a saying that China is so large that a full-scale reform is too difficult, and land reform might as well be promoted first in the pacified areas, taking advantage of the situation. It is said that recently, after the National Army counterattacked in northern Jiangsu and advanced into some areas, the land issue became more prominent and urgently needed to be resolved in the pacified areas. In fact, the land issue is indeed as chaotic as tangled silk in areas that have been "liberated" by the Communists and urgently needs to be resolved, but shouldn't other areas, and even the whole of China, also seek appropriate solutions quickly? In recent years, Western political commentators have often said that the Chinese Communist Party is not truly implementing Marxism but only advocating the redistribution of land. Regardless of whether this statement is accurate, it shows that the necessity of reforming China's land has become a common consensus among economists at home and abroad. The National Government, as the only legitimate government of China, has the responsibility to implement government orders in any region of the country. If it believes that it is time to resolutely implement land reform, it should establish a comprehensive implementation plan. Although it can allow for some flexibility in phased and regional implementation to adapt to local conditions, there should be no preconceived notion of implementing it only partially when formulating the plan or program at the beginning. Otherwise, a big mistake will be made, and not only will the entire implementation disappear, but also the local implementation will add endless disturbances.

Third, the government must establish the authority of the executing agency and assign it the responsibilities it should bear when implementing this policy. Equalization of land rights is not a small matter, nor is it an easy task that can be done without any resistance. It requires great determination and great courage. The administrative and economic power of the executing agency should be established in the central government and even at the local level. The Land Administration Department has been established for many years. Although the scale is roughly complete, it is limited by its status and funds. The promotion of routine land administration still feels insufficient. If it is to be charged with implementing the policy of equalization of land rights, it may be beyond its power. In this regard, the central government should not only change the department to a ministry to show its determination to actively reform the land, but also establish land administration departments in all provinces and cities, set deadlines, and provide ample funding to ensure that all necessary tasks such as land declaration and land survey are completed within the prescribed period. Only then can a reasonable redistribution be based on the principle of land to the tiller. Not only this, but land reform not only contains the motive of equal distribution but also has the intention of promoting production. Only when the tiller has his own land will he be willing to work harder. This is one point. After the redistribution, new organizational methods such as "cooperative farms" and "collective farms" can be introduced as much as possible to gradually mechanize agriculture, and production can be increased. This is the second point. Because of this, in the process of land reform and in the improvement of agricultural production, the central and local governments must strengthen the status and strength of agricultural financial institutions and cooperative financial institutions, so that they can cooperate with the government's policies and implement them in a consistent manner. Only then can they hope to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

In short, we believe that if the government wants to implement a "new policy," there will inevitably be some resistance. This is the case in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. In ancient China, it can be said that the widespread implementation of land reform today is a major event, which is not easy to achieve and is within expectations. However, as long as the government recognizes that this matter is beneficial to the majority of the people—Chinese farmers account for 80 percent—as long as the government plans carefully in advance and executes impartially in the event, and as long as it adheres to perseverance from beginning to end, we believe that this land reform will be feasible in post-war China. Moreover, if China wants political stability, economic prosperity, and to become a modern country, frankly speaking, if it does not start with land reform quickly, all other new policy measures will be like rootless sesame grass and a fountain without a source.

The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Meets Again
The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union held another informal meeting yesterday at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss how to speed up the progress of the peace conference. Hopefully, this meeting of foreign ministers will not be as prolonged as the previous one.

The Paris Peace Conference has been open for thirty days, and we have only heard the grand pronouncements of representatives from various countries, who often argue until they are red in the face because of a disagreement. Apart from this, almost no progress has been made. Peace conference work is inherently difficult, and slow progress is not unexpected. Considering the mountain of amendments to the peace treaty proposed by representatives from various countries, it is indeed worrying. Regarding the draft peace treaty with Italy, there is almost no article that does not need to be amended. Assuming that these amendments are to be discussed and each representative is allowed to freely express his opinion, then the peace conference may not be able to "successfully conclude" by the end of this year. But can the objective international environment allow the peace conference to be delayed like this? First, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on September 23. Although some people advocate for the peace conference to be temporarily adjourned, others advocate for the United Nations General Assembly to be postponed, but in general, these two equally important international conferences are likely to be held simultaneously. However, if they are held simultaneously, international attention will inevitably be diverted, and the importance of the Paris Peace Conference will also be diminished. Second, the relations between Europe and the Far East are closely related. If the European stalemate cannot be broken, the Far East issue cannot be resolved soon. Therefore, for the sake of the future of the entire world, the Paris Peace Conference must speed up its work and complete its mission as soon as possible. The reopening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference this time probably carries this important mission.

We have summarized the amendments to the draft peace treaty proposed by representatives from various countries, most of which focus on territorial demands: (1) Bulgaria demands the Serres region of Greece; (2) Greece demands a narrow strip of land in southern Bulgaria; (3) Greece demands the northern Epirus region of Albania; (4) Hungary wants to reclaim part of Outer Transylvania from Romania; (5) Abyssinia wants former Italian Somaliland in East Africa; (6) Austria demands South Tyrol from Italy; (7) Yugoslavia demands the Venezia Giulia region of Italy, including the port of Trieste. In addition, France also has territorial demands on Italy, and Egypt wants to cede a piece of territory from former Italian Libya. If these issues are to be discussed, the draft peace treaty drawn up by the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will be completely overturned during the disputes and debates. In order to maintain the draft peace treaty, the four countries should reach an agreement on the amendments proposed by the representatives of the remaining seventeen countries so that they can adopt a common and consistent attitude. As for whether the four countries will accept the amendments that have been passed by each committee, it should also be decided at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and at the same time, a spokesperson should be selected to defend the views held by the four countries at the Peace Conference. Whether the representatives of the seventeen countries are merely companions to the conference will largely depend on this meeting of foreign ministers.

Peace Conference Italian Committee Discusses French-Italian Border Issues
Australian Amendment Rejected

According to United Press: When the Italian Political and Territorial Committee met on the 29th, the Australian representative proposed setting up an investigation committee to assist in adjusting the intelligence on the French-Italian border dispute. After another heated debate with the Soviet representative, it was rejected by a vote of thirteen to six. The United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France all voted against it, while Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, and South Africa voted in favor, and New Zealand abstained. During the discussion, Polish representative Winiwicz asked the representatives to abandon trivial disputes and proceed with their work, and reminded the representatives that they had spent a month discussing six and a half pages of the ninety-two page draft treaty. The entire draft treaty must pass through the three sub-committees and the plenary session before being submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. "We are preparing for peace, not war—atomic war, as some representatives imagine," he said.

Review of Military Clauses

According to Paris Radio on the 29th: The Military Committee today reviewed the military clauses in the Treaty of Peace with Italy. Article 39 did not require any amendments. The Czech representative proposed discussing Article 40, which was also passed after debate by representatives from New Zealand, Czech Republic, France, and the United States. Subsequently, the discussion turned to the clause "Italy shall dismantle and not construct any permanent fortifications in locations that may involve French national territory." The Brazilian representative proposed that new revised wording could be added, adding "but for the sole purpose of national defense, it may be preserved or constructed within 20 kilometers of the border." French representative M. Bardoux said that France abides by the resolutions adopted by the four powers, and the Brazilian amendment is already included in Article 40(c). Italy already has the right to defend its territory under this clause. The Yugoslav representative expressed his agreement with this, and the Brazilian representative withdrew his amendment request. Article 40 was finally passed again. The meeting adjourned at 12:15.

Adoption of Preamble, Part Two, of the Treaty with Bulgaria

According to Agence France-Presse: The Political and Territorial Committee for Bulgaria met on the 29th to discuss the preamble to the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria. The Australian representative proposed an amendment stipulating the phrase "in accordance with the principles of justice" in the preamble. Yugoslav delegation leader Katarček objected, saying, "The Australian delegation's actions are like missionaries sacrificing themselves for the barbarians of Europe. This is truly incomprehensible. This amendment is enough to make some powerful countries consult on everything." New Zealand delegation leader Jordan expressed opposition and asked the chairman to exercise his authority and re-discuss the amendment proposed by Australia. At this point, the Soviet representative stood up from his seat and declared, "What Jordan said is humiliating to some delegations. The Australian delegation wasted time at the beginning of today's afternoon meeting." The General Assembly finally put the preamble of the treaty and the amendment proposed by Australia to a vote, passing it by a vote of twelve to one, with Yugoslavia voting against. Finally, the second part of this amendment awaits future discussion.

Jewish Terrorists Plot to Assassinate Bevin
British and French Authorities Deny Rumors

[United Press Paris Dispatch, 29th] French police authorities recently denied reports of the discovery of a Jewish terrorist plot to assassinate British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The British delegation also said that the rumors were absurd and ridiculous. French police authorities said that since the opening of the Four Powers Conference, French special guards have been following and protecting the representatives of the four powers.

Balkan Committee Discusses South African Amendment
Soviet Representative Repeatedly Refutes

According to Paris Radio on the 29th: When the Balkan Committee met today, the Ukrainian representative stood up to oppose South Africa's proposed amendment, saying that the first part of South Africa's proposal aimed to link Romania closely to the price trends of the world market, which was unfair. The Yugoslav representative agreed. The British representative strongly defended the South African amendment, and the US representative believed that the principle was that compensation should be borne by the former enemy country and not by the people of the Allied countries. However, the South African representative continued to insist on his position and refuted.

According to Paris Radio on the 29th: Soviet representative Gusev believed that the amendments to the Balkans were unacceptable. He pointed out that prices varied from country to country and could fluctuate for various reasons, so the issue of prices should not be prescribed in advance in the draft treaty. Regarding this point, the Romanian government should be allowed to organize its own economic situation. The amendment proposed by South Africa would involve foreign interference in Romania's internal affairs, causing additional difficulties for Romania's compensation. French representative Stoppani wanted to speak next, but was stopped by the chairman, who proposed to continue the meeting at 10:00 tomorrow. According to tomorrow's agenda, the continued discussion of South Africa's amendment proposals will be included.

Eight Countries' Applications for Membership Spark Heated Debate
Security Council Fails to Reach Agreement
Ukrainian Complaint Temporarily Postponed

[Our Combined Dispatch] The current session of the United Nations Security Council met in New York on the 28th. According to Reuters, at the beginning of the meeting, Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens stood up to speak, advocating for the rejection of Ukraine's complaint against Greece. Kleffens pointed out that Ukraine had failed to provide sufficient evidence, and its complaint was purely vexatious, intended to trouble other countries, and said that the Security Council should seek to protect its dignity. If we allow it to accept all complaints without sufficient reason, it will inevitably harm the interests of the United Nations organization. British representative Jebb also stood up to speak, saying that any country that wants to file a complaint must have sufficient and major evidence. At this point, Soviet representative Gromyko stood up to refute, saying that how could it be known that there was no sufficient reason before the case had been discussed in detail? Rejecting it without consideration by the Security Council would harm its dignity. How could it be known that the Ukrainian representative would not be able to present more detailed evidence when the Security Council discussed the case? The United Kingdom must have been embarrassed by Ukraine's complaint, and if the case had not involved the United Kingdom, Mr. Jebb would have approved it long ago. After such a heated debate, the result was difficult to determine. At this point, Chairman Piquet of the Polish representative suggested that the matter be postponed until the discussion of the member issue was over. This suggestion was immediately accepted by the representatives, and the discussion of the application for membership of the new members began. According to the original nine countries joining this time, but the Siamese government asked to postpone joining due to unresolved territorial disputes with France, so only eight countries remained. American representative Johnson once suggested that the case be combined into a group application, allowing all eight countries to join, regardless of the merits of each country. Brazil, Mexico, China, Egypt and other countries agreed with this proposal, but the Soviet Union and Australia opposed it. Soviet representative Gromyko advocated that each application should be handled individually, and Australian representative Hasluck also believed that from a procedural point of view, it should not be handled as a group, but should always be considered individually. At this point, the US representative withdrew his proposal and decided to discuss the applications of the eight countries individually at the meeting on the 29th.

The meeting continued at 10:30 a.m. on the 29th. According to United Press, the situation at the meeting may again cause the Soviet group and the British-American group to use their veto power against each other. However, the General Assembly may also accept the French proposal, which advocates that in addition to passing Sweden, Iceland, and Afghanistan, the remaining Albania, Ireland, Outer Mongolia, and Portugal should not be discussed for the time being, and should be discussed again after one year. But Gromyko, the representative of Germany, still seems to be trying to get Albania to pass first. The US delegation spokesman said on the morning of the 29th that if the Soviet Union insists, the United States may use its veto power to oppose Albania and Outer Mongolia's membership.

Greek Referendum Nears
Various Parties Predict Royalists Will Win
Time for Showdown Between Left and Right

[United Press Athens Dispatch, 29th] Greece will hold a referendum on September 1 to decide whether to restore the exiled King George II. This vote was organized by the royalist government under pressure from the parliamentary opposition and British forces, and will focus on the issue of the political system. The left-wing parties refused to vote in the parliamentary re-election at the end of March, but have now indicated their participation. 86-year-old statesman Sophoulis, Prime Minister before the People's Party victory in March, has repeatedly criticized that it is not yet time to hold a free and honest vote. Sophoulis is a veteran of the republican faction who has always opposed the right-wing People's Party and is the last surviving veteran of the Liberal Party. Other opponents alongside Sophoulis include three former prime ministers: Papandreou, Kanellopoulos, and the National United Group led by Venizelos Jr. The communist-dominated left has signaled to republican cadres to form an anti-George united front, but the cadres of that faction have resolutely refused to join forces with the left. The right wing is well-organized and has been in power for five months. Important positions are held by loyal monarchists. Even left-wing elements who openly believe George will fail privately admit that George's return is inevitable.

The joint Anglo-American election monitoring team is currently reviewing the amendments to the March election list, which has been severely criticized by the opposition and the abstaining left. George II, known by the people as "the unsmiling man," was exiled after Germany invaded Greece.

[United Press London Dispatch, 28th] Whether Greece will enter the Soviet orbit in the Balkans, or remain the only foothold of the Western Allied countries in the Balkans, a showdown seems to be imminent in a few days. The Greek left-wing Republican Party and the Communist Party, relying on Moscow's moral support, have been fighting the royalists for two years and have finally been defeated. Greek people at home and in London predict that the Greek King will win. The current Tsaldaris cabinet was formed after the parliamentary elections in March of this year and is an open royalist.

Soviet Ambassador Returns to Greece

[Our Report] London Radio 29: Before returning to his country, Soviet Ambassador to Greece Rodionov announced that the embassy's duties would be handled by First Secretary Chenosayev, which shows that the ambassador's return does not mean that Soviet-Greek diplomatic relations have been severed. Before leaving, Luo visited the Greek Foreign Minister and talked for 45 minutes.

British Cabinet To Be Reorganized

[Our Report] London Radio 28: British political circles speculate that Prime Minister Attlee is considering a large-scale reorganization of the cabinet, involving Sir Cripps/or three other cabinet members.

Soviet Territorial Ambition Towards Turkey

[Reuters Istanbul Dispatch 28th] A New York Times reporter said that after discovering a "Greater Armenia" map printed in Moscow, annotated in Russian and Armenian, it made people believe that Turkey was facing another problem from the Soviet Union. These maps are given to Armenians in Turkey and the Middle East. According to the map, 10,000 square miles of Turkish territory, accounting for about one-fifth of the country's territory. From the port of Kireç, along the Black Sea coast to the province of Sivas, and south to the border near Iraq, are all within the scope of Greater Armenia. This entire piece of land is about three and a half times the size of Turkey's Kars and Ardahan provinces, which the Soviet Union has long been eyeing.

[Our Report] London Radio 29: The British government confirmed today that although the United States has received an invitation from Britain to attend the upcoming Arab-Jewish-British Palestine Conference, it has decided not to send observers.

At the same time, the Colonial Department said that the Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, will not be invited to attend the meeting.

Iran Asks for Severe Measures
Zhang Province Fortress Attacked by Sasani Tribe
Soviet Side Claims 10,000 Indian Troops Arrived in Basra

[Our Report] London Radio 29: An Iranian spokesman announced today: The Azerbijan fortress of Ardibil, ninety miles west of Greater Tabriz, near the Caspian Sea, is currently under attack by the Sasani tribe. It is said that the Azerbijan Democratic Party "suffered heavy losses" and guerrilla warfare broke out on the outskirts of the city. Chadya Dibil is one of the richest cities in Azerbaijan Province, and 16,000 residents are now in a state of terror.

[Reuters Moscow Dispatch 28th] The Soviet news agency's Tehran telegram said that 10,000 Indian troops had arrived in Basra, and British officers there said they would station themselves in the Kordestan Province of southwestern Iran. The Soviet news agency also said that a large amount of military supplies had been transported from Kuhu and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf to supply the Arabs in Kou Province who were brewing independence.

Consistent U.S. Policy
Uphold Freedom of the Seas
No Right for Others to Interfere with U.S. Fleet Actions
Halsey's Incisive Remarks Aimed at the Soviet Union
West Hemisphere Joint Defense Plan in Progress

[United Press Washington Dispatch 28th] U.S. Navy veteran Halsey, in response to Soviet criticism of the U.S. fleet's tour of the Eastern Mediterranean, specially invited reporters to harshly refute it today.

[Reuters Washington Dispatch 28th] Admiral Halsey told reporters today that the United States, in cooperation with Central and South American countries, is establishing a defense system in the Western Hemisphere so that in the event of an incident, we can take care of the people of these countries and cooperate with them. Admiral Harbin, a hero of the Pacific War, has just returned from a goodwill tour of the Southern Hemisphere with Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower. Harbin's remarks have always been known for being pungent. In answering reporters' questions, he said that it is none of anyone else's business where we want to go, and we will go anywhere we like to go. But then he stated that the US fleet does not intend to enter the coasts of other countries, but the high seas are a free zone. Reporters also asked whether the Mediterranean is also a place where US fleets can freely enter and exit without criticism. He replied: "I have stated that any place is the same." Harbin denied that the United States intended to restore the "Big Stick Policy" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and said: "We need good friends. We have several good friends in South America and hope to maintain these friendships."

Nanjing Massacre
Cruelty Reaches Extremes
Eyewitness Testimony from International Tribunal

[United Press Tokyo Dispatch 29th] Prosecutor Michael Lemm of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal testified in court today that Japanese troops committed countless rapes of women during the Nanjing Massacre, and the degree of cruelty was almost unbelievable. 24 hours a day, there was not an hour without women being dragged out by Japanese troops. Japanese troops even poured gasoline on the heads of Chinese people and then set them on fire. In Nanjing, the Japanese troops seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted. Another witness, Fitz, an American who lived in China all his life and now works for the YMCA and the United Relief Association, said: He had witnessed hundreds of Chinese civilians being captured by Japanese troops and used for bayonet practice. All those with their hands empty and Niu Mountain bare were considered by the Japanese troops to be serving in the military, and they were put to death. Their determination to harm all Chinese soldiers was clear. Madam Shui, a supervisor at Ginling Women's College, said that the licentious Japanese troops repeatedly broke into the Ginling Women's College campus and kidnapped the female students they considered most satisfactory. Japanese troops often burned civilian houses at night for fun and to keep warm. Another witness, Mr. Sun, said that Japanese troops had tied up 10,000 civilians and lined them up along the banks of the Yangtze River, then used machine guns to shoot them. All 10,000 people died within an hour. After killing 400 of them, the Japanese troops threw the bodies into the river one by one, which took 30 minutes.

New Translation System Breaks Language Barriers
Foundation of United Nations Set
Any Representative Can Be Heard Simultaneously

[US News Agency Washington Dispatch 28th] Mr. Smith recently wrote an article in the New York Times magazine describing the complex interpretation system of the Nuremberg International Tribunal, which will also be used by the United Nations General Assembly. Smith said: The International Tribunal has many excellent interpreters, who use a system called: Simultaneous interpretation in four languages." This system has contributed greatly to international cooperation. This system has been adopted since the opening of the International Military Tribunal on November 20 last year, and will also be used at the next United Nations New York Conference. The situation of the interpretation system of the International Tribunal is as follows: Auditors, judges, and defendants are all equipped with a pair of headphones, and there is also a converter on their seats, with a dial with five numbers, which can be arbitrarily rotated to listen to the translated language. Judges, defense lawyers, and defendants all speak into the microphone, and the interpreter sits in a small room behind the court, listens, and immediately translates into four languages: English, French, Russian, and German, so that everyone in the court can listen. The interpreters

First Blind Student to Receive University Education; National School for the Blind and Deaf Achieves Success [Our Newspaper, Nanjing News] The National School for the Blind and Deaf moved from Nanjing to Jiangjin, Sichuan, during the war. Under the leadership of Principal Chen Guangxu, the school's affairs have flourished in recent years. The school is the only one of its kind in China and has received significant attention from all sectors. In 1940, Luo Fuxin, a graduate of the school's blind program, was admitted to National Central University, becoming the first blind student in China to receive university education. The school is now actively preparing to return to Nanjing and has sent its head of general affairs to select a school site in Nanjing. It is expected that the school will officially reopen in Nanjing in the second half of the year.

Hangzhou Sets Tuition Fees: High School 120,000, Elementary School 40,000 [Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] As the autumn school term approaches, schools in the city have begun holding entrance examinations. There are many applicants, but the Municipal Education Bureau has limited the number of admissions. The Ministry of Education, facing financial difficulties, cannot increase the number of public schools. Therefore, it encourages the establishment of private schools to alleviate the shortage of educational opportunities. Currently, the unreasonable phenomenon of military occupation of schools in Hangzhou persists. For example, the famous Anding Middle School, High Technical School, and Shulan Middle School are still forcibly occupied, making it difficult for the schools to reopen. Regarding tuition fees, the current rates are: Kindergarten around 30,000 yuan, Lower Elementary 35,000, Upper Elementary 40,000, Junior High 110,000 (230,000 with boarding), High School 120,000 (240,000 with boarding), University 250,000 (400,000 with boarding). Additionally, the Municipal Government had previously set the tuition for National Schools and private elementary schools to be collected in rice. It has now been approved to convert to cash at a rate of 45,000 yuan per stone of rice.

Zhengshi Middle School Reopens; Founded in 1931, it was Solely Established by Du Yuesheng The private Zhengshi Middle School in this city was founded in 1931 by Du Yuesheng. It was known for its dedicated teaching and strict discipline. It closed down in protest during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Now, with the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of peace, the school's board of directors has decided to reopen immediately, continuing its consistent principles. The school has built spacious school buildings and dormitories on Anhe Temple Road, with perfect facilities, making it one of the best private schools. With the dramatic increase in the number of students in the city this semester, public and private schools are struggling to accommodate them. Zhengshi Middle School's reopening at this time is undoubtedly good news for the secondary education sector!

1946 National Education Statistics Still Limited to the Nineteen Provinces and Cities in the Rear; Total Number of Schools Reaches 237,000 [Our Newspaper, Nanjing News] Since the implementation of the National Education Plan in 1940, primary education in China has made rapid progress. At the beginning of the National Education implementation, it was only limited to the nineteen provinces and cities in the rear at the time: Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Henan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xikang, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Chongqing. Since the victory last year, other provinces have begun to promote National Education. Therefore, the statistics on National Education are currently limited to these nineteen provinces and cities.

A Chorus of Calls to Rescue Out-of-School Children; Severe Shortage of Educational Opportunities Prompts Responses from All Sectors [Our Newspaper Report] The severe shortage of educational opportunities in the city has worsened since the incident a few days ago when elementary school students in Tanggu Road, Hongkou, demanded enrollment and vandalized school facilities. It is reported that the authorities are paying close attention to this and will take emergency measures to rescue out-of-school children. Here are the dynamics of various parties:

Intensifying Donation Drives The Education Loan Committee's work is reaching a saturation point due to the imminent opening of the National Goods Market. To widely promote the market's donation tickets, it has mobilized schools at all levels throughout the city to organize donation teams and launch promotional efforts. Most schools have achieved excellent results, but a few schools have not yet begun donation efforts. The committee today sent letters to these schools, urging them to work together to complete this dual mission of rescuing out-of-school children and promoting national goods. The committee requests that all donation teams settle accounts by the 31st. As for the goods sold for charity obtained by the donation teams, they should be sent to the committee before the 30th to clear records and facilitate organization.

Accelerating the Establishment of Civilian Schools To accelerate the promotion of supplementary education for out-of-school civilians and rescue out-of-school children, the Municipal Education Bureau is not only widely running literacy classes for the public but also actively increasing the number of municipal civilian schools. Fifty schools were established last semester, and twenty new schools have been added recently. Deputy Director Li simultaneously met with the principals and head teachers of each school yesterday (29th) afternoon at 4 PM to hold emergency discussions. Furthermore, due to the large number of school-age children in the North Sichuan Road area, the existing number of National Schools is insufficient to accommodate them. The Municipal Education Bureau has specially allocated part of the school buildings in the Yokohama Bridge Municipal Drama Experimental School to establish a new National School. Gu Zhongyi, Chen Baotai, and Li Jianwu have been appointed as preparatory personnel to prepare for enrollment as soon as possible, with classes starting at the same time as other schools.

Granting Tuition Loans Early According to the city bank, the method for providing tuition loans to impoverished students this semester has been decided to start early next Monday. Elementary schools are eligible to borrow 80,000 yuan, and universities are eligible to borrow 240,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 1.2% per month for a term of six months. However, these loans are limited to the children of impoverished families.

Preferential Treatment for Children of Public Servants To show consideration for the enrollment of children of public servants and teachers, the municipal government has issued the following key points for preferential treatment: (1) Children of public servants and teachers should be given priority admission to municipal schools. (2) Private schools should give priority to admitting children of public servants and teachers for free within 20% of their free places. (3) Applications can be made to the municipal bank for loans. The Municipal Education Bureau has been notified to comply with these measures.

Tennis Singles Finals: Tao Guanqiu Retires Mid-Match Due to Cramps; Carson Wins Men's Championship; Carson Leads 2-1; Fourth Set Incomplete; Luo Feishi Wins Women's Championship [Our Newspaper Report] The men's and women's singles championships of the first Grass Tennis Tournament were decided yesterday. Carson won the Shanghai Men's Singles Championship, and Miss Luo Feishi won the Shanghai Women's Singles Championship. In yesterday's final, Carson was leading 2-1 in sets. When Tao Guanqiu was leading 3-0 in the fourth set, Tao suddenly suffered cramps in his hands and feet. Massage was ineffective, and he was unable to continue, announcing his retirement, which was a great pity. Miss Luo Feishi won two straight sets against Miss Zhu Zhiying. Both the men's and women's finals were quite exciting and fiercely competitive, a rare sight in the past decade. The audience was also very enthusiastic, with nearly 2,000 people, creating an unprecedented scene. The awards were presented by Mr. Huang Shaojiang. The men's and women's singles champions each received a silver cup from Mayor Wu, and the runners-up Tao Guanqiu (men) and Zhu Zhiying (women) each received a silver cup from the Tennis Committee. The final results are as follows:

Miss Luo: Calm and Composed; The women's final began at 4:25 PM, with Zhou Jiaqi as the referee. After a 2-2 tie, Miss Luo won two consecutive games. Although Miss Zhu won one game, Luo won another three consecutive games, taking the first set 6-3. In the second set, Miss Luo became even more stable, hitting the ball calmly. Miss Zhu, under the opponent's aggressive shots, made many mistakes and seemed flustered. Luo won four consecutive games to lead 5-1, and then won another game to win the set 6-2. Miss Luo had ample court experience, and her shots were beautiful and impressive. Miss Zhu seemed to be a bit lacking. Luo Feishi 6-3, 6-2 Zhu Zhiying

Men's Singles: Exciting Performance; The men's senior singles final began, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Carson served, and Tao Guanqiu took the lead with 3-1 and 4-1. Carson then began to come to the net and won a game. After Tao Guanqiu lost his service game in the eighth game, Carson took the lead with 5-4 and finally won the first set 7-5. In the second set, Carson continued to aggressively attack with his signature net play. His half-volley shots in front of the net were a sight to behold. Carson won the second set 6-2 with ease, leading 4-1 and 5-2. Tao Guanqiu made many mistakes and was already showing signs of fatigue, unable to resist. In the third set, the server won each game. Carson touched the net three times while coming to the net, giving away the seventh game. Mao Nun took back one set 6-3. After the break, it was hoped that Mao Nun would regain his momentum, but unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered cramps after winning three consecutive games, which was extremely unfortunate. Carson's performance was quite exciting. His groundstrokes were stable, his backhand was reliable, and his serve and net play were all excellent. Mao Nun's achievement was also commendable. It is said that Tao's performance yesterday was inferior to his usual level.

Personnel Adjustment in the Twenty-First District; The 21st District Office (Xinshiwei) of this city has recently been ordered that the director of the Household Administration Section shall not concurrently hold positions in other sections. Therefore, adjustments have been made to the civil affairs, household administration, culture, and economic sections within the district. The Director-General concurrently serves as the Director of the Economic Section, while the Civil Affairs Section also serves as the Director of the Cultural Section. The Director of the Household Administration Section is a full-time position, so as to comply with the regulations without affecting the organizational structure, and the adjustments were made on the 22nd of this month.

Moreover, the territory of the district was completely occupied after 1937, and residents fled. After the victory, when the district office was established, only 13 districts were organized, with a population of just over 20,000. Now that peace has lasted for a long time, the district people who fled have returned to their hometowns one after another, and the population has been increasing every month. Each district has also applied to add to its subdivisions, so the district office will apply to the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Office for approval to add new districts as needed.

It also stipulates that the 3rd and 18th of each month are district affairs examples, and that district affairs staff should gather at the district office for work reports. In addition to reporting to the municipal government, the district office also ordered each district to implement these methods.

Furthermore, in order to promote production, the office has organized a production committee, formulated organizational regulations, and invited local enthusiasts or professionals to serve as committee members. This will be carried out soon. Furthermore, District Chief Chen Zhijing has gone to Beijing for business and has taken a four-day leave of absence, temporarily replaced by Deputy District Chief Long Yuan.

Now that the twenty-first district has been divided, the joint district office and the chief district chief have also been adjusted. It is said that Jiang Yinxiang, the chief district chief of the eleventh and thirteenth districts, is the chief district chief of the joint district office of the eleventh and thirteenth districts, and Zhu Yixing, the chief district chief of the twelfth district, is the chief district chief of the joint district office of the twelfth and fourteenth districts.

Q&A on Household Registration Laws and Regulations (Continued)

(54) Question: What should be done if someone has lived in a place for more than six months but has no intention of registering as a resident?

Answer: There is no mandatory requirement to register as a resident in the Household Registration Law. If someone has a permanent residence elsewhere and does not wish to register as a resident in their current place of residence, they can register as a temporary resident.

(55) Question: A young child who lives with their sister's husband for life will return to their clan after reaching adulthood. How should this be recorded in the household registration?

Answer: A young child who lives with their sister's husband is only temporarily living together. In the household registration book, it should be temporarily recorded as "fostered." After the child reaches adulthood and moves out, then registration as a resident should be done.

(56) Question: Mr. A has a wife and one son. After Mr. A dies, his wife marries another man into the household and has another son. What should be the order and designation of their household registration?

Answer: According to Article 1059, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the subsequent child should be registered with their mother's surname. When registering, the wife is the head of the household, and the sons born before and after should be registered in order.

(3) Personal Registration Category

(57) Question: Both "waiting-for-husband" daughters-in-law and concubinage are not permitted by law. How should personal registration be handled?

Answer: The household registration of "waiting-for-husband" daughters-in-law should be handled in accordance with that of child brides. Concubinage registration can be based on the effective date of the Family Law of the Civil Code, and they should be registered separately as concubines and family members.

The Civil Affairs Office recently responded to Tang Dezhen that if a household plaque is lost, a detailed account of the reasons for the loss and the facts should be prepared, and a certificate of loss should be obtained from the local district chief and reported to the local district office for investigation and reissue.

Yarn Prices Adopt a Flexible Approach; Unified Distribution Rumors Dispelled; Centralized Distribution to Be Implemented Today; Future Yarn Market to Shift with Textile Construction [Our Newspaper Report] The procedures for the centralized distribution of yarn by private mills have been prepared and will begin today. Notices have been issued to yarn-using factories, aiming to assist the government in implementing policies to balance supply and demand. It is hoped that everyone will work together to eliminate speculation, eliminate hoarding, suppress price gouging, and stabilize prices. The "Provisional Measures for the Sale of Cotton Yarn by Shanghai Yarn Mills" have been announced, listing eight articles, clearly outlining the procedures for application, approval, payment, and allocation of goods. Applicants can receive notice of approval on the same day, and payment should be made the next day. Mills can distribute the sold yarn successively ten days after receiving payment. The measures also stipulate that applicants who fail to pay as agreed will have their application资格 cancelled. These measures are more favorable to sellers than textile construction. However, since the news of this large-scale distribution, yarn prices have fallen. This is because after the foreign exchange changes, mills have been unwilling to open up more supply.

Yarn Changed to 400 Pounds per Bale; According to market insiders, the yarn produced by mills has traditionally weighed 420 pounds per bale, but now it has been uniformly changed to 400 pounds, with no extra small bundles added. In reality, the amount distributed has been reduced. It is said that this has been agreed to by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As for the requirement to pick up goods after ten days of payment, which can then be delayed to ten or more days or even a month, with the power in the hands of the mills, it is believed that other countermeasures are needed to prevent speculation. Yarn and cloth merchants have inquired about the standard for distribution pricing, and the answer is that a flexible approach will be adopted to respond to market changes. Therefore, the market is speculating about future yarn price changes. Yesterday, Textile Construction opened its supply with no change in posted prices.

Bidding Method Fails to Suppress Black Market; However, in addition to distribution, another bidding method is set, where the price is determined by the purchaser, with the highest bidder winning. In reality, this is selling at black market prices. Yesterday, several hundred bolts of chicken fine cloth were bid away by a certain household. This method has been used in the past, but since the foreign exchange changes, a policy of fixed prices and public allocation has been adopted. The sudden return to black market bidding has attracted much attention in the market. Well-informed sources said that private mills originally planned to centrally distribute 20,000 bales of private yarn and 10,000 bales of state-owned yarn, but state-owned mills have now indicated that they do not have such a large amount of yarn in stock. Private mills have also withdrawn their proposal to centrally distribute 20,000 bales. Mills continue to use the word "flexible" as the standard for determining the quantity of yarn to be distributed at any time. It is difficult to predict when the distribution will be completed. According to recent past performance, Textile Construction can produce 20,000 bales of yarn per month, but one-third of its spindles are not in operation. Private mills can produce 40,000 bales of yarn per month, but one-quarter of their spindles are not in operation. Some private mills have a large number of futures orders. It is difficult to predict how much spot goods will be available in the near future. Observers with authority pointed out that a concrete method for state-owned and private mills to cooperate in stabilizing yarn and cloth prices has not yet been established. However, Textile Construction has gained some control over private mills. In the future, the attitude of private mills will shift with the will of Textile Construction.

Various Yarn Mills Establish Sales Methods; The Provisional Measures for the Sale of Cotton Yarn by Shanghai Yarn Mills, established by the Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, are as follows: (1) Customers who purchase cotton yarn are temporarily limited to existing customers of each mill. (2) The above customers, who have a genuine need to purchase cotton yarn, should first fill out an application form to the mill they usually deal with, stating the grade, quantity, and purpose of the yarn they intend to purchase. (The application form is attached separately and can be printed by each mill.) The amount of the application must be limited to actual needs. If there is speculation or false reporting, the amount should be reduced or the application资格 cancelled. (3) After receiving the purchase application, each mill must first determine whether the application quantity is accurate based on the customer's previous purchase record. If it is untrue, it should be corrected at any time. The association will decide the quantity and standard price (based on 20s 400-pound double horse standard) and notify each mill by 4 PM on the same day, which will then inform the applicant. Each mill and applicant shall not increase or decrease the decided quantity and price on their own. (4) If there is any remaining amount of cotton yarn to be sold by each mill, the association will allocate it on its behalf. (5) After receiving the notice, the applicant should immediately sign a transaction contract with the mill and pay the full amount in cash the next day. (6) Each large bale of cotton yarn sold by each mill shall weigh 400 pounds, and each small bale shall weigh 10 pounds, with no extra small bundles added. (7) The cotton yarn decided to be sold shall be distributed successively ten days after the payment date. (8) If the applicant does not fulfill the contract or make payment after receiving the decision notice, the association may cancel their application 资格.

With Effective Control and Tight Credit, Gold Prices Unable to Rise; U.S. Dollar Also Continues to Fall by 20 Yuan; Yesterday's spot gold market was generally stable. It opened lower at 2,075,000 yuan, and there was still selling pressure. Buyers lacked interest and closed positions, gradually pushing prices down to a low of 2,040,000 yuan. Support then emerged, aided by actual sales from jewelry stores, and prices rebounded. After 10 AM, the Central Bank released 193 bars at 2,070,000 yuan. Prices then rose to 2,085,000 yuan before stabilizing. Around noon, prices hovered around 2,060,000 yuan. The afternoon market showed improvement, but prices ultimately fell by 20,000 yuan. Jewelry was listed at 20,000 yuan. Silver ingots and silver dollars showed little change. Hidden credit tightness persisted, with interest rates ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 cents. The Central Bank is still controlling the gold market. However, some retail investors speculated that the Central Bank was buying at low prices, creating uncertainty. Foreign currency fluctuations were limited. The U.S. dollar opened at 3,350 yuan with sellers. Prices fell to 3,320 yuan before stabilizing. At noon, prices hovered between 3,330 yuan and 3,350 yuan. The afternoon market showed slight uncertainty, but there were no significant changes. Prices ultimately fell by 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rose to 139.5 yuan due to telegram transfers. Supply was slightly abundant, and prices retreated from 730 yuan to around 710 yuan. Prices ultimately fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange was transacted at 720 yuan. Indian exchange was 865 yuan to 875 yuan. British exchange was offered at 11,600 yuan with no demand. The U.S. dollar had posted prices, but there were few transactions.

Chinese Stocks Recover from Weakness, Foreign Stocks See Strong Buying; Chinese stocks rebounded slightly, with some short covering. After opening lower, prices gradually recovered. Yongxin Yarn reached a low of 645 yuan, American Asia 3,580 yuan, Jingfu 215 yuan, Xinguang 235 yuan, and Qinxing 158 yuan. After opening, prices were maintained by short covering and recovered from weakness. At their highest points, Yongxin Yarn reached 672 yuan, American Asia 3,900 yuan, Jingfu 243 yuan, Xinguang 270 yuan, and Qinxing 188 yuan.

A Spring and Autumn Discourse on Edgar Allan Poe by Liu Huiwei

Edgar Allan Poe was an astonishing genius in American literary history, but he lived a life of poverty. Early in his life, he was expelled from the University of Virginia for gambling and drinking. Later, he was court-martialed and expelled from West Point because he ignored regulations and sat in his room writing poetry when he should have been practicing with a gun on the parade ground.

Poe was orphaned early and adopted by a wealthy merchant. Eventually, even this merchant drove his adopted son away and left him no money in his will. Poe's marriage is one of the most beautiful stories in literary history. His wife, Virginia Clemm, was his longest-serving cousin. After their marriage, they were very poor. Poe drank strong, raw wine. His sister was insane. Some said Poe was also half-mad. He was twice his wife's age. He was twenty-six, and she was only thirteen. One would expect their marriage to have disastrous results, but in fact, it was a successful romance. Poe loved his child-like wife very much, and because of this eternal love, he wrote several immortal poems in English.

Poe's poems and stories are literary treasures, but he could not earn bread with them. His "The Raven" was written continuously for ten years, and he sold it for only ten U.S. dollars – one year of work worth one U.S. dollar.

In the Grand Concourse area of New York, there is a cottage where Poe and his wife lived. When Poe rented this cottage more than ninety years ago, it was a dilapidated house on the verge of collapse. Now it is surrounded by apartments. But at that time, the cottage was located in the countryside. It was hidden among apple trees. When spring arrived, the air was filled with the fragrance of cherry blossoms and the buzzing of bees. It was a beautiful, dream-like setting.

Poe rented this cottage for three dollars a month. However, Poe could not even pay this small sum. He often did not pay the rent. His wife was suffering from tuberculosis. He could not even afford food for her. Sometimes, they went for days without eating anything. When dandelions bloomed in the yard, they picked some, cooked them, and ate the dandelion flowers. They lived like this day after day.

When the neighbors discovered that Poe and his wife were truly starving, they sent them some food, which was truly pitiful. But he had the genius to write poetry, and she was a passionate soul. Although they were poor, they were very happy.

Virginia died in January not long after. In the months before her death, she slept on a straw mat, without enough clothing to keep her warm. When she was too cold, her mother rubbed her hands, and Poe rubbed her feet. He covered her shivering body with an old military uniform he wore at West Point. At night, he coaxed his cat to sleep at her feet.

After she died, Poe had no money for a funeral. If it were not for the help of neighbors, she might have been sent to a pauper's cemetery.

Virginia died in January. A few months later, spring came, the moon rose in the apple trees, and the stars shone in the western sky. Poe sat and remembered his Virginia. Because of this remembrance, he wrote one of the most beautiful love poems:

The bright moon,
Brings me dreams of my beautiful love;
The starlight is brilliant,
Like the glances of my love's bright eyes.
I sleep beside my love all night,
She is my lover, my life, my bride,
She is in the grave by the sea,
In the grave by the murmuring sea.

### Ballad Selling by Zhu Yan

"Spring and Autumn Match" is on stage. This was originally a sallow-faced girl who slipped out from behind the curtain sideways. A thunderous applause burst out, shouting at her. Now she is made up with a face full of greasepaint, charcoal, and rouge, plus her original beautiful contours, dressed as a classical beauty. Already a half-mature girl, understanding a little about love and hate, having performed hundreds of different character scenes, she does not appear flustered at all, following the mechanical scene: "Da, da, da, de da da, da," adhering to an absolute standard, moving lightly and enchantingly, walking to the opening of the stage illuminated by countless electric lights.

Flipping her water sleeves gracefully, she carefully recites the introduction. Her voice is indeed what her profession considers a good asset, although it is a bit sharp, but the trailing sound has a lingering charm. "Good—" A particularly long, provocative shout made her heart flutter, and she couldn't help but cast a surprised glance in the direction of the sound. There, a short, fat fellow with a sweaty face was grinning foolishly. Many spectators were also shocked by the good voice of this shout, and everyone looked at him. When this high-spirited fellow noticed the actress's gaze, he shouted strangely without thinking, "Yo—yo!" As a result, the people in the entire small theater were overjoyed, and laughter was everywhere.

This is the reason why people are busily squeezing into the theater. A wonderful scene passed, people cracked melon seeds, drank tea, and chatted; waiting for another wonderful performance with both the main and supporting actors. People are so intoxicated as if they have lost their hearts; releasing their thoughts and souls, temporarily amusing themselves.

The girl calmed her heart, step by step playing her role. At this time, the old hag playing the stepmother aroused her sympathy. This skinny figure with a white nose struggles to speak as a villain, gnashing his teeth. A thick vein on his neck is bulging, and a red sore growing between his neck and shoulder is about to burst open due to the muscle twitching. "Alas, what a fate you have!" the girl thought innocently. However, when this clown picked up the family law and whipped her fiercely, she had a painful and real feeling. "Ouch—" she cried, twitching her shoulders, as if it were real. When she sang "Oh, my mother," strings of tears hung on her greasepaint-covered cheeks!

She was not acting; she was crying to her heart's content, lamenting the sorrow and melancholy of her small heart. There was nothing more enjoyable than this. On the stage, she had the opportunity to indulge in her resentment and sentimentality. Therefore, although she was only in her teens, she had a preference for tragedy; although a forced smile could win more and better applause.

However, she would not be too sad, forgetting that she was acting. The scenes and supporting actors would remind her intentionally or unintentionally; the biggest reason was that when she was playing her life, a pair of fierce and stern eyes were always watching her. Behind the curtain of the stage door, wasn't there always a pair of eagle-like eyes staring at her? It belonged to a fat, pig-like woman, who was her heartless stepmother who always held the family law.

This girl understood a little about love and hate. The elegant and handsome young man in the third scene also gave her a sense of reality. She needed a little love to nourish her. As a fellow actor on the same stage, he was a real gentle and handsome person. She shyly lowered her head, reciting the ancient words of love, trying to swim into the river of love that she had never been to before. This was very moving! People appreciated it, and those who did not shout also shouted, as if they were satisfied.

When the girl was unknowingly floating, a line of lyrics unintentionally went wrong, which was an irreparable mistake. The drummer frowned and accommodated her a little. The string player immediately gave her a "screw"—he was the teacher, after all. Don't look down on this ghostly fellow; he had the ability to teach this set of skills. She was shocked and returned to the reality of acting, singing the scene carefully, word by word, movement by movement.

After removing her makeup and wiping her face with hot water, she had just put on her half-old floral cloth gown when a solid, heavy, and scalding slap hit her still sallow and thin cheek.

"Damn you, you stupid bug! You messed up a line in Nan Bangzi! You're throwing away thirty thousand, you're losing face for your whole life!" the pig-like woman roared, waving her hands.

The girl felt wronged, habitually pouting her mouth. She wanted to say, "I only took ten thousand! You took two hundred and ninety thousand!" "I can sing! I'm not running away, I'm..." However, she couldn't say it. The eagle's eyes were staring at her so fiercely, and she really looked like a shrinking chick. She swallowed her grievances, enduring the too many tears in her eyes.

"Good!" Another frenzy of applause erupted in the front, directed at another girl who had taken the stage.

This is how they spent many, many years!

### On Art Criticism by Yan Wenliang

Creation and criticism occupy equally important positions in art. Creators can intuitively express a kind of beauty based solely on their personal environment, personality, and era background, while art discussion cases are not limited to one kind of art, but more importantly, possess multiple conditions and multiple knowledge, using different methods and angles to evaluate and accurately judge. In other words, artists only express and crystallize ideas, while art critics are purely spokespersons for artists; or more closely, guiding mentors. Therefore, if it is said that the cultivation of critics is ten thousand times more difficult than that of creators, it is not an exaggeration.

Everyone acknowledges that the conditions for the prosperity of art naturally require the emergence of outstanding artists for the most part; but another condition is that without the encouragement and supervision of critics, it is often impossible for art to reach a more exquisite and ideal realm. Ruskin's magnificent and precise art criticism held a powerful center in the European art scene, at least to the extent that his remarks influenced several eras without change. The highest criticism never considers the methods and techniques of artistic expression, but is determined solely by the feelings that artistic works give to each individual.

Of course, creators sometimes develop a kind of emotion based on simple personal impressions, and carve it into art. Directly or without any decoration, it is often refined through the training of critics, or even cut out with more emotion. This kind of emotion may be even more inexpressible than that of the creator. This is very possible. Therefore, Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" was almost destroyed at one point, but it has finally been preserved to this day as an indelible value of art criticism.

Art criticism is almost an art in itself. Moreover, it builds a beautiful paradise in the world seen by ordinary eyes more profoundly. The poet Longfellow, after arriving in Rome, had his beautiful poems filled with many timeless satisfactions, songs, and praises for art. Millet's "The Gleaners," that crude man, would not have been noticed if he had not been praised by the poet Théophile Thoré, and that masterpiece would have been overlooked.

Art critics should break all prejudices and overthrow all typical standards. Scales can measure the nature of every object, but when used in art, it somewhat limits it with a certain scale. Once there is a typical concept, it is easy to fall into fixed patterns. Yuan Zicai's discussion of poetry in the past said it well: "Poetry is just each person's temperament, it has nothing to do with the Tang and Song dynasties." Fixed patterns are not necessarily bad, but it is easy to fall into "sticking to old ways," which is natural. Because the path to art is never limited to one way. Wang Chong once said in his autobiography: "The children of a hundred families do not have the same parents, they are born in different ways and do not necessarily look alike. Each has its own gifts and is good in its own way." Art has this kind of phenomenon. They are born in different ways and do not necessarily look alike, as long as each has its own gifts. Therefore, art critics should abandon their own scales, which may also be very important.

Of course, the conditions for possessing an art critic are not limited to one way. Other things, such as keen senses and attentive cultivation, are also many important conditions. Even more so, a kind heart and noble mind are also necessary conditions for a true art critic. No matter what kind of art is being criticized, even if it does not agree with the critic's personal will, he should sincerely point out his faults, abandon the concept of personal hatred, and make the receiver feel as cordial and pleasant as meeting an old friend. With such a result, all art can enter the correct path and the prosperity of art can be expected.

### Ode to Woodcut Work by Yang Mou

Work, work, new vitality injected into the blood vessels, this simple stroke is so exciting, tempting, and influencing me.

Without work, life is just dregs. Without work, life is just like a zither without a score, vulgar, disorganized, noisy, and boring. If work stops, doesn't the meaning of the entire life suddenly stop?

Work will drag me down, but the hollow eye sockets are filled with pleasant brilliance. Fatigue will come in waves, but endless confidence is supporting me. Work encompasses happiness, it illuminates the path of life.

There is no greater pain in the world than having no work. In short, it's boring, boring, boring...

Isn't everyone aspiring and hopeful for themselves? Work is the medium. Without work, everything is just an illusion, everything is empty. Work fairly praises everyone, it engraves everyone's hard work and laziness.

Work encourages everyone's vitality, work guarantees that the world will not perish. Humanity is advancing, the world is progressing, because there is work, work creates warmth, and isn't the gloomy air all cleared away?

Work, isn't everyone praising it? Knowing that all work will bring fatigue and hard work, but who shrinks back?

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood by Ye Jingfeng 18

In the tense situation at the time, I couldn't care whether it was a fact or an illusion, I just thought about the second step.

"Let's go, old man?" It was still a child's voice.

"No, we have to move these two guys to the car and send them to the small river in front." This was the latter part of my plan. The first part, of course, was still thinking of relying on my school pistol, using the accurate means I had practiced, to shoot the two of them. But judging from the facts that have already happened, my plan may be a failure; because these two teammates have already preempted the opportunity. At most, we and the other party can only achieve an equal opportunity. In other words, if it weren't for Little Tiger's actions being so swift and agile, pushing me aside, maybe I could have hit them both, and Little Tiger and I might have each eaten a bullet from them.

After the latter part of my plan was implemented, I drove the car back; after passing the place where the fierce fight had just taken place, I slowed down the speed by less than half a mile. Little Tiger and I got out of the car; and the car continued to move forward freely; after running not far, it turned into the field on its own.

At this time, it was about the eighth or ninth day of the sixth lunar month. There should have been a moon, but the cloud cover was quite thick, and I still couldn't see anything clearly, I could only distinguish the path in front of my feet. In order to avoid the patrols, I had to abandon the road and pick a secluded field, walking towards the sparsely lit places. The tense nerves gradually returned to normal.

After walking for half an hour, thinking that I had avoided the firing line and other dangers, I picked the foot of a small grave and sat down.

"Did you take everything?" I thought of my pistol and Little Tiger's pocket.

"Our things?...They're all here." As if by magic, Little Tiger pulled out my pistol from his belt and pulled out that precious cloth pocket from behind, still full, "And I got two other things." Saying that, he pulled out the flashlight he had just used, and a small knife—a rather exquisite Japanese small purse.

"This gun?" I took the pistol, wanting to ask him when he had picked it up.

"When we moved those two guys to the top of the car, I picked it up next to the front wheel, pressed it on my waist, and forgot!"

"Didn't we turn off the lights earlier?" I suspected how he could see clearly—the gun was black, and the dirt on the ground was also black.

"I can see even if it's darker, my grandfather said I have cat's eyes—innate."

"Look what time it is now," I wanted to test his special eyes, and turned my wrist to show him my watch.

"Eight forty...minutes."

I took his trophy flashlight and shone it on it, and it was indeed exactly right. I thought of the child's big eyes with more black than white, which seemed to be a special gift. But when I was studying life, I don't remember having this article. Maybe this is an exceptional example, not recorded in the war.

"So, walking at night is the same as walking during the day?" Surprise and curiosity were mixed together.

### Free Talk: The Need to Read by Shaofu

We cannot take the destruction of the Sixteenth National School on Tanggu Road by students lightly. The seriousness contained in this incident is apparent.

The reason why the students destroyed the school is as follows—

Private school tuition is high. The school stipulates that no tuition is charged, so the number of new students who applied for the exam reached more than 2,200. The school authorities, in addition to continuing the 600 old students, had a balance of only more than 300 students. Yesterday, 300 new students were admitted, but there were still 1,900 who were not on the list. So they jointly asked Principal Qian to "We all want to study medicine, please help us, Principal;" However, due to classroom capacity and funding issues, the request could not be accepted, and a destruction scene occurred.

Students' actions may be reckless, but the motive cannot be denied as pure. If the educational authorities do not quickly seek effective solutions to this problem, I am afraid that such incidents will not only occur at the Sixteenth National School.

We have repeatedly called for the tuition fees of private schools to be too expensive, and we have also requested the authorities to pay attention to the pain of students wandering around without being able to enter school; after all, only a small number of wealthy families' children can study in private schools, and letting education become the exclusive right of the nobility is by no means something that the authorities can remain silent on. If the authorities cannot popularize education to the public, this is not only a dereliction of duty, but also a sin, creating all the sins of society.

The lack of educational funding is the fundamental reason, and in the paper drunk gold fan big Shanghai, to let students have no school to read, as Shanghai people should feel ashamed; although the respect for teachers movement has ended, the loan student fund is still going on, wealthy friends, in addition to your own children, can you think about other people's children and take out some money—

We want to expand the loan student fund movement, don't think that your own children can have schools to enter. If the majority of out-of-school youths become angry and resentful and wish to be equal with regard to everything, if everyone has no school to enter, is it a blessing to society?

In addition to this, we also contribute a little opinion. Can all schools in Shanghai, whether public or private, add night schools? (With the same curriculum and qualifications as day schools) In this way, can the classroom capacity problem be solved?

In short, we must not ignore this matter, and we must not use bureaucratic means to perfunctorily deal with it.

### Occasional Thoughts in Early Autumn by Gao Wuhong

Summer lazily left with its tail dragging, followed by autumn. "The west wind rises, the sky is blue, the chrysanthemums cover the ground, the wild geese fly south." Looking at the scenery in front of me, I really feel a mix of emotions. Although the weather is still hot, the poor are already worrying about winter clothes; "The whole family is in the west wind, and the food and clothing for September have not yet been cut!"

The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon, and all kinds of mooncakes stand in the windows of food companies, casting proud glances at people, seemingly saying: "Who has the strength to move me back!" Miss Mooncake, don't be carried away, the person who moves you back is going to eat you, but the people who linger in front of the window all day long, looking at you with longing eyes, are carefully appreciating your beauty and thinking of you day and night.

"China is starving, Shanghai is dancing,"

But just dancing is simply a "scene of prosperity." Is this "prosperity" fanned up by a small number of people? Can you say no? To raise money for refugees, "Miss" elections are held, and after "Queen," this trick has been adopted by foreigners. When Warner Company celebrates its 20th anniversary, it plans to hold a "Standard Beauty Contest" in Shanghai and invite all young women in the city who are twenty years old to watch the event for free. The period for electing "Standard Beauty" is predicted by the author to be around Double Ten Day this year; because Warner Company is celebrating its 20th anniversary, and the selected young woman is twenty years old, three Double Tens should be put together.

In this way, the already selected "Shanghai Miss" and "Queen" become questionable.

After the "Standard Beauty" is elected, what other tricks will be played in Shanghai in 1940?

Shanghai's urban plan has a 25-year target and a 50-year preparation. It's truly great!

Others have five-year plans and ten-year plans, but we only have one plan to build a great Shanghai, which is fifty years, enough to make others' five-year plans and ten-year plans pale in comparison.

Why not just set it for one hundred years? "A century of great plans," isn't that better? Many of China's "first-class scholars" are not always saying: "My plan will definitely be realized in a hundred years." "My works will definitely be popular all over the world in a hundred years."

People's hearts are sad, etiquette is lost, and the loyalty between people is not as good as a dog, so dogs are used to revitalize people's hearts. If you don't believe it, look at the advertisement for "Loyal Dog Saves Master." Doesn't it say: "Meritorious service to the world, encourages people's hearts. It will move you to tears!"

Drama advertisements have also become like movies. Colorful films are popular, so the advertisement for "Peacock Gallbladder" comes up with a "colorful, magnificent, luxurious, and incomparably sad, tragic historical tragedy." Why not say seven colors or ten colors?

### No Need to Race Horses by Zuo Qi

If Shanghai is compared to a human body, in addition to the black Suzhou River being like a festering appendix, then horse racing should be the lungs of Shanghai.

The health and well-being of the human body depend greatly on the soundness of the lungs. In order not to let Shanghai's lungs rot, we sincerely hope that the municipal authorities will seriously consider the application to resume horse racing, and hope that the conversion to a park can be implemented as soon as possible!

### It's Not a Small Matter Concerning the Public Interest of Citizens by —Trademark —Hen Xin

It was reported that at 3:40 pm on August 26, a sick discharged soldier was found by an inspector from the Huangpu Sub-bureau, who used a police car to transport him to Renji Hospital. At that time, the hospital refused to accept him because there were no empty beds in the ward. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital, which was also refused for the same reason. He was then sent to the Red Cross Hospital, but was still refused because the beds were full. Finally, he was sent to Hongen Hospital, but was also refused on the pretext that the beds were full. After many transfers and throws, he traveled east and west. By 8 pm, this seriously ill soldier with ragged clothes had traveled all over the major hospitals in Shanghai, but had no chance to receive medical treatment. After a long journey, he died in the police car.

Hospitals refuse to accept seriously ill patients on the grounds that there are no empty beds. This is a strong contrast to those who receive patients under the guise of recuperation, but are actually turning hospital wards into hotels. Moreover, even if a hospital accepts any patient who needs emergency treatment, the handling fee must be paid in advance before surgery can begin. From these two things, it can be seen that the magic power of "money" is truly great.

Therefore, I think that hospitals in the future do not need to use the Red Cross as a symbol, but may as well use "Confucius's brother" as a trademark.

### My Ideal Wife by Zhiwei

I am studying chemistry. Because I have joined the embrace of the motherland in a remote small mountain town, I have silently let my university process go by unnoticed. In those ordinary four years, I never had a romance. I believe: this is all because of the unstable life, which does not arouse the interest in finding love. Recently, my colleagues always like to joke about me as a "bachelor," so I feel the need to use "finding a love object" to deal with them; today I have drafted several qualifications that my future wife should have, and write them out frankly:

My ideals for my future wife are not demanding at all; the following points will make you understand: will you be my ideal partner. You—

(1) Have received more than ten years of education, and hold a continuously upward view of life.

(2) Able to handle big and small matters calmly.

(3) Believe that the hope for life should gradually step onto the stage of "truth, goodness, and beauty," and have absolutely no desire for vanity.

(4) The appearance does not have to be moving, just not annoying to look at. (Objectively)

(5) Do not indulge in alcohol, mahjong, or poker. When there is time to kill, I am willing to spend it all on books, newspapers, sports, and proper entertainment.

(6) Have a habit of loving cleanliness; but do not often apply cosmetics, paint nail polish and lipstick, or perm your hair into an airplane or other styles.

(7) Do not wear flashy and dazzling clothes; believe that a blue cloth cheongsam and a pair of medium-heeled leather shoes are the most comfortable for usual dress.

(8) Able to manage the home, with a little talent for designing or arranging small rooms.

(9) Have a love for travel.

If you are confident that the above points are not in conflict with you, and you are also interested in interacting with me, then please think about what methods you will use to make me know you; you must use your ingenuity!

### Where Does Sherlock Holmes Come From? by Stodare

Translated by Yu Qiang

Joseph Bell, and many such reasoning is recorded in other articles. Conan Doyle's Edinburgh University classmate Dr. Jones recalled:

"Gentlemen, what ails this man?" Bell suddenly asked the trembling students standing beside him. "You, see, look at him. No, you must not touch him. Use your eyes, - use your ears, use your brain, use your impulse feeling, use your reasoning ability!"

The stuttering student tried his best to say: "Hip joint disease, sir?"

"There is nothing wrong with the hip joint!" Bell replied with disgust. "This man's limp is not due to his hip, but only due to his feet, or rather due to his pair of feet. Have you carefully noticed the cut slits on those shoes, the slits are located where the shoes exert the greatest pressure on the feet. He has corns, gentlemen, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the hip joint. But he is not here to ask us to treat corns, gentlemen, we are not chiropodists. His troubles are more serious than this. This is a symptom of invasive alcoholic toxicity, gentlemen. The red nose, swollen face, bloodshot eyes, trembling hands, convulsive facial muscles, plus the rapid, palpitating, and distinct arteries, all tell us so. But these inferences, gentlemen, must be proven with absolute and concrete evidence. In this case, my diagnosis is proven by the whiskey bottle protruding from the patient's right hand pocket."

To another patient, he once said: Gentlemen, here we have a person who is either cutting corks or chiseling stones. If you use your eyes a little, you will be able to see a slightly hard callus on one side of his index finger, and a thicker callus on the outside of the thumb; "a sure sign that he is doing the former, not the latter."

On another occasion, he expressed his observation: "A fisherman—you notice that although it is late summer and the weather is very hot, this patient is wearing Wellington boots. When he sits on the chair, the boots can be seen clearly. Except for sailors, no one wears Wellington boots in this season. His face is tanned, indicating that he is a coastal sailor, not a deep-sea sailor on the outer ocean. His tan is only caused by one climate - it is still local skin color. A knife sheath is exposed under his upper garment, which is the kind used by fishermen in this area. He is also hiding a wad of tobacco in a deeper corner of his mouth, doing it very skillfully. Gentlemen, the conclusion of these inferences is that he is a fisherman. To further prove the correctness of my diagnosis, as soon as a fishy smell reported his arrival very clearly and stimulated, I noticed many fish scales attached to his clothing and hands."

### Additional Budget for General Expenditures Passed by the Legislative Yuan Yesterday; Lou Tongseng Reports on Conclusions of Economic Policy Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Legislative Yuan held its 306th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Thirty-one committee members were present, with President Sun presiding. First, Lou Tongseng reported on the general situation of the Yuan's nine-member committee (see below). Subsequently, proposals were discussed and the following cases were passed: (1) Draft Organizational Law of the Resources Committee; (2) Amendment to Article 6 of the Order of Merit Regulations; (3) Draft Organizational Regulations for the Southeast Plague Prevention Office; (4) Amendment to the accounting section of the Judicial Yuan Organizational Law; (5) Amended and passed the Draft Special Profit Tax Law for Speculative Activities; (6) Sino-Brazilian Cultural Agreement; (7) Passed the additional budget book for the national general expenditures of the 34th year of the Republic for Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Sichuan, Xikang, Gansu, Chahar, Henan provinces, and Chongqing, Nanjing, Beiping, Shanghai and other eighteen provinces and cities.

Financial and Economic Policy

Lou Tongseng's report briefly stated: The working method of the committee was divided into three types: meetings and discussions, group research, and separate interviews, lasting two months. Ten meetings were held, six of which included inviting responsible persons from the Ministries of Finance, Economy, Food, and Transportation, the Executive Headquarters, the Joint Treasury Board, and the Central Bank to attend and provide explanations. The committee also reviewed the following future work trends: (1) The government lacks a unified policy on financial, economic, and monetary issues. The system is scattered, and each competent authority acts independently, lacking close connection. (2) Authority does not reside within the institutions. Those who have the power to implement do not necessarily have to take responsibility. (3) The government's approach to handling financial and monetary matters is too drastic. For example, the recent adjustment of foreign exchange rates was too large in proportion. Such measures may damage government credibility or stimulate market fluctuations, which is really lacking in consideration. (4) Attention should be paid to research on policy institutions and personnel. The conclusions are: (1) Our view is that the economy comes first, while the administrative authorities' view is that finance comes first. (2) Our focus is on people's livelihoods and the national economy first, while the administrative authorities' focus is on seeking national unification and urgently solving two or three matters. Therefore, we are taking into consideration the entire financial, economic, political, and military situation, so that political and economic normalization does not hinder finance and military affairs.

Two Investigations

Subsequently, Tian Liqingying reported on (A) the investigation into the amount of coarse grain requisitioned by the Food Department this year and the actual situation of military grain quotas. It was found that the Food Department does not have a complete food policy, resulting in a failure to fully consider the interests of both consumers and producers, which is detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihoods. The Food Department should quickly find ways to transport the abundant grain from the rear to the needy areas, stabilize market prices in the sales areas, and reduce the burden on the people. (B) Regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' handling of enemy and puppet assets, the opinions in the investigation report are as follows: (1) Regarding the handling of factories and mines taken over in the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar area, those still under the custody and management of the Office account for more than 70% of all factories and mines, and each factory and mine has not attached a statement of "having materials." (2) Of the 334 units of factories that have been taken over, more than 200 have not started production. (3) The operating conditions of the factories and mines that have resumed production are very good, but they only claim to be "self-sufficient and have a surplus," which is incomprehensible. (2) In the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area, (1) there is no detailed report on the situation in the Anhui area. (2) The types and numbers of factories, mines, companies, and affiliated units taken over in Shanghai have not been listed in detail. (3) There are 176 factories that have resumed production, and they are all textile factories. Whether the rest are in a state of shutdown. (4) The numbers of factory materials returned are not detailed. (5) The method of handling sealed materials is also unknown whether the sale price is known, or whether it has been transferred to the national treasury. (3) In the Hunan-Hubei area, (1) according to the report of the special commissioner, the quantity of materials does not match the original inventory. (2) There are no detailed figures for the factory and mine units taken over in the Hunan area. (4) In the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian area, the value of materials and warehouse materials were not mentioned. Regarding the Taiwan area, according to the report from the area, the assets should be NT$8.6 billion, but currently there are only NT$3.3 billion.

Foreign Exchange Rate

Regarding the Central Bank's recent increase in the foreign exchange rate, this committee believes that the current economic crisis has many long-standing causes. After long-term mutual stimulation, it has accumulated and formed a way to save the situation. There are thousands of clues, but the only main method is to first determine a long-term economic policy. From this, a complete plan should be formulated, and then a set of implementation methods should be determined according to the plan, step by step, and advanced in parallel. The government and the society should work together to promote it, so as to avoid economic catastrophes. A temporary relief method cannot be effective. It must be known that finance is a link in the entire economic life. Financial measures and monetary activities must be in line with the entire economic construction policy to achieve the expected results. If monetary activities do not match financial measures or are not related to economic policy, then this type of monetary activity will only benefit a few people and cannot alleviate the misfortune of most industrial and commercial enterprises, let alone solve the economic crisis of the entire society. In recent years, the administrative authorities have seemed to only pay attention to monetary activities, invisibly leading the entire country to concentrate assets on the buying and selling of gold and US dollars, while ignoring the economic construction that is related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, resulting in the social and economic situation deteriorating. Foreign exchange control is extremely important. The pricing control should be adjusted at any time according to the market supply and demand, which is beneficial to industry and commerce. If a fixed exchange rate remains unchanged for several months, and then suddenly changes, the changed exchange rate will be vastly different, only causing merchants with large amounts of foreign exchange and hoarding large amounts of export goods to make huge profits. As for genuine producers, they benefit very little. The sudden increase in the foreign exchange rate by more than 60% is indeed beneficial to industry and commerce, but the value of the legal currency against foreign currency has also been devalued by more than 60%, stimulating price increases and greatly affecting people's livelihoods. The members of this committee believe that the consideration before this increase in the foreign exchange rate was not thorough enough, and hope that efforts will be made to promote comprehensive remedial measures as soon as possible to prevent the social and economic situation from becoming increasingly dangerous.

### UNRRA Relief Supplies to China to Resume Delivery Soon; American "Agricultural Missionaries" to Arrive in China Next Month

[United Press, Washington, 28th] US Undersecretary of State Clayton said today: UNRRA's relief supplies to China will soon resume normal delivery. He said: The Chinese government is seeking to correct various unsatisfactory conditions in order to improve the distribution of supplies.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] Clayton said: UNRRA's supplies to China, up to June 30 this year, totaled US$194 million, of which food accounted for US$65 million.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 29th] A large batch of materials from the Executive Headquarters recently arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 27th, mostly canned foods such as milk. However, some of these cans were cracked, and maggots were moving inside. The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch immediately cooperated with personnel from the UNRRA office to inspect and select the better cans. The headquarters was asked to instruct on the disposal of the spoiled canned goods. In addition, road openers that have been in Hangzhou for a month have arrived from the Relief Administration, some weighing 15 tons. Hangzhou's cranes can only lift one ton, so they cannot be lifted and used. Efforts are now being made to have people drive the machines out.
