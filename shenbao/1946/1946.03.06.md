### Zou Lu, Bai Chongxi, Wang Zhengting, and Others Demand a Change in Diplomatic Style; Atmosphere at the Plenary Session is Tragic, Indignant, and Exhilarating

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee was held at 3:15 PM on the 5th. 220 committee members were in attendance, presided over by Committee Member He Yingqin. Following the standard procedure of the secretariat reading the minutes of the Fourth Plenary Session, the Chairman announced that Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie would present a diplomatic report, which lasted one and a half hours. After a ten-minute recess, the meeting continued to review the diplomatic report. Committee members Zou Lu, Bai Chongxi, Wang Zhengting, Song Yishan, Hu Qiuyuan, Gu Zheng, and others spoke, all pointing out the errors of secret diplomacy and the urgent need to change the diplomatic style. During the review, the atmosphere at the meeting was tragic, indignant, and exhilarating. The speeches of Zou Lu, Bai Chongxi, and Wang Zhengting were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Minister Wang delivered an oral report on recent diplomatic work at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee on the afternoon of the 5th. The report covered the United Nations organization, the control of Japan, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and the issue of receiving the Northeast, the Vietnam issue, and the issue of protecting overseas Chinese. (1) When reporting on the United Nations organization, Minister Wang said: "The current international situation is extremely unstable, partly due to the lack of full coordination among the major powers in the United Nations, partly due to the emergence of new weapons (the atomic bomb), and especially because of the weakness of the existing United Nations organization. The weakness of the existing United Nations organization is due to the extensive veto power held by the permanent members of the Security Council. However, the instability of the international situation may create a universal demand to strengthen the United Nations organization. Although we are not satisfied with the current state of the United Nations organization, we must pay attention to its future development." (2) Regarding the issue of Japanese control, Minister Wang said: "The Far Eastern Commission and the Four-Power Control Commission, recently agreed upon by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, are a compromise based on the original proposals of the US and Soviet governments. The Chinese government proposed a similar compromise plan in November last year." When discussing the issue of Japanese reparations to the Allied countries, the Minister solemnly stated: "China has been at war the longest and has suffered the greatest losses. Therefore, in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and in the negotiations for receiving the Northeast, Minister Wang presented a report to the General Assembly today. Minister Wang said: "The withdrawal of Soviet troops was originally scheduled to be completed before December 3rd of last year, which is three months from the day of Japan's surrender (September 2nd), in accordance with the deadline for Soviet troop withdrawal stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Agreement. Later, due to the issue of our troops landing in Dalian, no agreement was reached between China and the Soviet Union, and irregular armed forces threatened our receiving personnel in Changchun, Shenyang, and other places, leading to setbacks in the reception. Later, after two rounds of discussions between China and the Soviet Union, it was agreed that February 1st of this year would be the deadline for the completion of the Soviet troop withdrawal from the Northeast. Now that the deadline has passed, the Soviet troops have not yet withdrawn. According to the Soviet side, the delay in the withdrawal of Soviet troops is due to technical difficulties. Our government is currently continuing to urge the Soviet side. In January of this year, the Soviet government made a statement to our government stating that Japanese enterprises in the Northeastern provinces that had served the Kwantung Army should be regarded as Soviet war spoils. Our side believes that all public and private properties of Japanese in China should be regarded as part of Japan's reparations to China, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, the views of China and the Soviet Union on this issue have not yet been consistent. However, the withdrawal of Soviet troops, according to the agreement, does not come with any conditions. Therefore, the existence of this dispute should not constitute the reason for the Soviet Union to delay its withdrawal. Sino-Soviet amity, as the President of our Party said, is not only needed by China and the Soviet Union, but also required for the peace and security of the entire world. I deeply hope that both sides will act in the spirit of amity and friendship to quickly resolve the issue of Soviet troop withdrawal." (4) Finally, Minister Wang explained in detail the issue of our army's withdrawal from Vietnam, and gave a brief report on the new agreements China has recently signed with countries in Central and South America, Thailand, and the Netherlands to protect overseas Chinese.

### Strict Review of Financial, Monetary, and Economic Measures by Various Committee Members; Attention Focused on Gold, Materials, and Other Items

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee was held at 9:15 AM on the 5th. Two hundred and thirty committee members, including Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Ji, Song Ziwen, and Chiang Song Meiling, were in attendance, with Committee Member Sun Ke as the chair. Following the standard procedure of the secretariat continuing to read the minutes of the third meeting and the reporting documents, the Chairman announced the continuation of the review of the financial, monetary, and economic problems reports. There was an extremely enthusiastic response, with a total of 21 oral inquiries and 2 written inquiries. Committee members believed that the Party's principles and political program and policies were extremely correct, but the execution by the responsible agencies was often unsatisfactory, causing the people to have many complaints about the Party. Therefore, based on their observations, they conducted a strict review of various financial, monetary, and economic policies. This courageous and responsible attitude truly demonstrated the Party's spirit of innovation. After the committee members spoke, there were proposals that the General Assembly should not accept the report of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and that the General Assembly should exercise its power of dismissal. There were also proposals to establish a "Committee for the Inventory of Enemy and Puppet Industry Materials". The first two proposals were not passed because the General Assembly had no such provisions, while the latter proposal was announced by the Chairman to be referred to the review committee. Immediately afterwards, the Chairman announced (1) the list of members of the Review Committee for Financial, Monetary, and Economic Issues, with Liu Jianqun, Liu Wen, and Zhao Ping as conveners; (2) the list of members of the Drafting Committee for the General Assembly Declaration, with Sun Ke, Wang Shijie, and Chen Bulei as conveners. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM. The opinions of the committee members on the financial, monetary, and economic problems report are briefly described below:

[] The reasons for the failure of economic measures: (1) Neglecting the Principle of People's Livelihood and cultivating official capital. (2) The failure of economic controls during the War of Resistance. (3) Allowing private industries to survive or perish on their own, without paying attention. (4) Heavy industry almost completely stopped. (5) No effective relief measures for unemployed workers. (6) Many of the personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over were quite derelict. (7) There was no adjustment plan for the surplus or deficit of materials in various places, and there were no appropriate measures to deal with rising prices. (8) No report or plan was heard regarding the post-war economic policy.

[] Production is low, people's livelihood is declining, inflation is rampant, prices are soaring, people are suffering deeply, and the lives of public teachers and soldiers are difficult. This situation can be used to describe administrative efficiency. Factories in the rear have closed down, and most of the factories taken over in the recovered areas have not started operating. The entire economic system is in a state of anarchy. All measures are contrary to the Principle of People's Livelihood. Those who implement the policies should be held responsible. He also explained the meaning of "bureaucratic capital" and requested the separation of officials and merchants and the registration of assets of officials and historians.

[Dai Kuaishi] The Ministry of Finance should pay attention to overseas remittances and should calculate according to the selling price of foreign exchange.

[Ren Xuan] The reports of the Ministries of Finance and Economics both failed to implement Articles 4 and 10 of the Principle of People's Livelihood Political Program as resolved by the Sixth National Congress. Article 4 of the Political Program stipulates that urban land should be owned by the public, and that farmland, except for those operated by the public, should be implemented with the most rapid and effective method of "land to the tillers". All land that is not self-cultivated should be gradually purchased by the state through the issuance of land bonds and then distributed. Article 10 stipulates the registration and restriction of the assets of officials at all levels and personnel of public enterprises, and the thorough implementation of the regulations that officials at all levels are not allowed to engage in commerce. However, the Executive Yuan only annotated this important political program with the word "should be done" and there was no implementation. This kind of bureaucratic style must be reformed.

[Lu Dangping] Please announce the figures for gold trading.

[Peng Zhaoxian] The finance departments of various provinces cannot intervene in land tax revenue and finance and have nothing to do, while the organization of the Land Grain Management Office is too large. This system must be improved. Some tax collection agencies in various provinces do not have enough total income to maintain the operating expenses of the agency. Some tax collections are too harsh. All of this should be thoroughly reorganized. There is no fixed standard for inheritance tax and land tax, and tax rates should also be set.

[Luo Shishi] (1) Regarding the gold policy, what are the gains and losses of the government and the people? (2) Is the establishment of state-run textile companies a solution to the "clothing" problem of the Principle of People's Livelihood? Later, it was announced that state-run companies would be handed over to private ownership after three years. Has this shaken the belief in the Principle of People's Livelihood?

[Liu Weichi] The difference between budget revenue and expenditure is very large. Is it still relying on inflation or are there other ways to make up for it? The foreign exchange fund is limited, so exports must be encouraged and overseas remittances must be used to maintain it for a long time.

[Wu Zhiren] The most serious and difficult economic problem to solve is bureaucratic capital. The Ministry of Economic Affairs should announce the names of bureaucratic capitalists and list them as targets of the revolution. The economic, financial, diplomatic, and transportation sectors should cooperate to solve the current economic and financial problems.

[Zhou Bomin] (1) The salt problem of thousands of millions of people in Guizhou is quite serious. There is a salt shortage everywhere due to the increase in salt prices. The salt prices in various parts of the province also differ greatly. Is it a loss of popular support to increase the selling price of this indispensable food for the people? (2) The suspension of cotton loans in Shaanxi has made it impossible for the people in the cotton-producing areas to maintain production, which is tantamount to encouraging the import of foreign cotton. Is this an economic policy?

[Wu Shaoshu] (1) Prices are soaring everywhere. Some people think that it is due to a lack of materials. Therefore, in Shanghai, they asked the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau established by the Executive Yuan to open warehouses and bid for materials to increase supply. However, who purchased the materials after the bidding, and have they been supplied to the market? This must be investigated. (2) The products of the China Textile Company are priced even higher than the black market. Therefore, there is a slogan in Shanghai that "China Textile" is leading the price increase. (3) Should public officials receive the same treatment? Why do senior officials of the China Textile Company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company receive special treatment? (4) Does the Executive Yuan have a solution to the current problems? If there is no solution, it should resign to the General Assembly.

[Zheng Yitong] (1) The financial powers and responsibilities of the central and local governments should be divided. (2) After the foreign exchange is opened, attention should be paid to a source of continuous supply to avoid creating a black market again. The operating personnel should be strictly disciplined. (3) There should be an overall plan for receiving and using enemy and puppet materials. (4) State-run and private-run companies should be clearly distinguished.

[Wu Tiecheng] (1) Before the war, the small accounts of various banks were mostly transferred to the United States during the war, in addition to investments and loans. At that time, 10,000 legal currency could purchase 3,000 US dollars. Now, when repaying depositors, 10,000 legal currency is only worth 5 US dollars. Another method should be formulated to prevent small depositors from suffering losses. The United States announced that the deposits of Chinese people in the United States amounted to 356 million US dollars, most of which were deposits of various banks in our country. (2) The Enemy and Puppet Property Bureau should quickly supply the market at par to adjust market prices. (3) State-run economic enterprises mostly fail and are criticized as bureaucratic capital. Why not hand over industries necessary for people's livelihood to private ownership?

[Zhang Jiuru] (1) How should enemy and puppet factories be operated? There are as many as 170,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai's first district, and there are still 80,000 now. The Ministry of Economic Affairs should immediately organize a liquidation committee to liquidate and announce the enemy and puppet materials received. (2) What is the result of the gold policy? What is the situation of legal currency being withdrawn? Will the gold policy continue to be implemented in the future? What is the situation of gold flowing out of the country? (3) If foreign exchange management is not effective, the banks that handle foreign exchange will manipulate foreign exchange. Does the Ministry of Finance have measures to ban it? Luxury goods should be banned from import to avoid checking foreign exchange and creating a black market. (4) After the provinces exempt land tax, the local governments are helpless and have to use the method of apportionment, which increases the burden on the people. This is related to the safety of society and the country. Is the financial authority paying attention?

[Hu Ying] There should be a clearer report on finance and finance.

[Yu Wangde] The increase in foreign exchange prices will affect legitimate uses, such as the cost of studying abroad.

[Liu Jianqun] At present, in terms of "goods", industry is declining and the economy is exhausted. In terms of "people", officials are not happy and people are suffering. This seriousness should not be ignored. The competent authorities should tell the solution, or think it out if they don't have it, and pick it up if they have it, and put it down if they don't have it, and advocate the establishment of another economic team to study countermeasures.

[Huang Xuchu] The salaries stipulated for the provincial security team are not even half of the food expenses. The treatment of provincial civil servants is too low, and the mining control measures should be revised.

[Luo Xiatian] Advocate being pragmatic, putting forward current problems, and earnestly seeking solutions, instead of being perfunctory and hoping that there will be no problems. In addition, we should also pay close attention to improving the many conflicts between the central government's policies and the actual situation in various localities.

[Zhang Banghan] The treatment of civil servants and the army is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. I hope that the financial authorities will budget according to income and make overall arrangements.

[Pan Gongzhan] Written inquiry: Should the treatment of civil servants be equal and should it be increased equally? Is the special treatment of senior officials of the China Textile Company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company true?

[Wen Yiyou, Lei Zhen] Written inquiry: Please reply in writing from the Ministry of Finance: (1) The use of the two currency stabilization funds. (2) Before the opening of foreign exchange, the detailed amount of foreign exchange supplied by the government over the years, as well as the names of the applicants and their uses. (3) The amount of foreign exchange earned by the government during the War of Resistance.

[Wu Jingheng] Summarizing the opinions of the committee members, they are nothing more than reviewing the four issues of legal currency, gold, foreign exchange, and materials. However, legal currency is issued by the government. If there is no way to deal with legal currency, then everything cannot be discussed. Legal currency can be issued at will, but gold is ultimately limited. Minister Weng said that to save prices, everyone should have a conscience, but those who buy foreign exchange and buy gold have no conscience at all, and they help prices rise. Gold and foreign exchange are like "robbers", assassinating legal currency. If they cannot be controlled, these two "robbers" will inevitably kill legal currency. If the government cannot maintain credit, then all legal currency and new currency will be useless. Therefore, he specifically put forward the slogan "Save the Legal Currency".

### Repairs to the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways to Begin Immediately; Ling Hongxun to Go to North China Again to Supervise Repairs

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] According to transportation circles, the uncertain repair work on the Jiaoji and Jinpu Railways has been revised due to Ma, Zhang, and Zhou's views on the joint control of transportation by the Communist troops in Shandong Province. The road repair work can begin within days. Once some of the railway equipment that has already arrived in Shanghai is transferred to Xuzhou and Jinan, it is hoped that the repair work can be completed mostly within a month. It is reported that Vice Minister Ling Hongxun will soon go to North China again to supervise repairs.

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 4th] The entire territory of Shandong is generally calm due to the arrival of Zhang, Zhou, and Ma. Both sides agreed to do their best to restore transportation first. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are expected to be opened to traffic in the short term. The issue of city separation is still difficult. On the morning of the 4th, Li Yufei flew to Xuzhou to pick up Chen Yi and return to Linyi. Lei Ke flew with him and returned to Jinan on the same day.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 4th] It is reported that the important agreements reached by Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai in Xuzhou are: (1) The government and the Communist army both agree to restore transportation and will start road repairs immediately. (2) Remove all obstacles on the transportation lines. (3) The Zaozhuang coal mine will resume operation immediately, and a mining area production committee will be formed to supervise the implementation. It can be implemented after the two committee members Zhang and Zhou return to Chongqing.

### Ye Ting Released

### MacArthur Has the Right to Go to the Northeast

Bernes Receives Reporters, Saying

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: US Secretary of State Bernes received reporters today. One reporter asked about the situation in Manchuria. He replied that the Supreme Command of the Allied Forces, headed by Commander MacArthur, could extend to any location where enemy forces had been found. Since the governments of the countries participating in the war against Japan had recognized MacArthur as the Supreme Commander, MacArthur should have the right to go to the Northeast (as long as MacArthur himself is willing to go to Manchuria). Mr. Bernes refused to comment on the Soviet Union sending Japanese prisoners to the interior, but pointed out that the Potsdam Declaration stipulated that Japanese troops who surrendered must be sent back to their home country.

### US Asks for Report on Soviet Transportation of Industrial Equipment; Soviet Troops in Northeast to Hold Combat Exercises

[United Press, Washington, 4th] State Department officials announced today that the United States has asked China and the Soviet Union to provide a report on the Soviet army's transportation of industrial equipment from the nine northeastern provinces of China. The US government has no official report on various rumors, so it has asked the governments of Moscow and Chongqing to provide some official information.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] Soviet troops here will hold combat exercises. Our military delegation has received notification of this matter, but the notification did not specify the date of the exercises. It is reported that Soviet troops in Harbin, Dalian, and other places have also held such exercises. In addition, the financial market in Harbin has been very chaotic recently, and the financial situation is very tight. Several commercial banks have requested assistance from the central bank. The reasons for this are perhaps very complex, but according to those who understand the inside story, the Soviet Grain Trade Society in Harbin recently stopped purchasing grain in the area. Before, the advance payments paid to the grain merchants have all been recovered, so deposit withdrawals have occurred in various banks. It is said that this phenomenon has also occurred in Changchun.

[United Press, Chongqing, 5th] The Propaganda Department today published an article by Secretary Jiang of the Supreme National Defense Council, describing the difficulties of taking over the Northeast, stating: The takeover of the Northeast began in mid-October of last year and stopped in early December. After a week, the situation improved, and work gradually expanded, but now everything has come to a halt again. The takeover of the Shenyang City Government has not yet been completed, the Chinese Eastern Railway is still managed by the Soviet side, and key personnel are shuttling between Chongqing and Moscow, Beiping and Changchun.

For the sake of world stability and peace, the formation of a strong Chinese army and navy is a matter of direct concern to the United States. The Chinese New First Army is still landing in Qinhuangdao, with approximately 15,000 to 20,000 men having already landed. US ships will continue to transport Chinese troops to recover the Northeast. Ships sending Japanese civilians and soldiers back to their country will be operated by the Japanese themselves from now on, in order to free up US naval officers and sailors.

Grand Welcome in Yan'an

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 5th Urgent Telegram] Ma, Zhang, Zhou, etc., left Gui Sui at 2:30 PM yesterday and landed safely at the Yan'an Airport at 4:30 PM.

Statement by the Three-Person Group

[United Press, Yan'an, 5th] The military "Three-Person" Group, after completing its inspection tour of the conflict zones in North China, issued a statement today, stating the purpose of the trip: "The purpose of this trip is to meet with the members of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters in Beiping, and then accompany them to personally meet with the commanders of the various fronts and the inspection teams of the various fronts, and strive to clarify misunderstandings or differences on the spot. We hope to personally explain the important objectives and intentions behind the formal agreements reached in Chongqing and urge the commanders to prepare for the arduous task of China's rehabilitation and unified army. We encountered difficulties beyond our expectations, but these difficulties were limited to certain areas and not widespread. The commanders of both sides have reached an agreement and believe that the siege can be lifted immediately, the people can restore their freedom of movement, and transportation can be quickly restored. We also believe that a sound working basis has been established between the commanders of both sides, and the living conditions can be brought back to normal immediately. In addition, we believe that the various teams in various places are now prepared to undertake the difficult tasks of rehabilitation and reorganization.

### Churchill Says in US Speech That a New War Crisis Is Lurking

The Dark Ages Could Return; Victory Is Shrouded in Shadow; Western Democratic Countries Should Unite

[Reuters, Fulton, Missouri, 5th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill, in a speech at Westminster College here today, said: If the English-speaking peoples cannot unite in a spirit of brotherhood, it will still be difficult to prevent war or promote the organization of world institutions. The United Kingdom and the United States must not only maintain a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding, but also maintain close relations between their military advisors to study the lurking crisis, and then they can cultivate a spirit of brotherhood. It is also necessary to jointly use all the naval and air bases of the two countries around the world to ensure mutual security. The Dark Ages can return; good times do not last; the victory of the Allies is now shrouded in shadow; we should be vigilant.

Churchill went on to suggest that the United Nations organization should have its own military organization: This can be done gradually, but it must be implemented immediately, inviting countries to contribute several squadrons of air force to serve the world organization. If the secret of the atomic bomb is now told to the United Nations organization, it will be a mistake, because the world's atmosphere is still not calm. If the United Kingdom and the United States can unite in a spirit of brotherhood as I have said, they can prevent problems before they occur and lay the foundation for peace. Only by maintaining a special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States can the world organization have its position and produce strength.

### Does Not Believe the Soviets Want War, but Want to Expand Power Without Restriction

Churchill then strongly advocated the Anglo-Soviet Treaty: I deeply admire the courage and perseverance of the Russian people and Comrade Stalin. The United Kingdom still sympathizes with and treats the entire Russian nation with goodwill and will always maintain permanent friendship with it. The ancient countries of Central and Eastern Europe are now within the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. However, glorious Athens will make a decision on its future elections under the observation of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The Polish government's current actions against Germany are quite inappropriate. The Communist parties in the countries of Eastern Europe are originally in the minority. Their current prominence may not be able to take on the responsibilities and want to strive for totalitarian rule. At present, except for Czechoslovakia, there is no true democracy to speak of. The Soviet Union's oppression of Turkey and the situation of the Russian Communist Party within Germany are not what we want to see in the post-liberation reconstruction of Europe, nor are they sufficient to constitute the elements of lasting peace. All of this makes me feel that a new war is inevitable. But I am sure that the future can be decided by us, and we have the power to save the future. Therefore, out of a sense of responsibility, I speak frankly, but I do not believe that the Soviet Union wants war. What it expects is the result of war and the unrestricted expansion of its power and doctrine. What is urgently needed now is a solution. The longer we delay, the more dreams we will have at night, and the crisis will deepen. It is no longer an era of striving for equal power. If Western democratic countries can unite and abide by the Charter of the United Nations, their strength can promote this principle. In this year of 1946, we can reach this goal by seeking all goodwill and understanding with the Soviet Union through the authority of the United Nations. The English-speaking peoples, united and abiding by the Charter, move forward and can stabilize the future world situation.

### Urge the Spanish People to Determine Their Own Destiny; Overthrow the Franco Government; Joint Declaration by Three Countries Published Yesterday; UK Does Not Agree to Refer the Spanish Issue to the Security Council

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 5th, broadcast that after the United Kingdom, France, and the United States issued a joint declaration on Franco, Washington officials believed that only the Spanish army has sufficient power to overthrow the Franco regime. The new government proposed by the three-country declaration could not be established because there is no political party with sufficient power in Spain at present.

[United Press, London, 5th] Government officials said today that France had sent a message to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union last week, proposing that the issue of the Spanish Franco regime be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for disposal. The British government has refused this, on the grounds that replacing Franco is a matter for the Spanish people, and "external forces" would only strengthen Franco's position.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] The governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France issued a joint declaration on Spain this evening, stating that the destiny of Spain should be decided by the Spanish people themselves. The Franco government had received assistance from Nazi and Fascist countries, so as long as Franco exists, the Spanish people will not be able to establish normal relations with the countries that defeated Nazism and Fascism. We have no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of Spain. The Spanish people should decide their own destiny. Although the Franco government has taken coercive measures against the political aspirations of the Spanish people, we still hope that their people will not suffer the horrors and pain of civil war again. On the contrary, we hope that enlightened Spanish people can quickly find various ways to make Franco retire peacefully, dissolve the Falange, and establish a provisional government, so as to give the Spanish people the opportunity to freely decide their government and choose their leaders. Amnesty for political prisoners, the return of exiled Spanish people, freedom of assembly and political association, and the enactment of public election laws are all important tasks. If the provisional government can gain the recognition and support of all freedom-loving people, it will devote itself to this goal and remain unwavering. Under these circumstances, we will immediately establish diplomatic relations with Spain and will assist it in solving various economic problems, because these problems cannot be solved at present. As for the severance or maintenance of diplomatic relations with the Franco regime, this is a major issue that must be considered in light of the overall situation and the efforts of the Spanish people to strive for freedom before a decision can be made.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] Regarding Franco's wartime relations with the Axis powers, the US military seized a large number of files in Germany. After experts from the State Department studied them separately, they were released today, proving that if the Axis powers had recognized Spain's demands for Gibraltar, Tangier, French Morocco, and part of Algeria, Franco would have abandoned neutrality and joined the Axis powers.

### Shidehara Hurriedly Enters the Palace; Japanese Cabinet Encounters a Crisis; Held a Meeting Yesterday Morning and Did Not Disperse Until Evening; It Is Said That MacArthur Will Continue to Order the Purge of Certain People

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] According to Kyodo News Agency: The Japanese cabinet held an important meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence from 10 AM this morning and discussed it all day. At 6 PM, Prime Minister Shidehara and Matsumoto, chairman of the Cabinet's Constitutional Revision Committee, hurriedly entered the palace to meet with the Japanese Emperor. They had not returned to the residence by 8 PM at night. The cabinet members waited quietly and did not disperse, so that they could continue the meeting at night. The agency also reported that Foreign Minister Yoshida had recently met with MacArthur, but according to Colonel Wheeler, military secretary of MacArthur's headquarters, Yoshida did not meet with MacArthur, nor was an audience scheduled. After the news came out, the Japanese immediately speculated that MacArthur would continue to announce that certain people, also as militarists, must be purged, and perhaps there are such people in the cabinet, so the cabinet has encountered a crisis. Some said that Matsumoto's entry into the palace proves that the cabinet meeting is related to the revision of the constitution. Others predicted that some cabinet members would resign after the cabinet meeting, but Kyodo News Agency said that the cabinet would not resign collectively. Japanese newspapers reported that the revision of the constitution seems to have stalled on the issue of the emperor's power. Rumor has it that MacArthur's headquarters is quite dissatisfied with the original draft of the revision of the constitution by the Japanese cabinet, so it is now drafting a new draft.

[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] Former Japanese Diet member Yukio Ozaki today submitted a draft constitutional revision plan to the cabinet. He advocated adopting the British constitutional monarchy system. According to his plan, the Japanese Emperor's power would be reduced, and the Japanese Emperor's activities would be limited to approving laws, convening parliament, appointing officials, awarding honors, and concluding treaties, but subject to the approval of parliament.

He is often given the cold shoulder by young war criminals, but he gets along well with the elderly war criminals. He often comes to them to ask for translation and chats freely.

### Regarding the Atomic Espionage Case: Canadian Government Releases Investigation Report; Soviet Embassy Masterminded the Spying, Encompassing Four Areas

[United Press Ottawa, 4th] Canadian Prime Minister King today released the results of the atomic bomb espionage case investigation. It is stated that after the Canadian government cracked the atomic secrets leak case, it appointed two judges to be responsible for the investigation. The investigation team has now submitted a report. Based on various pieces of evidence, this espionage activity was indeed carried out by personnel from the Soviet Embassy in Canada, acting on direct instructions from Moscow. These Soviet personnel received secret orders from Moscow around August of last year, near the end of the Pacific War, to find ways to spy on intelligence regarding the transfer of American troops from Europe to the United States and to the Pacific. The addresses of the U.S. Ninth Army and more than twenty other divisions and corps headquarters were also secretly investigated and reported. The person in charge of the operation in Ottawa was Colonel Zabotin, the military attaché of the Soviet Embassy.

Zabotin was ordered to spy on the following areas: (1) Details regarding the raw materials of the atomic bomb, its manufacturing techniques, procedures, and blueprints. (2) Details of the atomic bombs used by the United States Navy. (3) Samples of Uranium-235 and details of its manufacturing plant. (4) The location of the Brazilian infantry division (fighting in Italy) and details of Canadian divisions that had returned home.

According to a recent announcement from Moscow, Zabotin was recalled to his home country from Ottawa in mid-December. The report also announced that the following four people violated the Canadian Secrets Act by directly or indirectly leaking secret and confidential information to the Soviet Union: Mrs. Mathilde Carré, a code clerk in the Department of External Affairs, who disclosed the content of a secret telegram to Soviet personnel; Captain Leonard Burt Nantais, an officer in the Canadian intelligence bureau, who was the leader of the espionage ring, directly reporting to Lieutenant Colonel Motolov, the deputy military attaché of the Soviet Embassy; Mr. Durnford, an electrical engineer at the National Research Council, who originally worked on radar and was one of Nantais' spies, disclosed two reports from the research council regarding a certain radar development; and Mrs. Emma Woikin, an acting registrar at the British High Commission, whose position allowed her access to all the commission's secret documents, disclosed the contents of several secret documents.

The report also stated that there were many other very active spies, and that substantially more important intelligence had been leaked. However, because sufficient evidence had not yet been collected, no details could be released at this time.

(Further dispatch) The report also listed four defendants accused of assisting the Soviet Union in spying on secrets. After being tried in court, they were ordered to be remanded in custody until the continuation of the trial on March 11. Of the four defendants, only Mrs. Woikin pleaded guilty.

### Local News

Suzhou: Power Plant Lacks Coal, Entire Suzhou Experiences Power Outage

The Suzhou power plant previously faced a coal shortage, causing it to suspend daytime power supply, and even nighttime power supply was cut off by 12 o'clock. A few days ago, it sent personnel to the Shanghai Fuel Committee to apply for an allocation of 700 tons of coal. As of last night, the coal had not yet arrived in Suzhou. The plant only had a remaining ten tons or so of coal, borrowed from the Ministry of Military Affairs' warehouse. Furthermore, the culm coal ordered by the plant from the Xishan Baoshan Company could not be delivered due to continuous rainy weather and the inability of ships to sail. As a result, the electricity was cut off last night (the 2nd). In order to prevent accidents, the authorities closed the city gates earlier yesterday.

Qingpu: Petty Traitor Ma Jiwu Arrested

Ma Jiwu, who successively served as the vice chairman of the maintenance association in the third district of the county, Zhangyan Township, and as a lieutenant colonel and adjutant in Yuan Yingjie's puppet 5th regiment, as well as the director of the regiment's training office during the puppet regime era, was reported to the county government. County Magistrate Liu ordered the town's police to arrest him and bring him to Qingpu for legal proceedings.

Bengbu: Disaster Situation in Anhui-Jiangsu Border Region is Dire

During the period of occupation, the people in the border region of northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu had already suffered greatly. After the victory, the Communist army occupied Fengyang, Lingbi, Suxian, Wuhe, Xuyi, and Xiaoxian, Tongshan, Suining, and Huaiyin in northern Jiangsu, arbitrarily harassing the population. Coupled with rampant floods, droughts, locusts, and epidemics, the people were struggling to survive. After inspecting and investigating the situation, Mr. James of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration stated that 4 million people lacked clothing and food, and the disaster had almost reached a serious stage. The able-bodied disaster victims in the areas occupied by the Communist army in the Anhui-Jiangsu border region have fled to Xuzhou and Bengbu, where approximately 100,000 people live a life of begging.

Songjiang: Refusing to Use Puppet Currency, Improving Exchange

The money will be remitted to the Farmers Bank for exchange, and the Chamber of Commerce will exchange it for legal tender seven days later, collecting the receipt. However, this is a trial, and the initial amount is set at 20 million yuan in legal tender. If the results are good, it will continue. The county bank in this county has also started exchanging puppet currency. The method is for businesses to deposit puppet currency into the bank, open an account, and receive legal tender ten days later, but without interest.

Jiaxing: County Government Restricts Outflow of Rice and Grain

The Jiaxing County Rice Industry Association believes that although the authorities have restricted the sale price of rice in Hangzhou, there is still a black market. Therefore, rice peddlers from southern Jiangsu are selling rice out of Jiaxing to seek profits. Moreover, the provincial government is purchasing large quantities of rice from Jiaxing to relieve the food shortage in Hangzhou, making it difficult for rice prices in Jiaxing to fall. In order to ensure the food supply for the people, the Rice Industry Association decided at a board meeting a few days ago to request that the county government order the police at the train station to carefully inspect and prohibit the carrying of more than one picul of rice out of the county.

(5) Expand the distribution of porridge to relieve the poor. (6) Request the provincial government and the Grain Administration Bureau to approve the allocation of grain from the Lingmiao warehouse to this county.

### American Journalist Reveals the Inside Story of Actions in the Northeast: Soviet Army Speeding up the Construction of Ordnance Factories

— By Dickson, Northeast Correspondent for the "Stars and Stripes," Translated by Our News Research Office

The stubborn and arrogant Soviet army, emboldened by the victory in this war, believes that the war is not yet over and is now speeding up the construction of a massive ordnance factory in the Northeast. In this key corner of Asia, they are strengthening their military and political base.

In this newly occupied zone by the Soviet army, the terrifying Soviet secret police are creating all kinds of terror. In the strategic strongholds of Dalian and Lushun, the Soviet army is conducting military exercises.

From Harbin to Dalian, the Soviet army has almost completed the work of looting factories to establish the strength of the Soviet military industry. According to reliable sources, if northern China were to become a battlefield, there would be no factories in the area that could be used by the enemy.

In this industrially developed area, non-partisan citizens, when talking about their lives under Soviet rule, say, "It's actually worse than under the Nazi rule. The rampant terror is even worse than under the Japanese."

Impatient journalists finally uncovered the mysterious curtain of the Soviet army's actions in Northeast China. These journalists believe that the Soviet army should not have forbidden the publication of this news of world importance. They rushed into Shenyang and ventured into every remote corner of the Northeast, becoming uninvited guests.

Ignoring the repeated detentions, expulsions, arrests, and insults by the Soviet secret police wearing the NKVD insignia, these journalists still sneaked into Shenyang, Changchun, and Dalian. They have gathered enough news to serve as evidence that the Soviet army is indeed using force to gain a new foothold in Asia.

According to the Chinese army, the Soviet army clearly intends to stay in the Northeast for a long time. Marshal Malinovsky, the commander of the Soviet Far East Army, made this very clear in his speech commemorating Red Army Day in Changchun.

### "If Anyone Reaches into the Northeast, the Soviet Army Will Cut Off Their Hand"... Far East Red Army Commander Declares

The Chinese army also said that the Soviet army suffered heavy losses in the fierce war when they entered the Northeast. They will not easily give up these hard-won gains. The Chinese also said that the commander of the Soviet Far East Army said that if anyone other than the Soviet Union reaches into the Northeast, the Soviet army must cut off that hand!

While writing their dispatches behind closed doors, the journalists had to be constantly wary of the Soviet army bursting in. The journalists heard and saw enough evidence to support the following conclusions:

First: The so-called Kwantung Leased Territory—the Dalian and Lushun areas of the Liaodong Peninsula—has become a military industrial base for the Soviet army in the East. However, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Lushun is to be jointly operated by China and the Soviet Union, and Dalian is to be designated as a free port, open to all countries equally, but not to be used for military actions.

Second: The Soviet army will never withdraw from this area unless it receives valuable concessions from China in economic and military matters. They are increasingly insistent that they are not prepared to give up control of Dalian and Lushun at any price.

Third: The Soviet army interprets the Sino-Soviet Treaty as saying that the Soviet Union has full authority over Dalian during wartime. The Soviet Union does not recognize that the war is over until Japan signs a peace treaty. At the same time, this land is "leased" to the Soviet Union.

Lieutenant General Koslov, the Soviet commander in Dalian, reprimanded the journalists for intruding into his jurisdiction without obtaining a Soviet permit, saying, "Dalian is not included in the Northeast."

Fourth: The ubiquitous Soviet secret police, who have been using terror tactics against the people of the Soviet Union since the October Revolution, have now followed the Soviet army into the Northeast, implementing espionage, conspiracies, and intimidation against anyone who disobeys the Party.

### Soviet Army Using U.S. Liberty Ships to Haul Away Northeast Property... Japanese Soldiers Mysteriously Disappearing

Fifth: The Soviet army has completed a systematic looting of the Northeast's heavy industry. They are using ships to transport these materials to Vladivostok and into the Soviet Union. According to reliable sources, some U.S. Lend-Lease Liberty ships are also being used to transport these looted items. Japanese soldiers were also forced to participate in the looting, after which they mysteriously disappeared. The detestable fleet of Kauftan, commander of the Soviet army in Shenyang, also participated in this activity, indicating that they have been sent to Siberia in the Soviet Union to serve the Soviets.

Sixth: The Soviet army is cooperating with the Chinese Communist army, arming them, and using them as propaganda tools. It is rumored here that the Soviet army is recruiting Japanese officers and technicians to create friction between the Japanese and the Chinese.

At present, only Stalin knows when the Soviet army will withdraw from the Northeast. However, even if the Soviet army withdraws, the great industrial area that the Japanese painstakingly built from the Mukden Incident to the Pacific War has long been "completely changed"!

### Machinery Moved to Siberia: Shenyang Only a Hollow Shell; Citizens Startled Birds

— Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 3rd [Day of the Month], Translated and Sent by Ping Qi

Shenyang was originally the most important industrial backbone of China, but now it has been plundered, leaving only a hollow shell. It has suffered the most scientific and thorough robbery and theft in history, becoming a lawless and terrifying world!

After staying here for five days, the reporter reached these conclusions:

(1) The Soviet authorities have completely emptied Shenyang's vast industrial facilities, transporting hundreds of thousands of tons of machinery to Siberia.

(2) Acts of violence occur almost daily, and the people of Shenyang have become startled birds.

(3) The Soviet authorities have provided enormous indirect assistance to the Chinese Communists, and many reliable witnesses claim that, in addition to this indirect assistance, they are in fact directly cooperating.

(4) In Shenyang, as in Moscow, the central government has no real power.

Shenyang's Industrial Destruction More Severe Than Tokyo's

Shops on every street are closed, with only small stalls on the sidewalks doing business, selling nothing but scattered old goods looted from Japanese homes. The curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. leaves the streets of Shenyang deserted at night. Gunshots are heard every night, and theft, robbery, and assassination have become "commonplace."

The Japanese had established an industrial zone in the western suburbs of Shenyang, which accounted for 60% of the entire industry of the Northeast provinces. Now, it is a ruin. While the destruction of Tokyo and Osaka was certainly severe, the destruction of Shenyang was even more thorough.

The machines in the factories have been looted. First to be removed were window frames, telephones, and some light equipment. This was the first act of revenge by the Chinese masses after breaking free from Japanese constraints.

Anshan's Machinery Removal: Totalling Fifty to Sixty Thousand Tons

Next, the Soviet authorities brought trucks, and Japanese prisoners of war became porters, dismantling all kinds of equipment. For ease of transport, holes were knocked through the walls. Machines and equipment were dismantled and transported to the Soviet Union. Some empty houses were blown up, while those that remain have only walls and roofs left.

An engineer forced to participate in this work told me that the Soviet authorities had done the same elsewhere. He said that 70% to 80% of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works had been dismantled and transported to Yase Port, Dalian, and Korean seaports, before being loaded onto ships bound for Vladivostok. Some of the transport ships were American Liberty ships, but manned by Soviet crews. He said that 50,000 to 60,000 tons of machinery were moved from Anshan, and 150,000 tons more were exported through Dalian alone.

Removal of Generators: What Terrible Consequences Are to Be Imagined

The generators from the Yalu River Power Plant, which supplied electricity to the southern parts of the Northeast provinces, were also removed by the Soviets. After the generators were removed, Shenyang often experienced power outages, and the water supply was frequently interrupted.

The consequences of the water supply interruptions are very serious and unsanitary. If the weather warms up, there is a risk of a large-scale epidemic. Tens of thousands of people in the Northeast have already lost their lives to typhoid fever, causing great concern to the authorities.

On the streets of Shenyang, we, the first group of foreign reporters to arrive, were very welcome. The reporter group consisted of 22 people, including Americans, British, and French, some of whom were photographers. Chinese pedestrians on the street stopped and eagerly asked us, "When will the Americans send the national army here?" Even the Japanese were happy, asking, "When can they send us back to our country?"

Some Conversations Among Our People Resulted in Death by Gunshot

People here speak very cautiously, and repeatedly instruct us not to mention their names when writing the articles. Many people refuse to meet with reporters at all. One report says that a Chinese man who spoke a few words to reporters was later shot dead in front of his own gate.

This kind of unease affects not only the Chinese people and the Japanese, but also the White Russians. There are about 30 German Nazis in Shenyang. They did not seem to be affected much when the Soviet army moved in. One person told me that two weeks after the Soviet army entered the city, he had personally seen the Nazi flag still hanging on the roof of the German club.

Soviet Army Directly and Indirectly Assisted the Communist Army

Some have pointed out that the Soviet army has assisted the Eighth Route Army in attacking the national army three times, but such direct Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists is not easy to prove. General Kauftan Shtankevich, the commander of the Soviet army in Shenyang, has denied this claim. He said that only once did a Red Army truck loaded with sweet potatoes get damaged in the battlefield between the Nationalists and Communists.

Some people witnessed the Communist army using weapons seized from the Japanese army. A captured Communist officer also said that a Soviet army liaison team had supplied his unit with nine Japanese machine guns, as well as other equipment.

Whether these direct assistance from the Soviet army to the Communist army is true or not, we will put aside for the moment. However, it is very clear that the Communist army has received indirect assistance. Because the government army must obtain permission from the highest authorities before it can move, it cannot move freely in the Northeast, while the Communist army can move at will, which has given great help to the Eighth Route Army. At present, the central army occupies the railway from Jinzhou to Shenyang, and there are some troops in the suburbs of Shenyang. But apart from these places, all the rural areas are controlled by the Communist army.

Soviet Army Held Demonstrations; Bullets Pierced Our Headquarters

Opinions vary on the strength of the Communist Party in the Northeast. One figure I heard was 300,000 people, of which about 50,000 are said to be seasoned veterans of the Eighth Route Army, while the rest are recruited locally.

In Shenyang, there are six municipal officials appointed by the National Government, plus a headquarters commanded by General Peng Bisheng, but none of them have any real power. The city is completely ruled by the Soviet army.

The night before, the Soviet tank corps held a demonstration within 100 yards of the headquarters of the Central Twenty-fifth Division for four hours. Several bullets hit the walls of the headquarters. Soviet gunners broke into the room of the mayor of Shenyang, who was sent by the central government, wanting to seize his radio. Someone politely advised General Peng Bisheng and other officials to move to a hotel managed by the Soviet Union.

Soviet Army Controlled Factories; Losses Impossible to Estimate

The Chinese authorities cannot estimate the exact losses caused by the Soviet looting here, because some factories are still guarded by the Soviet army, and Chinese people are not allowed to enter. Without the prior permission of the Soviet army, the Chinese are powerless. The Chinese officials themselves live in fear, a fear that was triggered by the assassination of Zhang Xinfu and six attendants in Fushun in January. The circumstances of this assassination made many believe that the Russians were closely related to the case.

Today, Shenyang is like a city occupied by an enemy army. In comparison, the residents of Tokyo are still happy.

### "Four-Legged Culture" in Taiwan

— Dispatch from Our Newspaper; Will Be Available for Mailing Today

Ito Hirobumi wrote a travel poem about Taiwan: "Treat everyone equally, without favor, use this heart to govern peacefully, the hall sings in harmony, moving heaven and earth, long live the Japanese Emperor."

Taiwan has been ceded to Japan since the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. For 51 years, Taiwanese people have been subjected to Japanese enslavement education and "Imperialization" policies. The culture itself has undergone great changes. The content of Taiwanese culture has become a complex thing, neither purely Chinese nor purely Japanese. Taiwanese people wear Japanese kimonos as outerwear, but the undershirt is still a Chinese-style undershirt. Although under the forced oppression of Japanese enslavement education and enslavement politics, Taiwanese people can still maintain their national consciousness forever and make tenacious passive resistance with the spirit of the nation, which is also admirable.

51 years ago, the incompetent Qing government, with the base and cowardly mentality of "Taiwan's resistance endangers the capital," forced the Taiwanese people to accept Japanese rule. How disappointed the Taiwanese people were with their motherland at that time. For 51 years, the Japanese have used all kinds of methods to enslave the Taiwanese people. Although a few Taiwanese gentry and rogues were willing to serve the Japanese, the Japanese were able to boast to the world that their governance of Taiwan was excellent.

The Japanese government printed the above-mentioned poem by Ito and photos of Taipei City on postcards to promote to the world. The first sentence certainly needs to be heavily discounted. The second sentence completely exposes Japan's ambition for Taiwan. The third and fourth sentences, in their nauseating way, show the achievements of Japan's "enslavement" and "Imperialization" of the Taiwanese people. But most of the Taiwanese people wholeheartedly despise the Japanese rulers and their customs, cultural relics, and systems, mocking them as "four-legged culture." This phrase is truly poignant and humorous.

Because Taiwanese culture and Chinese culture have been separated for 51 years, they still cannot catch up today after the restoration. This was expected. Because Japan has always regarded Taiwan as a colony, it does not allow the Taiwanese people to learn the academic subjects that the people of the colonies cannot learn. So Taiwanese people's foundation in social sciences is too poor. Now, Taiwanese people must strive to learn the national language and Chinese to get closer to the culture of the motherland. They must also start to learn social sciences to build a new Taiwanese culture.

Equality with Men

In the past, Taiwanese women, like Japanese women, had no status or power in society or in the family. The current Taiwanese women are the same as Chinese women. China believes in equality between men and women. But the majority of Taiwanese women are still working as maids, waitresses, clerks, and ticket sellers. This is also due to education. Because in the past, Taiwanese women were educated by the Japanese, and Japanese education was different for men and women in spirit and form. It absolutely did not allow women to freely develop their talents, let alone allow them to participate in political activities. Now, Taiwanese women can be equal to men. Female students are included in each session of the Taiwan Provincial Local Administrative Cadre Training Corps. They have realized and proved that their status has indeed been improved. In the future, Taiwanese women will definitely be able to keep pace with Taiwanese men. They will be able to do what women in other countries can do, and they will definitely be able to do it well.

Youth's Distress

In the past, most Taiwanese youth received vocational education. Even those who received university education studied medicine and agriculture. Therefore, the issue of occupation is almost the most serious problem for Taiwanese youth today. Unemployment is the greatest distress of Taiwanese youth. Several students from the middle school teacher training class of the Taiwan Provincial Local Administrative Cadre Training Corps spoke to me in Japanese about the pain of unemployment. Although the situation in Taiwan is very good, most of the factories that have stopped production have not yet resumed, and there are fewer opportunities for young people to find employment. In addition, prices are rising and it is difficult to make a living. Unemployed young people hope to get jobs immediately.

When Chief Executive Chen took office in Taiwan, he expressed his willingness to employ Taiwanese youth. In addition to the "standby personnel registration" that has already been held by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office, the "Enterprise Management Personnel Training Class" held by the Provincial Training Corps has also been completed. All the trainees have been assigned positions by the Chief Executive Office. The Provincial Training Corps is now continuing to hold "Accounting Personnel Training Classes" and "Civil Affairs Personnel Training Classes," "Propaganda Worker Training Classes," etc. Therefore, the occupation problem of Taiwanese youth will not be a problem in the future.

The second distress of Taiwanese youth is that they do not understand the national language and Chinese. Chinese can be learned slowly, but the need for the national language is especially urgent. As a result, many national language tutoring schools have appeared everywhere. Some of them have excellent teaching methods, but many of them have inaccurate pronunciation. Taiwanese youth who are eager to learn the national language often find that there are several different pronunciations of a word, and they do not know which pronunciation is correct. The students of the Provincial Training Corps also reported to the Director of Education that the pronunciation of the national language teachers was different. In the country, whether it is a southern or northern accent, it can be understood. In Taiwan, which has been isolated overseas and occupied for 51 years, teachers who teach the national language should teach with standard pronunciation.

Currency and Exchange

Taiwan currently still uses the Taiwan dollar. It is found that the Taiwan dollar was issued by the Taiwan Bank, which was jointly established by Japanese officials and merchants. According to Chief Executive Chen's approval, the ratio between the Taiwan dollar and the legal currency is that one Taiwan dollar is equal to 30 legal currency. But in Taipei City, it only takes 20 or 24 legal currency to exchange for one Taiwan dollar. Because there is no national bank, Taiwan and the provinces of the mainland do not have remittances. More than 95% of the families of the people who come to work in Taiwan are still in the mainland, and remittances have become a major difficulty. Now all remittances are sent by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Chief Executive Office to Shanghai, and then Shanghai separately remits them to the provinces. Not to mention distant places, even Fuzhou, which can be reached the next day, takes two months to receive the funds remitted by the Chief Executive Office. Therefore, some people are willing to sacrifice the right to exchange one Taiwan dollar for 30 legal currency, and exchange the Taiwan dollar for legal currency (20 yuan) and entrust someone to take it to Fuzhou to remit to their homes. All public servants and teachers who come to Taiwan hope that the National Bank can come to Taiwan as soon as possible, so that remittances can be convenient in the future. When the reporter was sending the manuscript, I heard that Executive Yuan President Song had flown from Shanghai to Taipei. Perhaps his arrival can solve some of Taiwan's difficulties. (February 24)

New Method of Training Pilots: Miss Jane, an American, uses a "radar-like" (translated based on the "雷" sound) controller to start a prototype aircraft. This controller is no different from a regular one and is specifically used to train pilots. This invention will be publicly displayed at the World Invention Exhibition in Chicago in April 1946.

Commentary

### How to Complete China's Post-War Reconstruction in the Shortest Time

This article was written by Professor W.I. Kenter of Brown University in the United States. He is currently an engineering consultant to the Chinese Military Affairs Commission, has been in China for more than two years, and has made many contributions to military engineering. He recently returned to the United States. He wrote this article to express his opinions on China's post-war reconstruction, which are worthy of reference by the Chinese people. Translated by Mr. Tao Shuzeng, a member of the Engineering Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, for public viewing. —— (March 1st)

(1) Theme: The main purpose of this article is to provide a method by which China's great post-war reconstruction can be completed in the shortest possible time.

(2) Scope: This article only discusses state-owned construction. Private and provincial construction projects that are not of national scope are not discussed. Furthermore, this article only discusses the government's management methods, which can enable the completion of the largest amount of construction projects in the shortest amount of time, without discussing the raising of capital for state-owned construction.

(3) General Discussion: To ensure lasting world peace, it is extremely important for China to achieve a leading position among the countries of the Far East. To achieve this position, China must achieve accomplishments in the next 25 years that other countries have never achieved before. Where there is a will, there is a way, depending on China's determination. To accomplish this great task, the entire nation must be awakened to move forward courageously, each doing their best, with particular emphasis placed on trusting experts.

(4) Organization of Engineers: (A) China has a severe shortage of experts, who should not be left idle or used inefficiently. To enable each engineer to exert their maximum capacity and efficiency, we suggest that a Ministry of Construction be organized under the Executive Yuan. Its organization should include five general bureaus: [1] General Bureau of Railways, [2] General Bureau of Highways, [3] General Bureau of Aviation, [4] General Bureau of Ports, [5] General Bureau of State-Owned Water Conservancy Engineering. In addition to the five bureaus, a Design Committee should be established, with the Vice Minister serving concurrently as Chairman, and the directors of the five bureaus serving concurrently as members, leading the work of the five bureaus under the direction of the Minister.

(B) The tasks of the Ministry of Construction are as follows: [1] Formulate a five-year national construction plan. [2] Balance state-owned enterprises managed by this ministry and other ministries. [3] Design state-owned projects. [4] Prepare engineering budgets. [5] Guide or assist in guiding the construction of state-owned projects. [6] Serve as an assistant to the Chairman in engineering administration and as an engineering consultant to other ministries. [7] Conduct proposal surveys and reports for state-owned projects. [8] Review the purchase of engineering materials.

(C) Each general bureau has its own specialized responsibilities, but all must directly report to the Minister in order to coordinate and cooperate with each other into a harmonious whole.

(D) What must be specifically pointed out is that projects completed and accepted by the Ministry of Construction will be transferred to the ministry in charge of use or management. The responsibility of the Ministry of Construction lies in the planning, coordination, design, estimation, and construction of state-owned projects, but it does not use or maintain them after completion. This ministry is a purely service-oriented organization, and its expenses are drawn from the national treasury, not from the income from the use of the projects it creates, so that all engineers fall under the category of civil servants, providing the most efficient and economical service to the country and the people.

(5) Benefits of Organizing the Ministry of Construction: By organizing the Ministry of Construction, the country will quickly reap the following benefits:

(A) State-owned projects are concentrated in a single sponsoring agency. Centralized sponsorship is efficient and economical, redundant facilities can be avoided, and management and user agencies, not being concurrently engaged in new construction, can concentrate their efforts on use, management, and maintenance. Construction authority is in the hands of those with specialized knowledge and long-term experience, which is bound to be economical.

(B) Work between other ministries is easier to coordinate: China's future position depends on the government's understanding of current difficulties and its efforts. The solution to the current serious problems of lack of transportation, low production, weak purchasing power, and reduced imports and exports all depend on the engineers' most meticulous planning of the five-year plan. Not just one five-year plan is needed, but several five-year plans must be in place, and each plan must provide adequate solutions to national transportation, transportation, production, and raw material production problems. Only engineers can make the most appropriate plans and coordination for the above problems. If the various competent ministries can trust the adjusted plan of the same government agency and implement it accordingly, then the mutual coordination of work, administrative convenience, improved efficiency, and reduced waste are inevitable. The Ministry of Construction will be the most suitable organization for designing and adjusting the five-year national construction plan.

(C) Every engineer is used effectively: According to this organization, every engineer can be placed in the position that best suits them. If one bureau has less work, its engineers and auxiliary staff can be transferred to another bureau for use. This economical usage is only possible with an organization affiliated with the same superior agency. China has too few engineers, and there are many construction plans waiting to be launched, and in the next ten years or so, every engineer should do their best to work for the country every day.

(D) Business technicians and private companies can be utilized as much as possible: The scale of China's construction is extremely large, and even if all public and private engineers and construction companies in the country are used for design and construction, it will not be enough. If there is a central construction agency, such as the proposed Ministry of Construction, it should make full use of the power of business technicians and private companies, and cultivate construction companies and consulting firms operated by foreigners in China. It is also fundamentally necessary to train the use of new tools.

(E) The power of destructive factors can be reduced: China's current state of unrest is indeed affected by the turbulent state of the world as a whole; but there are many more special circumstances within China. Within these special circumstances, the Chinese government cannot take measures in certain areas, and the situation is even more serious due to traffic difficulties and low production. The lack of production leads to a reduction in people's purchasing power, and the reduction in people's purchasing power reduces the production of goods. The two are mutually causal, and over time form a vicious circle. The current plan is to provide these areas with the necessary means of transportation, complete transportation networks such as railways, highways, aviation, and waterways, develop their rich natural resources, and industrialize their people. This kind of unrest can be reduced. The way to achieve the above goals is to have engineers and others dig ditches, build embankments, build water power, drain accumulated water, and make millions of acres of drought-prone and waterlogged land cultivable and ensure a quantitative harvest. Various construction projects are immediately started so that the people have something to do, and they can personally see the government implementing the plans for rehabilitation and national construction. The turbulent situation will gradually decrease and even disappear with the success of various undertakings. Only a properly organized group of engineers can provide China with a properly coordinated railway, highway, and aviation system. Only the power of engineers can save the raging rivers and turn them into beneficial construction forces for China. Only the power of engineers can improve the living standards of the general people, increase domestic unity, and sweep away local disappointment and the factors of unrest. The organization of engineers will reflect the strength and power of the new China.

(6) Recommendations: The following recommendations are hereby made:

(A) Establish a Ministry of Construction under the Executive Yuan to be responsible for the planning, design, and construction of state-owned projects.

(B) The Minister of Construction must be an engineer with specialized knowledge, skills, vigor, and leadership qualities, administrative experience, and management skills.

(C) All engineers of the Ministry of Construction shall be civil servants, so that their positions are guaranteed, their merits are rewarded, their salaries are commensurate with their responsibilities, and they feel that they are serving the country and are respected accordingly.

(D) Private companies, business technicians, and foreign companies or firms operating in China who participate in national construction work shall be cultivated by the Ministry of Construction.

(E) The Ministry of Construction shall establish an expert advisory group of foreign nationals to assist the Minister in writing a five-year national construction plan, assist in the planning, design, and construction of large-scale state-owned projects, assist in research work, such as soil strength, foundation design, water conservancy model tests, etc., and assist in the purchase of engineering equipment, so that China's engineering technology and the equipment used are as advanced as those of advanced industrial countries.

(F) The Ministry of Construction should cooperate with engineering colleges, adding systematic research on engineering problems to the curriculum, so as to improve the knowledge of engineering graduates, and as information for more economical and more advanced design and construction in the future. Chinese soils must be classified from an engineering point of view, the drainage area of major rivers must be surveyed, hydrology must be widely studied, methods for soil and water conservation and reclamation of large areas of wasteland must be mastered, and the knowledge of flood prevention must be far more advanced than in the past.

### Amateur Radio Appeal: Guarantee Academic Freedom

— Shen Yizhi

Recently, it was reported in the newspapers that the Telecommunications Supervision Section of the Ministry of Communications was established in Shanghai to handle the application and registration procedures for wireless radio manufacturers, radios, and component purchases and usage; the purpose is to prevent wireless electrical appliances from falling into the hands of criminals for illegal use, and it has also held a discussion meeting with some manufacturers. Although no measures have been announced yet, judging from the points published in various newspapers, I cannot help but worry about the future of our amateur radio research community. And my amateur colleagues have not yet put forward any opinions, or pointed out the advantages and disadvantages, for the reference or adoption of the authorities. I am one of the amateur comrades, and I would like to state my views on the point that the authorities intend to implement the purchase of wireless electrical appliances.

Britain also implements registration and charging of radio users, and the penalties for evading registration and payment are quite severe, but on the contrary, special exceptions are made for amateur researchers. An amateur can freely go to any electrical appliance company to select or customize the components they need; the government also has various incentives and assistance measures. The driving of airplanes and the operation of submarines are not the result of the countless efforts of researchers in the laboratory day and night. Rockets and radars also do not grow out of the soil. However, our country only talks about "form" and does not ask about "reality". On October 9 last year, Chairman Chiang broadcast on the Central Radio Station in the accompanying capital: "The policy of cultural construction is to encourage scientific research, guarantee academic freedom, and improve social customs..." Science—radio is also one of science—is of course important in the current century, and everyone knows it. Only by "encouraging scientific research and guaranteeing academic freedom" can new discoveries, new reforms, and new successes be contributed to the government from the hands of researchers! Now we do not hope that the government will give us "encouragement", but is "guaranteeing academic freedom" our minimum requirement! The previous newspaper reported that the section announced: "Applications should be made to the Supervisory Section for the purchase of wireless electrical appliances, and after the section issues a 'Purchase Certificate', purchases can be made from designated merchants based on the 'Certificate'..." We know that an amateur purchases components mostly in a hurry and are not pre-planned. Now that an "application" has been made, even if they are lucky enough to be "qualified after review" and receive a "Purchase Certificate", the time spent will definitely not be within three to five days. By then, the researcher will have long since lost interest and will not be able to muster any interest; not to mention that there are various reasons such as being unable to "qualify" after "review", and those who come to apply for purchase from outside the city cannot wait long. This is simply hindering "scientific research" and restricting "academic freedom"; and how can social customs be improved, and how can cultural construction be completed?

In my humble opinion, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications should establish a "Wireless Radio Amateur Research Association". All amateurs must join the association, but considerable guarantees are required to prevent spies from mixing in. Membership fees should be charged annually to cover the various expenses of this project. The association will issue certificates and purchase certificates (with photos attached), regardless of region, quantity, or type, without the need to apply. All members have the right to "free purchase"; however, retailers should copy the purchase certificate number, etc., and submit a list for the authorities to check at any time.

I hope that amateurs will respond and urge the authorities to implement it, giving us a guarantee of academic freedom!

### National Post Office in Deficit: Losses Exceed Ten Million per Month

Whether Japanese Postage Rates Will Be Adjusted Has Not Been Ordered

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Wang Yuguang, the assistant of the Shanghai Postal Administration, told reporters yesterday that when victory came, the Shanghai Post Office made a considerable profit due to the adjustment of postage rates. However, due to soaring prices in recent days, the income from postage has been insufficient to cover expenses. Recently, the total amount of losses of post offices nationwide has reached more than ten million yuan per month, becoming a major burden on the country. The reporter then asked whether the post office was considering adjusting postage rates. Mr. Wang replied that he had not yet received any orders from the General Post Office on this point. As for the postal situation in the nine northeastern provinces, the Harbin and Changchun post offices have been taken over, and an office of the General Post Office has been established in Changchun. The postal services in Subei and North China have not yet fully returned to normal and need to be negotiated. Mr. Wang also revealed that this issue may need to be resolved in Beiping. The postal service in Taiwan is smooth, but the organization there has always been a combination of postal and telecommunications services, which is slightly different from that of other parts of our country. The director and deputy director after the takeover were directly appointed by the Ministry of Communications and have not yet taken office. As for whether the post office will resume foreign exchange remittance services, it remains to be decided by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau.

### Properties of Deceased Traitors: Request for Instructions on How to Handle; Extremely Large Amounts of Properties of Traitor Chuan Xiao'an and Others Seized

During the period of the enemy's invasion of China, those traitors who acted as accomplices, who had not been sanctioned by national law before victory and had luckily died, whether their remaining traitorous properties should be treated the same as the traitorous properties of traitors who had not died and had been arrested, and be confiscated in full, or whether they should still be inherited by the heirs of the traitor, and not be disposed of, the government authorities have not yet had clear regulations. Recently, the investigation team of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has seized many cases of traitorous properties of the above-mentioned situation, and because they could not be disposed of, they have submitted them to the Executive Yuan for explanation. According to personnel of the team, the traitorous properties of deceased traitors should be treated the same as the traitorous properties of traitors who have not died, otherwise the deceased traitors would be too cheap, escaping national law and maintaining their properties. For example, recently, the team seized the traitorous property of Chuan Xiao'an, the first puppet mayor of Shanghai, whose value was astonishing. Part of it was still in the name of the traitor Chuan, and part of it had been changed to the name of the heir. According to the investigation, the traitorous properties of Chuan include a large number of stocks in the Zhonghui Bank, Zhongya Bank, Minfu Bank, Ningshao Shipping Company, and Ningshao Insurance Company, Xiang Dayuan Hardware Store, and a large amount of hardware materials in two warehouses at No. 140 Wuchang Road and No. 6, Lane 89 Wuchang Road. Real estate includes all the houses in YuAnli, Wuchang Road, all the houses in Yuanheli, Gorden Road and Robeson Road, a foreign house at No. 1286 Yangshupu Road, and real estate houses in Xiafei Road and other places. The above-mentioned houses and warehouses have now been sealed and kept by the investigation team. Once the explanation and reply from the Executive Yuan arrive, they can be definitively disposed of.

Multiple Other Seizures of Traitorous Properties

In recent days, the office has also seized more than 200 houses and properties in the city that were owned by two major economic traitors, Chen BoFan, the chairman of the Puppet Match Control Joint Association, Wu Yong'An, the general manager of the Puppet Sino-Japanese Industrial Bank, and Gao GuanWu, the puppet governor of Anhui Province. The three traitors, Chen, Wu, and Gao, were arrested by our military authorities long ago, and their traitorous properties were only seized a few days ago based on confidential reports. Traitor Chen owns a total of 70 foreign houses in the Huanlong Road area, in addition to a large amount of land. Traitor Wu owns all the houses in Xiangmaoli, Diswei Road, and No. 162 to No. 167 Jiaeryi Ai Road, and all the houses in Lane 178, Tongren Road, a total of 91 houses. Gao GuanWu owns 17 houses in No. 669, Zhaojiabang Road, Nanshi (Tairuili). The above-mentioned traitorous properties have been sealed by the investigation team and are said to be confiscated in full.

Two Japanese Merchant Ships Seized

In addition, according to confidential reports, a certain Japanese trading company transferred two ships, Xieshun and Xiemao, to Chinese merchants Jiangsu Shipping Company and Huamin Transportation Company for operation after the victory. After the investigation team conducted a detailed investigation of the transfer process with the two companies, it found that the evidence held by the two companies was insufficient and suspected of forgery. Therefore, Xieshun and Xiemao were detained and confiscated last weekend and will be transferred to the China Merchants Bureau for takeover.

### Housewife Robbed and Tied Up

Robbery Occurs on Wansheng Road

At 7:30 last night, three robbers suddenly came to the home of Kong Yongqing, resident of No. 2 Xishanli, Wansheng Road, Nanshi. Each robber produced a pistol and used scarves to tie up the housewife, etc. They were robbed of eight gold rings, two pairs of gold earrings, one gold bracelet, and one gold watch before escaping.

### Retrial of the Ishihara Yu Case: Verdict May Be Announced This Week

The US War Crimes Tribunal retried Ishihara Yu, the Japanese war criminal and former translator of the Jiangwan and Wusong concentration camps, yesterday, and summoned Sato, the former director of the Wusong concentration camp, to testify. The Japanese was patient and untiring, and explained to the court that he did not know much about the matter, and only later learned that Ishihara Yu had abused prisoners of war. He also said that after learning about this, he immediately dismissed Ishihara Yu. The case is scheduled for retrial this morning, and a verdict may be announced this week.

### House Collapses on Chengdu Road

[Report from Our Newspaper] The cross-street building at No. 128 Chengdu Road collapsed suddenly at around 12:15 yesterday afternoon due to years of disrepair. A man named Wo Wei was injured on the spot, suffering head and chest injuries.

### US Dollar Telegraphic Transfer Rate Unchanged Yesterday; More Registration Applications

(Report from Our Newspaper) The US dollar telegraphic transfer rate announced by the Central Bank yesterday remained at 2,020 yuan. Various designated banks and foreign exchange brokers referred to this for buying and selling, and the market was stable throughout the day. A reporter visited a person in charge of the international department of a designated bank, who said: Currently, there are not many transactions, and the Central Bank is not temporarily conducting futures trading. However, if various designated banks have futures positions, they can still try to conduct some trading, with a maximum term of three months. At present, because the Central Bank only announces the US dollar telegraphic transfer rate, if customers come to settle foreign exchange for other countries, the various designated banks must find their own exchange rate levels, which is relatively complicated. It is also heard that in foreign exchange market transactions, the Central Bank does not pay commissions when selling foreign exchange, and the commission between importers and exporters and brokers is 2.5 jiao per thousand yuan. The commission between banks and brokers is 1.25 jiao per thousand yuan.

Also: Importers and exporters have gradually returned to normal. Yesterday, they contacted the 27 designated banks and approved foreign exchange brokers one after another, which was more enthusiastic than the previous day. Until about 5 o'clock, according to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, more than 40 applications for foreign exchange from Chinese and foreign merchants have been received.

### US War Correspondent Returns to Shanghai from Shenyang

Soviet Side Once Issued Expulsion Order

According to US military news: Seven US war correspondents returned to Shanghai from Shenyang yesterday. They claimed that this trip was the result of an expulsion order issued by the Soviet army. During their stay in the Northeast, their freedom of movement was lost, which was equivalent to house arrest. The telegrams from the reporters in Shenyang all arrived late, but although the reporters could not be stationed in the Northeast for interviews for a long time, the general public paid more attention to the subtle and unpredictable situation in the Northeast.

### Emergency Measures to Regulate People's Food: Public Sale of Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains

In order to quickly regulate people's food, the Special Commissioner's Office of Food Administration specially held a joint public sale of miscellaneous grains with the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau in the conference room of the office at 3 pm yesterday. There were 5,025 packages of corn, 7,653 packages of sorghum, 608 packages of sweet potatoes, and 81 packages of red beans, totaling 13,000 tons. There were no restrictions on the qualifications of bidders. As of yesterday, 69 units had submitted bids.

### Robbery on a Minhang-Bound Steamer: Fierce Resistance for Three to Four Hours; Details of Police Chief Wang Zhenchang's Heroic Death

[Report from our newspaper] Steamboats traveling between Shanghai and Minhang depart from the Old Zhabei Bridge on the Suzhou Creek every morning and arrive in Minhang around 5 PM. The day before yesterday, another steamboat, carrying flour, sugar, and other goods and over thirty passengers, had just arrived near Wangjiadu in Pudong around 1:30 PM when four bandits, who had been hiding in the lower deck disguised as passengers, suddenly pulled out box cannons, pistols, and other weapons to threaten the passengers and arbitrarily rob them. Fortunately, the boatman was alert and sent a signal to the shore in Pudong. The army and police on the shore noticed and fired several shots, which slightly deterred the bandits, who immediately stopped their robbery. Only a few people were robbed, and the losses were relatively limited.

People Assisting in the Capture of Thieves

When the boat reached Huajingkou in Puxi, the bandits jumped onto a small boat, ordered the boatman to quickly dock, and fled with their loot after landing. At that time, some of the passengers on the steamboat disembarked one after another and followed closely. Luo Mengyu, a patrol officer from the Changqiao Township Police Station of the Longhua Branch Bureau, had already received a report and led police officer Wang Zhenchang, a Shandong native, badge number 8601, and four other policemen to chase after them, firing shots from afar. The bandits, in desperation, fled across the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to Bridge No. 4. By the time they were chased to Bridge No. 3, more and more people had gathered and assisted in the pursuit, creating a clamorous atmosphere.

Police Chief Shot Twice

Seeing the large number of pursuers, the bandits split into two groups, each taking cover behind a grave in the fields, and fired back. Police Chief Wang Zhenchang, fearlessly leading the charge, rushed to the side of one grave and captured two unarmed bandits, handing them over to the other policemen to guard. He then continued to another grave, only five steps away from the bandits, when he was shot in the chest and left leg. He collapsed and was then stabbed in the head over eleven times by one of the bandits, causing a profuse amount of blood to flow. He was barely alive. His police hat was also snatched away.

Fighting for Three to Four Hours

At the same time, police officers from the Meilong Township Police Station had arrived and were detaining suspects on the left flank of the Nan Zhujia Village. He, the Director of the Longhua Branch Bureau, personally led Criminal Section Chief Wang Chengying and over twenty police officers, driving a police vehicle to advance toward the central section of Zhujia Village. The entire police force of the Changqiao Branch surrounded Wengbanqiao on the right flank. The three groups of men jointly searched. The Shanghai County Police Bureau had also received a report and quickly dispatched two detectives, who met at Bridge No. 4. A fierce battle between the police and the bandits lasted for three to four hours, consuming over a hundred rounds of ammunition.

Two More Suspects Apprehended

As it neared dusk, the two bandits armed with box cannons and pistols managed to escape. After a large-scale search of the surrounding villages, a suspect named Shao Ziquan from Nanjing was apprehended, carrying a load of pig bristles. He was taken to the branch bureau for interrogation. Police Chief Wang, who had been seriously wounded, was transported to Shanghai in a rice truck with the intention of sending him to the police hospital, but his injuries were too severe, and he died en route. Yesterday morning, Director He of the branch bureau told reporters that the death of Police Chief Wang in the line of duty was deeply regrettable and that his courage and ability were greatly admired. Police Chief Wang was thirty-six years old and had served in the police force for seven years, recently being promoted to police chief. Unfortunately, he tragically met his death, leaving behind a wife and child, with a desolate family situation. A request for generous compensation will be submitted to the General Bureau, it is said.

The two unarmed bandits who were captured are named Wang Jinfa and Li Jingen. According to their confession, the armed bandits at large were formerly soldiers, and they also revealed the addresses of their accomplices. Yesterday morning, Section Chief Wang of the branch bureau led section members to arrest a suspect named Yue Shouzhen at No. 7, Lane 596, Minguo Road. The two bandits who resisted arrest by firing guns are still being actively pursued.

Issuing Counterfeit Money and Manipulating Speculation

[Report from our newspaper] Mao Renyu, 47 years old, from Wujiang, who was the Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and the Chief of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch, was recently accused of absorbing legal currency, issuing counterfeit money, manipulating speculation, and raising prices during the war and arrested. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution against him. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court of the High Court in Tilanqiao opened the trial. The defendant confessed to holding the puppet position. He also stated that the total amount of counterfeit money issued was over 380 million yuan. The reason for printing counterfeit money without serial numbers was that prices were soaring at the time, and the turnover of money in the market was not smooth. In order to ensure a rapid supply, no serial numbers were added. The bank also hired a Japanese person named Kimura as a consultant. The authority to issue currency was actually in the hands of Zhou Fohai, who approved it and handed it over to the Business Bureau for handling. Although he had the title of issuing currency, he was actually only responsible for safekeeping. He hired two lawyers, Zhang Zhengxue and Li Baosen, to defend him. The court ordered him to be detained for a further hearing at a later date.

### Committee for the Defense of Democratic Spain Hopes for Sympathy from All Countries; Reception for Newspaper Reporters Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai-based Committee for the Defense of Democratic Spain hosted reporters from various newspapers yesterday at 3 PM on the third floor of No. 51 Guangdong Road. The chairman of the committee, Kao Luomo, the secretary, Pu Yana, the finance director, Jialamala, the surgical medicine specialist from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Elesi, and the traveling medical officer, Rong Geshou, (both of whom served with distinction caring for the wounded during the Spanish Civil War) attended.

According to Mr. Kao: The Franco government is the enemy of the Spanish democratic government. Since the Spanish Revolution in 1936, the people have been living in the tragedy of bloodshed. Franco has used his power to collude with the fascist Hitler, endangering the people. His violent power has caused countless Spanish people to suffer in misery. From now on, the Spanish people must respond to the call of the national Republicans to overthrow the "Franco government" in order to establish a new government of the people's freedom. At the same time, they deeply hope that all countries will sympathize with them and recognize the Republican government. Mr. Kao also said that although China has not yet recognized the Spanish Republican government, the Spanish Republican people are deeply grateful for China's friendship and sympathy for Spain and hope to cooperate more closely in the future. There are currently 450 Spanish residents in Shanghai, but some of them are children and Filipino or Chinese residents. The committee was established in November 1941 and secretly carried out its work during the enemy and puppet period.

### The Yarn Market Remains Calm, Spot Cotton Trading is Decent

Yesterday, the yarn market continued its downward trend. This was due to a larger supply from the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) after the close of the previous day's trading, coupled with the significant quantities of 20-count yarn offered by major mills. This caused some traders with tight finances to sell off their stock for cash. Customer sales were slow, and prices fell by 50,000 to 100,000 (currency unit unspecified), leading to a calm atmosphere in the market.

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was relatively stable, with decent trading volume.

### General Overview of Textile Construction Company Operations

Reasons for Higher Sales Prices

The Cotton Cloth Guild recently reported that the China Textile Construction Company (中國紡織建設公司) was restricting membership to the guild. However, the company's Business Department Directors, Zhang Siliu and Jiang Dixian, stated that this was not true. The company's current situation is as follows:

(1) The company has registered the following number of yarn and cloth businesses:

329 yarn businesses, 812 cloth businesses (including weaving mills and towel factories), 198 knitting factories, 286 dyeing and weaving factories, 58 underwear factories, 80 handkerchief factories, and 174 woolen mills.

(2) The "fair-price" cloth sold by various companies in Shanghai is limited to 1.5 zhang (丈, approx. 3.3 meters) per person, resulting in lower prices. The quantity of yarn and cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company is not limited, and as it is a business operation, its prices are higher than those of other companies.

(3) The Textile Construction Company sells cotton yarn every Monday and Thursday, cotton cloth every Tuesday and Friday, and linen, wool, and woolen goods every Wednesday and Saturday.

(4) The company is internally divided into five departments: Business, Engineering, Accounting, Auditing, and Secretarial.

(5) The enemy and puppet factories taken over by the company are partly back in operation, while the remainder are being prepared for resumption of production.

(6) The raw materials for all yarn, cloth, dyeing, and weaving factories are supplied by the company, and the finished products of these factories are sold by the company.

### Grain Prices Decline

The rice market is sluggish, with North China japonica rice continuing to fall by 1,000 (currency unit unspecified). Early thin-husk rice and early indica rice followed suit, decreasing by 300-500 (currency unit unspecified). However, white round-grain rice and indica rice were stable due to limited supply. In the oil market, shipments from Qingdao were popular, leading to a sharp price drop of 2,000-3,000 (currency unit unspecified). Flour fell slightly by 200-300 (currency unit unspecified), and soybeans also decreased by varying amounts from 500-600 to 1,000 (currency unit unspecified). Bean cake edged lower by 200-300 (currency unit unspecified), wheat bran weakened by 100-200 (currency unit unspecified), and raw peanuts also showed signs of softening.

(華聯糧業股份有限公司), with a capital of 50 million (currency unit unspecified), initially collecting half. The business will focus on the processing and transportation of rice, wheat, and other grains.

### Strong Sales of Firewood and Charcoal

Following the previous trend, bituminous coal blocks continue to sell well in the coal market, while bituminous coal dust and lower grades of white coal remain sluggish. The supply of firewood and charcoal is gradually increasing, and sales are also strong, making the market quite tight.

### Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee Denies Return of Looted Yarn and Cloth, Citing Length of Time and Difficulty of Verification

The Shanghai Cotton Cloth, Dyeing and Weaving, and Yarn Industry Guilds requested the return of looted yarn and cloth. The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau submitted the case to the Legal Advisory Committee for discussion. The committee concluded that the purchase of yarn and cloth was indeed forced by the enemy and puppets. According to the handling regulations and legal perspectives, the looted yarn and cloth should be returned. Five companies, including Yongxin (永新), Yongchang (永昌), and Licheng (立成), had already submitted documents and received approval from the Handling Bureau for return. Over 1,700 other companies were also in the process of collecting documents and applying according to the law. However, the 49th Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee ruled that because the Puppet Cotton Control Association's procurement of yarn and cloth had taken place a long time ago, and since the receipt of the yarn and cloth, most of it had been moved or double-sold, making verification impossible, the request could not be approved. The committee stated that if the yarn and cloth businesses held deposit slips from the Puppet Central Reserve Bank (僞中儲行) with unpaid amounts, they could directly apply for settlement at the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank. The Legal Advisory Committee's decision to approve the return of some yarn and cloth to Yongxin and other companies, without prior approval from the Review Committee, was revoked and declared invalid. Upon hearing this decision, the entire Shanghai cotton cloth, dyeing and weaving, and yarn industry was shocked, and many demanded that the guild fight for their rights according to the law. It is reported that the guild is currently discussing how to respond.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Cotton textiles remain weak due to the downturn in the yarn market. However, "901 Goose Brand" undershirts are selling well, and their price has uniquely risen by 2,000 (currency unit unspecified).

With the opening of foreign exchange, market sentiment has stabilized, and the prices of Western medicines have generally remained unchanged. Xiaozhilong tablets (消治龍片) have seen a slight price increase due to strong sales.

Among daily necessities, "Beautiful Phoenix" matches are selling well, and their price is showing a slight increase. The prices of various brands of soap are stable, while candles have seen a slight decrease.

The initial opening of the cigarette market has been quiet. There has been scattered selling of British American Tobacco (英美烟) products, while Chinese-made cigarettes are sluggish, and their prices have uniformly fallen.

In cosmetics, the season for vanishing cream has passed, and few traders are stocking it. The market price has also remained stagnant. Chinese and Western pharmacies have begun selling various perfumes, and trade is relatively brisk.

Paper sales have been significantly affected by the printing workers' strike. Very little Chinese-made paper has arrived, and prices have not easily decreased.

The prices of hardware items are mostly fluctuating in a weak range, with few increases. Only "Globe Brand" high-speed steel stands out due to the manufacturer's attention and scarce inventory.

In leather, transactions of yellow cowhide and black cow face leather are slightly more active, and prices have also risen slightly. The rest are generally stable.

### News from Hubei Province Middle Schools

Wuhan Middle School Students Face Lack of Schooling; Provincial Government Promotes Secondary Education

(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou) Among the over 6,000 middle school students in Wuhan, after the placement of municipal middle schools, temporary middle schools, and various training classes,

Over 2,000 Students Have No Schools to Attend

There are still over 2,000 students who have no schools to attend. The Ministry of Education and provincial and municipal authorities are very concerned and plan to find ways to increase the number of schools. However, due to the wartime damage to many buildings in Wuhan, it is temporarily impossible to find school buildings. Although the buildings of the former Puppet Railway Institute are very spacious, they have been occupied by the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications. Recently, after the Ministry of Education requested and received approval from the Executive Yuan, a telegram was sent ordering the office to hand over the buildings to the Ministry of Education for use as school sites. It is reported that the original site of the Puppet Institute is large enough to accommodate more than 1,000 students. Once the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications allows the handover, the problem of Wuhan middle school students lacking schooling can be partially resolved.

Vocational Schools Planned for Western and Northern Hubei

(Our Hankou Report) According to an announcement by the Hubei Provincial Government, in addition to the existing 16 provincial senior and junior high schools, Hubei secondary education will add 2 senior high schools and 6 junior high schools. The original 11 normal schools will also add 2 schools. One women's normal school will be established in each administrative region, and one provincial normal school will be established universally. Wuchang will establish a kindergarten normal school, a physical education normal school, and a social education normal school. County-run junior high schools and simplified normal schools in various counties will also be restored. As for vocational schools, there were originally only 6 schools. Now, it is planned to add 16 schools in the Western and Northern Hubei areas.

### Recent News from Shanghai Universities

Inconsistent Tuition Fees, Teachers' Salaries Need Adjustment

(Our Report) Universities in Shanghai have successively begun classes. This reporter has learned about the tuition fees from various schools as follows:

St. John's: Highest Tuition Fees

Among private universities, St. John's has the highest fees, totaling 45,000 (currency unit unspecified) (reduced from the original 70,000). The lowest is Shanghai University, at 28,000 (currency unit unspecified), because the school receives substantial donations from church organizations. Other schools such as Soochow, Aurora, Great China University, etc., mostly charge between 30,000 and 35,000 (currency unit unspecified), with limited differences. As for teacher hourly rates, Shanghai University has the highest, at 2,000 (currency unit unspecified) per hour, which is the same as the temporary university. The lowest is Jiaotong University, at 1,300 (currency unit unspecified) per hour. Other private universities are generally in the 1,500 (currency unit unspecified) range, which is not enough to cover teachers' transportation costs if the commute is long.

(Our Report) Professors at national universities in Shanghai have requested adjustments to their salaries and have sent telegrams to the Second Plenary Session, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the Standing Committee is carefully studying and considering the matter.

Professors' Association Discusses Salaries

More than 160 university professors in this area gathered at Fudan University to organize the "Shanghai University Professors' Association" (上海市大學敎授會). They elected Liu Dajie, Li Ximou, Zuo Renxia, Chen Kemei, Zhong Zhaolin, and others as 25 directors, and Jin Tongyin and others as 5 supervisors. They also scheduled a joint meeting of directors and supervisors for 5:00 PM today at the temporary university to discuss colleagues' situations, improve colleagues' welfare, and other fellowship matters. It is reported that private university professors will also ask the government for the same salary as the adjusted national university professors. If there is a shortfall, they will request the government to provide special funding to the schools.

### Brief News

Aurora University, originally established in Shanghai, established a branch in Sichuan in the spring of 1938 during the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has ended, the Shanghai headquarters has also been restored. According to the university regulations, the permanent establishment of branch schools is not permitted. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to transfer this branch to local Sichuanese to take over and rename it Chenghua University. The takeover was officially implemented on February 1st. All of the Chengdu branch's assets, valued at 150 million (currency unit unspecified), have been donated and received by Chenghua University.

Jing'an Temple in Shanghai has established a "Buddhist Academy" to cultivate Buddhist monks capable of promoting Buddhism, and has specially set up a research department at the Xizhu Temple in Hongkou. Master Taixu has been appointed as the dean and will fly from Chongqing to Shanghai to preside over the opening ceremony soon, it is said.

Members of the Wesley Fellowship of the Chinese Christian Moore Memorial Church are holding a supplementary night school at 17 Hefei Road, Shanghai, recruiting male and female students aged 14 to 40. Students with levels ranging from junior primary to senior high school are welcome to enroll. Registration will begin on the 8th and classes will begin on the 15th.

The Shanghai Private China Girls' High School has resumed classes at its original site on Linyin Road in Nanshi. Its branch school at 286 Lane, East of Huangpi South Road on Fuxing Middle Road continues to recruit new students. The affiliated Guangming Primary School has also resumed classes there and offers half-fee positions.

The site for the Military Sports Academy is planned to be outside Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing, and military sports expert Cheng Dengke will be responsible for the preparations. It is expected to begin recruiting students this summer.

### Yesterday's Basketball League: Outstanding Performance; Hualian Defeats Jiangwan; Zhang Liangxiong's Shooting is Divinely Assisted, Resulting in a 52 to 37 Victory

The Hualian basketball team launched a very smooth offensive last night, defeating the Jiangwan Air Force team by a score of 52 to 37. This victory created a record of four wins and zero losses in the basketball league. In the first half, Hualian led by 6 points with a score of 27 to 21. The 1,500 spectators in the city stadium cheered. Li Zhenzhong was absent from Hualian, with only Chen Xuechong, Zhang Liangxiong, Kong Guangyi, and Bao Songyuan present. Wu Chengzhang did not arrive until after the scheduled start time to complete the team. Zhang Liangxiong's shooting last night seemed divinely assisted, and his incomparable skill earned him 20 points, making him the greatest contributor last night. Hualian led all the way in the first half, exceeding by two or three points. After tying at 15 and 17, Hualian broke away, ending the first half with a score of 27 to 21. At the beginning of the second half, leading scorer Zhang Liangxiong had already accumulated four fouls, causing concern for Hualian. Fortunately, the offensive did not decline. After a score of 29 to 25, Hualian scored thirteen consecutive points, leading by as much as 17 points with a score of 42 to 25. Although Jiangwan counterattacked and regained seven points, Hualian continued to score, resulting in a final victory of 52 to 37. Hualian's performance was extremely excellent. Although the Jiangwan Air Force's shooting was accurate, its disorganized formation was the main cause of its defeat. In the game before, Green Forest defeated Haiying by a score of 47 to 33.

### Wartime Zhejiang Cultural Cradle: A Glimpse of National Yingshi University (Part Two)

— Huang Lan

Currently, the entire school has over a thousand students. In the spring semester of this year, the College of Engineering and the two specialized departments of Administration and Finance have newly recruited 270 more students. Next year's quota is expected to increase even further. In terms of facilities, they are still rudimentary due to the relatively short history of the school and the extensive damage caused by the past battles in eastern Zhejiang. Although the Ministry of Education has approved an allocation of 90,000 yuan from the operating budget for equipment, it is feared that this will still be insufficient to meet actual needs. The faculty members have been extensively recruited over the years. With the exception of a few unsatisfactory individuals, most are scholars of profound learning. The school's curriculum is quite rigorous, especially in the College of Engineering, where the weekly teaching hours reach more than thirty hours, fostering a strong research atmosphere among the students.

In terms of academic atmosphere, it was previously characterized by composure and simplicity but has recently transformed into one of vitality and vigor. This is partly due to the stability of the situation and the uplifting of people's spirits and also due to the school's efforts to innovate its administration. Students have strong organizational abilities, and various alumni associations, student unions, and specialized academic societies are well-established. The student union regularly publishes "Yingshi Review," which makes significant contributions to school affairs. Various academic societies also publish specialized journals, providing students with ample writing opportunities. Other matters, such as the food committee, new student reception center, and various recreational competitions, are all managed by the students with remarkable success.

(5) Restoration Issues

Yingshi University is a child of hardship born from this war. Its inherent inadequacies and pitiable fate are undeniable. However, considering the determination of the entire school's faculty and students to revitalize the school and the highest significance of the government's establishment of Yingshi University, there is no doubt that Yingshi University will flourish in the future. Yingshi University's restoration plan this time includes three components: first, to determine a location in a major city as a permanent campus and build complete school buildings sufficient to meet the needs of the entire school; second, to add departments and open specialized disciplines according to actual needs in order to complete a comprehensive university structure; third, to recruit leading domestic professors and enrich the necessary equipment for each department so that teaching is truly worthy of the name. Apart from the first item, which remains unresolved, the other items have been carefully planned by the school authorities and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation.

As for the permanent campus issue: as early as two years ago, the Executive Yuan had decided that after the war, it would be moved to Shanghai or Wuxing to commemorate Mr. Yingshi's birth or martyrdom. Later, after the recovery of various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the school immediately sent personnel to investigate the campus locations in the aforementioned two places. Several former sites of the French-Chinese Natural Science Research Institute and other locations in Shanghai were tentatively designated as temporary school buildings, and more than a hundred Japanese military barracks were taken over in Wuxing County. Just as it was about to be submitted to the higher authorities for selection and relocation, the Ministry of Education suddenly intended to relocate it to Jinhua for the sake of distributing the national university education network. Later, President Du represented the students twice to visit Minister Zhu, requesting to maintain the old decision of the Executive Yuan to facilitate the future development of Yingshi University. At that time, no decision was made. Later, former Minister Chen and others advocated for a re-evaluation by the Executive Yuan before a decision was made, so the relocation was suspended. According to reliable sources, the new campus of Yingshi University will be located in Wuxing or may temporarily move to Shanghai for classes for a period of time. Therefore, the school calendar for this semester has been extended by three weeks, and the winter vacation has been shortened to one week. It is expected that it will end early in June this year. It is predicted that Yingshi University will have a new look after moving to Shanghai and Huzhou. (Sent from Yongjia on February 27th)

Spring and Autumn

### The Dawn of Revival

— Hua Lin

Revolution is the duty of the people, not the privilege of a few. Officials are to serve the people, not special figures!

If these two points are clearly understood, there will be no end to the jokes. Look at the two major news items on the second day of this month's newspaper.

(1) The US Secretary of State's speech, "No country will be allowed to dominate the world alone!"

(2) The Second Plenary Session is expected to propose, "Eradicate bureaucracy and eliminate bureaucratic capital!"

It can be seen that the people of the country are awakening, and the world is also working towards a bright direction. This World War, after passing through this long period of darkness, divided the world into two major camps of "free world" and "controlled world." Now that Nazism has been destroyed, those who still want to control the world using Nazi methods can also deeply realize that such hegemonic ambitions will not be tolerated by the people of the world!

Progressive elements in the world should move forward along the right path of democratic thought. The so-called liberty, equality, and fraternity are linked together as one. Since the French Revolution announced the protection of human rights, anyone with hegemonic ambitions who wants to control the world has not escaped fundamental destruction. Did the ambitions of Germany's Wilhelm II and Hitler's mad tyranny mean that imperialism still exists now? Fanatical elements who blindly follow the crowd can also be vigilant!

The world is a whole, like cells in the body, inseparable from each other. No matter which corner of the world, if there is a part that is sick, it will affect the safety of the entire life. (See Ba Shan's Idle Talk), no one can survive independently from the crowd. Autocratic thought and bureaucracy, these two kinds of violence that violate humanity, please bury them in the Nazi graveyard. The dawn of revival is coloring [the sky] with the crowing of the rooster!

### Triumphal Song

— Yu Hong

——Random Notes from a Small Town

Living in the occupied area for eight years without going "inside," I often feel very ashamed. But the more days I live in this place, the more I admire the fighters who fight in the wilderness and defend famous cities. When I was little, I read a poem in a stone-printed palm-sized novel: "The whip strikes the golden saddle ring, singing triumphantly together," I thought the rhythm was very pleasant, so I memorized it firmly. Even when I grew up and even now, I still haven't forgotten it.

Naturally, this is a sentence praising the triumphant expeditionary forces, and it may even have a bit of aggressive meaning in it, which may not be suitable for our resistance war this time. But in these eight years, every time I walked past the humiliation with tears in my eyes, I loved these ten characters even more. I am naturally not qualified to experience it in the realm of poetry, but it is good to think about it and see it often. Because I have not analyzed why I have this long-cherished hope, perhaps there is a bit of revenge in it?

But this kind of waiting is very difficult, because every day I have to walk past the humiliation, and every day I have to make a living in the face of humiliation. To be more practical, I can't bear the bitter taste of national subjugation, and I hope that the day of victory will come, because this poem represents victory, whether it is a victory with aggressive meaning or a victory for survival, in short, it releases the shackles of depression and allows us to straighten our backs in the face of humiliation.

I also know that it takes more perseverance to enter the realm of poetry, but there is a little extravagance. If I can't see the team striking the golden saddle and the soldiers singing triumphantly, then it's okay to just listen to the song called "Triumphal Song." Because I often went to a friend's house late at night to listen to his hidden and unmodified shortwave radio, which transmitted the song of resistance from the free small city, "Arise, you who refuse to be slaves," and the battlefield march "Swords slashed at the heads of the Japanese devils." These are still far away from victory, but I am already familiar with them, although they are not without stimulation. But because they grew up in humiliation, it seems that this humiliation will never end.

Later, this radio and my friend went to the "military police team" together, so I could only hear the local broadcaster shouting "I sing, I fly..." pretending to be happy songs, and decadent tunes like "Flowers are about to bloom red, and unmarried people are good." I am a person without a sense of music, so listening to songs is just a confused fascination with the "Triumphal Song."

In the past few years, I have been wandering for life, although not necessarily "exhausted," I have suffered even more the bitterness of being a slave. A little bit of spiritual comfort is not enough to heal the temporary wounds. Therefore, the more urgent I hope for victory, I even have Lu Fangweng's mood of "When the royal army recovers the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father during the family sacrifice." This heart of waiting for victory is more eager than a child in the twelfth month waiting for the New Year.

When I woke up, victory had quietly arrived. I didn't dare to believe it, and I wondered if I was dreaming, but it was indeed true. So I evoked the old phrase again: "The whip strikes the golden saddle ring, singing triumphantly together." This seems to be a wish that is too easy to realize. Every day I go to the street to wait for the national army. It is so hard to wait, so hard, so hard. One day, two days, three days, four days, I can't count them, but I finally waited.

I am just reporting the situation in our small place. The national army walked past with solemn steps; everyone shouted "Long live, long live!" loudly. There were two or three horses, but no songs. It doesn't mean that the love for the national army was reduced because there were no songs, but I just felt like something was missing, like a dream that had not been completed.

### Old House

— Xiao Qun

I have come to this place again. I don't know if I have suddenly grown old or if other things have changed too quickly. I can hardly believe my eyes. Our old house is suddenly much shorter, the doors and walls have lost their luster, the white plaster has peeled off, leaving mottled stains, and everything has become gray and dilapidated. It seems like it has been deserted for many years, and its owner seems to have left this place for a long, long time, letting it collapse.

I see many unfamiliar faces. They don't seem to notice me. Firewood, charcoal dust, and dry branches are scattered all over the yard. Adults are sitting under the eaves basking in the sun or sewing something. Children are running around, falling down and wailing. Others are pinching chalk and drawing some clumsy patterns on the door panels. The gatehouse, which used to be tightly closed all year round, is now wide open. Occasionally, people shaking small drums and selling needles and threads pass by, stopping their steps; they look at it for a long time, their eyes containing some surprise. They might think:

"Hey, the owner of this house passed away not long ago, how could it become like this!"

Then they pick up their steps again, shaking their small drums and walking away with a tinkling sound.

Later, someone discovered me, walking over with trembling steps, looking at me from head to toe with dim eyes.

"Aren't you the second young master?"

"Yes."

"You're back!"

Many chickens are vying to eat in front of my feet, and the old man drives them away, but they gather again.

"Look, it's really outrageous, such a big yard has been ruined like this."

I look around with unfamiliar eyes, then I lower my head. I dare not think, I grew up here when I was a child. At that time, the glass windows were always wiped bright and clean, and the beams and pillars were painted red and shiny... A strong emotion tightly restrains me, my nose is sore, and I want to cry, but I finally barely hold it back. I turn my head and ask the old man:

"Have you been here all the time?"

"That's right, I'm old and can't move anymore. I've seen too much of what's going on in this house, young master, don't you remember how you used to pester me to grab...?"

I nod and give him a bitter smile. The old man continues:

"I really didn't expect things to change so quickly. To say that when this house was built, I saw it with my own eyes. Who would have thought that after so many years, it would be ruined like this. Do you see those residents in front? It's just outrageous, like a big tenement yard. If the old master knew there would be such a day, I don't know how sad he would be."

Our steps move slowly towards the back garden. As if discovering a miracle, I see a winter jasmine still climbing on the wall. This winter is not very cold, and after the New Year, yellow flower buds have already grown out. I feel a little joy. I pick a branch and smell it by my nose. A trace of a smile flashes across the old man's withered face.

"Only this winter jasmine is still alive, second young master, don't you want it? Where do you live? I'll send it to you right away."

But I shake my head, and I suddenly leave the ancient mansion again.

### Dialogue between a Horse and a "Horse"

— Ren Jun

——One of the Street Ballads

One day——

A horse-drawn carriage and a chartered car stopped in the same place;

The horse glanced at the coachman,

The coachman also glanced at the horse.

The horse spoke to the coachman:

(With a question mark drawn in its eyes)

"I am a horse, I can't help but let my shoulders and back

Be used as a road for people to walk on!

But what about you?——

But you are an out-and-out human being!"

The coachman lowered his head:

(With a faint bitter smile on his face)

"Please don't flatter me,

How can I be a human being?

You know, I'm just like you,

Also a horse!

The only difference is——

You have four legs,

But what about me?——

But I only have a pair!"

### Double Flight (18)

— Zhao Qingge

Li Yun's appearance was originally very pretty, but unfortunately, she had smallpox one year, and some scattered pockmarks were left on her face. This child is more innocent, lively, and stubborn than Lihua. In her narrow mind, she only knows how to play vaguely, and she is not interested in things other than playing. Because she was not born as beautiful as Second Madam Weng, and her temper was better than Second Madam Weng's, as long as there was something that didn't go her way, she would cry and make a fuss endlessly. Therefore, Second Madam Weng didn't like her very much and could only let her be herself. Naturally, Old Master Weng also had no time to educate her. Old Master Weng regarded Lihua and other things the same way, very lightly. But Madam Mo loved her more than her parents, perhaps because Madam Mo could not get comfort from her own children, she wanted to exchange feelings from other people's children. Moreover, in Madam Mo's consciousness, Second Madam Weng's daughter was just like her own daughter.

In the past few years, Old Master Weng's opium addiction has become more and more serious. He sleeps during the day and smokes opium at night, which makes Second Madam Weng still live a lonely life like seven years ago, and the days have become unbearable! Some of the fields that Second Madam Weng bought have been sold by Old Master Weng. Now there is only one house left, and Old Master Weng is still calculating that the price of this house can be enough for him to smoke opium for a year.

Second Madam Weng hated it so much that she gritted her teeth and often scolded Old Master Weng: "Why don't you die? If you die, I will be more peaceful." But Old Master Weng told her with a smile: "If I die, you will be a widow!" But Second Madam Weng didn't think so! Isn't Second Madam Weng equal to a widow now? Moreover, Second Madam Weng sometimes thinks: it's better to be a widow and be more free. Now that Old Master Weng is alive, she can't just marry someone like this, even though she has already had this idea.

In fact, the bankruptcy of the Weng family is not entirely the fault of Old Master Weng alone, Second Madam Weng is also responsible. Although she doesn't smoke opium, her consumption is also quite considerable. For example, she dresses up; she likes to play; she pays attention to eating and drinking; all of this expenditure is no less than that of Old Master Weng. Naturally, her reason is depression, so she needs to find recreation and seek sustenance in all aspects of life.

### Social Service American Youth Willing to Travel to Shanghai

Seeking Hosts

Yesterday, an American youth sent a letter, translated as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam: I am an American, 31 years old, I am very fond of literature, and I have worked as a journalist.

If I stay in your city for a few days, I wonder if there are any people willing to be hosts? If they can guide me, I will be grateful. After returning to my country, I will write a book based on what I have heard and seen, and then present it for your instruction, which will also be an aid to Sino-American friendship. Wishing you good health. J. Manka, December 10, 1945.

This column previously received a letter from Yuanfengsheng Rice Store, No. 533 Julu Road, stating that the Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road area is still a place where pickpockets appear. On the 22nd of last month, a shop assistant carried a large amount of legal tender and placed it behind a bicycle. When passing by the area, it was all cut away. He immediately reported to the Huangpu Old Zha Sub-Bureau for investigation. The shop assistant, feeling innocent and unable to clear his name, sought death. Therefore, he requested the two newspapers to publish it so that the police could pay attention to it and save his life.

This column forwarded the original letter to Sun Jialiang, the director of the Old Zha Sub-Bureau, for handling. Yesterday, Director Sun replied in a letter saying:

"Regarding the pickpocketing incident on Beijing Road, since I took office, two cases have been solved. The large amount of money stolen from the rice store has already been solved, and the store has been notified to come to the bureau to retrieve the lost funds..." This is specially published so that the owner pays attention.

### Service Briefing

Seeking Lin Yimin I have been entrusted by the Political Department of the 70th Army of the stationed army in Taiwan Province to bring a document to Lin Changming's house at No. 1 Penglai Road, This city, for Lin Yimin. However, I went to inquire there yesterday, and there was no No. 1, so I could not complete the task. It is understood that Mr. Lin came to Shanghai on the order of the department to recruit political team drama propaganda personnel. The document I brought is for the purpose of these personnel going to Taiwan and is very important. I hope that your department will publish an interview on behalf of the department. Yang Cunshou of the Political Department of the 70th Army of the Army sincerely wrote.
