### Relief for Northeastern Farmers - Joint Issuance of Agricultural Loans

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] Since the fall of the Northeast, farmers in various areas have been subjected to economic exploitation by the enemy and puppet regimes, making livelihoods extremely difficult. Although there was a good harvest last year, which could have provided some respite, they were heavily plundered again, leaving them without any productive capacity. Now that spring plowing season is here, farmers in various areas are still unable to engage in agricultural work. The Relief Administration is concerned about the hardships of the people and took advantage of Chairman's presence in Shenyang to present the situation to the Chairman. The Chairman approved the proposal for the China Farmers Bank and the Relief Administration to jointly issue agricultural loans. The Chairman also instructed Chief of Staff Zhang Jia'ao of the Executive Headquarters and Director Liu Guangpei of the Relief Administration to handle the matter jointly.

### Important War Criminal of the Invasion of China - Sakai Takashi's Crimes are Definite - Trial Concluded Yesterday, Sentence to be Announced Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The war criminal Sakai Takashi was tried today by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Army Headquarters. Prior to the trial, spectator tickets were issued, and spectators arrived in droves at 8:00 AM today. At 9:45 AM, the Presiding Judge Shi Meiyu, along with Jury Members Meng Chuanda, Gao Qimai, Bao Qihuang, and Zhu Ying San, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu, and Clerk Zhang Tikun, entered the courtroom in succession. Sakai Takashi was then escorted into the courtroom by military police and court police. Sakai Takashi appeared composed when entering the courtroom, holding his head high. He then stood at the defendant's seat. Sakai had short hair and a short beard, wearing a navy blue serge suit, a khaki shirt, and yellow-rimmed glasses. He brought two books into the courtroom. At that time, the magnesium lights in the courtroom flashed, and photographers scrambled for shots. After Presiding Judge Shi announced the opening of the court, Chief Prosecutor Chen Guangyu first read out the indictment, which contained four points of criminal facts: (1) Organizing special service agencies, (2) Military and political aggression against China, (3) Launching wars of aggression, (4) Slaughtering our compatriots and committing rampant rape, with extremely heinous crimes. The entire reading lasted for 25 minutes. Subsequently, the translation into Japanese took another 25 minutes. Then, Presiding Judge Shi began the interrogation. First, he asked Sakai's age and origin (Sakai listened intently, taking notes quickly with a pencil, seemingly intending to use them for defense, and occasionally smiling), and investigated his duties. Sakai is 60 years old, from Hiroshima. He graduated from the Japanese Army University in the fifth year of Taisho and came to China in the eighth year of Taisho. He then traveled back and forth between China and Japan, serving as officers of various levels in the invasion of China. Regarding the Tanaka Memorial, Sakai said, "I am someone who has studied Chinese issues for many years. I have never seen such a fact, nor is it credible," with extremely cunning words. Regarding the interrogation about forcing our military commander-in-chief General He to replace the military and political leaders of North China, he repeatedly denied it, saying that it did not happen. Regarding participation in combat, he said: "As a soldier, I only know how to obey and have no responsibility." He also said, "This is just an incident, not aggression. The July 7th Incident was not a war. The Japanese did not want war, and the Japanese were also fighting for survival." At that time, Jury Member Meng Chuanda said, "Are you only allowing the Japanese nation to survive and not allowing other nations to survive?" Sakai was speechless. The interrogation ended at this point in the morning, and Presiding Judge Shi announced that the trial and debate would continue in the afternoon. The trial resumed at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. First, Prosecutor Chen stated that the criminal facts were divided into four parts: (1) Before the July 7th Incident, the defendant was the commander of all aggressive actions in North China, and he was the main planner of the July 7th Incident. (2) During the war, the defendant led the army with all kinds of atrocities and said: "I only represent millions of victims to request the death penalty for those who threaten the survival of the nation." After Sakai heard the translation, his face suddenly changed, and his attitude was no longer as calm as in the morning. He stood up to argue and hoped to extend the date of sentencing. Presiding Judge Shi informed him that the evidence was conclusive and rejected the request for an extension. The court then appointed defense lawyer Wang Long to plead on his behalf on both factual and legal grounds. The Presiding Judge believed that the reasons were insufficient. The prosecutor then requested a public trial with the death penalty. The Presiding Judge then announced that the sentence would be announced at 5:00 PM tomorrow. Sakai retreated from the court after nervously affixing his fingerprint.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th] The number one Japanese war criminal in South China, Tanaka Hisaichi, the former supreme commander of the Japanese army in South China, has been prosecuted by the military court prosecutor for crimes such as letting soldiers harm the people.

More than 20 relatives of the victims will be present at the court. The U.S. military will also send personnel to the court to present their opinions, as a group of U.S. pilots were brutally murdered by the defendant's subordinates.

### Secret Documents of the CCP Obtained from Communist Army Headquarters in Changchun - Du Yuming Announces Recovery of Anshan

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming (see picture) held a press conference at Changchun Airport at 3:00 PM this afternoon, attended by over 30 Chinese and foreign journalists. Commander Du first announced that the National Army had recovered Anshan today, as well as the Dongxiaofengman Hydroelectric Power Plant, the second largest power plant in the north. The National Army's progress was swift, and the Communist Army did not have time to destroy the plant, which is fully usable. A large number of Communist Army vehicles and heavy artillery were left on the south bank of the Songhua River and could not be transported. Mr. Du continued: The National Army obtained a top-secret document from the Communist Army headquarters in Changchun, which was a resolution of the CCP Central Political Bureau on March 12th of this year. Its content has four items: (1) The military takes an offensive posture in the Northeast; (2) The political takes a comprehensive offensive; (3) Absolutely not to resolve the issue with the Kuomintang during negotiations; (4) Estrange the Sino-American relationship. This Communist Army military operation in the Northeast began on March 12th, engaging in the destruction of railways, refusing negotiations, and spreading rumors about U.S. planes strafing. This proves that the Communist Army has been implementing the above resolution, which caused Changchun to fall into the ravages of war.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 30th] According to people coming from Chifeng, the situation in Rehe has eased since the National Army entered Changchun. Lieutenant Colonel Li Dezhong, the CCP representative of the Chifeng Group of the Executive Headquarters, arrived in Chifeng on the 22nd, but refused to inspect Gushannailin Hot Springs and other places, claiming that he had not received a formal order from the Executive Headquarters. Gushannailin Hot Springs was originally a National Army defense area, but the Communist Army launched a general offensive in Rehe in mid-May and successively occupied various places. Furthermore, U.S. and government personnel of the Executive Headquarters lost their freedom from the 8th of this month until the 25th. Zhao Zhuanghua, the 75-year-old Bishop of the Chifeng Catholic Church, has been imprisoned by the Communist Army. A certain priest was punished by being paraded through the streets because he had offended the Communist side.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th] The National Army's consolidation of its foreign operations in Changchun was completed after the recovery of Yongji. If a peaceful agreement in the Northeast cannot be reached soon, the Battle of Harbin will soon begin. The National Army's New First Army crossed Dehui yesterday morning and advanced north, reaching the banks of the Songhua River today. The "Democratic United Army" of Zhou Baozhong and his 60,000 troops are currently constructing fortifications along the north bank of the Songhua River, strengthening their defenses to hold onto Harbin. Another Communist Army force of over 20,000 troops has retreated to Qiqihar to engage in defense.

[Associated Press, Changchun, 30th] The National Army has extended forward from the recently recovered Changchun area, crossing the border of Jilin and occupying Luan (transliteration), 35 miles northeast of here, and the railway town of Yaomen, 50 miles north. They are now approaching the south bank of the Songhua River and advancing along the railway towards Harbin.

[United Press, Peiping, 30th] The Xinsheng Daily reports: After the National Army recovered Yongji, the capital city of Jilin Province, Lin Biao's troops retreated to Huadian.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Sources in the transportation sector report that the government has begun to repair the Jinpu, Pinghan, and Pingsui railways, and has allocated 8 million yuan and 300,000 catties of grain to provide relief to the refugees besieged by the Communist Army who are on the verge of death.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 29th] Conflicts in various parts of Shandong are gradually subsiding. There was no contact in the outposts around Jinan yesterday.

### Neutrals Discuss the Communist Party's Methods - Confusing International Figures

### Continuous Negotiations and Continuous Conflicts

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] After the recovery of Changchun, the government hopes that the domestic political situation can be resolved peacefully. The first step is to implement all the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, restore transportation, and reorganize and unify the armed forces. However, according to neutral observers, although the Communist Party had no choice but to withdraw from Changchun, it does not seem to have completely abandoned its attempt to secede from the Northeast. It is said that the Communist Party has received instructions from Yan'an to engage in "continuous negotiations and continuous conflicts" in order to confuse international figures, misleading them into believing that China is hopeless, so that they can cut off aid to China from allied nations. Therefore, people have to remain wary of the Communist Party. Some even say that when the Communist Party calls for negotiations, one should be wary of its secret conspiracy to create another conflict, as there have been many such examples in the past. In this regard, neutral figures who are currently seeking peace hope that the Communist Party will thoroughly correct its past mistakes and fully implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and not hinder the government's important task of restoring transportation, which is in the best interests of the people.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] This morning, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Minister Zhang Lisheng visited representatives of the Democratic League.

The representatives of the Democratic League visited the Sun Yat-Sen Mausoleum together this morning at 10:00 AM. During his meetings with the representatives of the Democratic League yesterday and today, CCP representative Zhou Enlai expressed the CCP's hope that a joint government would be realized in the Northeast and discussed the issue of military reorganization, but his words were vague and unrealistic, and the listeners seemed uninterested. According to neutral figures, the CCP does not yet have sincere intentions to repent, and even if meetings are held every day and negotiations are held every moment, it will not help the current difficulties. According to Mo Dehui, a representative of the social elite in the Political Consultative Conference, the key to resolving the current disputes is to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. It is rumored that Mr. Mo will not go to the Northeast in the short term.

### Marshall Deeply Aware - National Interests Outweigh Party Interests

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th, Special Dispatch] According to diplomatic sources, Special Envoy Marshall has a deep understanding of the situation in all aspects of China. Therefore, when representatives of various parties visit Marshall, he explains the importance of national interests outweighing party interests in China with extremely sincere words. Marshall seems to share the same feeling for the opinions in Chinese newspapers calling for the restoration of transportation and the reorganization and unification of the armed forces. Because Marshall's ultimate goal in promoting peace in China is to hope that China will become a unified, strong, solid, and orderly country. It is rumored that the Peiping Executive Headquarters held an important meeting today to discuss the peaceful takeover of Harbin, as the National Army vanguard arrived in the southeast suburbs of Harbin this morning and can enter Harbin immediately.

### Confiscation of 120,000 Pieces of Gauze - Merchants Still Heartbroken - Tang Shoumin Just Escapes Death - Sentenced to Life Imprisonment - Heard the Sentence, Repeatedly Proclaimed Disagreement, Female Servant Watched Him Being Escorted Back to Prison

[Our Newspaper Report] Tang Shoumin, a major financial traitor in Shanghai, held positions during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, disrupting finances with notorious crimes. The High Court has completed the final trial. Presiding Judge Xiao Xie Fen ascended the bench at 10 AM yesterday morning and brought Tang to the case. Tang wore a gray long gown, yellow pointed leather shoes, tortoiseshell glasses on his nose, and a shaved head with graying hair, appearing calm. Upon hearing the sentence being read out, "Tang Shoumin colluded with the enemy country, plotted to resist this country, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for life, all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members," his face turned pale, and he claimed he did not agree. Presiding Judge Xiao then stated that an appeal to the Supreme Court could be made within ten days. The defendant's lawyer was not present in court during the sentencing, nor were any family members listening. Only a female servant who visited the prison every day to deliver goods was there, watching her master being escorted into prison by the bailiffs. The full text of the judgment is recorded as follows: Prosecutor: Prosecutor of this court, Defendant: Tang Shoumin, male, 55 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 35 Enlihe Road, Chairman of the Puppet Jiaotong Bank. Appointed defenders: Lawyer Zhang Shijian, Lawyer Zuo De, Lawyer Yuan Xingyuan. The above defendant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for the case of a traitor. The judgment of this court is as follows: Main Text: Tang Shoumin colluded with the enemy country, plotted to resist this country, sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for life, all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members. Facts: Tang Shoumin had served in the banking industry for many years. On December 8, 1941, when the Pacific War broke out, he was the General Manager of the Jiaotong Bank, stationed in Hong Kong, presiding over the bank's affairs. Hong Kong fell on the 21st of the same month. He then returned to Shanghai in April 1942 and was instigated by Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and Japanese Embassy Financial Officer Ohara of the Puppet Nanjing government to prepare for the resumption of Jiaotong Bank, plotting to resist this country. He realized this on September 12 of the same year, taking the position of Chairman. In late February 1943, he responded to the invitation of Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Mei Sipin and others. He promoted the enemy's new economic policy and formed the National Commercial Control Association to replace the enemy's military control. It was established in Shanghai on March 15 of the same year. Mei Sipin, the Puppet Minister of Industry, announced the Puppet Executive Yuan's telegram and appointed Tang Shoumin as the Chairman of the Board. It was initially affiliated with the Puppet Ministry of Industry and later changed to be supervised by the Puppet Executive Yuan, serving as the general agency for the national control of materials. He relinquished his position on June 30, 1944. During his tenure, relying on the power of the enemy and puppet regimes, he forcibly collected more than 120,000 pieces of gauze from merchants. He also served concurrently as a Counselor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, a member of the Puppet National Economic Committee, a member of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, and a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Puppet Central Savings Association. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he was detained by the Third Aspect Investigation Office and sent to the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, and then transferred to this court. The prosecutor investigated and prosecuted.

[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Xibin, a clerk from the Wu Xing Station of the Puppet Special Service Headquarters, was sentenced yesterday. The main text: Wang Lubin, colluded with the enemy country, plotted to resist this country, sentenced to five years of imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for five years, all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members.

### Yuan Ludeng to be Sentenced Today

[Another Report] Yuan Ludeng's trial has been completed and will be sentenced at 9:00 AM today. Cultural traitors Liu Yusheng, Tan Zhongjiang, Liu Weijun, and Indian traitors Nana Kechang and Bao Pei will be sentenced at 2:00 PM today.

### Reasons

Regarding the fact that Defendant Tang Shoumin has held various puppet positions, he has confessed without denying it, and there are written confessions attached to the file, which can be verified, and there is no doubt about the facts. What should be investigated is whether he has committed the crime of colluding with the enemy country and plotting to resist this country during his tenure in the puppet positions. The Puppet National Government is a puppet organization supported by the enemy Japan, and it is a base camp for colluding with the enemy country. This is a well-known fact. Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai are also notorious major traitors. The defendant was instigated by them and contacted them. Under the affiliation of the puppet government, he prepared for the resumption of the Jiaotong Bank. Who can believe that he had no intention of colluding with the enemy country? Moreover, the Jiaotong Bank is a national financial institution. When Hong Kong fell, the head office moved west, and the branches in the occupied areas were automatically closed. This was the economic strategy of our government at the time to resist the war. As the general manager, how could the defendant pretend not to know? However, in the occupied area, under the guise of resuming business, he took the position of chairman himself, causing two Jiaotong Banks to appear at the same time. His disregard for the law is obvious, and his sabotage of the national policy of resistance is even more so. It is a clear excuse to say that he had no intention of plotting to resist this country. Although it is argued that at that time, it was due to environmental coercion and the difficulty in the lives of employees, and the preservation of the bank's assets, that it was an act of necessity. However, according to the defendant's own account, after returning to Shanghai, he was released and returned home, which means he had regained his freedom. Therefore, the so-called environmental coercion is not credible. Moreover, after taking the position of chairman, he stayed in it for several years without any suspicion. How can he use environmental coercion as an excuse? As for the so-called difficulty in the lives of employees, even if it is true, he should have planned for withdrawal work to provide relief. He must not use it as a pretext for resisting this country. The assets stored in Shanghai by the Jiaotong Bank are real estate. According to the defendant's confession on record, it is difficult for the enemy to move the real estate elsewhere. Therefore, his so-called preservation of the bank's assets, and citing Zhao Dihua's letter as supporting evidence, is also insufficient to adopt. Furthermore, according to the organization of the Puppet National Commercial Control Association, it was instructed by Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and Mei Sipin to promote the enemy's new economic policies and replace their military control in order to collect materials. As the defendant said, "Chen Gongbo and Zhou Fohai told me to establish it, saying that it was the new economic policy of the Japanese side. Before the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, all materials were directly controlled by the enemy army. At that time, the Japanese had a Seventh Outpost Office on the Bund, which was revoked only after the establishment of the Commercial Control Association." It is very clear that the Commercial Control Association was the incarnation of military control. After the enemy and the puppets failed in military control, they changed their faces and implemented the so-called new economic policy. As the defendant served as the chairman, he was obviously willing to go against the tide to implement the enemy's new economic strategy. How can he use it as a reason for pseudo-exemption from responsibility? Moreover, during his tenure, he was entrusted by the puppet government to forcibly collect more than 120,000 pieces of gauze, with conclusive evidence. Even now, the gauze merchants are still heartbroken. The sixth piece of evidence presented by the defendant can be used as supporting evidence. According to the provisions of Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, he relied on the power of the enemy and puppet regimes to commit acts that were beneficial to the enemy and puppet regimes and detrimental to the people, which is also beyond doubt. However, the defendant still insisted on the outline for purchasing gauze, which had been revised repeatedly, in order to obtain hundreds of thousands of taels of gold from the enemy, and that the gauze had not been taken away, as an excuse. It is unknown that the gauze was not taken away because the Allied forces were attacking very tightly and sea transportation was blocked. It is obvious that this is a defense that cannot be adopted. Furthermore, he claimed that he had assisted in the work of resisting Japan, citing the written statement of witness Liang as proof. Regardless of whether the witness failed to appear after being summoned by this court and was not a legal witness, whether what was said is true remains to be considered. Even if his written statement is indeed true, it was after 1945. At that time, the Axis powers of Germany and Italy had already been defeated, and Japan was on the verge of destruction. It was either speculation and opportunism or a shift of course with the wind. It should not be regarded as assistance in the work of resisting Japan. This claim is also difficult to be considered reasonable. However, his remaining puppet positions do not have any obvious crimes. His joint stock establishment of the China Silk Company, in which Jiaotong Bank contributed the most capital, although not without suspicion of manipulation, is not in line with the provisions of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, and it is not in the list of punishments in this regulation. It can be ignored. The defendant is in a leading position, and the circumstances of the crimes committed are not light.
