### Adjustment Work Can Enter Smooth Path; Resumption of Transportation Under Discussion; Conflicts in Jin-Cha-Sui-Ji Have Ceased

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Our Newspaper, 28th] The adjustment work for military conflicts by the Adjustment Department seems to be entering a smooth path and gradually entering the stage of consultation on the resumption of transportation. On the extremely complex diplomatic and internal affairs issue of Chifeng, the government made a major concession. A tripartite agreement was reached late last night, and the Fifth Communiqué was immediately released, denying that General Du Yuming had been ordered to occupy Chifeng. It also declared that the Executive Headquarters ordered the national and communist armies at all levels to comply with the ceasefire order, remaining at the locations before midnight on January 13, 1946, and ordered that no army of either side should enter Chifeng to take over the defense zone after the withdrawal of the Soviet army. This communiqué took effect from 7:00 AM on the 27th. An official familiar with the inside story pointed out to the reporter that this was a major concession by the government in its effort to seek peace. The reason is that China and the Soviet Union had agreed that in the Chinese area north of 28 degrees north latitude, after the Soviet army completed its surrender acceptance and withdrew, it would be defended by the National Government army. Therefore, it was justified for the National Army to go to take over the defense. In terms of ceasefire measures, the Soviet army only began to withdraw on the 23rd, and the Communist army had not occupied Chifeng before midnight on the 13th, so it was even more appropriate for the National Army to enter after the Soviet army withdrew. However, in order to achieve peace, the government made a major concession and agreed not to let the National Army enter. The Communist side explained that the Communist Party had already carried out underground activities in the area during the Anti-Japanese War and established local governments and troops after the victory. If the National Army obeyed the ceasefire order, it would not enter the city. Fortunately, the matter has been resolved because of the tripartite agreement that neither army will enter the city. However, whether the security team currently stationed in the city belongs to the neutral side or the Communist side and whether it can continue to stay will be a noteworthy issue. According to the reporter's information, the Executive Headquarters of the Adjustment Department has been actively discussing the issue of resuming transportation in the past two or three days, but the discussion does not seem to have made much progress. The transportation authorities told reporters today that all expenses, equipment, and labor related to the resumption of transportation have been fully prepared, waiting only for the consent of the Communist Party. This is somewhat like "everything is ready except for the east wind." They also told reporters that the personnel responsible for repairing roads in Anyang, Baotou, and other places had requested the Communist army to allow them to start repairing roads, but the Communist army refused on the grounds that it had not received orders. People from the Communist Party in the Executive Headquarters believe that the implementation of restoring transportation involves extremely complex issues such as equipment, personnel, and road protection, which require lengthy discussions, and specifically stated their desire for "railway neutralization." It is generally judged that to quickly restore transportation, not only the mediation of the US personnel is needed, but also the participation of the US technical personnel.

[United Press, Beiping, 28th] The military adjustment enforcement department sent teams to various places to implement the ceasefire order, which has come to an end. Today, it began to deal with the second issue of restoring transportation. The three committees and staff members are discussing the starting method day and night at the headquarters of Xiehe Hospital. The Communist Party advocates that the restoration of transportation should include all transportation such as railways, waterways, highways, and postal communications. The central government said that all transportation should be opened as soon as possible, but railway transportation is most needed, so it should be restored first. This kind of dispute occurred during the Chongqing negotiations last autumn and has not been resolved today. The Communist side also requested that once the transportation lines are restored, it should be guaranteed that they will not be used to assist in the war, which shows that the mutual suspicion has not been completely eliminated. The third thing that the adjustment enforcement department should deal with is the issue of disarming the Japanese army. Both sides agreed not to proceed for the time being. The 1,200 Japanese troops on the Jiaoji Railway are temporarily allowed to continue to carry firearms.

[United Press, Rehe, Chifeng Airport, 28th] US Navy flight personnel, carrying orders and supplies from the headquarters of the military adjustment enforcement, contacted the three-person supervisory group that had been stranded in Chifeng for ten days this afternoon. Two US transport planes they were driving, carrying Communist Commander Duan Suyuan (transliteration) from Chengde, the Communist headquarters in Rehe, flew to the airport here. Duan carried orders that the Communist army in the Chifeng area should allow the supervisory group or the Americans performing liaison work to pass freely without obstruction.

### Fengzhen Talks Reach Agreement on Equipment; Unarmed Soldiers Can Enter Each Other's Individual Territories

[United Press, Beiping, 28th] The military adjustment enforcement department issued a joint communiqué today, stating that according to the report from the enforcement team sent to Datong, the conflicts between the national and communist armies in northern Shanxi, southwestern Chahar, southeastern Suiyuan, and western Hebei have now completely stopped. Representatives of the enforcement team and the commanders of the two armies held talks in Fengzhen and have now reached an agreement, which includes the following six points:

(1) The troops of both sides withdrew to the locations where they were stationed before midnight on January 13, that is, before the ceasefire agreement took effect.

(2) Both sides issued notices and published statements in newspapers, stating that trade can be resumed between cities in the ceasefire zone, and it has already been restored in the Datong area.

[United Press, Beiping, 28th] The executive team of the Adjustment Department sent to Datong reported by wireless telegraph today that the team is holding talks with the national and communist generals in Fengzhen, and the situation is satisfactory.

### "China in the Sun" - New Book Published

[U.S. News Agency, New York, 27th] Literary critic Garnett described Randall's new book, "China in the Sun," in detail in the book review column of the New York Herald Tribune on the 24th. Garnett commented: "The author of 'China in the Sun,' Randall, has now returned to China to restore the publication of the Shanghai Great America Evening News, which was suspended in 1941 due to interference from the Japanese. Mr. Randall is a native of Minnesota, USA. Since going to China in the spring of 1924, he has spent most of his time in China. His writings on China have a consistent significance, which is lacking in the writings of others who claim to be familiar with the situation in China. He said that China has been in the process of revolution for the past 30 years, and the current dispute between the Chongqing government and the Communist Party is, in his personal view, just another chapter in a long history. He believes that the best way to understand China is to compare it with the United States in the 18th century, when the provinces of the United States were deeply divided and transportation facilities were still in their infancy. This book is the best work on the history of 20th century China. The intimate tone and rich materials in the book are particularly characteristic."

Security Council Chairman Makin proposed that the Iranian representative be allowed to participate in the Security Council meeting when discussing the Iranian complaint and asked the representatives if they objected to this suggestion. At that time, all representatives turned their attention to the chief Soviet representative, Vishinsky. Since no representatives raised objections, the Iranian representative, Taikizadeh, took a seat, only six feet away from Vishinsky. The Iranian representative stated that the Iranian government had sent several diplomatic notes to the Soviet government, requesting permission for Iranian troops to enter Azerbaijan, but the Soviet government had neither denied nor responded. The Iranian representative said that this dispute was regrettable because Iran was originally an ally of the Soviet Union, and Iran had contributed to the Soviet Union's victory. Finally, the former Iranian Prime Minister Hakimi's plan to go to Moscow was also rejected, so Iran had no choice but to file a complaint with the Security Council. The Iranian representative also pointed out that the Soviet Union interfered in Iran's internal affairs, violated the Tehran Agreement, and warned that if Iran could not freely deploy troops within its own country, there might be tragic consequences. Thereupon, the Iranian representative requested that the Soviet army withdraw from Iranian territory by March 2nd and requested the Security Council to pass this request.

[United Press, Iranian Capital, 28th] The new Iranian Prime Minister, Shadanah, announced today that he had instructed Shah Taai, the head of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, to discuss Iran's complaint against the Soviet Union with Vishinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation. Shah Taai was Prime Minister during the Tehran Conference and is a friend of Vishinsky, fluent in Russian.

[Reuters, London, 28th] News from Tehran last night reported that Iranian Prime Minister Shadanah had issued a new instruction to the Iranian delegation in London, but as of four hours before the United Nations Security Council meeting this afternoon, the Iranian delegation had not yet received this new instruction. Iran's complaint against Soviet interference in its internal affairs is on the agenda of the Security Council this afternoon.

### General Assembly Agenda Nearing Completion

[United Press, London, 28th] The United Nations Security Council held its second session today to discuss issues such as Soviet interference in Iran and the stationing of British troops in Greece and East India, which "threaten world peace." Albania's application for membership will also be discussed, and later the refugee issue will be discussed, which is related to the initial discussion of the financial problems of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In addition, the United Nations General Assembly received a memorandum of 10,000 words from New York, pointing out that the Argentine government is still a dictatorial regime, with aggressive intentions, and undermines all obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter, advocating for the exclusion of Argentina from the United Nations organization. Therefore, Argentina's application for membership may not be discussed at this session. The General Assembly agenda is nearing completion, and the outstanding issues that have not yet been discussed include the election of the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization and 15 judges of the International Court of Justice. Judging from the progress of the meeting, the small countries have fared better than expected. During this time, the Arab League and most Latin American countries led the struggle for the interests of small countries. Most small countries initially feared that the five great powers had already gained control in the Security Council and would also gain the same power in the General Assembly, so they tried their best to fight, unanimously insisting that the General Assembly vote must be decided by a majority vote to weaken the position of the great powers in the meeting. This move has already been achieved.

### Four Powers Begin Drafting Treaty with Italy - France, United States, and Austria Request Border Revisions - Soviet Union Seeks Trusteeship over Libya

[Reuters, London, 28th] The New York Times correspondent said that representatives of the foreign ministries of various countries are drafting the draft treaty with Italy. The British representative has proposed a plan to establish Italian colonial trusteeship, suggesting that Italy's colonies be temporarily handed over to the four powers drafting the treaty, namely Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, pending the completion of the entire United Nations organization's trusteeship plan. The representatives of the four powers are busy sorting out the many outstanding issues left over from the foreign ministers' meeting last autumn, so the British proposal cannot be considered for the time being. In addition, the Soviet Union insists on obtaining sole trusteeship over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. Soviet representative Gusev is waiting for instructions from Moscow, and there is no way to discuss this trusteeship issue until he receives them. In the past one or two weeks, Britain and the United States have had requests to obtain sole trusteeship over African colonies and Pacific islands. Therefore, the Soviet Union is unwilling to lag behind and intends to claim the same rights over Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its opinion on the Dodecanese Islands, which is a matter of great concern to all parties. It is said that the Soviet Union has also supported Yugoslavia's claim to the port of Trieste. In addition, there is the issue of reparations. Britain, the United States, and France believe that Italy should not and cannot afford to bear reparations. France's demands on Italy seem to have decreased compared to the foreign ministers' meeting last autumn. France still demands to acquire Brigas and Tenda on the Italian border, but no longer demands to acquire Val d'Aosta in northwestern Italy and the area near Lake Chad in southern Libya. The strongest advocate for acquiring Italian territory was De Gaulle, and De Gaulle's departure should ease France's attitude.

### Romanian and Bulgarian Issues - Britain and Soviet Union Reach Understanding

### Relationship Between Britain and Soviet Union - Presents Abnormal State - Security Concessions Made by Britain to the Soviet Union - Fails to Obtain Corresponding Compensation

[Reuters, London, 28th] The New York Times correspondent said: When the British Foreign Secretary sat next to the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs at an international conference, he actually said that he was tired of the accusations against the Soviet government, which shows that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union, or Britain's traditional foreign policy, has undergone some unexpected events. At the same time, British newspapers used terms such as "political deception," "untrustworthy behavior," and "malicious and boring actions" to describe Soviet propaganda and foreign policy, which can also indicate the abnormal state of the relationship between the two countries. The British have indeed become tired of it. They feel that the privileges demanded by the Soviet Union are those that the Soviet Union itself is unwilling to grant to others, and the security concessions given by Britain to the Soviet Union have failed to obtain corresponding compensation. Britain has not objected to the Soviet Union's demands on the Baltic states, Poland, Finland, East Prussia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, but when Britain advocates maintaining closer relations with Western European countries or implementing its security policies in Southern Europe or the Middle East, Moscow expresses firm opposition. The British feel that the situation they are facing is as follows: Britain, with a population of 45 million, is being asked by the Soviet Union, with a population of 200 million and the world's largest land army, to recognize the alliances it has made with neighboring governments as security measures, while Britain is not allowed to have other security arrangements besides relying on the United Nations mechanism. In this situation, there are four possible paths that Britain can take: (1) Trust the Soviet Union's goodwill and let it do as it pleases; (2) Restore the balance of power policy and not allow only one strong power to exist on the European continent; (3) Rely on the United Nations organization; (4) Improve the United Nations Charter, so that the powers either obey the constraints of United Nations law, or confront the combined forces of all countries, and also use the Western European regional agreement as a backup for the United Nations organization. In the current situation, no British government would dare to trust the Soviet Union's good intentions, and neither Britain nor the United Nations organization can easily take action against the aggression of a certain power. Because the British government fears the Soviet Union and is still unable to determine its constitution, it is most likely that British foreign policy will take the fourth path mentioned above. The true balance of power policy is for the united countries to take concerted action against belligerent countries. Representatives of various countries attending the General Assembly expect that the unstable international situation will hopefully stabilize somewhat after the peace treaty is signed, and the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union may improve.

### Former British Cabinet Member - Accuses Labor Government

[United Press, London, 27th] Former British Conservative Party cabinet member Macmillan today accused the Labor government, saying: Under the leadership of the Labor Party, the friendly relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has gradually decreased, and it is not as close to the United States as it used to be. It was previously claimed that after the Labor Party came to power, British-Soviet relations could be improved immediately, but today, the friendly relationship between us and our old allies is under serious threat.

### Viceroy Wavell Addresses Indian Parliament

[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] Viceroy Lord Wavell delivered the shortest Governor-General's address in history to the Indian Central Legislative Assembly today, saying that the British government is determined to establish an executive council composed of political leaders and organize a constitutional assembly as soon as possible. I cannot discuss the organization of these institutions in detail at this time, nor can I explain how to overcome the various difficulties, nor is it convenient to determine the date on which India will gain freedom. I can only assure you that these matters will be the first things the governments in London and New Delhi will do. The Viceroy added that some of you may wish to vote against the government's measures, and it is up to you to decide whether or not to do so. But I believe that legislation is in the interest of all the people of India, and it would be short-sighted to hinder or delay it.

### London Public Assembly - Demands India Be Granted Independence - And Sympathizes With Struggle for Liberation in East India and Vietnam - Marches to Government After Meeting to Petition

[Reuters, London, 28th] The Indian League held a demonstration against British policies in India and Indonesia at Trafalgar Square here yesterday, with over 2,000 participants. The police were stationed at various key points to maintain strict vigilance. The flags of the Congress Party were planted all around the Nelson Monument, and speakers spoke from the base of the monument. Member of Parliament from Manchester, Dr. Johnson, first gave a speech, saying that the people of London represented, this an opportunity to express profound sympathy for the independence movements in Java, Vietnam, and India. The venue was equipped with loudspeakers, and the colorful costumes of Indian women were a beautiful addition to the conference.

A banner with the slogan "Reap the Complete Victory" was hung on the pillar of the venue. Member of Parliament for Wales, Mr. Goff's speech warned the government to prepare to deal with the backlash from the firing in Bombay. His speech said that although the Labor government was supported by me, if it continues to implement imperialist policies, it will have to use imperialist methods. I really don't want to see the Labor government go down this path. By this time, the mood at the venue had gradually become tense. Mr. Goff then said, "You should support this mission. Please protect the freedom of the people of the East." Indian Communist candidate Dutt also said, "We are meeting here not only for the interests of the people of India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, but also for your interests. We cannot allow our personnel to participate in actions that interfere with the freedom struggle of other nations." The conference passed two resolutions, namely, demanding independence for India and demanding that the British government recognize the independence of Indonesia. After the meeting, the crowd marched, following Government Buildings to the Foreign Office and the Indian Affairs Office to submit the resolutions, with mounted police leading the way, followed by Indian students holding the Congress Party flag high. Indian League Secretary Menon and British Members of Parliament Goff and Hutchinson. There were young girls, old women, veterans of both World Wars, British officers and soldiers, Dutch sailors, American pilots, and three Indian soldiers in the marching column. As the clock at Whitehall struck four, the procession set off. While the leaders entered the Foreign Office and the Indian Affairs Office, the others stood in front of Government Buildings, shouting slogans and jeering. The procession then returned to Trafalgar Square. Chairman Hutchinson told the crowd: "We have complied with the order to submit the resolutions to the Foreign Office and the Indian Affairs Office. A Foreign Office staff member left a message saying that Foreign Secretary Bevin had been invited out, but would read the resolutions within an hour and consider them. There was no one in charge at the Indian Affairs Office. India is in deep water, but the place that handles Indian affairs, except for one person who has nothing to do with the Indian Affairs Office, no one else. We have to leave the resolution to that person to immediately forward to the Indian Affairs Minister. Both resolutions will be considered and answered, and the reply will be published in the newspaper or announced at a public gathering here again. Now that we have submitted the resolutions, the meeting that is being held will be talked about by the people in India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and they will know that the British people are supporting their struggle for freedom." The crowd then donated 2,000 rupees to fund the Indian League to show their practical sympathy for Indian goals. The procession was a quarter of a mile long. When passing the monument, the Indian national flags held were all slanted to pay tribute to those who died in the two World Wars, and the spectators along the way were numerous.

### Japanese Female Lawyer - Advocates Revising Civil Code

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] One of Japan's eleven female lawyers, Miss Watanabe Michiko, gave a radio speech last night, pointing out that the Japanese Civil Code, enacted in 1897, "is full of feudal ideas." She declared that the Civil Code must be revised so that couples can enjoy equal rights. She said that Japanese women are listed as quasi-incapable persons, and all important actions must be approved by their husbands. Only if the wife has no children can she inherit her husband's property. She also said that Japan's marriage law favors men and is unfavorable to women. She advocated the appointment of a committee to revise the Japanese Civil Code and allow women to participate in the committee.

### Testing the Atomic Bomb: Records and Inferences

[United Press Washington, 27th] United States Army and Navy experts are preparing to use a fleet as the target to test the power of the atomic bomb. To date, only three atomic bombs have been used. The first was tested in New Mexico for the first time, and the other two were used to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Based on these three experiences, experts have gathered information from all parties and obtained the following records or inferences: (1) At the instant of the bomb's explosion, the initial pressure reached hundreds of thousands of pounds per square inch, followed by winds with speeds of 500 to 1,000 miles per hour. Although brief, the force was extremely strong, as speeds exceeding 75 miles per hour are commonly referred to as gale-force winds. (2) When tested on the sea surface, it will generate waves ranging from low to 100 feet high. (3) At the center of the so-called "fireball," the temperature can reach 100 million degrees Fahrenheit. As the heat wave spreads outward from the center, the heat will decrease sharply, but it will still possess immense destructive power. According to reports from American scientists, people within a mile of the bomb's detonation point, even if not killed by "mechanical force," will be burned to death or severely injured. A large amount of radiation is also emitted during the bomb's explosion. This type of radiation, like a bell, reached Hiroshima and Nagasaki with enough power to affect blood cells even if the skin appeared unharmed, causing blood to seep out and flow into internal cavities. American military officers and scientists believe that this radiation did not have much residual power in the two attacks on Japan because the bombs were detonated in the air, and the radiation dissipated very quickly, not lingering on the ground. However, some scientists speculate that if the bomb were detonated closer to the ground, as planned for this test, it could leave behind a large amount of radioactive material equivalent to several tons of radium. Due to this threat, nearby islands in the test area may be affected by radioactive waves or cloud fragments. Therefore, as a precaution, islanders must be evacuated to prevent accidents. Some house walls in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, although directly bombed, remained standing because the pressure was directed downwards, but roofs and floors were shattered. Regarding the impact on steel-framed buildings, some clues were obtained in Nagasaki, where the Mitsubishi torpedo factory was completely disintegrated due to the pressure. During this test, responsible personnel refused to disclose how the fleet would be arranged, only stating that some battleships would be placed at the center of the bomb's detonation point and spread over a large area, loaded with automatic recording instruments to study various degrees of damage.

### President Gouin Urges National Assistance to the Government in Overcoming Difficulties; Finance and Food are the Two Major Current Problems; French Foreign Policy Remains Consistent

[This Newspaper Report] According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 28th, French President Gouin issued a message today: "All French people should fully assist the newly formed French cabinet to overcome the current difficulties."

[This Newspaper Report] According to a Paris broadcast on the 28th, French President Gouin declared to the press today, "In order to improve the domestic economic and financial situation, the French government is determined to take extremely strict measures to awaken the people, but all decisions will be made in accordance with democratic principles. The current responsibility is extremely heavy. I assumed the position of president not out of personal desire, but out of a sense of responsibility. I deeply hope that this sense of responsibility will inspire all French people."

[This Newspaper Report] According to a Paris broadcast on the 28th, the newly appointed French President Gouin declared during today's French cabinet meeting: "There will be no change in French foreign policy. This policy has already been announced by the French Foreign Minister at the United Nations General Assembly. The new government is currently facing two problems, one is supply, and the other is finance. I am confident that the French people will be able to accept these problems with the same perseverance they have shown during other difficult periods."

### The World Watches: The Direction of the U.S. Congress

[Reuters Washington, 28th] The people of the United States and the world will closely watch the U.S. Congress's handling of the U.S. loan to Britain for the following reasons: (1) The strength demonstrated by the opposition will have a significant impact on the U.S. government's procedure for lending to foreign countries this year. This procedure is currently awaiting approval of credit to Britain to determine its future. (2) The course of action that the U.S. Congress will take in handling affairs can be seen from this debate. (3) This will demonstrate whether the U.S. Congress's dissatisfaction with President Truman's domestic agenda will extend to Congress's attitude toward the president's foreign relations and international cooperation policies. (4) This will show whether the United States is rapidly moving into a new isolationism. The loan to Britain may encounter more dangerous and significant opposition in both the House and Senate, but the U.S. government anticipated this and has prepared measures to deal with it.

### Burma's Demand for Autonomy Attracts U.S. Attention

### The U.S. Labor Strike Situation Improves; Cannery Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; The Steel Industry Also Shows Signs of Early Resolution

[United Press Chicago, 27th] Meatpacking workers belonging to the two major U.S. labor unions went on strike to demand increased wages. The government took over the canneries on Saturday and Sunday. It is now heard that 248,000 workers will resume work on Monday, and deliveries can begin on Wednesday. The government also expressed optimism about other labor strikes today.

[United Press Washington, 28th] A senior government official predicted on Sunday evening that the steel industry strike could end within a week. It is said that this news came from sources close to those in charge of the government's labor policy, but it cannot be fully verified. The strength of those hoping for an early resolution of the steel industry strike, which has lasted for a week, has greatly increased since the resolution of the Ford and Chrysler auto strikes. It may gain an advantage within a week, and there may be other pressures that can lead to victory. Although the White House does not intend to intervene in the next three or four days, there are many changes and uncertainties. The general strike in the steel industry began at midnight on January 20th, involving 800,000 workers in 1,292 factories in 30 states, making it the largest strike in the history of the U.S. steel industry. Although President Truman made every effort to mediate and try to get the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the U.S. Steel Corporation to reach a compromise, it ultimately failed. Only Kaiser, the president of the West Coast steel plant, accepted the president's proposal and agreed to increase wages by 18.5 cents per hour. The steelworkers' union initially demanded an increase of 23 cents per hour, but the employers only agreed to an increase of 12.5 cents. After repeated negotiations, the union agreed to reduce the demand to 19.5 cents per hour, but the employers would only increase by 14 cents at most. The negotiations broke down on January 19th, and a general strike was implemented from midnight on the 20th.

### Regarding the Request to Amend the Treaty, Britain Replies to Egypt

[Reuters London, 28th] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that Britain has delivered a reply to the Egyptian ambassador regarding the Egyptian letter of December 20, 1945, concerning the amendment of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. The reply expresses sympathy for the letter and is preparing to announce the letters of both sides simultaneously with the Egyptian government. Well-informed sources believe that the issue of the date and method of amending the treaty will be jointly reviewed by both parties. It is heard that Egypt is eager to modify the status of Sudan and have British troops withdraw from Egyptian territory. The Anglo-Egyptian treaty, drafted in 1936, only allows British troops to be stationed in the canal zone outside of wartime, so the withdrawal of British troops from most parts of Egypt can be discussed separately from the main conditions issue.

[United Press Cairo, 28th] Three Egyptian cabinet members resigned yesterday in anger because the government did not submit the issue of Egyptian independence and the withdrawal of British troops to the United Nations General Assembly. Their resignations have now been withdrawn, and the Egyptian political crisis has subsided.

### The United States Creates a New Type of Bomber: Unparalleled in Speed and Power

[United Press Washington, 28th] The Navy announced today a powerful new dive torpedo bomber that will be carried on the Midway-class super aircraft carrier. It has a maximum range of over 1,700 miles and can dive vertically at a speed of over 500 miles per hour, using a 4,000-pound bomb or rocket or torpedo and a 2,000-pound bomb rocket to attack targets. This new bomber is called the BTM Moller and was designed and manufactured by the Martin Company of Baltimore, specifically for new giant aircraft carriers. The flat flight speed exceeds 350 miles per hour. When not carrying bombs, it weighs 17,500 pounds, which is 1,000 pounds more than the current similar aircraft. This aircraft is equipped with a special brake that can reduce the maximum vertical dive speed of over 500 miles per hour to within 350 miles per hour, so the bombing is more accurate. Its wing-mounted dive brake can be released in five seconds at extremely high speeds. The aircraft is equipped with the world's largest aircraft engine, with 3,000 horsepower. Its Curtis four-blade electric propeller is 14 feet 8 inches in diameter. The aircraft is 50 feet wide, 41 feet 8 inches long, and the wings are box-shaped, with the outer wing sections folded vertically for easy carrier deployment. The aircraft is equipped with four 28mm guns, and the bombs, rockets, and torpedoes it carries are suspended outside.

These words came from the intercom wireless telephone as I was flying a C-60 Star aircraft in a curved line reconnaissance over the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level in the interior of New Guinea. The sky was full of holes. The person who told me this was my training pilot, Sergeant Griml.

A week ago, he discovered the hidden valley of New Guinea when he flew around, searching for a relatively low mountain path in the steep mountains of the Orange Mountains. The existence of this hidden valley was not revealed to the world until 1938 by the Archbold Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History. This is only the second time that white people have come to this mile-high, walled-off deep valley. Later, we learned that the Archbold Expedition renamed it the Grand Valley.

### Searching for a Landing Field, Soldiers Become Explorers

This time the explorers were not American and Dutch scientists, but American soldiers.

Our brothers came here to find aircraft landing sites that could be used against the Japanese army. When General MacArthur began to implement the island-hopping strategy in New Guinea, the only air route we could supply to him was to fly over the 1,500-mile-long Stanley Mountains at the southeastern end of the island. After the capture of Dutch New Guinea, the route was much shorter and could closely follow General MacArthur's vanguard troops.

Lieutenant General Kenney (now General), Commander of the Allied Southwest Pacific Air Force, ordered his subordinates to open a route from the Muroc Air Force Base to Dutch New Guinea, and at least find an intermediate direct route and landing sites at both ends, so that they could be put into practical use immediately after the base was built. Sergeant Griml was sent there to reconnoiter and found two possible routes. He paid close attention to the Grand Valley, believing that it had great potential as a landing site. The first route discovered was about 200 miles southwest of the Grand Valley, passing through Ifitamin. So we set off to inspect.

### Savages Form a Nation in Cliffs and Walls

The Grand Valley is a mile high above sea level, lying in the Baliem Valley in the mountains discovered by Archbold. In the middle of these cliffs and walls, there live strange tribes that do not communicate with the outside world: many of them die of old age without interacting with each other. The southern entrance of the Grand Valley is locked by 200 miles of wetlands and simple gorges. The east and west sides are towering peaks up to 14,000 feet high, which are like its national walls; the only possible entrance is on the north side. The crew of the twin-engine Star aircraft took off from Muroc at dawn, and we flew into the cloud layer at an altitude of 500 feet. The top of the clouds was still as high as 8,000 feet in the sky.

### Heads Are Cut Off or Used as Crocodile Snacks

In the middle section between Muroc and the foot of the Orange Mountains, we flew over 200 miles of wetlands. This wetland is as flat as a billiard table when viewed from below. The tribes living here are a nation dedicated to taking heads. These savages are as terrifying as the eels that flood the area. From here, we can easily see why the Dutch Tanamu La exile colony is the most effectively managed in the world. The only way for prisoners to escape is to go down the river. If he escapes into the wetlands, he can choose to have his head cut off or be used as a snack for crocodiles.

As we approached the Orange Mountains, the cloud layer became even higher! But we caught a glimpse of a particularly steep cliff. A rare cumulus cloud rose over the Grand Valley, and we could see an occasional gap. We knew that many peaks were lurking inside, with the higher peaks protruding above the cloud layer.

### The Author of This Article and His Captured Monkey

The person holding the monkey in the picture is Colonel Elsmore, the author of this article. This monkey has been brought back to the United States by Elsmore and given to his daughter. He has flown over the Grand Valley many times. In May of last year, after a U.S. military transport plane crashed in the Grand Valley, he enthusiastically engaged in rescue work and made great contributions.

### Flying Over the Orange Mountains, High into the Clouds, Over the Grand Valley

We needed to fly over the Orange Mountains and find a way out on the north side of the valley. Our plane climbed to 17,000 feet before we could safely fly through or around the cloud peaks. We saw Mount Wilhelm, which is over 15,000 feet high. It's strange, the snow-capped mountains on this side!

We circled for thirty minutes before starting to descend. The mountains here are lined up and the peaks range in height from 13,000 feet to 6,000 feet, clearly extending along the north coast of New Guinea. In the middle of each mountain range, there is a river channel flowing through the wetlands. Suddenly, Sergeant Griml pointed to a cloud pile 300 feet high on top of a ridge and shouted into the microphone: "Quickly slide over that ridge!" So we slid over the ridge and entered a canyon, and then we repeated flying under the cloud layer and took a breath. The lower our plane flew, the narrower the canyon became. The surrounding walls also became steeper. At this time, we circled around, and a straight cliff stood opposite us, and my breathing suddenly tightened. But Griml spoke again: "There is a gap between the cliff and the cloud pile. Let's continue to fly in the middle. The valley is below this!"

### Natural Great Cave - The Slok River Flows

As we flew over the cliffs, we observed a natural great cave, which could also be called a natural tunnel. Its rounded arch was at least three hundred feet high. The Slok River, below our plane, suddenly plunged into the steep walls of the deep gorge.

On the other side of the ridge, we saw native villages scattered in the valleys, stretching almost to the cloud-piercing cliffs. In this valley, about a mile away, the flowing water of the Slok River emerged from another mountain, continuing its winding course. In the clouds, a line of gap suddenly opened, and this picturesque great valley was revealed before our eyes at this moment.

### The Entire Great Valley Is a Fertile Land

Lying among these mountains is that peculiar cluster of villages. We got an overall bird's-eye view: the Great Valley stretches thirty miles in length, with a large river called the Baling River flowing through it. The Baling River originates from a stream gorge in the north, turning into rapids and waterfalls as it flows into the valley, where its momentum slows down. After leaving the valley, it enters another stream gorge surrounded by steep cliffs, hanging upside down and becoming turbulent rapids all the way to the sea. The entire valley floor, even the surrounding cliffs, are fertile, quite different from other parts of New Guinea.

The farmland is intertwined with ditches, and crops grow everywhere. Men, women, and children are all diligently cultivating the land, which is different from other tropical regions. The sudden appearance of our plane naturally frightened these people. As the plane descended rapidly, they scattered and ran in all directions, some hiding in the sweet potato fields, others jumping into the ditches.

One thing that was particularly surprising was that the ditches and villages in the Great Valley were arranged in neat squares, no less impressive than American farmland. They cultivated their fields up to the cloud-piercing cliffs, which American farmers would never dare to climb so high! The natives' houses were all built at the foot of the mountains, some choosing to hide discreetly among the trees.

### Natives Threw Spears in an Attempt to Attack Reconnaissance Plane

Each village was built with wooden and stone fences, and observation towers stood everywhere. We flew very low to take a closer look. These towers were pieced together with wood, and there was a sentry on the top of the tower, standing guard. Our plane obviously disrupted their observation system. The "sentry" desperately climbed down and slipped into the thatched hut like a shooting star. As we flew low again, a native even threw his spear upwards, trying to strike our fuselage.

Villages were built along both sides of the river. This river was undoubtedly a natural defensive line for the warring tribes. We couldn't see any beams or boats. But the natives certainly knew how to build bridges. Later, when flying close to the walls of this deep valley, we finally discovered a suspension bridge.

This reconnaissance flight gave us very little understanding of the local natives, only some indications from the photographs. We felt that the natives here were taller than the people we had encountered in other parts of New Guinea. Later, during a combat operation, the situation of the 60,000 residents in the Great Valley became clearer. This time, we only saw from the air that their houses were round, built almost like Eskimo snow houses, some long and round. They were mostly built close to trees.

### Having Obtained Information, We Flew to Ifitamin

After obtaining many photos and observation data here, we flew to Ifitamin to find a second possible landing site. In terms of distance, climate, and navigation, Ifitamin was more suitable than the Great Valley. So, we decided to use Ifitamin. At the same time, based on the results of a survey conducted by a certain explorer from Xizhou several years ago, we believed that the natives there were very friendly. We not only wanted to avoid unfortunate bloodshed but also to hire natives for construction work. From our Dutch or Australian friends, we couldn't get any records of white people ever having been to the Great Valley. From that time on, I communicated with Archibald, comparing the information from the photos we had taken.

All new pilots underwent standard training on the spot to adapt to the climate and environment of New Guinea. The environment was as threatening as the Japanese devils, so the pilots constantly flew over the Great Valley to practice. War correspondents thus obtained many interesting adventure stories. I once flew George Thorp and Harley-Davidson over the Great Valley to see it, and they nicknamed the Great Valley "Shangri-La Valley."

As a result of repeated flights, quite a few pilots had been there, enough to form a visiting organization. Many veterans became members of the "Shangri-La" Association after returning home, and they all had certificates with flight dates.

### American Plane Crashed, Women's Army Corps Suffered Tragedy

During a training flight, a tragedy occurred over the Great Valley. This happened in May. A military transport plane crashed into the wall of the Great Valley, and the entire fuselage was burned. Out of twenty-four people, only five survived. Among them, three were members of the Women's Army Corps serving at the Hollandia base. Within twenty-four hours, two more of them died. The one surviving woman and two men subsequently told the world many strange and bizarre stories from the Great Valley.

The author himself was in charge of the rescue operation this time. Unexpectedly, many mysterious local situations were answered.

### Three Soldiers Escaped Danger, Good News Spread Throughout America

Seven weeks after the crash, the three surviving soldiers were finally rescued. We parachuted medical personnel and engineers into the Great Valley to provide relief and build a runway so that low-flying transport planes could land safely. When the weather was good, we dropped all kinds of food supplies. A communication team with two-way radios also went down. We even broadcast the news for our compatriots left in this paradise to hear.

What a happy event! When the three surviving comrades, male and female, were rescued back to the Hollandia base. The surviving female comrade, named Margaret Hastings, was a corporal in the Women's Army Corps. The story she told was published in newspapers and magazines throughout America.

### Pigs Are Fat and Large, Only Cooked During Celebrations

Pigs were very valuable. Killing or eating a pig was often only done during celebrations. So, some pigs grew very fat and large before being slaughtered during festivals! The round roofs were covered with soot. The terrain of the Great Valley was very high, and fires were often needed, but there were no chimneys on the houses. Smoke came out of the gaps in the walls or the thick thatch of the roof. Men had nothing else except a piece of cloth covering their lower body. Women only had a handful of fig leaves woven into a diaper-like thing, tied to the front and back of their fat thighs, with everything else exposed. Their chests were bare.

Each village had a neat layout. Banana trees were everywhere, and the fields were full of sweet potatoes. Men mostly lived in stone-built round houses, while women lived in rectangular houses.

### Discussion of the Method of Paying Property Rental Income Tax

— Tao Gongwen

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau was established and will levy property rental income tax in the city. This tax system is still in its initial stages and is being trialed, and it is inevitable that the tax law may have shortcomings. I hereby offer my opinions on the method of paying this tax.

Consider this:

Paying Income Tax

In principle, the self-assessment method should be adopted. However, for the sake of economy and convenience, it may be advisable to adopt the withholding method. However, those who withhold taxes have no obligation to withhold taxes, so the state should provide appropriate incentives to those who withhold income tax. For example, when the deposit interest income tax was first implemented, the government provided financial institutions with a commission for withholding interest income tax, and this was the reason for it. Adopting the withholding method requires two conditions: first, the number of taxpayers (income recipients) must be far greater than the number of withholding agents (income payers), even by tens of millions of times. If the withholding method is adopted, the collection and tax payment costs can be greatly reduced. Second, the withholding agent must be able to calculate the amount of tax to be withheld independently based on the tax law. For example, deposit

Interest Income Tax

is a fixed-rate tax on the total amount, and financial institutions can calculate the amount of income tax to be withheld based on the tax rate stipulated in Article 6 of the Income Tax Law and the amount of interest receivable by each depositor, without waiting for notification from the collection agency before withholding.

Let us examine whether the current property rental income tax, excluding agricultural land, has the above conditions for adopting the withholding method. The answer is no. First, the number of taxpayers for property rental income tax (landlords) is far less than the number of withholding agents (tenants), which is the opposite of the situation where the number of taxpayers for deposit income tax (deposit customers) is far greater than the number of withholding agents (financial institutions). Assuming that there are 10,000 landlords (including legal entities) and 100,000 tenants in the city, if the withholding method is adopted, the collection agency must review 100,000 income reports and distribute 100,000 tax payment notices. At the same time, 100,000 people must report their income on behalf of the collection agency, and 100,000 people must pay taxes to the national treasury or its agents. Sometimes, the withholding agent has to spend more than 200 yuan on transportation expenses to pay a tax of 200 yuan, and the time spent is worth several times more than 200 yuan. In this situation, the property rental income tax borne by the people seems to be small on the surface, but in fact, the tax payment costs exceed the tax amount by several times. If the self-assessment method is adopted, the number of taxpayers in the previous example is only one-tenth of the number of withholding agents, so the manpower and resources spent on property rental income tax by the people, the collection agency, and the collection agency can be reduced by nine-tenths, accounting for only one-tenth of that under the withholding method. Comparing the two, is self-assessment more economical and convenient, or is withholding more economical and convenient? Anyone with a little common sense will not find it difficult to judge.

Second, Property

Rental Income Tax

Due to the progressive tax rates and the fact that the income from renting two or more properties owned by one person should be calculated together, the withholding agent cannot independently determine the amount of tax to be withheld and must wait for notification from the collection agency to confirm. This is completely different from deposit interest income tax. Although the monthly rent payable by a particular tenant is the same, the amount of income tax to be withheld often varies greatly due to changes in the total amount of rent receivable by the landlord. Here is an example to illustrate: Suppose a landlord has five houses in January, rented to four people: A, B, C, and D, at a rent of 6,000 yuan per house per month. According to Articles 3 and 6 of the Property Rental and Sale Income Tax Law and Rule 12 of the Implementing Rules, the property rental income tax payable is 1,620 yuan, and each tenant withholds 405 yuan of income tax. Suppose in early February, the landlord bought two more houses for rent, receiving 6,000 yuan of rent per house per month. According to the law, the landlord should pay 2,770 yuan of rental income per month, and the rent payable by A, B, C, and D has not changed, but the amount of income tax to be withheld in February increased from 405 yuan to 461 yuan, six dimes, six cents, six mills, six filaments. In this situation where the tax amount cannot be determined independently by the tenant, the tenant must receive notification from the collection agency before withholding income tax and paying rent.

Furthermore, if the withholding method is adopted for property rental income tax excluding agricultural land, and the withholding agent reports the income (rent) of the taxpayer, the competent collection agency must spend considerable effort to combine and calculate the income belonging to the same taxpayer without any omissions. In the absence of a unified naming system and incomplete statistics of people's property today, it is indeed difficult to comprehensively calculate the income of taxpayers based on reports from withholding agents scattered in various places. Suppose someone lives in Shanghai and has houses for rent in Shanghai, as well as in Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Qingdao. If the self-assessment method is adopted, the landlord can report and pay the tax in person, without the troublesome procedures of comprehensive calculation, and the consolidated property rental income of the taxpayer can be obtained. If the withholding method is adopted and the income is reported by each tenant, assuming that each tenant is a highly educated intellectual who accurately reports the true landlord's name and address without any errors, then the Chongqing Direct Tax Bureau, the Hankou Direct Tax Bureau, the Guangzhou Direct Tax Bureau, and the Qingdao Direct Tax Bureau must receive the income reported by the tenants of the houses rented by the landlord and then forward it to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau to comprehensively calculate the landlord's property rental income in accordance with the law. The cumbersome nature of the procedure can be seen. The method of collecting taxes should be simple, convenient, and economical, which is an important principle in public finance. The fact that most of the current property rental income tax is collected through the withholding method seems to run counter to this important principle.

From this point of view, if we do not want the property rental income tax to become a truly good tax, then the payment method should completely adopt the self-assessment method, and we must not follow the example of the deposit interest income tax and adopt the withholding method, because the objective conditions are completely different.

### Women's Army Corps Corporal Hastings Who Survived the Crash

There were eight members of the Women's Army Corps on the American military transport plane that crashed and burned in the Great Valley. Five of them died on the spot; two more died within 24 hours. Hastings was the luckiest of the eight. In the picture, Ms. Hastings looks worried and looks up at the sky, hoping that planes from her homeland would come and rescue her soon. Behind her are the Filipino members of the rescue team who temporarily built it.

### Reading Minister Yu's Talk on Financial Plans

Finance Minister Yu Hongjun recently came to Shanghai for inspection and gave a speech to our reporter, saying that the government has carefully studied the issue of new exchange rates and will formulate appropriate measures under the principle of revitalizing and developing international trade, which will be announced soon; this year's financial plan will focus on construction, with post-war rehabilitation as the center, but this year's financial expenditures, such as military reorganization, will also be quite large. It has now been decided to find ways to rectify tax revenues, and at the same time, it is planned to utilize foreign materials and strive for the stability of the monetary system and prices so that the budget approaches balance; regarding provincial and municipal local finance issues, it is necessary to first seek the prosperity of local finance, and the central government has decided to increase the amount of subsidies to local finance, and at the same time, it plans to re-divide the series of central and local finance to clarify their respective areas. In addition, it also elaborated on simplifying direct tax procedures and related issues such as the United Nations International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The above words, although only a conversation with a news reporter, are simple and concise, and have somewhat clarified the country's financial policy. The people in the recovered areas have been separated from the central government's administration for a long time, and at the beginning of the restoration of the rivers and mountains, the steps taken by all parties may not be well-organized. Regarding various issues related to their own interests, such as the value of currency, the re-establishment of exchange rates, the burden of taxation, and the use of received materials, they have long hoped that the central government's responsible heads will make an announcement. Reading Minister Yu's speech to the reporters has somewhat made them understand the central government's financial administration plan, which is of some benefit to the people's understanding of the government's administration.

Financial and monetary problems are the crux of all problems. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the most serious problems, in addition to political problems, have actually been financial and economic problems. Although the recent strikes in the recovered areas have complex causes, they are mainly financial and economic problems. The serious threats felt by the people in the recovered areas today are mostly that there are no concrete measures in the financial and economic aspects, or that although there are measures planned, there is no courage to implement them immediately. The increase in the cost of living and the soaring prices are mainly due to the failure to stabilize the currency value. Because the currency value has not been stabilized, it has affected the turbulence of general life. The repeated occurrence of strikes is mainly because the currency income of workers' wages is not enough to cover their living expenses. — In essence, this is still a problem of the failure to stabilize the currency value. If the value of currency — currency — cannot be stabilized, then all social and economic problems can be related to financial problems. If we do not first seek the rehabilitation and restoration of the currency itself, then all rehabilitation and restoration may not be possible. This situation is common in all countries after the war. Not only is this the case in today's China. France, Germany, Australia, and Italy after World War I were all like this; even in the countries after World War II, the situation is the same. China has resisted the longest and suffered the heaviest financial trauma. At the time of post-war rehabilitation, the first thing that needs to be rehabilitated and restored is finance, and the first thing that should be rehabilitated in finance is the currency issued by the state, and how to stabilize the value of the currency. It is necessary to stabilize the value of the currency so that social unrest can be reduced and move towards a normal path. The hope of seeking society is also the most necessary thing for today's financial policy to be implemented resolutely by people with vision and魄力. Minister Yu is most familiar with the situation in Shanghai, an international financial city. After this careful inspection, I dare to believe that there will be brilliant methods. But the method must not only have "law," but also must be "handled," so that the method is valuable.

Secondly, another threat felt by the people in the recovered areas is the complexity of the tax system and the increase in the tax burden. And the biggest chaos is the failure to clarify the central and local financial systems. Local authorities believe that the central government monopolizes all tax sources, causing local finances to be on the verge of bankruptcy, so they have to seek their own ways to remedy it, so apportionments and harsh taxes are repeatedly issued, and the people and the government are suffering. As for taxes within the central system, the tax rates have been increased recently, so that the people in the recovered areas, after eight years of war, cannot bear the burden, and complaints are heard from time to time. The people in the recovered areas have been hoping for governance for eight years. Now that the rivers and mountains are restored and the people are renewed, they hope that there will be reasonable standards for the financial apportionment and tax burden to avoid disturbing the people.

From the standpoint of the country, the main financial problems placed in front are the few points that the people in the recovered areas hope to achieve. However, in addition to this, some belong to organizational problems of finance, and some belong to policy problems. In terms of organizational problems, there are places in the organization of the Ministry of Finance that need to be effectively adjusted. For example, the establishment of the Direct Tax Department seems to be a superfluous matter. Since direct tax is one of the national tax revenues, it should be merged with the Taxation Department into one to save work. Furthermore, since the current financial problem is a currency problem, and the management of financial affairs is becoming increasingly complex, which is one of the main businesses of the Ministry of Finance, but at present, there is only a Currency Division under the Ministry, and there is no independent unit, such as the National Treasury Department, the Taxation Department, and the Customs Department, to be responsible for handling it, which seems insufficient to be competent. It is already urgently necessary for the Ministry of Finance to set up a special agency to manage currency and finance in the future.

Regarding the policy issues of finance, there are the re-division of central and local finance, the conversion of land tax and the issue of the existence of the Grain Department, and issues such as salt administration and tariffs. It is said that the reason why local finances are not possible is that most of the tax sources are occupied by the central government. In Shanghai alone, it is said that the main tax revenue is still the entertainment feast tax, which is almost the only tax that supports the municipality. Even docks and warehouses are not allowed to be interfered with by the municipal government, let alone others? If this statement is not false, there is a very big problem here. The entertainment feast tax is taken from the general public, so why is it that the large factories and large firms in Shanghai benefit more from the municipality, but their burden on the municipality is so light? When re-determining the financial system of the central government and the local governments, it is imperative not to ignore the principle of "tax-paying ability" on taxes, and to ensure that the burden of taxes can be equally borne by the general taxpayers according to their tax-paying ability.

Regarding salt administration, it is a matter of course that the system of lead bank package traders must be abolished. However, it is said that the methods are not uniform. Old merchants in Changlu and Lianghuai still have special privileges similar to the disguised lead bank system, while Liangzhe has separately recruited new merchants to contract, and I do not know why. In terms of contribution to the country, the old merchants in various places are somewhat similar to each other, but in reality, the treatment they receive is very different. The state changes the salt law, and there was a power weighing in the original, but the change must be thorough, and a system should be clearly stipulated, or the tax should be levied on the spot, regardless of what is known, or the tax levy system should not be adopted, and the people should be allowed to buy and sell freely. As it is now, on the surface, the lead bank is abolished, but in reality, there is still a similar lead bank system in existence, which not only violates the national law, but also destroys the entire salt administration scale and affects the national economy and the people's livelihood, which is of no light importance.

All of the above are our feelings after reading Minister Yu's speech. We are willing to give them to the financial authorities, and it is nothing more than the meaning of the wild man offering the sun.

### Proclamation of Issuance of "Sun Notes" Causes Uproar in the Market; Minister Yu Denies the Allegation, Saying Speculation Fuels New Exchange Rate Announcement; Application Required to Use Frozen U.S. Dollars

(Report from our newspaper) Yesterday, rumors abounded in the city that the government would issue "Sun Notes." This was further fueled by news reports detailing the types, designs, patterns, exchange rates with foreign currencies, and issuance dates of the "Sun Notes," causing significant unease in the market.

Neither Rumor Has Any Basis

A reporter specifically visited Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, who solemnly denied the matter to the reporter, stating, "I have no knowledge of this matter." The reporter further inquired about the rumored announcement of the exchange rate within the week in Nanjing or Shanghai. Yu stated that this was purely speculation and that he had no knowledge of it. Regarding the rumor that frozen U.S. dollars could now be utilized, Yu stated that since the U.S. government issued Public Notice No. 94 on December 7th of last year, most of the original freeze management laws for countries worldwide have been lifted, including for our country. If one wishes to utilize such unfrozen U.S. dollars, one must go through the procedures for applying to use them. However, since December 8th of last year, all financial and commercial transactions with the United States are not subject to these restrictions.

Separate Meetings with Chinese and Foreign Guests

Yesterday afternoon, Yu separately summoned Mr. Litt, Manager of Citibank; Mr. Annard, Chief Representative; Mr. Peterson, Manager of Chase Bank; Mr. Gray, Manager of HSBC; Mr. Doubo, Manager of McCallie Bank; Mr. Sangor, Manager of Advantage Bank, and others. He emphasized that the business policies of foreign banks in our country must comply with the laws promulgated by our country, and that their rights and obligations are equal to those of Chinese banks. Yu had convened a meeting with leaders of the city's financial community at his residence the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, he met with three foreign guests: Mr. Freeman, General Manager of American Weili Han Company; Mr. Shi Weifu, Director of Yizhong Tobacco Company; and Mr. Xie Pu'er, General Manager of China Business Company, and others. In addition, Huang, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department; Shu Yunchang of China Textile Construction Company; Chen Changtong, Manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China, and others were also summoned by Yu and given instructions. In addition to summoning the authorities of various foreign banks yesterday afternoon, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Headquarters; Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Ding Guitang, Deputy Commissioner of Customs; Lieutenant Colonel Davis of the U.S. Army Supply Office in China; Smith, U.S. Commercial Counselor, and others also paid their respects.

Returning to Nanjing Today, Heading to Chongqing in a Week

This morning, if the weather permits, he will fly to the capital. It is reported that this trip will not only involve personally inspecting the repatriation of various agencies affiliated with the Ministry of Finance but also reviewing current financial issues with Lu Peizhang, Vice Minister of Finance, and others. Yu will stay in Nanjing for a week before returning to Chongqing.

### Provisional Criminal Tribunal of the High Court Continues Trial of Traitors

Five traitors were tried separately by Presiding Judge Liu and Judge Cao of the High Court yesterday morning: (1) Yang Chunting, who cohabited with his mistress at No. 5, Renrui Lane, Fanhuangdu, rented his third-floor house to Ge Wanjun in July of the previous year. Ge then secretly established a radio station in the bedroom to communicate with the mainland. The defendant, suspecting that Ge had an affair with Zuo Yangshi, reported the establishment of the secret radio station to the Japanese, leading to its exposure. (2) Gao Quansheng served as a secret agent for the Japanese Gendarmerie in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong, and secretly reported the patriotic activists Ding Weiliang and Huang Haigen, leading to their arrest. (3) Jiang Yougen, Shen Anfa, and Zuo She recruited laborers to go to the Philippines to build ships for the Japanese Navy. (4) Zhang Qipin opened the Fuxing Nail Factory, manufacturing wire nails for the Japanese Jiangnan Shipyard. (5) Yang Xiguang served as an investigator in the puppet Special Higher Police Section, arresting several of our aviation personnel, including Han Zhen. Witnesses were summoned for all of the above cases, and the trials were adjourned for reconsideration.

### Government to Return Land Forcibly Confiscated by the Enemy and Puppets

During the war, areas such as Zhabei, Nanshi, Longhua, Hongqiao, and Jiangwan in this city suffered severely from the trampling of the enemy and puppets. Later, as the Japanese were pressed by the war, they forcibly confiscated land to arrange defensive works. Once an area was designated for requisition, even if there were buildings within the boundary, they would need to be demolished immediately, without any compensation. Our reporter recently visited the Land Bureau on this matter, which concerns the rights and interests of the people, and it was stated that with respect to land requisitioned by the enemy and puppets, if no compensation was given and there is no actual need by our government, it will be investigated and returned one by one, to demonstrate the government's utmost intention to protect the rights and interests of the people.

### Qian Changzhao Arrives in Shanghai

Qian Changzhao, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to inspect the various factories affiliated with the committee. Qian will stay in Shanghai for three days.

### The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Electrical Workers to Resume Work by a Deadline; the Department Store Strike is Resolved Satisfactorily

The labor unrest at the Electrical Company, after being mediated and persuaded by the representatives of the five major public utilities, yielded no results. At 3 p.m. yesterday, Faris was summoned to the Social Affairs Bureau to meet with Zhang Zhenyuan, Director of the Labor Section, and expressed his personal opinions on the eleven demands made by the labor side. In order to resolve the unrest immediately after taking office, the new Director, Wu Kaixian, ordered the representatives of the company's employees to resume work by a deadline and scheduled a mediation session for 2 p.m. today to be conducted in accordance with the law.

The order will be delivered to the Electrical Company this morning. The original text states: "Order to Ouyang Zurun and other representatives of the employees of the Shanghai Electric Company: This Bureau has investigated that the employees' strike that began at the headquarters on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month spread to the Yangshupu Power Plant on Feilun Road, and the entire plant is now in a state of labor unrest. Although this Bureau investigated the facts and scheduled a mediation committee meeting in accordance with the law, the employees used the excuse of being bound by the decision of the general meeting to refuse to attend. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang, and representatives from the General Labor Union Bureau, Zhu Chenghao, and others rushed to persuade them, but they persisted in their defiance and refused to attend. This is a blatant disregard for the law. It must be understood that public utilities are not allowed to strike under the law. As for the employees' concerns that elected worker representatives may be fired by the employer, unless they violate the law or company regulations, they will be dealt with according to the law. The Party and government representatives have guaranteed that the representatives can attend the meeting with peace of mind and await mediation. As Director of this Bureau, I care for the workers and follow the laws and regulations. I hereby order the workers to resume work by a deadline and have scheduled a meeting with representatives from both sides at 2 p.m. on the 29th of this month to conduct mediation in accordance with the law. You must comply with this order. End of Order. Director Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director Tong Xingbai."

Nine Major Companies Officially Resume Work

The deadlock of the five-day strike at nine major department stores, including Sincere Company, was resolved satisfactorily at 7 p.m. last night. Representatives from both labor and management gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:30 p.m. Director Zhang Zhenyuan's mediation was unsuccessful. The newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, personally and earnestly advised both sides to make concessions to each other. Subsequently, the labor representatives telegraphed each company to resume work immediately. Detailed regulations were agreed upon at 7 p.m., and wages were increased to 32,500 yuan. The labor side expressed satisfaction, and formal work resumption will begin today.

Year-End Bonus at the Waterworks Resolved

The Shanghai Waterworks' request for a year-end bonus from all workers was addressed yesterday when Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian sent a hand-written note to the company's workers, instructing them not to take any action before a solution was reached. At the same time, he instructed both labor and management to begin negotiations. It was reported that an agreement had been reached by last night. The solution provides that those who have worked for more than one year will receive a bonus of one month's salary, and those who have worked for less than one year will receive a bonus calculated on a percentage basis.

The China Press Struck Yesterday Afternoon

Workers in the machine room of the English-language China Press went on strike at noon on the 28th. It is said that 80% of the workers walked out. The newspaper had issued half a month's salary for January last Saturday, which was 30% more than before, in addition to one-third of a month's salary as a Lunar New Year bonus. The workers were dissatisfied with this, demanding a 100% increase in salary and an advance of one month's salary. When their demands were not met, they began to strike. The newspaper's management believed that the treatment given to the employees since the newspaper's resumption was higher than that of general printing houses.

Wu and others arrived at the bureau at 10 a.m. All colleagues had gathered in the auditorium to welcome them, and a Commemoration Week ceremony was held at that time. Deputy Mayor He first delivered instructions on behalf of Mayor Qian, stating that Director Wu and Deputy Director Tong had a long history of leading Party affairs in Shanghai and had made significant contributions to the Party and the country. The Central Government's selection was most appropriate.

Wu and Tong Deliver Inaugural Addresses

Director Wu Kaixian then delivered a speech, stating, "I have been in Shanghai for thirty years and have been engaged in revolutionary work for twenty years.

Both have a tonnage of 10,480 tons and are known as sister ships. The "Zhongshan" arrived in Shanghai at the end of November last year and is currently sailing between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, specializing in the transportation of coal. The "Zhongtong" is reported to have also arrived from New York, carrying a large number of relief supplies. Due to the lack of a reliable wharf, it is now waiting outside the Wusongkou to be imported. Both vessels fly the national flag and are still represented by the American President Lines.

### UNRRA Distributes Relief Supplies; China Receives the Lowest Share; Director Zheng Baonan Reports on Work Overview

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the Translation Department of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in this city hosted reporters at the Duchen Hotel and invited Zheng Baonan, Director of the UNRRA Washington Office, who had recently arrived in Shanghai, to report.

Relief Supplies Shipped to Qingdao

Director Shen first reported that a U.S. military landing ship would be dispatched to Qingdao with a large shipment of relief supplies. Approximately 1,000 tons of flour, clothing, medicine, milk powder, and other supplies will be distributed to fellow countrymen within the Communist-controlled areas in Shandong Province. The use of landing ships for transportation was the result of a request by UNRRA Director Keyser to the U.S. Army and Navy. Marshal Marshall and General Wedemeyer expressed their sympathy.

China Receives the Lowest Share

Shen then introduced Zheng Shinan to report, stating that UNRRA's assistance to our country was US$56,250,000, which is US$1.25 per compatriot. In terms of per capita allocation, our country receives the lowest share. He hopes that UNRRA can make adjustments. Zheng then listed the amounts received by various countries, noting that even countries formerly at war with the Allies, such as Austria, received more than our country. The reasons for the inadequate allocation: First, perhaps because there are more UNRRA personnel of European origin, there is an inevitable bias toward European countries; second, UNRRA doubts our country's ability to absorb these supplies. In fact, if UNRRA could provide more assistance to our country in terms of water and land transportation equipment, absorption and transportation would not be a problem. Zheng also stated that he will visit areas with the most severe disaster situations, such as Henan and Hunan, next week.

Three Principles for Requesting Relief

Director Shen and Zheng then answered questions raised by various reporters, summarized as follows: (1) On September 19th of last year, our country requested US$945 million at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Conference in London, but because it was decided at that time to provide relief to former enemy countries such as Germany and Austria, it was indicated that the amount could be reduced to US$800 million, but the result was not as desired. (2) Countries requesting relief should follow three principles: the extent of the loss, the size of the population, and the situation of the ceasefire. The ceasefire in Europe was gradual, and British and American troops provided great assistance to the countries where they were stationed as they advanced. Taking Italy as an example, it received more than US$500 million in relief. Because victory came suddenly to our country, we never received this kind of benefit. (3) All countries intend to extend the UNRRA closure date. Our country, however, ended the war three months later than Europe, so it will end at the end of March next year. This matter can be decided at a future United Nations Relief Conference. China hopes to extend it for another six months. (4) Many people in our country are opposed to China leasing British ships to transport relief supplies. In fact, these ships fly the United Nations flag, and British merchants are simply providing a service. (5) To date, UNRRA supplies have arrived in China on 31 ships, totaling approximately 135,000 tons, of which 29 ships arrived in Shanghai, one ship went to Qingdao, and one ship went to Hong Kong.

### Thirteen Bandits Apprehended in Nightclubs

[Report from our newspaper] The Judicial Section of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau in western Shanghai received a confidential report the other day stating that a large number of bandits were hiding in various dance halls on Tibet Road and in the Nanshi area. Chief Zhou of the sub-bureau and Deputy Chief Zhang ordered Section Chief Li to lead a number of officers to the addresses. They successively apprehended thirteen bandits, including Chai Baisheng, Liu Deyun, Wang Henggen, Guo Changgen, Chen Changfa, Chen Guoxiang, Chen Boqing, Chen Youguan, Zhao Liangui, Qu Zhenghui, Zhao Yunjiang, Yao Qi, and Ding Minghong. They also seized a Mauser pistol. After strict interrogation at the bureau, the suspects confessed to using firearms to rob the homes of the Quan Wu family on Xinzha Road, the He Yutang family on Fuxing Road, the Huang Ruting family on Yangshupu Road, the Yufeng Rice Store on Shunchang Road, and the Ju Haofen family on Songxue Street in Nanshi. After the investigation is completed, the suspects will be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for further investigation.

### Director Jia of the Bureau of Public Works, Wang Shengsan, Took Office Yesterday

Wang Shengsan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, took office yesterday. Wang is a senior figure in China's engineering community and enjoys a high reputation. In 1930 and 1936, he attended the World Power Conference and the Railway Conference twice, serving as the chief representative of China. After graduating from Jiaotong University, he went to the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom to continue studying mechanical engineering.

### Army Headquarters and Garrison Headquarters Jointly Tried Jiang Gongmei Yesterday; Re-examination Adjourned Due to Pending Investigation

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Jiang Gongmei, former head of the Shanghai Military Police, was jointly tried by the Army Headquarters and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters a few days ago. The presiding judge was Li Shenzhi of the Army General Staff, and the Director of the Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Zeng Zhaoyi.

It is understood that the case involves a wide range and requires detailed investigation. It will be made public once the entire trial is concluded.

### Pu Zhengdong Reports on Shanghai's Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure; 2 Billion Needed to Break Even Over Four Months

The Shanghai Municipal Government held a National Father Commemoration Week yesterday morning at 9 a.m. Mayor Qian led the ceremony, and Finance Director Pu Zhengdong reported on the fiscal situation in the city since its recovery. Mayor Qian then introduced the newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, to meet with the colleagues of the Municipal Government. The main points of Director Pu's report are as follows:

Shanghai's Revenue and Expenditure Have Never Been Balanced

It was stated that Shanghai's fiscal revenue and expenditure have never been balanced. Previously, when revenue was insufficient, public bonds were issued and public assets were disposed of to achieve balance. Since the Central Government revised the fiscal revenue and expenditure system in 1943, the business tax, land tax, property rental and sale income tax, deed tax, stamp tax, and inheritance tax, which originally belonged to the local government, have been completely transferred to the Central Government. Currently, the taxes belonging to the local government are only the entertainment tax, banquet tax, slaughter tax, business license tax, and house tax, totaling five types. These are the only sources of revenue for all administrative and construction needs of the city.

Revenue and Expenditure Figures for the Past Four Months

The lawful revenue from municipal taxes totaled more than 16.44 million yuan in one week in September last year, 113.62 million yuan in October, 278.79 million yuan in November, 742.1 million yuan in December, and 713.9 million yuan to the 24th of this month, for a total of 1,864.85 million yuan. The revenue has been increasing month by month, which is only due to the continuous improvement of collection methods and does not increase the burden on the people. As for the expenditure, it totaled 56.87 million yuan in September last year, 1,007.965 million yuan in October, 1,278.42 million yuan in November, and 1,492.12 million yuan in December, for a total of 3,907.07 million yuan. The net difference between the revenue and expenditure is approximately 2,004.222 million yuan. In addition to allocating start-up funds, emergency funds, and police winter uniform expenses, the administrative expenses, living subsidies, and rice subsidies that originally belonged to the national budget from September to December of last year have not yet been allocated.

### Scavenging Bomb Fragments; Arms and Legs Blown Off

[Report from our newspaper] At approximately 3:20 p.m. yesterday, two young scavengers, Xi Quanfa and Xi Linquan, residing at No. 58, Xinmin Xincun, Xujiahui, western Shanghai, picked up ten large and small artillery shells in a certain place. They first used a hammer to strike one of the shells, intending to sell it as scrap copper and iron. Unexpectedly, it exploded with a loud bang, blowing off Quanfa's left arm and injuring his right hand on the spot, and blowing off Linquan's right leg. Both fell into pools of blood, barely alive. Police officers arrived and sent them to the First Municipal Hospital in Nanshi. The remaining shells were taken away by the 264th Regiment of the Army for destruction.

### He Fengshan Hosts Gathering for People from All Walks of Life

He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hosted a reception for people from all walks of life at No. 23, Daxi Road, at 7 p.m. yesterday.

### The Re-launched "Financial Review Monthly" Published Yesterday

The "Financial Review Monthly" has been published in Hong Kong for seven years. It was recently relocated from Chongqing to Shanghai for re-launch. The office is located at No. 97, former Edward Road. The first issue of Volume 14 was published yesterday. In addition to contributions from many experts, including Li Ming, Tong Mengzheng, Zou Zongyi, Zhang Baiyi, Dai Mingzhong, Zhou Xianwen, Chai Jianshi, Chu Baoyi, and Jian Guansan, it also contains three important pieces of information: "Financial, Monetary, and Economic Reconstruction Laws and Regulations," "Shanghai Gold, Foreign Exchange, Public Bond, and Stock Market Tables for the Past Six Months," and "Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Assets Handling Regulations," which are extremely valuable for reference.

### Weather Forecast

### Sun Yat-sen Note Stimulates Sentiment; Gold Price Gradually Rises; US Dollar Fluctuates with the Gold Market

Yesterday, due to rising gold prices reported from other locations, and further stimulated by the "Sun Yat-sen Note," major players in the industry planned to initiate a short squeeze. Buying momentum was intense for a time. However, physical US dollars were heavily sold, pushing the spread (套頭) to over 640 yuan. The gold market had a supply of short selling positions (套賣頭寸), making it difficult for the price increase to be sustained. Credit was extremely tight. At noon, long positions were liquidated, leading to a slight dip. The morning opening saw a rise to 9.1 million. Buyers came in droves, and industry players joined forces to compete for purchases. After the opening, the price rose gradually to around 9.6 million. At this point, the US dollar market did not show a corresponding increase, leading to short selling. Although there was a small pullback, there was much struggle in between. Near noon, long positions were liquidated. At noon, due to a shortage of funds, the price succumbed to below 9.4 million. In the afternoon, there were not many spot transactions. When next-day delivery opened, it had rebounded to 9.53 million. The continued weakness of the US dollar affected sentiment. In the end, it remained around 9.45 million. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the spot price rose by 38,000. Jewelry shops raised the price of gold ornaments to 100,200. Fine silver was at 850 yuan. Silver dollars rose to 530 yuan. The unofficial discount (暗拆) ranged from 1 jiao to 1.4 jiao.

Physical US dollars were being sold in large quantities. Doubts arose about whether cash could be used for settlement purposes, causing hesitancy. The morning opening, stimulated by the gold market, rose to 1460 yuan. Initially, it fluctuated. Later, due to the dramatic rise in the gold market, it triggered arbitrage buying (套買) (the spread against gold widened to 645 yuan per ten taels), gradually rising to around 1480 yuan. Later, as gold prices fell back, the US dollar also declined to slightly above 1460 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, a further small decline was seen. The supply of physical US dollars from money exchange businesses exceeded demand. As a result, it closed 15 yuan higher compared with last Saturday. Hong Kong dollar notes initially rose slightly for both new and old issues, stimulated by the gold market. However, old issues, due to their lower speculative nature, were somewhat inferior to new issues. But in the end, the high prices could not be sustained. Both new and old issues remained unchanged compared with last Saturday.

### Major Players Manipulate; Public Bonds See Another Price Increase

Since the absorption of public bonds at lower prices by industry players last Saturday, there had been signs of waiting for an opportunity to move. Yesterday, news reports that "Sun Yat-sen Notes" would soon be issued were exploited to the fullest extent, driving up prices with all their might. In a half-true, half-false state, Class C bonds fell to 1650 yuan at the morning opening. Major players jointly bought, employing both short squeezes and price manipulation. The shouting of prices was done in one go, wildly raising them to over 1950 yuan. The bulls were satisfied and stopped. Then came a round of selling and shorting. Under the dual pressure, the price plummeted by more than 400 yuan in an instant, falling back to 1500 yuan. After this, fluctuations were frequent. Major players and retail investors had different views. The price first rose to above 1800, then fell back to within 1700 yuan at noon due to time constraints. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Classes A and B each rose by 310 yuan, Class C by 370 yuan, Class D by 330 yuan, and Class E by 370 yuan.

### Speculation Exploits Rumors; Chinese Stocks Make Steady Progress

Before the capital of counterfeit currency had been fully processed, news reports stated that "Sun Yat-sen Notes" were about to be issued. Regardless of the source of the news, speculators were able to make full use of it. Yong Spinning opened in the morning already raised to over 1800 yuan, and Mei Ya at 12400 yuan. However, at this time, due to the urgency of the rumors, the shouting of prices was intermittent. Later, as credit tightened, some businesses had to sell off purchased gold to prepare for settlement. There was a slight decline, but there were many fluctuations in between. Both Yong Spinning and Mei Ya fell back about 100 yuan from their peak. Until the noon close, they were still fluctuating. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yong Spinning and Mei Ya each rose by 130 yuan, Xinhe and China Textile each rose by 30 yuan, and the "Three Small Hot Stocks" (三小熱) each rose by about 10%. Due to their cheap base prices, unpopular stocks also attracted attention and continued to make progress.

Foreign stocks were passively raised due to the stimulation of stocks and bonds. Therefore, they were not as brilliant as stocks and bonds, but the process was extremely stable and there were not many pullbacks. Until the noon close, compared with last Saturday, medium and small stocks such as Yi Spinning and Paper Industry each rose by over 200 yuan. Jardine Matheson, due to its large price and high cost, failed to prosper. Rubber stocks were desolate.

### Yarn Prices Soar Again; Spinning and Construction Company Will Not Sell Within the Year

Yesterday, the yarn market made rapid progress. The rumors of Sun Yat-sen Notes revealed in newspapers greatly boosted morale. Industry players and retail investors successively absorbed massively. In the case of a shortage of stock from each factory, the price rose rapidly. 16-count and 20-count yarn increased by 50,000, and fine yarn increased by 70,000 to 80,000. At noon, the Spinning and Construction Company announced that it would no longer be selling within the year, so the trend became even more outstanding.

### Too Little Allocated Raw Materials; Silk Unanimously Becomes Expensive

Yesterday, in the artificial silk market outside of exchange transactions, 120-numbered Tianqiao spot was priced at a maximum of 1.23 million yuan, and a minimum of 1.2 million yuan. Warehouse receipts were 800,000 to 810,000 yuan, an increase of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan compared with the weekend. This was really because the number of raw materials allocated for the first time was too small, and each factory was running out quickly. There was still actual sales, so factory operators were no longer static. The cost of goods arriving increased sharply, and each tier of quality was raised unanimously. Intermediate tiers required a price of more than 1.5 million yuan. Silk goods had unimpeded sales and prices also followed. Mei Ya quilt covers were 850,000 yuan per 100 pieces, Da Cheng ge bi crepe was 2,800 yuan per yard, and Minsheng brocade was 12,000 yuan per piece.

### Cotton Transactions Firm and Steady

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was still firm. Chinese yarn mills purchased 42-count raw material American cotton middling flower at 62,000 yuan, and 32-count raw material San Yu Zhen fine velvet flower at 63,500 yuan. The above were all factory delivery prices. Hua Hao purchased 16-count raw material Fire Machine flower at 44,000 yuan, and Zhou Pu seed flower was priced at 9,000 yuan and 9,200 yuan. The above were all warehouse delivery prices.

### Cotton Cloth Merchants Act Reserved and Do Not Release

The news of the issuance of Sun Yat-sen Notes was rampant in the market. The gold price had already risen. Those holding goods had a preconceived notion of valuing goods over currency, acting reserved and not releasing stock. In addition to the low inventory of finished products, the cloth market had a slowly rising phenomenon.

### Rice and Grain Prices Soar; Edible Oil Rises Most Sharply

Due to the rainy weather and the end of the year, the source of supply was gradually scarce. As stores were about to close for the holiday, they all had to prepare goods, so actual sales were very high, causing both japonica and indica rice to rise by 300 to 400 yuan. Flour also increased by 300 to 400 yuan because of scarce arrivals and smoother retail sales. Soybeans were unusually lively and continued to rise by 500 to 600 yuan. The oil market also surged by a huge 6,000 to 7,000 yuan as stores prepared for the New Year. Soybean cake followed suit, rising by 100 to 200 yuan. The liquor market was firm and steady.

The rice market will close tomorrow. According to the person in charge of the temporary rice and grain market, the market will complete its work today due to the approaching end of the year, and will not begin trading again until the fifth day of the new lunar year next spring.

### As the Final Accounting Period Approaches, Tea Market Transactions Decline

The final accounting period for all industries and businesses in the 34th year of the Republic of China will soon arrive. Tea merchants must also follow the precedent of doing annual operating statements, so both buyers and sellers are unwilling to transact. The only occasional transactions are from retail consumers requiring cash for adjustments. Therefore, there are very few transactions. Market momentum is quite calm. Market conditions lack significant changes, and remain stable. According to news from the Tianjin gang, there is high demand for Dafang green tea, etc. The general trend is to resume activity after the lunar new year.

### Coal Market Silent; Firewood and Charcoal Inevitably Soften at Year's End

Coal market transactions are zero and silent. Near the end of the year, most coal merchants have temporarily closed. Without actual sales channels, most are unwilling to purchase. Sales of white coal chunks are sluggish and the market continues to fall. White coal dust, given the brisk sales of coal briquettes, is considered lucrative by industry peers and the market is surprisingly firm. Due to the rain, small firewood and charcoal vendors are unable to achieve brisk sales. The cargo owners are eager to liquidate and return home. They can only sell at a lower price, but buyers are still lacking.

### Timber Market Price Firm and Nimble; Doubled in November

Yesterday's timber market situation, although it was the end of the year, was still outstanding, nimble and profitable. Lauan plywood and pine boards were being sought after, and prices repeatedly set new records, already doubling in November.

### Economic Briefs

Jiang海關: It is now notified by the Chief Inspectorate of Customs that from today onwards, all gold bars and any gold nuggets will be prohibited from exiting the customs. If passengers are travelling to various parts of the Northeast, there are also limits on the amount of jewelry they can carry. If they exceed the limit, they should make arrangements themselves, and depending on the situation, they may be temporarily detained for one month, after which they will be confiscated.

Low-priced frozen pork and beef will be sold by a temporary sales office organized by the Enemy and Puppet Property Bureau, located at 1080 Dongdaming Road, starting today.

The Kai滦 and Huainan coal mines are increasing their output daily. Kai滦 currently produces more than 4,000 tons per day, and Huainan currently transports more than 400 tons per day to Bengbu for transfer to various locations.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Students arrested and detained at Jingling University, the local court has set the trial to take place on the 30th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch] Students dismissed from the Jingling University Preparatory Class (首都臨時大學補習班) for causing trouble, the prosecutor's office of the Capital District Court (首都地方法院檢察處) considered them suspected of committing crimes. The students arrested, including Yu Baiqing (于柏靑) and eight others, have been investigated by the prosecutor and, in accordance with Articles 136 and 302 of the Criminal Procedure Law, have been prosecuted for obstructing official duties and freedom. The prosecutor's office has completed its duties. The case will now be handled by the judge of the criminal court in accordance with the law. Although prosecution has been initiated, whether a crime has been committed is subject to the court's trial. It is currently difficult to speculate.

Therefore, a part of the "121 Student Association" (一二一同學會) did not attend classes on the 25th, and advocated to request the release of the arrested students. The court will soon open the trial for this case. The actual observations and interviews from all sides are recorded below:

School Side

When the newspaper reporter went to the Preparatory Class on the 26th, he saw that notices of the hunger strike of the eight arrested students, including Yu Baiqing, were posted on the two walls at the entrance, calling on students and people of the community for help. On the 25th, part of the so-called 121 Student Association in the class did not attend classes. Those who went outside to appeal were doing this. However, visiting the classrooms, the majority of students were in class. When the class was first established, those in charge thought that the preparatory class was very simple, opening a class when it reached 50 people. The curriculum was a preparatory nature. The general provision was for ordinary subjects to be sufficient. Unexpectedly, the number of students later increased, and all departments of the university were prepared, which was very urgent. The class director recruited many outstanding professors from Chongqing (渝), Shanghai (滬) and the mainland (內地), (such as the famous scholar Sun Hongfen (孫洪芬) of the former Science Society (科學社). He met the reporter just now, and then knew that he was the professor of the chemical engineering department of the class), which was already a lot of effort.

Professor Side

According to Wang Shulin, the director of the class: the previous student disturbances were due to the English test paper, but the biggest demand came from students of the former Zhongda University (僞中大學生), who wanted to be assigned to formally study at Zhongda (中大) after completing this preparatory class. Frankly speaking, if they allow them this condition, no matter how hard they suffer, it will not work. This matter is not only handled by the Ministry of Education (敎部), which does not have this method, but Zhongda itself, because the previous school buildings could only accommodate 2,000 people, and now the number of students has increased to 4,500. They already feel difficult, and cannot say that the Zhongda door is closed tightly, and people are not allowed to enter, but it is not that you can rush in by banging on it. If students can study hard in the class and get good grades, many of the professors here are in Zhongda, and can feel that the students are good and preside over public opinion. There may be a chance to insert themselves. I cannot deceive or perfunctorily make promises that I cannot do myself, and hope that students can enter Zhongda, but it depends on their efforts. As for the arrested students, he did not act as the plaintiff, and did not file a private lawsuit. It was entirely the prosecutor who believed that the students had obstructed official duties and freedom, and considered them suspected of committing a crime. The prosecutor acted as the plaintiff and filed a public prosecution. Wang also sent a letter to the court, expressing leniency and forgiveness towards the students. Since he did not accuse them, he could not accommodate the students' request to bail the students out in his personal name. Students can come up with their own ideas and apply for bail according to the law.

Ministry of Education Side

According to relevant authorities: the Ministry of Education's reorganization of student life is an educational administrative process, and it ends with the procedure of expelling students. The students were arrested and interrogated for assaulting the class director, which is a legal issue for the court. Judicial independence and educational administration have no right to interfere. As for the request for bail, students can apply for it according to the law, subject to the court's verification.

Court Side

After learning that the detained students were on hunger strike, President Wang (汪院長) of the Capital District Court sent the chief clerk Tu Huai-li (涂懷禮) to visit the students at the detention center on the 26th at 11 a.m. to express President Wang's concern for the youth, explaining that the matter will be conducted according to legal channels, and will soon open the trial, advising the students to eat as usual (one said that the students were not on hunger strike), and said that the hunger strike request is meaningless, and the court is not responsible for this matter, and there is no reason to be coerced by this to influence the case. The conversation lasted for two hours, and the students also expressed that the warden treated the young people well. It is heard that the court will open the trial soon, and will hold a public trial in a few days. According to regulations, Director Wang sent a letter to the court, expressing leniency, and the court sympathized with the psychological observation of the young people who blindly violated the law. It can be said that the law cannot be abandoned, but the circumstances are understandable. It is speculated that the trial will be lenient. It is expected that the trial will be opened and resolved around the 20th of this month. It is also heard that an investigation court will be held first, to study the matter in advance, and then a three-way hearing (with three judges appearing in court at the same time) to ensure thoroughness and care.

### Guangxi University President Li Yunhua Goes to Chongqing to Ask the Ministry of Education for Instructions on Restoration Issues

[Our Newspaper, Guilin News] Guangxi University President Li Yunhua went to Chongqing a few days ago. It is reported that there are two purposes for this trip: (1) The number of students at the school was originally scheduled to be 600, but recently, due to the restoration of transportation, the number of people coming from all directions has exceeded 1,000, which is very different from the original budget, and it is proposed to ask the Ministry of Education to allocate additional funds. (2) Most of the school buildings in Guilin were destroyed, and reconstruction is not easy. Although classes are now being held in Liuzhou, the school buildings are covered with bamboo sheds, which only shelter from wind and rain, so some people advocate moving to the original site in Wuzhou, which also needs to be decided by the Ministry of Education.

### The Top Ten Medicines of 1945

— Mu Ming

Just like electing the top ten movie stars, the Journal of the American Medical Association recently specially invited major physicians to select the ten most important medicines of 1945. The results were quite interesting.

Now, let's list the ten famous medicines of 1910 for comparison, so that we can see the degree of medical advancement over the past 35 years. The top ten medicines of 1910 were also selected by a majority of doctors, and their rankings are as follows:

(1) Ether, (2) Morphine, (3) Digitalis, (4) Diphtheria Antitoxin, (5) Vaccinia Virus, (6) Iron, (7) Quinine, (8) Iodine, (9) Alcohol, (10) Mercury.

From this table, it can be seen that the medical scientists of the early 20th century were still very immature, far from being comparable to today, and that humans at that time were far less happy and safe than we are now, because the weapons used to fight against diseases were too weak, and life simply had no guarantee.

In 1945, the throne of the top ten medicines was seized by Penicillin, which is universally recognized and without a doubt. This great new invention of penicillin is truly worthy of being called the king of medicines. Its contribution to mankind is too great, and there is no precedent for this in the history of medicine. Sulfa drugs were also dazzling and unparalleled, but they inevitably paled in comparison after the invention of penicillin. Now, they are listed together as one item in the top ten list, because there are too many new drugs in modern times, each with its own advantages. Only listing one would inevitably lead to regret. In the ranking list below, each item is based on a type of drug:

(1) Penicillin and similar products, sulfonamide drugs.

(2) Blood, plasma, and blood products.

(3) Quinine and the artificial antimalarial drug Atabrine.

(4) Ether and other anesthetics; including morphine, codeine, and various sleeping pills.

(5) Digitalis cardiac stimulants.

(6) 606-type arsenic preparations.

(7) Immunological preparations, including various vaccines and serums.

(8) Insulin and liver extract.

(9) Other hormones.

(10) Vitamins.

The drugs included in this table are really too complex and broad. Among them, immunological preparations, hormones, and vitamins are the most brilliant pages in the history of modern medical science, and they are definitely not something that just one or two drugs can represent. It can be said that it took a lot of effort to arrange such a table, but in fact, there are still many drugs whose value cannot be ignored even though they did not make the list.

It is surprising that blood and its products actually jumped to second place. This is probably because there were too many blood transfusions during the war. In terms of application, the amount of blood transfused must have been very large. Similarly, addiction drugs are given special attention because the war was mostly conducted in tropical regions (especially the American war in the South Pacific), and the threat of malaria is far greater than in the past.

The rapid progress of medicine and the rapid changes in drugs are truly amazing. Just imagine that terms like vitamins and hormones were simply unheard of in 1910, but now they are household names, known to both women and children. It is expected that progress will accelerate even further in the future. If the top ten medicines are selected again in ten years, I wonder what kind of changes there will be.

### "Discarded Calendar" and "Laborious"

— Zhong Geyi

Despite your government issuing an order to abolish the lunar calendar, the "discarded calendar" still exists perfectly well and will never be 100% abolished! Of course, on the surface, we have adopted the Gregorian calendar, and all agencies, schools, etc. follow the Gregorian calendar. However, the penetration of the lunar calendar into the folk has long reached an unshakable degree, and it is by no means a political order that can easily "discard" it from the minds of the people! Just look, why do people still calculate their birthdays according to the discarded calendar? Why is there a kind of liveliness during the discarded calendar New Year that the Gregorian calendar New Year does not have? All of these are undeniable facts.

Now, isn't it time for the discarded calendar New Year again? It's the New Year! But the New Year requires money in many ways: gift-giving, buying New Year's goods, paying for coolies and servants, giving "lucky money"... Money, money, money. Money makes the New Year a daunting and difficult hurdle! True, for the big bosses, there are official profits here and bonuses there. Today, one subordinate pays tribute with chickens and ducks, and tomorrow, another subordinate presents hams, enjoying the "New Year's blockbuster" and trying a table of "sacrifice dishes" costing tens of thousands of yuan. It's truly "Isn't it a joy!" But for the small employees and the salaried class, the income is meager and pitiful, while the expenses are huge and alarming. Everywhere, people feel "short of money," but New Year's gifts must be given, and a "grand appearance" must be "held up"! Therefore, one can only sigh while reluctantly forcing a smile and saying "Congratulations and get rich"! And when the end of the year arrives, "it is time for the poor to pay their debts," who can jump out of the palm of the creditor? Okay, let's look back at how the prices are; how are they? Can you deny that prices have consistently risen more than they have fallen? It's truly "It's hard for the poor to get through the New Year," and "Wang Xiaoer's New Year is worse than the last!"

It's true that to get through a "discarded calendar" New Year, you can't help but say "laborious"! ———Truly "laborious"! Indeed "laborious"! Really "laborious"!

To solve the problem of "laborious," there is only one way, and that is to thoroughly and fundamentally abolish the "discarded calendar"! But, to abolish the "discarded calendar"? In fact, it is a more "laborious" thing than celebrating the New Year!

### Chongqing Snippets

— Mei Youyun

What has the Political Consultative Conference given us? Can the ceasefire order promote peace? The voices of the people are all hoarse. The people's hope is not to enjoy a comfortable life. Even if life is more difficult, they only ask to be able to exist in an orderly and worthwhile time. Don't walk towards the road of destruction!

At a certain speech meeting of the Political Consultative Conference representatives, the audience stirred up an unfavorable action. They opposed the representative's argument and even "used force"! Although it was an unorganized and disorderly raising of angry fists, they shouted in unison; "Long live Chairman Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!" This proves that justice cannot be disguised!

The people who stayed in the mountain city seem to be indifferent to their expectations for the upcoming Spring Festival. Most people had too perfect expectations for it when victory first came, a beautiful dream of "returning home for the New Year." Since it is impossible to realize, coupled with some unpleasant emotions entangled, who can still have the interest in "listening to the sound of firecrackers and feeling happy"?

In Central Park, a steel and cement monument is being built. It is to commemorate the martyrs who contributed to the War of Resistance. Okay! Let it stand in this park, the site of victory in the War of Resistance! Tell these living people: "Who did you die for!"

Thoughts

### Between Merit and Demerit

— Tan Ziyou

These days, traitors are being tried everywhere. The newspaper on the 16th had two reports; one was the trial of Gan Weilu in Shanghai, and the other was the trial of Chen Hongci in Guangzhou. These two treasures each have their own ugly appearances, and at the same time, they further explain their past history. The reason why they say it is, in the final analysis, nothing more than hoping that the lord will be extra kind and declare them innocent.

People come into the world and should establish some careers for the nation, for the country, and for their own clan, so as not to waste this trip to the world. This is nothing to be proud of; this is just one's duty. Looking at the past of people like Chen Hongci and Gan Weilu, it is indeed not bad; but what about now? They are traitors. How good it would have been if they could have promoted and expanded their past. However, they fell into the water, causing eternal regret, not only defiling the great achievements of all their ancestors, but also dimming the glory of their descendants! Now, they are still unwilling to confess their guilt, and they even fantasize about using a little of their past history to "offset" today's crime.

Two people scold each other on the street. I scold you for having a pockmarked face, and you scold me for being bald. Although what everyone scolds is indeed the other party's shortcomings, it does not mean that just because you have hit the other party's shortcomings, you can say that your own shortcomings are not shortcomings! Saying that someone else is bald does not explain that your own face is not pockmarked! At most, you can say that you don't have this shortcoming.

We should not casually obliterate a person's past achievements; but we cannot regard this as capital for doing bad things, betraying the country, or committing crimes in the future, as a tool for offsetting crimes.

Merit and crime cannot be merged in any way, like positive and negative numbers cancelling each other out. At least, this should be the case when merit and crime do not occur at the same time.

Whether you betrayed the country or not is the purpose of trying traitors. If you did, you must be guilty; if you didn't, bring the evidence that you didn't betray the country! What does past merit or demerit have to do with today? Now that you have become a traitor, what is the use of a photo personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang? What is the use of being classmates with someone? What is the use of being a judge for more than ten years?

Past history is useful, but it only serves as a lesson for us today, as a tool to encourage us to move forward and urge us to do good. It is already "a great sin" not to promote and expand such a good past. Now that you have betrayed the country, you still want to use the past to offset your crime, and there are even such mouths in the world to say this!

### The Eyes of the Soul

— Yang Tongfang

There are many people whose eyes are not blind, but their "eyes of the soul" are blind. Because what is revealed from their souls is not light, but darkness. The soul is the master of a person's body and mind, and should always be kept pure and clean. If it is slightly covered with some dust, it is tantamount to obscuring the entire "eyes of the soul."

It is not a very sad thing for a person's eyes to be blind. Ms. Helen Keller said: "The blind are not considered the most defective, because the defects of the visual organs can be remedied in various ways." This is very true. Modern scientific civilization has already brought many blessings to the blind. The various new facilities in blind schools have solved the difficulties of reading and learning for the blind. The blind can still read newspapers, play music, receive external stimuli, and awaken the motivation of life. There are many blind people in the world who have struggled and succeeded in the dark and reached the bright side of life.

According to the research of modern psychologists, the learning ability of the blind often exceeds that of ordinary people. Some say that the intelligence of the blind is higher than that of ordinary sighted people, but this is not entirely true. Hollingworth said: "The memory of the blind does sometimes surpass that of ordinary people, which is a compensatory effect. Visual defects are compensated for in other ways." Generally speaking, the blind are not easily disturbed by external visual distractions because of their blindness. Their hearts are always quieter, and their thoughts are more focused, so their learning ability is naturally much higher.

Therefore, I feel that although the eyes of the blind cannot see external things, their "eyes of the soul" may be much brighter. Many blind musicians can play the sincere tunes from the depths of their hearts and move countless people, perhaps not without reason?

What is sad is that there are many people in society whose eyes are not only not blind, but also have no nearsightedness at all. Their eyes are sharp and their eyesight is strong, but their hearts are not bright at all. Their thoughts and behaviors are base and unbearable, corrupt and unbearable, giving people the feeling of "dregs in a sewage ditch." Although the eyes of such people are bright, their hearts are incomparably dark. Their minds are drowsy and their thoughts are as stagnant as dead wood. They spend the whole day in a muddle-headed way. For these "soulless blind people," life becomes nothing more than eating and sleeping. They themselves feel that life is meaningless. Life is originally full of hope, but they say there is no hope, only frustration and negativity. The future is originally bright, but they say there is no light, only darkness and depression. In fact, what is unfolding before us is infinite hope and light, but their "eyes of the soul" have long been blinded, and a large cataract covers them, so they naturally cannot see hope and light.

To hope for social progress and cultural development, we must let the "eyes of the soul" shine brightly. We must demand improvement and upward mobility in life, increase the positive significance of life for individuals and society, make our lives purposeful and conscious, remove all the shadows in our minds, not only maintain physical health, but also strive for mental health. Eliminate all bad mental states. If our "eyes of the soul" cannot see clearly, we should immediately find ways to treat them.

Open our eyes to see this dynamic world outside, to see farther and clearer. Open our "eyes of the soul" to think, observe, understand, and criticize our lives, to improve the meaning of our lives from self-awareness, and to correct all psychological pathologies!

### City Education Association Established, Education Staff Job Center, Schools Can Entrust Personnel Recruitment

The Shanghai City Education Association has recently organized a "Education Staff Job Center" so that qualified unemployed teachers in primary and secondary schools can find positions and focus on education with peace of mind. This is indeed a very important initiative. Unemployment is the most depressing and serious problem, especially for educators. When they are employed, they receive meager salaries and live a hard life. They have no savings, and once they become unemployed, they suffer from hunger. Asking around is not always a solution. Now that there is a special agency for introducing teachers, everyone can first join and register, hoping to obtain a suitable position, so as not to sigh about the vast future and no one to take care of them. On the other hand, it is hoped that if schools and bureaus need to hire teachers of certain subjects, certain grades, full-time or part-time, they should entrust the association's job center to be responsible for recommending them. Anyone who is qualified, teaches diligently, and has considerable teaching experience can be hired. In this way, both the supply and demand sides can obtain satisfactory results. I hope that the morning, industry, commerce, learning, and military departments all have job centers. The first step is to conduct talent registration, investigation, and statistics. The second step is to contact various production and business agencies, and recommend them in as many ways as possible, so that "everyone has a job, and everyone gets what they deserve;" and "as soon as someone asks for someone, everyone gets who they deserve;" It is especially hoped that the government will take the lead and society will promote it. If it can be handled properly, the unemployment problem can be gradually solved, and unnecessary social struggles can also be eliminated. "Everyone has something to do, and everyone has food to eat," this is the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's idea of "everyone doing their best"!

Request to Restore Streetlights To the Editor: Our factory is located at No. 1125, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai (i.e., Wuding Road). There were streetlights before the war, which was convenient for pedestrians. During the enemy and puppet period, they were destroyed by petty thieves and have not been restored. Moreover, this street is the main road for thousands of residents in the Zhuanbang area, with factories and many Western residences. At night, it is as dark as ink. Not only do collisions and conflicts occur constantly, but also cases of burglary occur from time to time. The reason is nothing more than the lack of streetlights. Now that streetlights have been restored in most places, this lane alone has not been installed. We deeply hope that the wise authorities will install them as soon as possible. We are very grateful. Yuexin Dyeing and Weaving Factory respectfully.
