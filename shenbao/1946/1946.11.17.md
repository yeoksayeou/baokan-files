### Government Actively Reorganizing During National Assembly Meeting; Democratic Socialist Party Submits List

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zheng Dang, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, flew to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th to consult with Zhang Junmai, Li Huang, Zhang Qun, and others, and returned to Nanjing at 4:30 PM on the 16th. In the evening, when Lei met with reporters, he did not explain the mission to Shanghai, only answering the reporter's inquiries as follows: (1) The National Government Committee is about to be reorganized and is currently under preparation. The number of committee members from the Communist Party and the Democratic League will be reserved. (2) The rumor that the reorganized government will have eighteen ministries is not accurate. (3) The reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be handled after the National Assembly concludes, due to timing issues.

[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] Shao Lizi, the chief representative of the peace negotiation government, told United Press reporters today: There is no longer any problem with the Democratic Socialist Party participating in the National Assembly. Shao said: Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, returned to Nanjing after going to Shanghai to discuss with members of his party, and submitted four suggestions before participating in the National Assembly, requesting the government to accept them. According to Shao, these suggestions include the following points: (1) The government reiterates its policy of resolving the Communist Party issue peacefully; (2) The government should allow the full realization of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association; (3) The government should remove party branches and youth league activities from all schools. Shao said: These suggestions are "acceptable" to the government, and the implementation details are being drafted. This issue is expected to be resolved soon. Shao also revealed: The government is preparing to reorganize, including the National Government Council and the Executive Yuan, and this reorganization will be implemented during the National Assembly meeting. Wu Tiecheng also stated: The Kuomintang is preparing to reorganize the government.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing at 7:15 AM on the 16th on the Nanjing-Shanghai train. Among those traveling with him were Meng Xianzhang and six other representatives from Hubei. Because Zhang arrived very early, very few people came to welcome him. After getting off the train, he took Wu Tiecheng's car to Wu's residence. At 10:00 AM, Wu Dingchang visited him, followed by an audience with the Chairman, and then a visit to Song Ziwen. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Li Zongren visited him. At 5:00 PM, he accepted Zhang Jiaao's invitation to meet with Zhang Junmai on Tianzhu Road and discussed everything. In the evening, he accepted Special Envoy Marshall's invitation to dinner. There are rumors that Zhang will be transferred to the position of Secretary-General, although this has not been officially confirmed, but it is quite possible.

### Youth Party Representatives Register; Zhang Junmai and Others Fly to Nanjing; Democratic League to Express Attitude Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After the list of Youth Party National Assembly representatives was announced on the morning of the 16th, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, and 19 others registered on the 16th. Li Huang remained in Shanghai due to illness and will return to Nanjing on the 17th. Also, 30 National Assembly representatives registered on the 16th, bringing the total to 1445, including 19 Youth Party representatives.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] When reporters asked Minister Peng Xuepei for his opinion on the remarks made by Youth Party leader Zuo Shunsheng, he replied: Mr. Zuo's remarks are logically rigorous. He said that only by unanimously participating in the National Assembly can peace be maintained, unity be promoted, and a constitution supported by the whole country be created to protect the people's livelihood. His theory is simple and clear, which shows that right and wrong and justice cannot be covered up by intimidation and propaganda tactics.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, along with nine party officials including Jiang Yuntian and Sun Baogang, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 4:30 PM on the 16th. It is reported that the list of the Democratic Socialist Party has already been drafted and can be submitted immediately. The National Government may convene a selection committee immediately to approve it. Tonight, reporters inquired about the Democratic League's thoughts on the participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party in the National Assembly. Luo Longji replied that he had no opinion to express, but he intends to receive reporters in the next few days to express his attitude. The area in front of the Lan Family Villa has become deserted.

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, came to Shanghai again on the morning of the 15th. On the mornings of the 15th and 16th, he continued to hold meetings with party cadres here to discuss participation in the National Assembly and the party's future issues. As a result of the discussions, the party hopes that the government authorities will accept the demands it has put forward before immediately submitting the list for the National Assembly. Zhang took a plane back to Nanjing in the afternoon.

Reporters visited Sun Baoyi, the spokesperson for the party, last night, who stated: "Our party has not yet submitted a list of National Assembly representatives and hopes that the government can continue to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party so that the current situation does not worsen further." He also stated: "The party has requested that the National Assembly be postponed and implemented in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference before nominating a list. Among them, the postponement of the National Assembly is now a thing of the past. However, we still hope that the government will accept the part about reorganizing the government and drafting the constitution. Some important clauses in the draft constitution, such as the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan and the scope of the Executive Yuan's powers, have not yet been decided, and we hope the government will adopt them."

Sun also stated that the relationship between the Democratic League and the Democratic Socialist Party has always been very close. All proposals of the Democratic League are jointly decided by the Democratic Socialist Party, but the actions of the Democratic Socialist Party are not bound by the Democratic League. The Democratic Socialist Party has always hoped to take consistent actions with the Democratic League and echo each other. However, in special circumstances, the Democratic Socialist Party can also act freely and is not bound by the Democratic League. Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, and Shen Junru also came after him, but Luo Longji is still in Nanjing.

The Chinese Communist Party authorities have not made any statement regarding the Democratic Socialist Party recently. Zhang Junmai's visit may be to discuss with Zhou Enlai. Zhou has not returned to Yan'an due to a plane delay, but Dong Biwu remains in Nanjing, creating a lingering connection. There may still be a turning point in the overall situation.

### Representatives to the National Assembly from Hebei

Appeal for Relief for the Disaster in Hebei

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] National Assembly representatives from Hebei Province, Han Da, Li Huadong, Liu Yaozhang, etc., took the opportunity of attending the National Assembly to make appeals for urgent relief to the disaster victims in Hebei in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, they sent Zhang Yinwu, Li Sizong, and three others to the Executive Yuan to petition. Because Premier Song was out, Secretary-General Jiang received them on his behalf. After the representatives tearfully described the dire situation of the people in Hebei, Jiang promised to forward the report to Premier Song and try to allocate relief funds as soon as possible to provide urgent relief.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 16th, listing the names of the National Assembly representatives whose registration has been canceled for various reasons, and who are being replaced by alternates or supplements. This order. Shao Shenting of the Dalian Occupational Groups was unable to attend in Nanjing for some reason, and was replaced by Zhang Baozi. LÃ¼ Lefu of the Xinjiang Mongolian Tribe resigned and was replaced by Qiao Jiafu. Hu Shuhua, a civil engineer in the free occupation group, was elected as a representative of the social elite, and was replaced by Xu Enzeng.

### China Labor Association

Supports the Convening of the National Assembly

Opposes the Communist Party's Separatist Militarism

[Central News Agency, This City] The China Labor Association, in support of convening the National Assembly and opposition to the Communist Party's separatist militarism, telegraphed to the Nanjing National Assembly representatives, stating: This time, the government has shown forbearance for the country, promulgated a ceasefire order, and repeatedly postponed the meeting, its painstaking efforts are evident to the world. Our association is a national labor organization, established for more than ten years, with the purpose of studying labor theory based on the Three Principles of the People, coordinating labor welfare, and promoting the labor movement. During the War of Resistance, it also participated in military work to assist the government. From now on, it will adhere to its original intention to implement the labor policy of the Three Principles of the People, contact international workers, and continue to work to improve labor culture and increase labor welfare. Communism is not suitable for China's national conditions, which is clear in the teachings of the Founding Father. The Communist Party's despicable, brutal, and undemocratic style is especially unsuitable for the peace-loving and freedom-loving Chinese nation. We believe that today's China must implement constitutionalism, and the implementation of constitutionalism must be promulgated with a constitution. The promulgation of a constitution requires convening a National Assembly. To seek peaceful reconstruction of the country, the military must be nationalized. The Communist Party's separatist militarism is a major obstacle to peaceful unification. Because if the military is not nationalized for a day, wars will continue, and there will be no peace. We, at this time of national success or failure, must work together and bravely move towards the path of national construction, bringing the country to a state of prosperity, strength, and well-being, and elevating the people to a comfortable life. If any party, disregarding the suffering of the people and the interests of the nation, dares to defy the world and disrupt the National Assembly and engage in separatist rebellions, it will be the public enemy of the people of the whole country. On the occasion of the opening of the conference, we sincerely send this telegram to the representatives, hoping you will be informed, China Labor Association, 15th.

### "Social Security" Chapter Should Be Added to Draft Constitution

Occupational Representatives Draft Proposal

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] This National Assembly's occupational representatives, because the Five-Five Draft Constitution and its revised draft do not contain provisions related to occupational representatives, have gone to the Ministry of Social Affairs to solicit opinions. Minister Gu Zhenggang hosted a tea party on the 16th to invite representatives of various occupational groups to collectively discuss common opinions. Minister Gu first stated that the current occupational representatives account for about one-third of the total number of representatives. The future constitution should have provisions for the number of their representatives and the method of their creation. He also said: "The Ministry has worked with experts to formulate a plan to add a 'Social Security' chapter to the constitution to stabilize society, consolidate the foundation of the country, meet national requirements, and adapt to the spirit of the times." He also asked the representatives attending the meeting to contribute their opinions. The representatives spoke enthusiastically, discussed repeatedly, and agreed that it was necessary to strive for this in the National Assembly. Finally, Tang Qiyu, Li Hongru, Wu Yun, Hu Shuhua, and 12 others, as well as a representative from Xinjiang Heyuan, were selected to form a drafting committee to draft proposals for submission to the National Assembly.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th] US Ambassador Stuart flew from Nanjing to Beiping on Marshall's special plane at 4:00 PM on the 16th. Chuan Jingbo said: "The ambassador is homesick, so he came back to see." The ambassador's health seems to be better than the last time he returned to Beiping, but his mood seems to be covered by a deeper shadow. Someone asked him if there was still a glimmer of hope for peace, and he said: "I don't know, but I will always have hope for China." He told reporters that rumors of Marshall returning to the US are false.

### National Assembly Representatives Commemorate Loyal Souls; Chairman Chiang Personally Presides Over the Ceremony; Ceremony at Linggu Temple Extremely Solemn and Grand

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] More than 500 National Assembly representatives, led by Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, went to the Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine in Linggu Temple on the morning of the 16th to pay respects to the soldiers who died in the War of Resistance.

Today the weather was clear, and hundreds of representatives bathed in the sunshine, looking at the beautiful Zijin Mountain and feeling a sense of righteousness. They lingered in front of the Martyrs' Shrine for a long time before leaving.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Chairman Chiang and his wife hosted National Assembly representatives at the Lixingshe Auditorium on the evening of the 16th.

Older representatives sat on the sofas on the left and right, and the rest sat on wooden chairs behind the sofas. More than 300 representatives and reporters from various newspapers attended, and all enjoyed this mixed performance of Western music, Chinese gongs and drums, Beijing opera costumes and movements, and modern dance rhythms in an extremely quiet atmosphere. The program ended at 10:30, and the guests and hosts parted happily.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] On the evening of the 16th, Chairman Chiang hosted a banquet at his official residence for more than 30 older representatives from various places to Nanjing, including Xue Tuxuan, Kong Geng, Long Ling, Zhan Tiaoyuan, and Yang Minsheng, accompanied by Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Chen Bulei, and Hong Lanyou.

### Zhou Enlai's Written Statement

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai of the Chinese Communist Party delegation held a press conference at 2:30 PM on the 16th and issued a written statement, stating that there was nothing else to explain besides this. Then the reporters raised questions, and Zhou answered them one by one, and the meeting ended at about 4:00 PM. The full text of his written statement is as follows: The National Assembly unilaterally organized by the Kuomintang government opened yesterday. This National Assembly was convened unilaterally by a one-party government, violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the national will. The Chinese Communist Party firmly opposes it. Not only was the date of this National Assembly not agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference, but more importantly, it is a divisive National Assembly convened by one party, not a united National Assembly attended by all parties. According to the resolutions and procedures and spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented in turn, and it can be convened under the leadership of the reorganized government.

The various resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference are the temporary constitution agreed upon by all parties, and it is a whole that cannot be divided. In the past ten months, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have not only not been implemented in the slightest, but have been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang authorities. The ceasefire agreement was approved by the Political Consultative Conference, but the civil war has spread from Northeast China to inside the passes. The government authorities have thoroughly destroyed the authority of the January ceasefire order. The four promises announced by the government authorities at the opening of the Political Consultative Conference, from the Datangzi massacre to the Li Wen assassination case, have been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang secret service rule. The reorganization of the government has not yet been agreed upon, and the program for peaceful national reconstruction cannot be implemented. For the local governments in many liberated areas, the Kuomintang authorities not only do not allow them to maintain the status quo in accordance with the program, but also want to implement "takeover." If they do not agree, they will implement armed occupation. The basic spirit of the military resolution is the separation of military and civilians, but now the governors of the provinces of the Kuomintang government are all filled by active military personnel.

The review of the draft constitution was not completed in Chongqing, and the Communist Party representatives immediately made a full reservation statement. After arriving in Nanjing, the government authorities shelved it until now and never discussed it again. The agreement on the National Assembly issue was a final compromise during the Political Consultative Conference. The Kuomintang authorities guaranteed that they would not convene a divisive National Assembly unilaterally organized by one party, and guaranteed to pass the draft constitution completed by the Political Consultative Conference. Other parties were allowed to reserve representative quotas in regional and occupational representatives among the representatives unilaterally organized by one party for ten years, and the number of party representatives and liberated area representatives must be increased. Only such a National Assembly, which can be attended after the civil war is completely stopped, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have been implemented, the people's freedom rights have been guaranteed, and the government has been reorganized, can be called a united National Assembly attended by all parties.

The so-called National Assembly that is now opening not only violates the above-mentioned resolutions and their spirit, but even the date of the meeting or postponement is determined by a one-party government, and the number of representatives is determined by a one-party government. According to the number announced on the morning of November 15, it has reached 1,580, which has encroached on the 410 representatives of other parties in the original agreement of 2,050 people, especially the quota of 200 representatives in the liberated areas, as many as 140 people. It can be seen that this National Assembly is a divisive National Assembly unilaterally organized by one party from beginning to end. The so-called leaving vacancies waiting for the CCP to participate is both a destruction of the PCC and a complete deception. In fact, it just wants to deceive other parties besides the CCP to participate in order to embellish the face of the Kuomintang authorities' personal dictatorship. Therefore, in the Nanjing talks in January, through the hard work of third-party people, the CCP has repeatedly proposed that the form of the talks can be flexible, but it must be done in accordance with the resolutions and procedures of the PCC, but they were rejected by the government authorities. The closer the date of the one-party National Assembly, the more we advocate immediately stopping the one-party National Assembly so that the military three-person meeting, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group, and the Constitution Draft Review Committee can be opened simultaneously.

In accordance with the truce agreement, the troop reduction plan and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the current military and political issues should be resolved separately and implemented immediately. Then, in a peaceful environment, a united National Assembly attended by all parties can be convened calmly. However, the government, anxious to embellish the dictatorship, does not consider this at all. The one-party National Assembly that is now opening not only makes the recent propositions of the CCP and the third party in the talks impossible, but also finally destroys all resolutions and the truce agreement and the troop reduction plan since the Political Consultative Conference, cuts off the road of peaceful talks since the Political Consultative Conference, and at the same time quickly and thoroughly exposes the deceptive nature of the government authorities' "ceasefire order" on November 8. This one-party National Assembly also wants to pass the so-called "constitution" to "legalize" the dictatorship and "legalize" the ceasefire. If this continues, the Chinese people will surely fall into a deep abyss of suffering. We Chinese Communists firmly do not recognize this National Assembly. The door to peace talks has been closed by the Kuomintang government authorities. We have no need to consider all the tricks that will be played in the one-party National Assembly, or even the reorganization of the government. Participating in this National Assembly and acknowledging these tricks will inevitably overturn the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and destroy the track of peace, democracy, unity, and unification since the Political Consultative Conference. There is no middle ground. The bloody battles to attack the liberated areas are in full swing, and the US government's policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war remains unchanged. False peace and false democracy can never deceive people. We Chinese Communists are willing to fight to the end for true peace and true democracy with the Chinese people and all parties that are truly working for democracy.

### To Withdraw to Yan'an in Two or Three Days

Dong Biwu Will Still Remain in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai answered reporters' questions at the press conference on the 16th: 1. The return to Yan'an will be decided in two or three days. More than a dozen people will travel together. When will he come again, he has not considered it yet. The personnel returning to Yan'an this time came because of the past Political Consultative Conference. Dong Biwu will still remain in Nanjing because the office was established at the beginning of the War of Resistance. At the same time, remaining in Nanjing will still maintain contact with the government. The Shanghai office will also still exist. More than a dozen people remain in the Beiping Military Mediation Department under the leadership of Ye Jianying. 2. Whether the liberated areas will convene a people's congress after the National Assembly is convened is not currently under consideration. 3. At present, the government army is launching a tighter attack on Yan'an. Hu Zongnan's troops have mobilized ten brigades and deployed attacks in the south of Yan'an. Ma Hongkui also has five brigades from the west of the Yellow River to the east of the Yellow River. The day after the government issued the ceasefire order, fourteen planes circled over Yan'an, that is, when the military talks were conducted with Special Envoy Marshall and others, two planes also passed over Yan'an. This actually shows that the government still wants to use military action to threaten the Communist Party to participate in the National Assembly, but the Communist Party will never give in. The next action of the government may be to carry out a tentative military offensive action towards Yan'an. I can predict that the government is determined to write to the Yan'an area. This means that the government not only produced a National Assembly that was convened and organized unilaterally by one party, but also prepared to use the offensive in the Yan'an area to block future discussions. The government uses 66% of its military strength in the liberated areas, which is a situation of national offensive. In the Subei area, the government is attacking Yancheng and deploying LianShui and Liyang to continue the offensive behind Yantai on the Shandong Peninsula. On the Pinghan Railway, the government army is moving along the line to both sides. There are also military actions in the Andong and Liaobei areas of Northeast China. Actual military actions have never stopped. 4. The submission of the Youth Party list was expected long ago. 5. The Communist Party believes that the third party's suggestion to postpone the National Assembly is an unwise move, and the government may not adopt it. Nominating to the government for questioning means destroying the PCC resolution and spirit first. The four representatives of the Communist Party made a painful statement at the Jiaotong Bank on the 11th, explaining that the intention was to maintain the position of the PCC. If the government can also maintain it, it is very good. Unfortunately, the National Assembly has been convened, which is tantamount to tearing up the PCC resolution. It is regrettable that the Youth Party also tore it up. 6. The Communist Party's attitude in the future: (1) The CCP's future policy has been determined since Japan surrendered, seeking a peaceful, united, and unified China. This attitude will never change; (2) The method needs to be determined based on the development of the objective situation, and it should be discussed back at the moment; (3) In accordance with the spirit of the PCC resolution, the CCP has made great compromises. Many people opposed the country ten years ago. The PCC has made some compromises, such as the draft constitution, the ceasefire agreement, the four promises, the program for peaceful national reconstruction, and the agreements on the government side. (4) Regarding the National Assembly issue, the government hopes to retain the representatives from ten years ago. The CCP believes that the National Assembly only guarantees the principles of amending the constitution, guarantees the passage of the National Assembly, and at the same time, the PCC resolution can implement government reorganization, and then convene the National Assembly. Only this can be called a National Assembly in which all parties unite to participate. (5) This time, it was convened unilaterally by the government. The CCP will never participate. Ten years of civil war before the War of Resistance, eight years of friction after the War of Resistance, and one year of disputes after victory, twenty years have passed. (6) Yan'an welcomes the Central Daily News and the Central News Agency to go, but no one has ever gone. (7) The government's convening of the National Assembly means breaking up, so I want to go back. (8) The CCP will not give up peace talks, and will resume talks on a new basis. (9) If the government wants to continue the offensive, we will of course resolutely resist.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall on the morning of the 16th and expressed his farewell. He also went to the US Ambassador's office on the evening of the 15th to say goodbye. It is said that both Stu and Marshall advised him not to leave Nanjing for the time being.

### Eschew Ease and Luxury, Strive to Avoid Self-Destruction: Chairman Chiang's Admonition to Military Unit Commanders to Labor Together with Soldiers and Share Hardships

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Chairman Chiang yesterday telegraphed all unit commanders nationwide, earnestly and sincerely urging them to eschew extravagance, strive to labor alongside their soldiers, share hardships, and maintain a spirit of perseverance and extraordinary fortitude. The full text is as follows: (Titles Omitted) Reports indicate that commanders stationed in provinces and cities often indulge in wanton feasting and extravagant displays, harboring poison without realizing the harm. They neglect their duty to safeguard the nation, merely increasing their daily pleasures, indulging in banquets and neglecting their soldiers for months. How can they bear the weight of the revolution and rescue our people from fire and water? It must be understood that the way to govern an army lies first and foremost in sharing joys and sorrows, and enduring hardships together. Famous generals of old did not wear fur in winter or use fans in summer, nor did they raise umbrellas in the rain. They did not speak of thirst until the army's well was dug, nor of fatigue until the army's tents were pitched, nor of hunger until the army's stoves were lit. Only in this way could they gain the "hearts of their superiors willing to die for them," and achieve the effects of victorious battles and successful conquests. It is now stipulated that each army commander must, every three months, labor alongside soldiers, share meals, deliver incisive training speeches, and personally inspect barracks two or three times; division commanders, two or three times a month; regimental commanders, three times a week; battalion commanders, two or three times; company commanders, two or three times every three days; and platoon leaders must be close to their soldiers every day. Anyone who deliberately violates this will be charged with dereliction of duty. In this way, superiors and subordinates will trust each other like father and son, and the will of the people will become like a fortress. Commanders at all levels must especially restore a simple and unadorned life, maintain a spirit of perseverance and extraordinary fortitude, cast aside vanity and cultivate integrity. "Worry and toil can revitalize a nation, while ease and luxury can lead to self-destruction." These ancient teachings are clear and should not be surpassed. In addition to dispatching personnel for random inspections, this urgent telegram is hereby issued, urging you to diligently implement these instructions and order your subordinates to comply accordingly.

### One Year Since the Northeast Takeover: Headquarters Releases Information on Transportation Destruction and Restoration Efforts; Communist Forces Continue to Attack, Threatening Changchun

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 15th] Amidst the calls for the National Assembly, the Communist army in the Northeast has disregarded the ceasefire order and launched attacks on the National Army to the north, southwest, and around Changchun. On the morning of the 14th, they destroyed the Sun Bridge on the China Chang Railway. This news has led to widespread belief that the Communist army in the Northeast is planning a large-scale operation to attack the National Army in all directions. In summary, Misha Zi north of Changchun and Shijia Bu south of Changchun on the China Chang Railway have both been attacked. There are even rumors that they intend to destroy the Dong Liao River Railway Bridge, a challenging engineering project on the China Chang Railway. Nong'an County northwest of Changchun and Yangta in Xihuai De County have been occupied. The situation is changing.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 15th] The Communist army is suspected of plotting to threaten the security of Changchun. Vague artillery sounds could be heard in the city last night. However, according to military officials here, such actions are not worth mentioning, and the safety of Changchun is as solid as a rock. Furthermore, the China Chang Railway was repaired on the morning of the 15th, and a northbound train safely arrived in Changchun.

### Test Run on the Pingzhang Railway; It is Reported That Fu Zuoyi Invited a Group of Reporters from Tianjin and Beijing to Zhangjiakou; It is Said That the Mongolian Banner Problem is Not Complicated

[Our Beijing Dispatch, 16th] The Tianjin Beijing Railway Bureau held a test run on the Pingzhang section of the Pingsui Line on the 14th, and specially invited reporters stationed in various places in Tianjin and Beijing to Zhangjiakou. The group returned on the evening of the 16th. Fu Zuoyi, commander of the Twelfth War Zone, hosted the reporter group on the evening of the 15th. He made the following answers to various questions: (1) Fu said: He is still in the process of understanding various issues in the Chahar Province. This stage of understanding can be concluded recently. In the short term, he may go to the capital to attend the National Congress. The reorganization of the Chahar Provincial Government may be concrete before he leaves. (2) Fu believes that the so-called Mongolian Banner issue is not as complicated as the outside world says. If it were as some people say, then he might not be able to enter Zhangjiakou. He believes that everything needs to be treated with sincerity and fairness. Then there will be no problem. (3) Regarding the issue of whether Chahar Province's grain and fur will be subject to unified control in the future, Fu said that he is organizing an economic research committee to invite scholars to participate, consult and decide, and plan how to support and protect local commerce and industry in Chahar Province. There is currently no unified control. Scattered merchants have already been active in Tianjin and Beijing. He hopes that the central government will allocate more funds. The current amount received is still 200 million to promote reconstruction. Fu feels that his subordinates lack talent and is unwilling to bring in personal favors when employing people to avoid unnecessary concerns. The attitude of everyone should be consistent, so it is necessary to train them all. (4) Regarding the attitude towards building Chahar Province, Fu said that he must strictly follow the Three Principles of the People, especially focusing on the Principle of People's Livelihood and the method of equalizing land rights. This is not to cut the high, but to hope to suppress the low. The land rent should be as low as possible. The people said that in Shaanxi, the lowest ratio has reached nine-to-one, which is even lower than the 25% rent reduction. Specific methods will be drafted for reference. Relieving workers is also an important task. (5) Regarding the situation with Outer Mongolia, Fu said that he had posted a notice on the Sui Meng border in the thirty-third year, strongly advocating friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. He did not allow our personnel to approach with weapons and sent back those who entered from Outer Mongolia, so nothing happened. In the future, Chahar Province will be the same. As for the division of the border, the "Naobao" will be used as a marker. (6) Fu opposes the Communist Party's policy of killing people, saying that this policy will never succeed. Finally, he said that Chahar Province had a bumper harvest this year and there was no problem with military food. Fu repeatedly mentioned his experiences in Xiaba over the years and was particularly interested and pleased with the method of producing the lacking materials.

### "Bitter Tea Studio" Traitor Zhou Zuoren Sentenced to Fourteen Years in Prison

Betraying and Siding with the Enemy Should Bear Criminal Responsibility

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The case of the traitor Zhou Zuoren of "Bitter Tea Studio" was sentenced in the Capital High Court on the morning of the 16th. At 10:30 AM, Zhou was escorted from the Laohuqiao Detention Center to the High Court waiting room. At 10:50 AM, Court President Ge Zhiqin, along with judges Ge Zhaotang, Shentu Chen, and prosecutor Wang Wenzun, opened a joint panel in the Dacheng Hall and brought Zhou to court. After briefly inquiring about his name, age, birthplace, and address, the main text of the verdict was read out: "Zhou Zuoren, jointly colluding with enemy countries, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment, deprived of public rights for ten years, and property confiscated except for a reasonable amount of necessary living expenses for family members."

Zhou was wearing a long blue indigo cloth shirt, light yellow socks, and black and yellow woolen shoes. His beard and hair were gray and white, and he wore gold-rimmed glasses. He looked calm after hearing the verdict. The court instructed: If you do not agree, you can apply for review. Then he was escorted back to prison.

The verdict of Zhou's case, the first half narrates the facts of his crime, and the second half is the reason for the verdict. The main points are as follows: The defendant Zhou admitted to holding various false positions, and his argument that he maintained education and resisted enslavement was not enough to cover up his collusion with the main traitors in North China, colluding with each other, and carrying out false orders under the will of the Japanese. The evidence of his behavior in favor of resisting Japan is still accurate, and although the sentence should be reduced according to law, the behavior of betrayal is unforgivable. "According to the fact that the defendant has been teaching in various universities for many years, and countless people in my country have been influenced by him, and he has considerable knowledge, and many people in my country admire him, he occupies a leading position among the masses, and bears the heavy responsibility of education in the highest institutions. He should have the spirit of fearlessness and persevere to the end to support the righteousness of the nation. However, his will was weak, and once he was assassinated, he betrayed midway, surrendered to the false regime and sided with the enemy, facing the enemy with a flattering face, only seeking personal survival and security, regardless of the interests of the country and the nation, and cannot bear criminal responsibility. Taking into account various circumstances, a reduced term of imprisonment of fourteen years should be imposed, and public rights should be deprived for ten years, in order to maintain the law and show fairness."

### Editorial: The Youth Party Participates in the National Assembly

As the National Assembly convenes, many social notables have reported their attendance. Furthermore, the Youth Party has submitted its list of participants in the National Assembly. Its Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, has even issued a written statement on this matter, elaborating on the party's process and reasons for participating in the National Assembly, and concluding that "merit and demerit, right and wrong, vary from person to person; everything can only be judged impartially by contemporary worthies and future historians." This candid demeanor of a politician is truly worthy of praise from the people of the country. The convening of the National Assembly was originally intended to establish a foundation for the peace and unity of China, as well as for democratic construction, and to formulate a fundamental law for the nation. The success of this historically significant meeting depends entirely on whether the various parties and non-affiliated individuals in the country demonstrate sincere cooperation towards it. The government, in convening the National Assembly, has spared no effort to be extremely tolerant and accommodating, originally hoping that all parties, factions, and non-affiliated individuals could participate together, discuss national affairs, and formulate a perfect constitution for the long-term peace and stability of the country. Therefore, it has tried its best to accommodate all opinions, not hesitating to postpone it repeatedly. The National Assembly, originally scheduled to convene on the birthday of the Founding Father, was ultimately extended by three days due to the efforts of mediators. This shows that the government's tolerance for the country has reached its peak. Three days later, on the day of the National Assembly's opening, we saw the attendance of social notables and the submission of the Youth Party's list, which immediately gave us a sense of infinite brightness for the future of the overall situation.

Why do we say this? The current government, with the Kuomintang in power, adheres to the Three Principles of the People of the revolution and originally hoped to implement constitutional government and return power to the people as soon as possible. The convening of the National Assembly is the initial stage of implementing constitutional government, hoping to promulgate it throughout the country after the constitution is formulated, thereby leading the country into the regular track of constitutional government. For the sake of peaceful unification and democratic construction, the government has repeatedly respected the opinions of all forces and shown extreme tolerance. All these facts are known to the people of the country. If all parties and factions have the sincerity of peaceful unification and democratic construction, they should unanimously participate in the National Assembly and jointly plan national affairs. As the spokesperson of the Youth Party said: "We believe that since the ceasefire has been implemented, only unanimous participation in the National Assembly can maintain the hope of continued peace; only unanimous participation in the National Assembly can promote national unity... Only by passing the draft constitution revised by the Political Consultative Conference in this National Assembly and obtaining unanimous support from the entire country can democracy be effectively guaranteed." All these words are enough to represent the general will of the people of the country. Since the National Assembly has been repeatedly postponed at the request of all parties, the National Assembly, which has been postponed, should naturally be attended by all parties. The people of the whole country have high hopes for the National Assembly, so refusing to participate in the National Assembly is tantamount to isolating oneself from the people of the country; future historians will surely have a fair argument. Therefore, due to the postponed convening of the National Assembly, whether or not all parties participate can show whether all parties have the sincerity for peaceful unification and democratic construction, and whether they put the interests of the people first; thus, the political situation, which has been confusing for a year, has turned towards a bright trend.

Therefore, we feel regret when we read the statement of the Chinese Communist Party in the newspaper. The convening of the National Assembly was originally intended to melt all parties and factions into one furnace; to achieve this goal, all parties and factions must put the interests of the people first, abandon prejudices, and participate together. This is why the government has repeatedly tolerated, and this is why the National Assembly has been repeatedly postponed. Now that the National Assembly has opened, all parties and factions should unite to participate and jointly plan national affairs. If the National Assembly has a "split" phenomenon, then those who create this situation are the CCP and other people who refuse to participate, which is not only a destructive act against the National Assembly, but also a malicious act that destroys the interests of the entire nation. The people need stability, and the country needs construction, so they have high expectations for the National Assembly. Refusing to participate in the National Assembly is tantamount to isolating oneself from the people of the country; future history will surely have a fair judgment.

Therefore, for those people who have not yet attended the National Assembly and those parties that have not yet submitted their lists, we hope that they can participate as soon as possible. This is because all parties have repeatedly expressed their opinions on the convening of the National Assembly, and to respect these opinions, the National Assembly has been postponed repeatedly. Now that the National Assembly has opened, there should be no reason not to participate. Since the Youth Party has submitted its list, then the Democratic Socialist Party and other people who belong to the so-called "third party" have worked hard for national affairs, and at this moment they should confirm the trend of history, submit their lists, and participate in the National Assembly together. We sincerely hope that the convening of this National Assembly can lay the foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the country and enter the regular track of constitutional government; then a new China of the Three Principles of the People, which is of the people, by the people, and for the people, and is prosperous and happy, can be established soon!

### Emphasis on Rectifying the Source; Second Phase of Suppression in Yangcheng District; Bandit Leader Liu Gengui Killed on the Changtai Border

[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] Major General Ma Shigong, Commander of the Parachute Corps stationed in Suzhou, Commander of the Yangcheng District Suppression Command, and Commander of the Suzhou City Defense Command, received reporters from this newspaper on the afternoon of the 16th. In his statement, he briefly stated that in addition to being responsible for the Suzhou city defense and Yangcheng District suppression work, the headquarters is also responsible for consolidating the security of the Jinghu Line and strengthening the external defense of Shanghai. At the beginning of the winter defense and the National Assembly, in order to prevent bandits from disturbing the area, orders have been given to begin the second phase of suppression. The focus is on clarifying local administration, establishing land and water security, improving regional intelligence, and implementing mutual assistance and joint defense systems. It also includes handling the work of recruiting scattered bandits and turning them into new people through enlightenment, in order to rectify the source and achieve lasting peace, and establish a foundation for the long-term peace and stability of Jiangnan. Specifically, it can be divided into four aspects: (1) Regarding the suppression situation, banditry in various counties has been quelled. In October, a total of 558 bandits were captured, 128 surrendered and reformed, 2 light machine guns, 14 rifles, and 12 pistols were seized. The "New Fourth Army" organization was cracked down on, including Jin Baojiu, the head of the Changshu Zhitang Communications Station, and Wu Shouying, the commander of the Luodian pseudo-Jiangnan Self-Defense Army. Other hidden bandits, such as Li Gancai from Kunshan, Tao Yunsheng from Changshu Liancheng, Zhu Kunyou from Meili, and Lu Jiakang from Zhitang, were also arrested by the suppression forces. Therefore, the bandit forces have been weakened and are approaching their end. The period of clearing is not far away. (2) Maintaining public security: In addition to all routine measures, the counties under its jurisdiction are ordered to strengthen winter defense and implement amnesty to achieve the primary goal of current public security. (3) Rectifying discipline: Since the beginning of the suppression, attention has been paid to the conduct and integrity of personnel, and no harm to the local area, collusion with the people, or extortion is allowed. Emphasis is also placed on the integration of the party, government, and military, with mutual supervision. (4) Training the Self-Defense Force: Cadres are assigned to the counties under the jurisdiction to train the Self-Defense Force to strengthen self-defense capabilities. Currently, 385 people in Suzhou have started training, and the first phase in Changshu has completed 180 people, with the second phase currently in training. Other counties, such as Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, have also organized and trained them one after another and will soon complete a strong local armed force.

[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] Liu Genbao and Liu Gengui, two bandits from the "New Fourth Army" who disrupted the towns of Zhitang, Shaxi, and Laozha on the border of Changshu and Taicang, the pseudo-Taicang County Chief, the Security Brigade Commander, and the Director of the Autonomous Committee, were constantly besieged by the suppression forces of Changtai County. Most of the main forces dispersed. Liu Genbao sneaked into northern Jiangsu, while Liu Gengui led the remnants to wander around. On the 12th, he encountered a parachuting sweep force in Zhizhuang. A fierce battle broke out. Liu Gengui was injured and threw himself into the river and died. The remaining party fled in all directions. A bandit Wang Chuanlin was captured alive and a short gun, many hand grenades, maps, documents, and other items were seized. All the personal witnesses were escorted to the Yangcheng Command in Suzhou on the 16th for interrogation.

### Seawall Collapses Another Two Meters; Haining Residents Extremely Alarmed

[Report from Haining, This Newspaper] The "Jue" numbered seawall outside the South Gate of this county has developed cracks due to years of disrepair. On the evening of the 12th, it suddenly collapsed by as much as seven meters. The reporter visited the relevant authorities to inquire about the rescue situation. It was reported that the Seawall Engineering Bureau has transported more than 1,500 bundles of strip wood and two sets of pile frames from Babao, but the seawall workers have not been fully recruited and are still rushing to prepare. The rescue work has not yet begun. It is also reported that all the machinery and materials of the Seawall Engineering Bureau are difficult to transport, and it does not want to transport them to Ning for rescue, causing extreme panic among the people of Ningcheng. The night tides have been particularly high in recent days, and the breach is flooded with seawater, with loud rumbling noises constantly heard. On the evening of the 14th, the "Jue" numbered seawall was washed away another two meters at both ends. Now, the dangerous and cracked sections of the seawall from Dou Pantou have reached a length of 150 meters. If the rescue project is delayed further, once the entire seawall collapses, Ningcheng will be completely turned into a swamp. The county government and the county council have re-telegraphed the provincial authorities, urging them to rescue quickly to save the dangerous situation.

[Report from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] The "Jue" numbered seawall in Zhejiang Province has recently collapsed again.

Currently, work is underway to excavate the seawall foot and build a new concrete seawall, measuring 100 city feet in length. The earth embankment at Chen Tanggang and other collapsed parts will also be started. The revetment project in Hangzhou will be completed soon, and the seawall project in Xiaoshan and other places on the south bank is also in progress.

[Report from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 16th] Chairman Shen of Zhejiang Province inspected the seawalls in Sibao and other places in Hangzhou on the 16th and instructed the revetment project.

### Rugao Organizes Propaganda Team; Expands Political Propaganda

[Report from Rugao, This Newspaper] In the Subei Pacification District, the government has repeatedly issued instructions on "three points of military affairs, seven points of politics." The local garrison authorities and county government agencies have carefully followed them. In order to expand political propaganda, a propaganda team has been jointly organized to expand propaganda during the celebration of the Premier's birthday and the National Congress. In addition, students from the detention training center will go deep into the countryside to conduct door-to-door propaganda, hoping to achieve practical results.

### Two Bandits Captured in Lumu; Committed Crimes in Shanghai

[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper] Bandits Feng Laowu, Wang Genrong, etc., successively robbed the homes of Cao Wantong and Cao Yazi, as well as the General Administration Hall of Suizhou Qimenwai Huajinggang, etc., in Suzhou, Lumu, and Nan Shen this spring. They also colluded with others in Shanghai between June and July this year to rob a brothel on Simalu, a cloth store on Laborbert Road, and a hardware store on Caojiabo Wu Yi Chang, and the Hongkou Fish Market, etc., committing numerous crimes. Under the strict dominance of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, four accomplices, Chen Jiaxi, Liu Zhaochen, Liu Yudong, and Yu, were detained, and Feng was wanted with a golden warrant. As a result, the two bandits Feng and Wang could not survive in Shanghai, and they escaped from the net a month ago and came to Suzhou, hiding in Lutang Township, Lumu District. They actively colluded with gangsters in the city, trying to stir up trouble in Suzhou again. Fortunately, someone secretly reported to the Lumu Self-Defense Team stationed there. The team sent personnel to meet with the local security chiefs, pretending to be checking household registrations, and caught the two bandits Feng and Wang by surprise. According to their confessions, they had already colluded with two accomplices in the city, Liu Jinshan and Shen Shaoqing, who were hiding at No. 14 Guanku Lane and No. 89 Gushi Lane respectively, waiting for an opportunity to stir up trouble. Personnel were dispatched to escort the two bandits to the city, where they cooperated with the First Police Station in charge to detain the two bandits Liu and Shen one after another, and directly escort them to the Suzhou City Defense Command for strict punishment according to law.

### Hangzhou Municipal Government to Expand Organization

The Municipal Government has already requested instructions from the Provincial Government and expects to implement the new regulations in January next year. According to Mayor Zhou's words to reporters: Expanding the organization is not to waste public funds, but to recruit talents, so as to achieve the ideal of an international city as soon as possible.

### Five Principles Provided by the Suzhou Branch of the Industrial Association; Please Government to Consider Increasing or Decreasing Import Duties

[Report from Wuxi, This Newspaper] The Jiangsu Branch of the China Industrial Association has sent a telegram to the central authorities concerned to request protective tariffs in order to protect rights and interests and assist in construction. It requests the authorities to consider the country's manufacturing capacity and supply and demand situation and increase or decrease import tariff rates, providing five principles:

(1) Luxury goods should be taxed. (2) Goods that can be manufactured in the country must be subject to import tariffs. (3) Finished products should be heavily taxed, while semi-finished products or raw materials should be lightly taxed or exempted. For example, cars, pigments, paints, leather, rubber products, etc. should be heavily taxed when imported, but car parts, pigment semi-finished products, paint raw materials, tanning agents, raw rubber, etc. should be taxed reduced to assist the country's weak industry. (4) Agricultural, industrial, and mining machinery, ships, military vehicles, and transportation tools imported for non-commercial purposes should be exempted from taxes to show encouragement. (5) Instruments and medicines needed by educational and research institutions, and small-scale experimental machines, should be exempted from taxes.

### Dozens of Lake Bandits Intercept Dongting Dongshan Liner

[Report from Suzhou, This Newspaper] The Dongting Dongshan liner "Traveler" left Shan at 7:30 am on the 14th, carrying more than 100 passengers to Suzhou. When it sailed to Bainongkou near Ducun, five or six bandit ships suddenly appeared, with light and heavy machine guns mounted on the bows. They approached the ship in a four-sided encirclement. About thirty or forty bandits, all armed with long and short guns, boarded the ship in a swarm and monitored the actions of the drivers, crew, and passengers, forcing them to sail towards South Taihu Lake. When it sailed to the center of South Taihu Lake, about three miles away from Ducun, they ordered it to stop and arbitrarily looted. The overcoats and better clothes of the male and female passengers on the ship were stripped off, and no one on the ship was spared. After more than an hour, the bandits divided the loot into their small boats and roared away. The Suzhou Police Department is now sending officers to investigate and arrest them.

### Canal Shipping; Direct to Huaiyin; Security Consolidated, Restoration Recently

[Report from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper] Since the national army recovered Huaiyin, the Zhenjiang Office of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau has been urging the resumption of navigation on the Zhenqing Line. The Zhonghua Lv Yun Society dispatched a ship for a trial voyage on October 23. However, due to the fact that the security situation in Huangpu and between the eight lines above Baoying has not been consolidated, and navigation is quite threatened, the shipping line was temporarily shortened to Baoying starting on October 31. Now that the number of national troops stationed along the canal has increased and the security situation has improved, the Navigation Administration Bureau has again ordered the shipping bureaus to resume navigation. It is reported that four ships, Huafu, Ronghua, Maoli, and Run Dong, dispatched by the Zhonghua Lv Yun Society, and four ships, Xiangshan, Feilv, and Shengli Feichou, dispatched by the Datong Tongyun Company and the Zhenjiang Branch of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, resumed navigation on October 13 and towed relief supplies from the Su Ning Branch to Qing for relief. The passenger fare is 56 yuan per person per kilometer, from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin is 10,700 yuan, from Zhenjiang to Huaian is 9,900 yuan, from Zhenjiang to Baoying is 7,800 yuan, from Zhenjiang to Gaoyou is 6,300 yuan, and the freight per ton is five and a half times the passenger fare. It is reported that the shipping companies still comply with the orders of the Navigation Administration Bureau to sell tickets to refugees holding return certificates at 20% off the prescribed fare to show preferential treatment.

### Shanghai County Southwest Township; Rice Rent Standard Agreed

[Report from Minhang, This Newspaper] Regarding the rice rent issue in the southwest townships of Shanghai County, Speaker Huang of the County Council, Deputy Speaker Wang, and gentry Li Hengzhai, Gu Kaoxiang, and more than ten representatives from the County Party Department and the County Farmers' Association jointly convened a meeting yesterday. Considering this year's bumper harvest of rice grains, it was decided that each mu would actually receive two dan of brown rice, with half for the landlord and half for the tenant. The landlord should get one dan, and the 25% rent reduction should be implemented, and 7.5 sheng should be collected. Later, at the request of the representative of the County Party Department, considering that the cost of farmers is high and their lives are difficult, it was requested to reduce the rent again. Finally, it was decided that each mu would be charged with 7 dou of brown rice or 6 dou and 3 sheng of white rice, with 160 city catties as the standard. One dou should be added to the actual rent, and 3 dou of brown rice should be added to the board rent per dan, starting from today. The first two limits are 20 days each, 3 dou should be added beyond the first limit, and 2 dou should be added beyond the second limit.

### A Unique Occupation; Yang Jiliang Specializes in Accusing Traitors; Investigation Reveals All False Accusations; Has Been Detained

[Report from Wuxi, This Newspaper] Before the Anti-Japanese War in Xiyi, there was a group of idlers who secretly used the organizations of "Old Eight Party" and "New Eight Party" to specialize in reporting cases of people violating laws and police regulations. Beforehand, they would contact the parties involved and extort huge sums of money. If they did not get what they wanted, they would come out and report, causing a storm in the city and making everyone grit their teeth. Later, it was detected by the officialdom and severely arrested, and this trend disappeared. During the occupation, a small number of party members of the New and Old Eight Parties changed careers or died. After the victory, the affairs of eliminating traitors arose one after another. At first, it was chaotic, so that people from all walks of life were in danger. After the cases of traitors were clearly ordered to be handled by the judiciary, the society began to be quiet. Recently, the Jiangsu Higher Court has repeatedly received reports from Yang Jiliang, also known as Yang Zongying and Yang Jianying, who resides at No. 9 Tianji Bang in Wuxi City, accusing a large number of traitors. For example, Zhang Zhitong was accused of being the pseudo-President of the Legislative Yuan, Xu Juncai was accused of being the pseudo-Director of the Education Department, and Zhang Sheng was accused of being a pseudo-female detective. After receiving the report, the Higher Court ordered the Xiyi Court to secretly detain them. After receiving the order, Chief Ma of this county conducted a strict investigation. As a result, it was found that Zhang Zhitong and Xu Juncai were both rice merchants, and Ms. Zhang Sheng is currently a senator of the Provisional Council and returned from the rear. Chief Ma arrested Yang Jiliang for interrogation. The suspect firmly denied using the names Yang Zongying and Yang Jianying and ordered him to be detained for verification. Before Yang Jiliang was detained, the bailiff of the court delivered the summons of Yang Zongying. Because Yang Jiliang refused to accept it, he posted the summons on his gate, a total of seven or eight times, which set a record for this county. It is said that Yang Jiliang was originally a businessman. Because his speculation failed, he had a fantasy and specialized in reporting traitors, defrauding property, and making a living. This kind of occupation is also unique.

### Jiangyin Curfew

### Rattle Pig Discovered in Zhenjiang Mountain Area

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] A type of wild boar, of varying sizes, has recently been discovered in the mountains of Xilin Township, Shangdang District, in this county. A local hunter captured one, which had a small head and a pointed snout, with bright eyes and two very sharp lower teeth protruding from its mouth by about an inch. Its body was covered in black hair interspersed with stiff bristles like a hedgehog, ranging in length from five inches to a foot. They resemble hairpins used by women. When attacked, they rush around with great force, their bristles standing on end, making a rattling sound. According to those in the know, this is a "rattle pig."

### Flying Thief Li San Interrogated: Court Hearing Held Twice in One Day

[Our Jinan Dispatch] The flying thief Li Shengwu, (aka Swallow Li San), whose exploits shocked Jinan, was brought to the local court. In the morning of the 11th a court hearing was held for questioning. Suspects Jia Jinbang, Hao Bohong, Han Xiuqing, Yang Yide, etc., were also questioned. According to Li, the Xue Liwen case in Dongxiaowangfu, and the robbery cases in the silver shops, etc., in this city, were all his work. The prosecutor Wu Tingxian, who is handling the case, argued that, apart from the Xue Liwen murder case in Jinan, there were no other cases of injury. When he questioned the other suspects, they all defended themselves, claiming to have only a superficial relationship with Li and were ignorant of the details. Due to time constraints, the interrogation was temporarily adjourned. Prosecutor Wu considered that Li's case had spread throughout Jinan, known to all, young and old, and the news spread was not without inaccuracies. Although Li had already confessed, there were still some ambiguities. For the sake of prudence, he held another court hearing at 2:00 PM, summoning Zhang Chunting, who arrested Li, and Xue Liwen, the victim's family, for questioning. Xue did not appear due to other business. After the court session, Li Xinlu, another suspect, was found to be suspicious, because he often went to Li's house to smoke opium and stay overnight. The prosecutor believes that Li Xinlu's relationship with Li was intimate, and that Li Xinlu was unlikely to be indifferent to Li's whereabouts. However, Li Xinlu firmly denied the accusations, so he was temporarily detained. Two court hearings were held in one day, with very good results. According to Prosecutor Wu, the case is being actively investigated. Because the general public attaches great importance to it, he decided to file a lawsuit in the short term. It is said that another court hearing will be held in the next few days for further investigation.

### Urgently Stop Street Firecrackers

Recently, in bustling areas on the western side of Shanghai, there are often groups of rogue youths, three or five in number, randomly throwing firecrackers, sounding like gunshots, one after another. Upon hearing them, pedestrians are startled and fearful, even suspecting burglar alarms. Especially the elderly, weak, women, and children are frightened and lose their composure. These youths then clap and laugh! They are even more prone to harassing young women! Currently, winter defense is urgent, and safety is paramount. These explosive sounds are most likely to cause misunderstandings. It is hoped that those maintaining local security will take action to stop them, preventing problems before they occur. The citizens will be very grateful! (Zhu Xianlin, Park Police) (Editor's note: Mr. Jin Lianzhi, a reader of our newspaper, has also made the same statement, so it will not be published again.)

### Please Clear the Mud on the Side of the Road Quickly

Near the intersection of Bintang Road and Jiaozhou Road, there is a stinky ditch. Two weeks ago, the Public Works Bureau sent workers to dredge it, and the mud from the river was placed on the side of the road. At that time, the street was filled with a foul odor and slippery mud, making it difficult to walk. We all thought that once it dried, it would be carted away. But to this day, the mud is still halfway across the road, and in addition, the neighbors have dumped garbage on it, making it smell even worse than before. It is hoped that the authorities in charge, for the sake of the health of the residents in the western part of Shanghai, will send someone to clean it up quickly so that traffic and hygiene are not hindered. (Chen Zhihong)

### Please Issue Education Subsidies Sooner

I am a low-level businessman. For economic reasons and to prevent my daughter from dropping out of school, I had her take the entrance exam for the municipal kindergarten teacher training school, and she was fortunate enough to be admitted. The Municipal Bureau of Education, in order to reduce the burden on parents, issues students with a monthly food subsidy based on the cost of living index, which makes poor parents extremely grateful. However, it is now mid-November, and the subsidies for September and October have not yet been received. I don't know if the Bureau of Education has not issued them, or if the school has received them but not distributed them. Therefore, I have to ask the education community to show sympathy and live up to the original intention. (Wang Zhengming)

### Homeless Women and Children Need Relief

There are dozens of women and children resembling refugees gathered in the open space at the Sichuan Road Bridge in this city, and this has been the case for over a month. No one has asked about them, and no one has provided relief. As the severe winter is approaching, they are curled up there, exposed to the wind and dew, which is truly unbearable. The appearance of the city aside, even human feelings and morality are not aligned. It is proposed to use your newspaper to raise awareness and call for the attention of relevant authorities or charitable organizations to provide relief so that these helpless women and children can avoid freezing to death. (Xiang Boyan)

### Shanghai-Caohejing Traffic Still Maintained

Regarding the letter from Mr. Chen Lianhu and others stating that the Caohejing bus line has been suspended, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities stating: "The Xiang Sheng Transportation Company applied to this Bureau in March of last year to operate Longhua tourist buses and special buses to benefit tourists during the Longhua Xiangxun festival. In April of this year, the Bureau ordered the company to come to the Bureau to sign a contract to comply with the rules. However, the company has not complied, so it has been suspended. Now, in order to temporarily maintain Shanghai-Caohejing line, the Bureau decided that beginning on the 18th of this month, the Preparatory Committee of the Public Transportation Company will dispatch four buses from Laoximen, via Fuxing Road, Baoqing Road, Hengshan Road, Wanping Road, and Jinyi Road, to Longhua. The buses will then return via Shiji Road and Xietu Road to Caohejing Town. The Bureau has publicly solicited bids for this route, and several transportation companies have applied. In the future, when the municipal government makes a decision and hands over the route to a business for operation, the Bureau's temporary buses will be discontinued. As for the news that the Bureau forced the company to stop operating because it could not collect road maintenance fees and other fees, it is a misunderstanding. These fees are the company's obligation to the municipal government. Any transportation company operating a business passenger car on a designated route in the city must pay them, not only Xiang Sheng Transportation Company. 'Hereby conveyed.'"

### Forwarded Mail

To Mr. Li Guohua: Recently, Mr. Tao Yishan, Director of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command, delivered a letter to be forwarded to you, stating: "Your letter of October 19 has been received with respect. Regarding the cases of traitors, the central government has stipulated that they should be handled by the High Court. If you have concrete evidence of a certain gentleman's crimes of collaborating with the enemy, please report it directly to the court." Hereby conveyed.

### Limiting the Use of the Veto: Decision to be Discussed by the Five Powers; Both the US and the Soviet Union Oppose Amending the UN Charter

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin invited the delegations of the five major powers of the UN General Assembly last night to directly discuss the veto issue. China, the US, and France immediately accepted, and the Soviet Union also expressed agreement. The discussion will likely take place next Monday. Well-informed sources said that France will propose to the Political and Security Committee of the UN General Assembly today to suspend the debate on the veto issue and allow the five powers to discuss whether to limit the use of the veto.

[Reuters, New York, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin has sent letters to the chief representatives of China, the US, and the Soviet Union at the UN General Assembly, suggesting that a meeting of the five major powers be convened to discuss the veto issue. The purpose of the five-power consultation is to draft a "code of conduct" stipulating the circumstances under which the five powers may or may not exercise the veto. Previously, British and American representatives suggested that the five powers hold informal talks to discuss various issues of the United Nations, but this was not approved by the Soviet representative. However, Soviet representative Gromyko today told some representatives that he was willing to support holding five-power talks to discuss the veto issue. The various suggestions put forward by the five powers for discussion include: (1) The United Kingdom's request to clearly define the definitions of "situation" and "dispute" that threaten peace. If it is a dispute, then one of the five powers, if it is a party to the dispute, must not have the right to vote. (2) The United States suggests that the five powers draft a list of cases in which the veto can be used. (3) The French proposal would allow a power unwilling to obstruct the actions of the Security Council to abstain from voting, thus automatically preventing it from exercising the veto.

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] According to the British delegation, the veto provision in the UN Charter was originally the idea of ââUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, we have repeatedly defended the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, being more courageous than successful, and we cannot help but feel guilty. We acknowledge this. Small countries such as Australia, Cuba, and the Netherlands are using this as an excuse to try to amend the Charter, which is also not what we want. If this matter evolves into a struggle between small countries and big countries, we would rather the UN General Assembly close as soon as possible. The US position has been explained by Senator Connally in the Political and Security Committee with nine opinions. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky also said that the Soviet Union has always opposed amending the Charter and undermining the UN mechanism. The US representative agreed, saying that amending the UN Charter could lead to the collapse of the UN mechanism. Vyshinsky also said that those who attempt to amend the Charter are actually adopting a strategy of alienating the enemy and defeating them one by one. However, this strategy of alienating the great powers will not succeed. The Soviet Union is committed to building peace through cooperation based on the solidarity of the great powers. Therefore, it believes that the proposals of small countries such as Cuba, Australia, and the Philippines are a big mistake.

### Foreign Ministers' Meeting Continues; Debate on the Issue of Trieste; France Drafts New Plan Pending Consultation; Poland and Czechoslovakia Request to Participate in Discussions on the German Issue

[Reuters, New York, 16th] The Foreign Ministers' Meeting is scheduled to continue debating the Trieste issue at 9:00 PM today (5:00 AM on the 17th Shanghai time). The discussion will be based on the new plan drafted by French representative Mauviel. Most of the agreements that have been reached yesterday have been included in this new plan. However, the following two principles remain unresolved: (1) Should the final power belong to the governor of the free zone or to the government? (2) Should the governor's authority over the police continue to exist after the governor is appointed until the government establishes representative institutions? Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recognition that the governor should have the right to decide what constitutes a state of emergency is a major concession. Molotov said yesterday that this concession by the Soviet Union could break the deadlock.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland announced today that they have asked the Foreign Ministers' Meeting to allow them to participate in discussions on the German issue and any matters related to their interests.

### Italy and Yugoslavia to Hold Direct Negotiations; Britain Expresses Approval in Reply

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 15th] Regarding the negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia on the issue of Venezia Giulia, the Italian government recently left a note to the British and American governments. The American reply was submitted to the Italian government a few days ago. The British reply was also delivered to Italian Foreign Minister Nani today through the British chargÃ© d'affaires in Italy, stating that the British government is deeply sympathetic to the direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia to reach an agreement, which will help promote world stability and international cooperation.

### Britain and the United States Suggest Investigation of Conflicts on the Greek-Albanian Border

The Soviet Union Actually Expresses Dissent

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Regarding the border conflict between Greece and Yugoslavia, the British government has not received an official report on the matter, so it will not comment. However, the British and the United States suggested to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference that an international committee of neutral nature be organized to go to the scene to investigate the truth of the border conflict, but the Soviet representative actually expressed dissent, which is regrettable.

### The United States Reaffirms Moral Condemnation of the Franco Regime

[Agence France-Presse, Albania Capital, 15th] It is learned that the Albanian government has decided to recognize the Spanish Republican government.

No Need to Study Further! (Reprinted from an American Magazine)

### The Soviet Union Has Abused the Veto Power Nine Times

[United Press, Lake Success, 15th] The representatives of the Security Council have different opinions on how many times the veto has been used, but they unanimously believe that the Soviet Union has used it the most. Its record is as follows:

"Soviet Union" - once in the Lebanon and Syria case, four times in the Spanish case (the Soviet Union said that these four times should be counted as one); once against the investigation of the Greek border conflict, three times against the applications of Ireland, Portugal, and Transjordan to join the UN. "France" - once in the Spanish case. "Britain and the United States" - It is debatable whether Britain and the United States' opposition to the applications of Albania and Mongolia to join the UN counts as a veto. The British and Americans claim that the case was not supported by a majority, so the opposition of Britain and the United States is not a veto.

### The United Nations Establishes a Subcommittee to Depart for Site Survey

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The UN Headquarters Committee met yesterday and immediately appointed an 18-member special subcommittee to expedite the selection of a permanent headquarters. The subcommittee will visit the following four locations: (1) the former site of the New York World's Fair (where this session of the UN General Assembly is being held); (2) the Philadelphia wasteland; (3) the Boston Green Mountain area; (4) the San Francisco Bay area. The headquarters must be acquired without cost or at a reasonable price.

### British House of Commons to Discuss Foreign Policy Tomorrow; Prime Minister Will Attend and Defend; American Newspapers Observe That Bevin May Change His Style

[United Press, London, 16th] Since the Speaker of the House of Commons announced that the amendment proposed by the Labor Party "rebel" members to the King's speech at the opening of Parliament could be submitted for discussion, more than 50 "rebel" members have drafted a plan to publicly debate "Bevinism" on Monday. The "rebel" members are now demanding that Britain adopt a "socialist" foreign policy to avoid the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States that will "inevitably" arise under the current British foreign policy. Most parliamentary observers believe that the way in which members oppose Bevin's policies will be limited to debate. If it is put to a vote, it will be defeated by conservatives and "loyal" supporters of the government.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] British Prime Minister Attlee spoke by long distance telephone today with Foreign Secretary Bevin in New York to discuss the "rebellion" of 73 Labor Party members. When the House of Commons held a meeting this morning, some Labor Party members who disagreed with the government decided to request a discussion on foreign policy on the 18th of this month. Although they claimed that this move did not involve a vote of confidence, reliable sources said that Prime Minister Attlee gave the Foreign Secretary every convenience in his telephone conversation with Bevin today so that he could come to London and personally defend the foreign policy adopted by Britain. It is said that Foreign Secretary Bevin only replied that it was indispensable for him to stay in New York and could only ask the Prime Minister to defend him on his behalf.

[Reuters, New York, 15th] Famous current affairs analyst Hirsch broadcast a commentary on the British Labor Party members opposing Bevin's foreign policy, saying that the young "rebel" members wanted to oust Bevin and replace him with Dalton, believing that Dalton could detach Britain's economy from the United States and then seek a compromise with the Soviet Union. Bevin's ouster is unlikely to become a reality, but it is likely that Bevin will change his style to cater to their wishes. The New York Times commented that this "rebellion" took place at a time when the British and American governments were in delicate negotiations with the Soviet Union, which was unfavorable to Bevin and Byrnes, because the success of the negotiations with the Soviet Union depended on the consistency of British and American policies.

### Jewish Terrorists Continue Nerve Warfare Tactics

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 15th] Jewish terrorists continued their nerve warfare, calling a newspaper here today to inform them that government offices, the Palestine Broadcasting Station, and the local magistrate's office had been planted with bombs, and told them to pay special attention to things that seemed harmless. After a search, a small package was found in the local magistrate's office. The police dared not act rashly and asked the engineers to inspect it. The Stern Gang, a Jewish terrorist group, posted slogans in the streets today, urging Jewish residents to isolate Jewish leaders who had succumbed to the British.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 15th] Reliable Arab sources said today that when the British-Arab negotiations in London resume next month, the Arabs, even if they do not send a delegation, will at least attend as observers.

### Greece's Border with Neighboring Countries Presents an Undeclared State of War; Rioters Flee into Yugoslavia After the Attack

[This newspaper's special correspondent in London, 16th] The London Foreign Office is paying close attention to the border conflict between Greece and Yugoslavia. The US has also expressed concern. Reliable sources said that today, unidentified "bandits" attacked the Greek border again and were repelled.

[United Press, Athens, 15th] It was officially announced that the Greek government forces recaptured the border village of Skra today. At the same time, fierce fighting has continued for four days between the village and Anchangelos (six miles south of the Yugoslav border). The Third Army Headquarters said that two brigades of troops equipped with tanks had entered the area. The Athens General Headquarters received a report from Pantelis, commander of the Third Army, that more than 1,000 people had gathered on the Bulgarian side of the Greek border, at the point where the two countries border Yugoslavia. More than 800 rioters attacked Skra village yesterday and were repelled, with four soldiers and 22 rioters killed. 250 rioters were cut off, trying to join the main force and escape into Yugoslavia.

The Greek Prime Minister Declared

Skra village was attacked by rioters with heavy machine guns and mortars three days ago, and the rioters fled into Yugoslavia. It is rumored that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering filing a complaint with the UN Security Council. Unofficially, it is believed that the border conflict has the nature of "launching an undeclared war against Greece." Lukatsis Voudoubis said: "In this war, the government must take urgent measures to stop the endless incidents. The attack was limited to Greek territory, but 200 rioters from the vanguard were joined by 800 uniformed troops from the north of the Yugoslav border." Voudoubis refused to specify the nationality of the troops, but a spokesman for the General Headquarters believed that the attacking troops came from training camps in Yugoslavia. All official reports acknowledge that a large number of rioters and troops clashed and then fled into Yugoslavia. According to news from Skra village, there were a total of 55 deaths, and most of the bodies were mutilated. The village has a population of only 646, but it is famous in history. During World War I, the Greek army drove out the Bulgarian army and took the lead in breaking through the Balkan defense line, which was at this location.

[Reuters, Athens, 16th] Representatives of the Greek General Staff met today with British, American, and French military attachÃ©s to report on the recent battles in northern Greece. The Greek Ministry of Public Security said that guerrilla activities have increased significantly this week from Thessaly to Trikala.

### Nearly One Thousand Sunken Japanese Vessels: Some Salvaged from the Seabed

[Reconstruction Company Tokyo 16th Dispatch] According to a recent survey: During the war, in the western Honshu sea areas such as Kure Port and Ujina Port, the number of Japanese ships that sank included 126 warships, 527 steamships, 170 motorized sailing vessels, and 162 landing craft.

### Mexican Gold: Shipped to Macau in Large Quantities

[Reuters Hong Kong 16th Dispatch] Reliable sources report: 50,000 to 60,000 ounces of Mexican gold are en route to Macau. This is one of the main reasons for the recent drop in gold prices here. The price once fell to as low as $279 per tael this morning, but later recovered slightly to $296. It is believed here that the final destination of this gold is likely to be the mainland and Hong Kong. Since gold imports into Hong Kong require a special permit issued by the Hong Kong government, it is expected that this gold will only be smuggled into China and Hong Kong when the opportunity arises.

### MacArthur's Support for Japanese Textile Industry: Great Dissatisfaction in Britain

[Agence France-Presse London 15th Dispatch] The British House of Commons recently discussed the silk industry, believing that the British silk industry still cannot compete with low-priced Japanese silk dumping. Therefore, they suggested that the government should make strong representations to the American military authorities in Japan. Unless a large amount of raw silk is imported into Britain in the shortest possible time, British silk workers will be unemployed. British people, regardless of whether they are left-wing or right-wing, are concerned about MacArthur's efforts to restore the Japanese textile industry and make Japan a major industrial power in the Far East again.

### Japan Under Occupation (Part 1): The Occupation Work is Divided into Three Stages

â Original by Relman Morin, New York Times Tokyo Correspondent, Translated by Zhang Deqian

One year ago, on August 30, 1945 (U.S. time), a military transport plane landed at the dusty Atsugi Airfield outside Tokyo. General MacArthur climbed down from the ladder and began the Allied occupation of Japan. He was wearing a spotless open-necked khaki uniform and a cap embroidered with gold thread, just as his subordinates had seen him at more than a dozen beachheads in the Southwest Pacific. Other generals often wore dark green work clothes to avoid attacks by guerrillas, but MacArthur never liked wearing that kind of clothing.

Behind him was a glorious war record of three years of constant victories, advancing by land and sea from the southeastern corner of New Guinea all the way to northern Philippines. However, he casually made a speech to the American and Japanese reporters who came to greet him, saying: "We have come a long and arduous road, but now we seem to have been rewarded."

But the work that MacArthur began that day, his staff still call it "the greatest gamble in military history." Japan had already announced its surrender and sent a committee to Manila for preliminary contacts; however, the surrender document had not yet been signed. MacArthur had only 50,000 troops under his command. And surrounding them were 4 million armed Japanese soldiers. As long as the Japanese army made a move, these few American troops would immediately become prisoners. However, the Japanese army did not make a move. Not only did they not make a move, but they also mobilized a large number of old cars to transport the American troops to Tokyo and Yokohama.

The formal surrender ceremony was held at 8:00 PM (U.S. Eastern War Time) on September 1 on the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. MacArthur won the first hand he played in his biggest gamble. The occupying forces settled in Japan, waiting for the Japanese to contribute to democracy by establishing "a responsible government with a peaceful orientation," according to the terms of the Potsdam Declaration upon which they surrendered.

To assess the gains in this area, the purpose of the occupation should first be divided into three procedures according to their different natures: (1) Disarmament and demobilization of the Japanese army and navy, and reduction of national war potential; (2) Removal of political obstacles to establish politics that conform to the ideals of the Allied countriesâincluding all old and bad laws and systems, such as the "thought police" and the government-sponsored and war-promoting religious system, etc.; (3) Jointly forming a cooperative organization with the Japanese to create a new democracy, which is the most difficult step.

The first stage has now been completed. At the end of the first year after Japan's surrender, 5,852,000 Japanese soldiers had been disarmed. Some of the Japanese navy that survived the American bombing has also been completely eliminated. A huge amount of weapons has been destroyed. In the Tokyo area alone, 300 licenses have been issued to allow aircraft factories and munitions factories to be converted into civilian factories; in addition, there are 80 factories left, prepared for reparations. Even if the occupation work ends next year, the Japanese will not be able to rearm themselves in their lifetime.

The second stage is progressing smoothly, but has not yet reached such a satisfactory level. Deep-rooted old restrictive laws have been abolished, and a new Americanized constitution and auxiliary legal system will eventually be established. The era of dictatorial directives and basic orders forcing the Japanese to reform was declared over at the beginning of this year.

It is not yet entirely certain whether MacArthur will use compulsory orders as a weapon again to make the Japanese thoroughly obey his orders. U.S. Representative Acheson repeatedly reported to the United Nations Control Commission for Japan, believing that "left-wing totalitarianism" is no different from fanatical militarist rule, and that the Allied Supreme Commander should strictly prohibit the Japanese people from taking these two wrong paths. This is sufficient to fully illustrate the policy held by MacArthur's headquarters in this regard.

Summarizing several legal systems abolished last year, we can roughly see how huge changes have taken place in Japan's domestic institutions. The emperor's power has been severely restricted in practice. Once the new constitution is approved (Editor's note: The new Japanese constitution was formally announced on November 3), his legal status will be no different from an idolâalthough Emperor Hirohito himself is still admired by the majority of the people, because they believe that he ended the war, otherwise the militarists would have continued to fight.

Zaibatsu are large-scale family capital groups. We have formally announced that the zaibatsu are the patrons of the Japanese military institutions. Now they have been frozen and lost their power. Major zaibatsu organizations such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda have all decided to dissolve. The 45 major "colonial banks" used by Japan to exploit occupied territories have also been permanently closed. (Editor's note: The Mitsui and other zaibatsu have recently been formally dissolved)

### Lending to Traitors Cannot Be Recovered! Executing Agencies Not Responsible for Repaying Debts; Li Ze's Assets to Be Seized Separately

According to sources from the Committee for Handling Traitorous Assets yesterday, the committee discussed the following major cases regarding the handling of traitorous assets: (1) Whether the creditor's rights and debts of all properties of traitors should be cleared on their behalf. It was decided to handle the matter in accordance with Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 3213, which stated: "The executing agency of all properties confiscated in accordance with Article 8 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors is not responsible for clearing the debts owed by the traitor and the burdens established on the property." (2) A light yellow Studebaker car suspected of being enemy property seized by the Enemy Property Handling Bureau. Zheng Qingsheng and Wang Zongyao previously submitted a request for its return. The request was approved and they were instructed to provide evidence for verification. Now, the investigation team transferred a request from Deng Qingsheng et al. stating that the purchase certificate for the car was lost and could not be submitted. They requested that the Handling Bureau be consulted and approved for its return. It was decided to submit the original request for review. (3) Commissioner Fan Qizhang submitted a request on October 30, stating that he was ordered to supervise the business of the Xinhua Industrial Society and prepare the society's monthly budget of expenses. Decision: 1. Instruct the person in charge of the factory to prepare a plan for resuming work; 2. Pass the budget; 3. List the names of all the traitors at large who are on file, together with the evidence of their crimes, and send them to the High Procuratorate for review. (4) Gan Shuishi applied to redeem the real estate in Ankang Lane, Yifeng Lane, but the request was rejected. (5) There are still many of General Manager Li Ze's traitorous assets in the New New Company that have not been seized. Should personnel be sent to continue handling the matter? It was decided that the company's shares could be seized by notifying them separately, and Shu Yueqiao should be summoned for questioning for reference. At the same time, the Criminal Division of the High Court should be consulted to report the situation of Li's traitorous assets so that they could be seized. (6) Chu Chen Shunzhen, the wife of the traitor Chu Minyi, applied for the unsealing and return of property that did not belong to Chu Minyi in order to maintain her livelihood. It was decided to transfer the matter to the Jiangsu Committee for Handling Traitorous Assets for review and reporting. (7) It is proposed to publicly lease the Baofeng Silk Factory, which was received and seized in the Wang Yongkang traitorous asset case, and give the lessee a preferential right of purchase. It was decided to lease it first, and when handling it, the estimated value would be allowed to be purchased by the lessee with priority. (8) Chen Kunyuan, a suspected traitor, has been acquitted and released by the Military Law Department of the Chairman's Peiping Headquarters. Please return the sealed property of Chen Kunyuan. It was decided to consult the original judgment in full before reviewing it again. (9) The China Chemical Factory reported that the situation of the 20,000 shares of registered shares and the reasons why they could not be recovered are known. Please waive the recovery. It was decided that the shares should still be recovered. (10) Jin Wenhua, the father of the traitor Jin Taonan, applied to sell the seized property in order to maintain his livelihood. It was decided to discuss it after Jin's traitorous sentence is determined.

Mrs. Cripps said in her speech: "I am very pleased to have this opportunity to tell you about the work of the British Aid to China Fund. I would also like to thank the Chinese government for giving us the opportunity to increase our unlimited knowledge and discuss various issues. The organization of the British Aid to China Fund includes people from all walks of life in Britain. They have different political and religious beliefs, but they are all working together for the purpose of aiding China, forming a cooperative group and generating great power. This trip to China is only temporary, so I cannot easily express my personal opinions, but I firmly believe that you hope that I can briefly describe my impressions of China. We have been greatly welcomed everywhere in China. This kind of grand welcome is beyond my description. I also hope that the aid to China work can be further expanded and promoted. This visit to China is not only to learn and visit from the Chinese people, but also to continue our aid to China work under the friendship between China and the United Kingdom. There are currently many service organizations developing in the United Kingdom, and I hope to exchange opinions with each other. We are very moved by the people who have been persecuted by the Japanese and the people who are struggling to survive in suffering. We have also visited various different regions and completed visits to North China, South China, East China, and West China, and have gone to Hong Kong, Chongqing, Chengdu, Liuzhou, Yan'an and other places to visit various public institutions. Although the people of Shenyang are very poor, they are still constantly striving to improve. When visiting Peiping, I also gave a speech to the students there. Students everywhere are enduring great sacrifices in order to study. I have tried to analyze the entire modern China, and the suffering of the people every day concerns me. In the past few years of suffering, I have worked for both China and the United Kingdom. I always remember everything about China. My greatest hope for China is that peace will come soon. We really have this belief and patience to seek the arrival of peace."

Mrs. Cripps will go to Caohejing at 10:00 AM today to visit the Shanghai Relief Institute for Refugees and Orphans.

### How Much Living Expenses Should Be Appropriately Reserved for the Families of Traitors? The Judicial Yuan's Explanation Is Abstract; It Is Difficult for the Enemy Property Bureau to Implement

[This Newspaper Report] In the judgments of traitors, the disposition of traitorous property is: "All property will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for family members." However, there is no clear stipulation on how much should be appropriately reserved. The Traitorous Property Group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau submitted a document to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation due to the difficulty of implementation. Now, the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3213 has been obtained, which states that the so-called "necessary" refers to what is needed for the livelihood of ordinary people in the area where the traitor's family is located. As for how to determine the necessary living expenses to be reserved for family members, the executing agency should investigate and clarify the entire property and the population status of the family before executing. It also stated that "the main text of the judgment may only make an abstract declaration regarding the necessary living expenses for family members." The Traitorous Property Group of the Enemy Property Bureau believes that the above explanation still lacks specific regulations, and it is still difficult to handle it.

The entirety of the confiscated traitorous property includes all the property obtained as a result of committing the crime of treason, and the property originally owned by them. As for the public property among the property obtained, or the private property that should be returned to the victims, it is not included in the confiscation list.

### More Than Three Thousand Cases of Plasma Have Been Fully Recovered: Godowns on Szechuan Road and Broadway Road; President of the United Press Accidentally Discovers Them

According to a disclosure by a U.S. Navy spokesperson yesterday, he received a notification on November 14th from the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission, stating that a portion of a large quantity of surplus medicines belonging to the U.S. military in Okinawa, approximately one million tons, including plasma owned by the American Red Cross, was not for public sale. After learning that plasma was being sold at high prices on the black market in this city, the U.S. Navy is now making every effort to assist the Liquidation Commission in buying it back from merchants. The U.S. Navy is aware that Liquidation Commission staff are attempting to prohibit the illegal black market trading of plasma in this city, but according to investigations, such trading is continuing. The Navy spokesperson stated that the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission is continuing to conduct a strict investigation, attempting to buy back the plasma to prevent illegal trading.

[United Press, Shanghai] The Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office previously sold plasma to Shanghai merchants and is now trying to recover it and return it to the Red Cross. Although the Chinese buyer has agreed to return it to the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office, this has not yet been implemented. Hapson, the president of the United Press Shanghai branch, and reporter Massa, accidentally discovered more than two thousand cases of this black market plasma in a godown opposite the Cathay Hotel on Szechuan South Road yesterday, and another several hundred cases in another godown. It is expected that all of the more than three thousand five hundred cases of plasma can be recovered. Yesterday, Hapson and Massa were having dinner at the Cathay Hotel on Szechuan South Road when a diner saw that they were news reporters and approached them with a newspaper, pointing out a news item about the recovery of plasma. The diner then said that they were planning to move the plasma out of the godown. Upon hearing this, Hapson and Massa went to the godown to inspect it and saw hundreds of cases of plasma inside a fence. They then learned that there were still hundreds of cases inside the godown and that plans were being made to transport them away by truck. As no U.S. Navy trucks had arrived, they suspected that there might be another plan to transport the plasma to a secret location. They immediately telephoned the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office and other U.S. agencies to inquire. They learned that none of them knew anything about moving the plasma. The American authorities here have been trying to find and recover the plasma since October 3rd. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to the godown. Later, the Coast Guard also arrived. Had they been slightly later, it is feared that at least part of the plasma would have been moved. Later, the owner sent a truck to the godown to transport the plasma, but seeing that personnel from the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Office were already there, it drove away empty. Mr. Ge, an official from the Disposal Office, even took a photograph of the truck, which had the owner's name painted on it. Mr. Davis, the director of the Shanghai office of the Disposal Office, also came to the godown in person. In addition, several personnel from the American Red Cross also arrived, but declared that they were purely observers. After informal discussions among all parties, it was decided to send a Coast Guard officer to guard outside the godown to prevent the plasma from being moved. Personnel from the Disposal Office and the Red Cross then went to inspect three other godowns, led by someone, in the hope of finding unrecovered plasma. They then found hundreds of cases hidden in a godown on Broadway Road, piled up to the ceiling. Although the exact number is unknown, it is believed that almost all of the plasma intended to be recovered is in these two godowns. As for how much of the plasma has already been sold on the market, it is still unknown. It is said that the attempt to recover the three thousand five hundred cases is likely to be successful. Each case contains twelve bags of plasma, and each bag contains five hundred cc. Mr. Maddy, an official from the China branch of the American Red Cross, told a United Press reporter that the U.S. Navy will be responsible for shipping the plasma to the United States.

### Song Park Opens: Over Seventy Acres in Area; Lush with Flowers, Plants, and Trees; Mayor Wu and Others Praise the Park Repeatedly After Visiting

[Our Newspaper] The Song Jiaoren Park, located at the intersection of Gonghe New Road and Song Park Road in Zhabei, has been renovated by the Parks and Fields Management Office of the Public Works Bureau for several months and is now completely new, becoming a scenic spot and historic site for recreation. According to Mr. Cheng Shifu, a specialist from the Public Works Bureau responsible for the renovation of the park, the Jiaoren martyr's tomb field covers approximately one hundred and twenty acres. After receiving it in August this year, a plan was made to arrange the flowers and plants in the grounds. The renovation work started on September 1st and took only one month to complete the current park scenery. The park includes approximately seventy acres of land surrounding the tomb. The rest has been divided into several sections due to the construction of roads. The flowers, plants, and trees in the park are all supplied by the nursery of the Parks and Fields Management Office of the Public Works Bureau. In addition, it is planned to build a memorial hall in the open space behind the tomb, but this is currently difficult to do due to the high cost of building materials. The current simple renovation has already cost 15 million yuan.

The park is scheduled to officially open today. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the local press was invited for a preview. Mayor Wu also came to the park at 4:30 PM in the afternoon to inspect it and repeatedly praised it.

### Fuxing Island: No Tunnels; Will the Case of Concealed Materials End Without Resolution? Informant Cannot Be Located

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the legendary case of underground materials being concealed on Fuxing Island, the District Procuratorate sent a special letter to the Executive Yuan for inquiry a few days ago. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan replied to the District Procuratorate, stating in brief: The case has been handed over to Xu Fuqi, the chairman of the Morning Industry Committee of the Executive Yuan, for investigation. According to his reply, there are two points: (1) There are no clues to be found in this case, as the committee has not found any underground tunnels on Fuxing Island at all. At the same time, after a thorough search of the archives, the Agricultural Committee never sent anyone to Fuxing Island to handle the takeover, so the "takeover personnel" mentioned by the District Procuratorate could not have handled it. (2) Fuxing Island was not taken over by the Executive Yuan at the beginning of the victory. It was borrowed from the Naval authorities after the Executive Yuan requested it and was approved by the National Defense Conference. At the same time, the District Procuratorate also sent a general letter to the Songhu Garrison Command summoning the original informant in the case, Yang Biting. Yesterday, the Garrison Command also replied, stating: "This headquarters does not have this person. The summons is returned herewith." It is generally believed that the case may end without resolution.

### Don't Blame Me for Preferring Chrysanthemums: No Flowers Bloom After This Flower Fades; Chrysanthemum Exhibition Ends Today

The chrysanthemum exhibition held by the Municipal Public Works Bureau in Fuxing Park will be on its last day today. The reporter made a special trip to visit it last night. According to the person in charge of the chrysanthemum exhibition office, the total number of visitors to the chrysanthemum exhibition has reached 300,000, and the ticket revenue has reached 600,000 yuan. A total of 2,000 pots of chrysanthemums of approximately 200 varieties were on display. Most of the citizens who came to see them were young women, who took pictures against the scenery to leave their beautiful figures among the myriad chrysanthemums. The chrysanthemums currently displayed in the park have been mostly damaged by the continuous wind and blows. As the reporter walked out of the park gate, he suddenly recalled the poem by a predecessor: "Don't blame me for preferring chrysanthemums; no flowers bloom after this flower fades," which could not help but evoke the desolate feeling of "the year's floral affairs have come to an end."

### Tax Bureau Dismisses Clerk: Forging Seals to Defraud

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Shengchu, a native of Wuxi, 39 years old, was previously a clerk at the Jiangsu Province Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. He has now been dismissed and is unemployed in Shanghai. The other day, he actually came up with a bizarre idea: to forge tax bureau seals and official documents. He went to Room 405 of the East Asia Hotel, the Shanghai office of the North China Sales Department of the Great China Match Company, and showed the seals and other credentials, requesting a temporary loan of 3 million yuan, claiming that he was a tax bureau official and that the amount could be deducted when taxes were paid in the future. The representative of the office, He Ruixiang, saw through the scheme and handed him over to the Old Gate Branch Bureau. According to his confession, he had previously defrauded the Fucheng Enterprise Company on Ningbo Road of 1 million legal tender using the same method and spent it. The preliminary trial confirmed the facts. He will be sent to the District Procuratorate this morning for further investigation.

### The Declining Employment Agencies: Servants' Wages are High, and Introduction Fees are Even Higher; The Industry Association Plans to Request Unified Management

[Our Newspaper Special] Before the war, Chinese labor was worthless. Wages in production industries were pitifully low. Foreigners classified Chinese exports as colonial goods, meaning that the labor costs of these commodities were as low as those extracted from colonial labor. In many industries, using modern machinery was not as cheap as using manual labor. The treatment of domestic servants further revealed the cheapness of labor. In Shanghai in 1937, it cost only 2 to 4 yuan per month to hire an ordinary maid, and a wet nurse cost only about 10 yuan. Therefore, it was not uncommon for a family of moderate means to hire two or three workers.

Wages Rise High

Nine years later, everything has changed dramatically. The cost of Chinese labor is at least comparable to that of the United States. High wages in Chinese production industries are already known worldwide. In terms of the treatment of domestic servants, at least in Shanghai, it has made it daunting for small and medium-sized families to hire servants. Today, in Shanghai, hiring a male servant to do ordinary work in the house, in addition to providing food and accommodation, costs 40,000 to 60,000 yuan per month. The cost of female workers is even higher, reaching 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month, in addition to food and accommodation. If a female worker is slightly knowledgeable, literate, and able to cook and do laundry, she may earn more than 100,000 yuan in a wealthy family. Therefore, if calculated in terms of rice prices, the "real wages" of domestic servants are indeed much better than before the war. As for servants with special skills or uses, their compensation is even more generous. A chef who can cook both Chinese and Western dishes can earn more than 200,000 yuan per month, and ordinary ones can earn more than 100,000 yuan. A wet nurse who has passed the examination can earn about 150,000 yuan per month, and ordinary ones can earn about 120,000 yuan.

Great Differences Between Past and Present

Today, there is an industry in society that exists based on these domestic servants, and that is the employment agency, also known as the "go-between shop." From a statistical point of view, this industry is in decline. In this city, there were more than 400 agencies around 1927, but only more than 200 before 1937. The difficult life during the war forced these people to do small businesses or to sell their original houses to do other businesses. Today, there are only 70 employment agencies left in Shanghai. Business is now sluggish, with only about 1,000 people being introduced each month, most of whom are maids. All servants introduced by the agency are accompanied by a guarantee, which is kept in the employer's home and checked every six months without additional fees. Servants introduced by the agency must work for at least three months after the wages have been agreed upon. If they leave before the term expires, the agency is obligated to find someone else to replace them.

Introduction Fees are Appalling

The economic source of the agency is the so-called "introduction fee," which is well known. After the servant and the employer have agreed on the wages, the agency will ask for the introduction fee. Before the war, the introduction fee was borne equally by the master and servant, but now it is paid solely by the employer. How much should the introduction fee be? This is a question that has not been resolved to this day. Before the war, the introduction fee was half of the wages. During the enemy-puppet era, the introduction fee was as high as eight times the wages! What about now? It depends on the employment situation and is not uniform. There is a shocking rumor that a wealthy family actually paid an introduction fee of 200,000 yuan! The general situation is 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, with some bargaining involved. Recently, the Employment Agency Association has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, hoping that the introduction fee can be equal to the amount of the wages. However, given the high wages in this city, they would be very satisfied if they could get half of the requested amount. In fact, if the introduction fee is too high, families willing to hire people will not go through the agency, and this industry will inevitably decline.

The Association Wants to Unify

The main difficulty for employment agencies today is that people in general are very annoyed with the introduction fee. They have now switched to the method of "servants introducing servants" and are unwilling to patronize the servant introduction agency anymore. Therefore, this industry is in a major recession, and it is difficult for each agency to maintain itself. Especially in many larger agencies, it is even more difficult to support several employees. Now, the industry association is preparing to request the competent authority to uniformly stipulate the amount of the introduction fee in the future and not to allow excessive demands. At the same time, the employment of servants must go through the agency. They believe that doing so can immediately achieve the benefit of lower wages. They point out that the high wages of domestic servants in this city are mainly due to the increase in wages by wealthy families after the victory. At the same time, the lack of statistics on supply and demand in the city due to servants introducing servants is also one of the reasons. According to them, if unified management can be carried out in the future, it can somewhat stabilize wages. Recently, the Shanghai Vocational Introduction Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs has had preliminary contact with the industry association and has requested some materials, which may be the beginning of government management. In fact, this industry is in decline because the past business methods are too old and have not truly served the society. To make this industry continue to exist, it needs public guidance and supervision.

### Britain Hopes to Obtain Materials from China: Commercial Delegation to China Arrives in Shanghai from Hankou

[Our Newspaper] The British commercial delegation to China arrived in Shanghai from Hankou at 2:30 PM yesterday and landed at Jiangwan Airport. The delegation's secretary, Pelliga, arrived in Shanghai on the 13th. After the delegation arrives in Shanghai for the second time, it will stay here for more than ten days to complete its unfinished work and is scheduled to fly to Taiwan on the 29th of this month.

Reception for Reporters Before Leaving Hankou

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 15th] The British commercial delegation to China held a press conference at the British Consulate General at 5:30 PM this afternoon and replied to reporters that the United Kingdom will take all possible steps to increase its foreign trade. Currently, more than 80 percent of British industries have returned to normal, and its exports have already exceeded the amount in 1938. This achievement has been achieved by restricting domestic consumption. The United Kingdom is currently extremely short of food and raw materials and hopes to obtain them from China. However, the current situation prevents us from achieving this wish. There are three reasons: (1) Prices are too high. The prices of Chinese goods are now three to six times higher than before the war (calculated at the exchange rate). (2) Transportation costs are too high. (3) The war in China not only damages transportation and affects the distribution of imported materials, but also greatly reduces the products that the United Kingdom urgently needs. Regarding trade in the Yangtze River basin, the United Kingdom will continue to attach importance to it.

Therefore, Huang Jin has withdrawn the lawsuit against the District Procuratorate for destroying the desks and chairs. As for whether to allow him to withdraw the part on tearing up the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the District Procuratorate is currently considering it.

### American China Policy Association: Cobb Talks About Work Situation

[Our Newspaper] Kohlberg, a member of the American China Policy Association and the current treasurer of the association, came to China last week and recently went to Beijing. Yesterday, he returned to Shanghai and met with reporters at his residence. According to him, the mission of this trip to China, in addition to private business affairs, is also to be responsible for collecting some information for the China Policy Association.

When the reporter asked what kind of information it was, Cobb refused to disclose it, only saying that he had met with Madam Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Lifu in Beijing and jokingly said, "Some Americans think of Mr. Chen Lifu as a mysterious figure, but what I (Cobb referring to himself) saw was a thin and gentle person. I mentioned this to Mr. Chen when I met him, and Mr. Chen laughed." Cobb has submitted the topics of the information he wants to collect to the relevant parties and will have them mailed to the United States after it has been collected. He himself is unable to wait and is scheduled to return to the United States on Tuesday this week.

Cobb also talked to the reporter about the general situation of the China Policy Association, saying that the association was officially established in June or July this year and its purpose is to help the American people understand the situation in China and study the correct China policy. In addition, it closely monitors the activities of communist elements in various countries. The chairman of the association is Mr. Powell, the editor of the China Weekly Review, the vice chairman is the famous American missionary Mr. Fish, and there are a total of sixty standing members, most of whom are legal and political leaders, writers, editors, and people who know and have a good impression of China. In September of this year, the association submitted a letter to President Truman suggesting four points: (1) Immediately demand that the Soviet Union abandon the special rights it obtained in China in the Yalta Agreement. (2) Condemn the actions of the Chinese Communist Party and stop all support for the CCP. (3) Fully support the Chinese National Government. (4) Reorganize the Far East Division of the State Department and appoint personnel who are in line with foreign policy. This recommendation was submitted through the President's Secretary and had a considerable impact. However, Cobb finally told the reporter that the United States' China policy is still undecided, and there is still disagreement between the President and the Congress. The differences may be eliminated and finalized within a year, otherwise, it will have to wait until the next general election.

### Letter

To the Editor: Having read your esteemed newspaper's November 1st first page news column which stated my name was associated with Mao Yunhui in the transport and sale of salt, this is inconsistent with the facts. The reason is that I went to Xuzhou on business last month to settle accounts and traveled on the same wheel to Pukou with the said Mao Yunyao, after which we separated. The salt matter has nothing to do with me. I am afraid it is a misunderstanding of hearsay. Please check and make a correction. Respectfully, Gao Hongji, Stationmaster of the 66th Detachment of the Lianyungang Station

### Relying on the Advantage of Fundraising Associations to Extort Money: City Council Advocates Prohibition; Police Affairs Committee Requests Police to Maintain Order at Stations; Telegram to the Entire Country Calling for the Elimination of High-Interest Loans

City Council Political Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM in the council's meeting room. More than ten people, including Ji, attended, and Police Chief Tie Wu also attended. Zhang Jiu served as the chairman. After the meeting began, the Chief first reported on the actual situation of the disciplinary case. Chief Xuan stated: "In order to thoroughly resolve the issue of rectifying police discipline, we have decided to proceed in four aspects: (1) Improving quality; (2) Improving treatment; (3) Strengthening training; (4) Emphasizing rewards and punishments." The discussion began regarding the prevalence of fundraising associations in this city. Chen stated that the wind of such associations is strong. However, it should be prohibited for general public officials to borrow the name, or for local ruffians to rely on their power to extort money from the people through the method of "beating the autumn wind." However, the original proposer was unable to attend the meeting to state the reasons, and it was inconvenient to delete or modify the original proposal, so it was decided to retain it for discussion at the next meeting. Later, Qiang Qian temporarily suggested to Chief Xuan that the order of getting on and off trams and buses was too chaotic, and the elderly, children, and women were suffering from the inability to get on the bus. He asked if the police station could send personnel to maintain order and stipulate that all people waiting for the bus at each station must line up to board the bus. Chief Xuan immediately agreed, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

In addition, the City Council, in order to strictly prohibit usury, in addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan, specifically telegraphed all provincial and municipal councils across the country, requesting consistent implementation. The original telegram is as follows: "XX City Council Public Oversight Committee, after investigating the loan interest rates of banks, the monthly interest rate before the war was only one percent, but in recent years the interest rate has soared to five percent, which is already alarming. After the victory, due to abnormal fluctuations in prices and speculative manipulation, some people have spared no effort to raise interest rates in order to determine the success or failure of the moment, creating high black market interest rates, which have exceeded twenty percent. If this trend is not curbed, the entire legitimate industry and commerce will collapse. The depth of the crisis is beyond imagination. The fourth meeting of the Social Affairs Committee of this council proposed to request the central government to issue a general order to the banking industry to clearly stipulate legal interest rates, and to telegraph all councils across the country to respond in unison, and to jointly telegraph the central government to call for a swift and effective ban on usury to save the industrial and commercial crisis and remedy social ills. The case was resolved to telegraph all provincial and municipal councils across the country to respond to the call and record it in the minutes. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan, we also telegraph your council to take note of and jointly telegraph to resolve the industrial and commercial crisis. We are extremely hopeful and prayerful. Shanghai City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan (Cheng) (Said) respectfully."

### Zhang Sumin Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison; Zhang Tao Scheduled for Sentencing on the 23rd; Former Puppet Police Station Detective Chen Jinsheng Acquitted

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Sumin, who once served as the director of the puppet Jianghai Customs Office and the director of the puppet Enemy Property Management Committee, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights by the High Court yesterday. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. In addition, Chen Jinsheng, who was accused of serving as a detective at the puppet police station, was acquitted by the court, which believed that the staff of the former Public Concession Police Department could not constitute the crime of treason, and that he had not engaged in any actions detrimental to the country or the people while continuing to serve in the puppet police station.

On the same day, the trial of Zhang Tao, the former president of the puppet Supreme Court, was scheduled for sentencing on the 23rd of this month. Zhang is currently sixty-one years old and a native of Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. When Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and others organized the puppet Reformed Government in the twenty-seventh year, he immediately took office as a puppet legislator and concurrently as the chairman of the puppet Economic Committee. When Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others organized the puppet National Government in the twenty-ninth year, he transferred to serve as the president of the puppet Supreme Court. He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The High Court has held several hearings to investigate. Yesterday morning, a collegial panel was convened for trial. The defendant was escorted to the court from prison by bailiffs. His hair was already gray, and he wore an old-fashioned pair of glasses on his nose and a blue silk robe. He argued a lot about the charges against him, claiming that he participated in the puppet government under duress and that the laws used during the puppet organization period were still those set before the war and had not been changed. He also denied being a member of the Kuomintang, saying that the reason he confessed to being a member of the Kuomintang when he was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau was out of fear of being considered a member of a different party.

Huang Qinwen and Others Concluded the Trial

In addition, Huang Qinwen and Hong Wenjiang were accused of organizing the Subei Fresh Pork Transportation Shipping Association and the Shanghai Fresh Pork Business Office to control the sale and purchase of pigs and supply them to the enemy army. The trial of this case was concluded yesterday and is also scheduled for sentencing on the 23rd. The cases of Fang Guojin, Chen Guoqiang, Wang Qin, and others will also be sentenced on the same day.

He was also hired by the Second Special District Local Court of the puppet Shanghai Municipality to take over the Shanghai Bar Association's clubhouse. After the High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution in this case, the High Court convened a hearing to investigate yesterday afternoon. Qian's testimony was evasive, and the court adjourned the hearing for further questioning.

### Arrest for Suspicion of Treason: Detectives Extort Huge Sums of Money

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Junqing, a native of Yancheng who opened the Guohua Barber Shop on Mongol Road in Zhabei, was recently reported to the Shanghai County Government Police Bureau for suspicion of treason. On the 8th of this month, the bureau dispatched two detectives, Zhao Bugao and Xu Lihe, from the Minhang Police Station, carrying documents to Shanghai, and went to the address with the Zhabei Branch Bureau to arrest Chen and take him back to Minhang for interrogation. Unexpectedly, on the 11th, Zhao and Xu went to Chen's shop again and told his brother, Yongqing, that the case would be handled according to law, but if he could pay 10 million yuan as a reward, he could guarantee that his brother would be acquitted and released. After negotiations between the two parties at the Qinghe Tea Garden on Mongol Road, an agreement was reached for 5 million yuan. It was agreed that the money and the person would be exchanged at 12 noon on the 12th. Afterwards, Chen's brother reported the information to the Zhabei Branch Bureau and prepared a bundle of legal tender with 5-yuan and 10-yuan notes on the outside, falsely posing as 1 million yuan, and two Zhejiang Quangong checks for 3 million yuan dated the 15th and 1 million yuan dated the 18th. At the appointed time, the police station sent Police Chief Wang Yingzhou to accompany him to wait at the Shanghai-Jiading Automobile Company on Xinzha Road and Datong Road. At about 10:00 AM, Zhao and Xu arrived on time, saying that your brother would be an hour late due to procedural issues. Chen's brother handed over the checks and cash, and Zhao was about to count the money when the police officers stepped forward and arrested him. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed to the above-mentioned criminal facts. In order to clarify the truth of the case, the police bureau has sent a letter to the county police bureau for investigation.

### Shanghai Municipal Party Department Formulates Clarification Measures for the Issue of Traitors in the Film and Drama Industry

The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, in view of the fact that during the period of occupation, people in the Shanghai film and drama industry were unable to relocate inland, and many people remained in Shanghai to work. Among them, apart from a few who willingly surrendered to the enemy and acted as accomplices, who should be punished, the remaining personnel are still being reported one after another, causing general film and drama practitioners to be in a state of anxiety and affecting artistic work greatly. In order to make film and drama practitioners feel at ease to work and seek progress for Chinese film and drama, two remedial measures were decided at the 39th Executive Committee meeting to distinguish right from wrong and avoid wrongful convictions. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Send a letter to the Procuratorate of the High Court to pay attention to this matter. (2) Jointly review the films and works of the accused persons with judicial organs, the City Council, the Municipal Government, the Education Bureau, the Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the Cultural Movement Committee, and various newspapers and drama organizations, and submit the review results to the court for reference, so as to ensure that Shanghai film and drama will not be suspended due to arbitrary accusations.

[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Hu Wenhu, the owner of Tiger Balm Yong An Tang and a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant, arrived in Shanghai yesterday after a separation of twelve years. At 3:50 PM, China Airlines Flight 128, carrying Mr. Hu, landed at Longhua Airport.

### Embezzlement by Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) Treasurer: Private Lending at High Interest Rates; Authorities Thoroughly Investigate the Truth; More Than One Person Involved; Wu Suiren Under Strict Surveillance

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of Wu Suiren, treasurer of the General Affairs Section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), embezzling 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for private lending at high interest rates, our reporter learned yesterday that the case is quite complex and involves more than just Wu Suiren. The authorities at the CRRRA are currently conducting a thorough investigation.

It is understood that the CRRRA discovered Wu Suiren's embezzlement two weeks ago. In October of this year, the Executive Yuan, based on the basic agreement between China and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), allocated 3.2 billion yuan to the CRRRA as this year's regular expenses for UNRRA in China. The funds were advanced by the Executive Yuan and paid by the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank. However, aside from 500 million yuan that was remitted to the General Affairs Section of the CRRRA in Shanghai, the remaining 2.7 billion yuan was directly remitted to Wu Suiren himself. After receiving the remittance, Wu immediately cashed the drafts at the Central Bank, which paid him with cashier's checks. Wu then used the funds for private lending at high interest rates. Initially, the matter was not discovered. However, at the beginning of this month, the authorities at the CRRRA inquired with the Finance Department of the CRRRA in Nanjing about the funds. They were told that the funds had already been remitted. The CRRRA immediately sent personnel to Nanjing to investigate, while also conducting inquiries in Shanghai. This led to the discovery of the truth. The CRRRA then ordered Wu Suiren to return all of the original funds and dismissed him from his position. However, the details of Wu's lending and the amount of interest he collected are still under investigation. Although Wu Suiren has not been detained, he is under strict surveillance by the authorities.

### Soybean Cake Raw Material Funds; Edible Oil Difficulties Resolved; Investigating Costs as a Basis for Price Negotiation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to suppress oil prices and promote oil mill production, Mayor Wu convened a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the City Hall conference room, bringing together all parties related to edible oil to discuss the matter.

Mayor Wu stated: The current difficulties faced by the oil pressing industry are nothing more than the slow sales of soybean cake, the shortage of raw materials, and insufficient funds. Now, an agreement has been reached with the Central Trust of China to purchase soybean cake. Starting from the 18th of this month until the 17th of next month, the Central Trust will initially purchase 120,000 cakes produced by various private factories, at a price of 10,500 yuan per cake. After purchasing them, the Central Trust will engage in barter trade with Taiwan Province. In terms of raw materials, the Central Trust will find ways to purchase soybeans in Dalian, Sipingjie, Changchun, Yingkou, and other places in Northeast China to supply to various factories as raw materials for oil pressing. As for the issue of funding for oil pressing, the City Bank has now arranged a loan of 500 million yuan to be used by various oil mills for purchasing raw materials. Regarding the production costs of edible oil, Mayor Wu has instructed the China Vegetable Oil Factory to be responsible for compiling a production cost table for submission and verification, to be used as a reference during price negotiations.

Furthermore, Mayor Wu was extremely angered by the rampant black market trading of edible oil. However, yesterday, the black market trading of oil was almost completely absent. It is expected that after the full allocation of oil by various oil mills starting yesterday, the price of edible oil will stabilize.

Except for a small amount of 10-count coarse yarn that was traded at the price limit, there were no transactions for 20-count yarn or higher. The general customers were willing to pay higher prices to buy goods, but they could not obtain them. The price-limited yarn formed a situation of having a price but no market.

The cloth market has been fluctuating violently for several days, especially yesterday's market price.

Finally, the members noted that many yarn factories also weave cotton cloth. Therefore, a portion of the cotton yarn from the total yarn production should be reserved for the factory's own cloth production needs. The proposal was voted on and implemented.

Regarding the first point, the Textile Management Committee has recently expanded the approved amount as originally decided. Moreover, October is still the first trial run, and necessary adjustments can be made later by measuring the situation. Regarding the second point, anyone who meets the qualifications of the transporters stipulated by the Textile Management Committee can operate, so it is not necessary to adhere to any one side. As for the recent situation of yarn and cloth being shipped south, according to the investigation by the Textile Management Committee, there are two points worthy of attention: (1) Since the ban on the shipment of yarn and cloth to South China, Guangzhou has once felt an extreme lack of yarn and cloth, and prices have soared, differing from yarn prices in Shanghai by up to 1 million yuan, becoming the highest peak for yarn and cloth in the country. With merchants seeing the profit potential, they devised ways to transport goods by land, using (A) the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as a base, passing through Jiangxi, Fujian, and reaching Meixian, Xingning, and transferring by waterway to Guangzhou. (B) From Wuhan via the Yuehan Railway to Hunan, transferring to Qujiang to Guangzhou. (C) Others directly mailed parcels from Shanghai to Wuzhou, Guangxi, and then returned to Guangzhou by waterway. Mailing to Wuzhou. Since the receiving time is not confirmed, it is easily affected by fluctuations in the current price, so there are fewer incoming goods. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is easier and cheaper to transport, so among the three routes, the Yuehan Railway has the most incoming goods, averaging 100 pieces per day. (2) In the past, Guangzhou's yarn and cloth could be sold to Qian and Gui and as far north as Hunan Ganzhou and other places, in addition to being sold to Hong Kong and the South Seas. Recently, because the arrival route for yarn and cloth passes through the above-mentioned places first and then reaches Guangzhou, the outer markets do not need to go to Guangzhou to purchase any more, so sales are smaller than before. As for Hong Kong and the South Seas, Hong Kong's ban on yarn and cloth exports has suddenly blocked the door to smuggling to the South Seas. The Annam government has also restricted the import of goods and required the settlement of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of 1.1 Vietnamese dong per Hong Kong dollar on the black market was raised to 1.7 per 1, making the transport of yarn and cloth to Vietnam not only unprofitable, but actually causing losses. As a result, yarn and cloth prices in Hong Kong are lower than in Guangzhou. With weak sales in the South Seas and Hong Kong, the wind of smuggling has also decreased spontaneously. The number of tax bureaus that have applied for separate shipments to ports that can be smuggled, such as Shiqi Yangjiang, Siyi, Zhanjiang, Shiqiao, and Zhangmutou, has also gradually decreased.

### Gold Price Has Strong Upward Momentum; Strong Demand for US Dollars; Hong Kong Notes Also Rise in Tandem

Gold was initially under pressure and lower, but the general mentality was very optimistic, and the rebound was weak, remaining fairly strong. The opening price was 2,505,000. After opening, many long positions were closed for profit, and soon retreated into 2,500,000. Pressure also came, and due to the registration allocation relationship, the buying of actual sales was slightly exhausted. It once fell to around 2,475,000. The Central Bank allocated 200 bars at a price of 2,485,000. After 10:00, the situation stabilized and hovered. At 10:30, the buying wind rose again, and immediately rebounded to above 2,500,000. The demand was doubled, and the supply was slightly silent. Near noon, it gradually rose to 2,547,000. At noon, it was around 2,540,000. In the afternoon, it was slightly lowered to below 2,530,000. As a result, it rose by another 30,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry hung high to 260,000. Silver and silver dollars rose again. The secret short-term interest rate was peaceful, and the interest rate was still between 12% and 15%.

Foreign currency continued to advance. The black market for US dollars was initially as low as 4,750 yuan, and near noon it approached 4,900 yuan again. A part of the new buyers sought advancement in Hong Kong dollars, so the strength of the buyers was slightly dispersed. As a result, it remained between 4,800 yuan and 4,900 yuan in the end, continuing to rise compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were boosted by the impact of the Shanghai exchange rate report and the buying enthusiasm for gold, rising sharply by 20 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also rose to 940 yuan to 950 yuan, Indian remittances were 1,150 yuan to 1,160 yuan, and British remittances were 15,200 yuan to 15,300 yuan. Transactions were not smooth, and the US exchange rate remained sluggish.

### Reducing the Deposit Reserve Ratio; Requests Have Indeed Been Submitted to the Ministry; Liquidity Can Increase by Hundreds of Billions

According to Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department of the Central Bank: The deposit reserve ratio of commercial banks and money shops can be adjusted within the specified range according to market conditions. Recently, the deposits paid by various banks and money shops in this city are the highest amount of the statutory deposit reserve ratio, with demand deposits at 20% and time deposits at 15%. In order to regulate finance, this bank plans to reduce the deposit reserve ratio to 15% for demand deposits and 10% for time deposits. It has already reported this to the Ministry of Finance for approval. According to the current difficulties of the industrial and commercial sectors, they are nothing more than (1) too much expenditure, (2) too high interest rates. It is hoped that after the reduction of the deposit reserve ratio is realized, the market interest rate will be lowered at the same time. This is a necessary task for stabilizing the market. It is reported that it is estimated that after the reduction of the deposit reserve ratio by 5% for commercial banks and money shops in Shanghai, liquidity can increase by about 100 billion yuan.

### Tea Loan Changed to Pledge Loan; Rumors of China National Agricultural Corporation Purchasing Inaccurate

The 7 billion yuan loan for green tea production previously issued by China National Agricultural Corporation (CNAC) was due to expire in September. Later, due to problems such as transportation and commodity tax not being resolved, the green tea from Tunxi and Pingshu has not arrived in port to this day. As a result, the loan period has also been extended to the present in an invisible way. It is now known that the CNAC and tea merchants have agreed to a pledge loan method to solve the above-mentioned difficulties. In the future, after the CNAC coordinates exports, the proceeds will be used to offset the production loan. In addition, it is heard that the CNAC and tea merchants will handle this batch of new green tea with precision and select a foreign key. As for the matter of the CNAC purchasing tea from you, there is no certainty.

### Rumors of Adjusting the US Exchange Rate Are Fabricated by Speculators

Recently, rumors of foreign exchange adjustments have been spreading, and it is also said that sixty to seventy foreign ships have arrived in port, carrying a large number of commercial goods that need to be settled in US dollars. Speculators have added fuel to the fire, and the black market for US dollars has soared. According to financial authorities: The rumor of exchange rate adjustments is purely an atmosphere created by speculators. To suppress black market transactions of US dollars, severe measures will be taken. It is heard that the police bureau will dispatch personnel to thoroughly enforce the measures.

### Long Pile Velvet Sells Well

The retail trade of woolen fabrics did not see much improvement yesterday. Although clothing stores and shops have successively lowered prices to attract customers, there has not been much development. This is because the public's purchasing power has indeed been weakened due to various environmental factors. However, long pile velvet, Shanghai Bailong, sells quite well. Women's clothing stores all have decorations, because winter women's coats are still popular. The arrival of foreign goods is lacking, and local factory production is not high. At the tea fair, the trend is like a crane standing among chickens. Yesterday, the wholesale price of imported long pile velvet was 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per yard, and the local factory price was 95,000 yuan.

### Silk Factories Forced to Suspend Operations Due to Exhaustion of Raw Materials

This year's spring and autumn silkworm cocoon harvests in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were poor, causing great concern about raw materials for various silk factories. Recently, silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been forced to suspend operations, accounting for one-third of the total, due to the exhaustion of raw materials and the inability to continue operations. The factories are now requesting the China Silkworm Corporation to allocate the dry cocoons collected by the corporation to substitute reeling in order to maintain the livelihoods of the factories' employees. It is heard that, in order to improve production, the corporation will allow silk factories with rotary multi-end reeling machines to be allocated cocoons for substitute reeling. Yesterday, the corporation sent technician Zou to various factories to investigate the number of rotary multi-end reeling machines. Once the investigation is completed, the total number will be reported and allocated proportionally based on the number of machines in each factory.

This has already been ordered to be followed. However, due to transportation difficulties, national middle school restoration students cannot return to their hometowns on time. The education departments should accommodate them at any time and should not refuse to accommodate them on the grounds of being overdue. Even if the reporting is overdue, they must be given the opportunity to audit classes. In the second semester, they will be formally assigned to grades. Furthermore, if these students were originally publicly funded, they should continue to enjoy public funding. In addition to separate distribution, this order should be strictly followed."

### Inspection Report of Chahar, Shanxi, and Suiyuan â Inside and Outside the Great Wall (5)

â Special Correspondent of This Newspaper from Hangzhou

The Arduous and Heroic Defense of Datong

At 3:00 PM on November 2nd, the reporter group flew from Zhangjiakou to Datong, which had been under siege for 45 days. The flight took one hour. Representatives from all circles of Datong had been waiting at the airfield for a long time. A melodious military band played a welcoming tune. A general with two golden stars glittering on his collar, a neatly trimmed gray mustache, and a face full of smiles, shook hands warmly with each reporter and exchanged cordial greetings, saying, "Your arrival is wonderful! Truly wonderful!" He was Chu Xichun, the hero who defended Datong, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Army Group and Commander of the 43rd Army.

The entire city of Datong was swept by a wave of welcome upon our arrival. From the airfield to the city gate, lines of elementary and middle school students respectfully lined the streets, holding up welcoming flags and shouting welcoming slogans. Inside the city, welcoming slogans were plastered on every wall, and every resident seemed to have the word "Welcome" written on their emaciated faces. In those cursed days, Datong suffered greatly. Now, as we sit beside the warm fire in the reception hall, the Yuzhong Hotel, listening quietly to General Chu Xichun recount the events of the battle, it is truly an epic of sorrow and heroism!

An Epic of Sorrow and Heroism

Datong, once the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty, contains the Nine Dragon Wall, the Upper and Lower Huayan Temples within the city, and the Yungang Grottoes thirty miles from the city, all of which are ancient relics over a thousand years old. Located between the inner and outer Great Wall, it is a crucial hub on the Ping-Sui Railway and the starting point of the Tong-Pu Railway. Dominating northern Shanxi, it has long been a vital military stronghold, its gain or loss directly affecting the safety of the Central Plains. After Japan surrendered last year, the National Army received it with airborne troops on September 3rd. The Communist Army, feeling that the existence of Datong was a major obstacle to their control of Shanxi and Suiyuan, and the consolidation of Rehe and Chahar, was determined to seize it.

The official day that Datong was besieged was August 3rd, but the actual fighting should be considered to have started on June 16th, when the Communist Army launched the offensive in northern Shanxi. Shuoxian fell, followed by the occupation of Shanyin. The soldiers and civilians of Datong had already sensed the premonition and were making preparations to meet the enemy: concentrating forces, mobilizing the people, and storing grain and fuel. To concentrate forces, the National Army painfully withdrew from important industrial areas such as Kouquan and Pingwang, and resolutely defended several relatively strategic strongholds in the vicinity of Datong, which were Shaling, Caifulou, Beiyuemiao, and the railway station, centered around the airfield. These strongholds were intended to give the outstretched "devil's claws" a "deterrent blow."

We should pay attention to the comparison of the forces of the two sides. On the Communist Army side, participating were the so-called elite field divisions 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 358, and 359, a total of thirty-two regiments, approximately 50,000 troops. On the National Army side, Chu Xichun commanded a mixed force: the 38th Division, the 5th Cavalry Division of the Northeast Advance Army, the 6th Division, the Transportation Police Corps, the Security Brigade, the Signal Battalion, and the Self-Defense Force, totaling about 20,000 troops. When survival is threatened, even a coward can become very brave. This mixed force, under the command of Chu Xichun, formed an iron whip, turning the sandy Datong into an impregnable fortress. Military strength alone was not enough. All 300,000 people of Datong, except for the disabled and pregnant women, were mobilized during the defense. At that time, there were two slogans: "Everyone defends themselves, everyone participates in the war!"

The more dangerous the battle became, the closer the hearts of the soldiers and civilians became. Everyone developed a belief: "If we must die, we will die together! Before death comes, we will resist it with all our might!" A total of 281 people died while participating in construction projects and rescue work for the people of Datong.

The Communist Army attacked the four strongholds of Shaling, Caifulou, Beiyuemiao, and the railway station for a long time without success, becoming increasingly frustrated. The initial commander was Yao Zhe. Seeing that it was not working, he was replaced by Xiao Ke, but it was still useless. He Long personally took command, but it was still ineffective. Finally, Nie Rongzhen came. He changed his strategy, abandoning direct assault and using tunnels to approach the defending troops, so that they would either be killed or starved to death. As a result, the defending troops in the four strongholds were surrounded, and all contact with the city was completely cut off. The defenders of Beiyuemiao had a battalion, and Battalion Commander Li Huichuan and the remaining soldiers, after fighting for more than twenty days, were exhausted. Now, without food or drink, they ate grass like wild men, and when thirsty, they drank their own urine. After three days, the Communist Army saw no movement in the temple and thought everyone was dead, so they approached carelessly. A burst of gunfire suddenly erupted from the temple, each bullet hitting someone. This greatly surprised Nie Rongzhen. Finally, he had to resort to a final trick, releasing large amounts of poison gas at each stronghold. The National Army was unprepared, and the defenders of the four strongholds were all poisoned before retreating. As the battle progressed to the edge of the city, Chu Xichun supervised the defense day and night, exhausted to the point where he would lie down on the sofa in his clothes for an hour or two, but would soon be awakened and take his guards to each defense position to comfort and encourage the soldiers. The city's supplies relied solely on the air force dropping ammunition. All materials, except for fuel, were in great shortage. At that time, prices reached an appalling level. The following table compares prices before and after the siege was lifted:

Item Unit Price during Siege Price after Siege Lifted

Millet 1 Dou 20,000 Yuan 4,000 Yuan

Oat 1 Dou 6,000 Yuan 1,900 Yuan

White Flour 1 Jin 3,800 Yuan 700 Yuan

Oat Flour 1 Jin 2,400 Yuan 450 Yuan

Sorghum 1 Dou 6,000 Yuan 1,900 Yuan

Because of this, many people starved to death.

The more difficult the situation became, the more determined the soldiers and civilians were to fight to the end! Chu Xichun was from Lixian County, Hebei Province. The Communist Army mysteriously brought his mother and third uncle from their hometown and threatened them to persuade Chu to surrender, but Chu remained unmoved. The Communist Army then asked people familiar with Chu to write letters persuading him to surrender, but he tore all the letters to pieces.

The Communist Army also promised its soldiers that they could pillage for three days after entering the city! Like the promise made to Japanese soldiers when they attacked Nanjing. If Fu Zuoyi had not decisively sent troops to Jining, Datong would inevitably have been lost. The victory at Jining was also the rescue of Datong. On September 16th, the National Army charged out of Datong, displaying their long-suppressed skills, venting their accumulated resentment on the bullets, killing with great satisfaction. According to the figures released by Chu Xichun, the casualties of the two armies during the 45 days were: more than 20,000 for the Communist Army, and about 2,000 for the National Army.

Chu specially arranged for us to watch a live ammunition drill by his troops. A cooked egg was placed on a brick, and another brick was placed on top of the egg. At a distance of seventy meters, a shot hit the egg squarely, making the shooter a first-class marksman. The egg was then awarded to the shooter to eat. Fifteen soldiers participated in one drill, each limited to three shots. Seven out of the fifteen soldiers hit the egg, and all the others hit the brick. "Are the heads of the Eighth Route Army as big as eggs? Are they as big as bricks?" Chu said excitedly, holding a broken egg, to confirm the certainty of the Datong victory.

Visiting Kouquan and Pingwang

The smiles with which the people of Datong welcomed us were mixed with tears! The Communist Army did not enter the city, so the damage within the city was relatively small. Outside the city, wherever the Communist Army set foot, buildings were reduced to ruins and fields were devastated. Now, out of 300,000 people, more than 80,000 have no clothes, no food, and no home to return to. We went to inspect the battlefield on the outskirts of the city on a new moon night. Shaling, originally a village of 150 households, was reduced to a pile of rubble. A Reuters reporter described it as resembling the "Normandy battlefield." Both Caifulou Temple and Beiyuemiao Temple were historical sites, but both temples had disappeared. Even the mud eyes of the Beiyue Emperor were dug out. The destruction of the train station was as terrible as that of Zhangjiakou.

On November 3rd, we took a special train to Kouquan and Pingwang for inspection. The Yongdingzhuang coal mine in Kouquan, along with the Xinzhou, Meiyukou, Si Jia Liang, Baidong, Si Zhi Gou, Tongbao, and Baojin coal mines, comprised the eight Datong coal mines. During the Japanese occupation, they could produce 8,000 tons of coal per day, supplying the needs of North China. The Pingwang power plant had a capacity of 21,000 kilowatts, the largest in North China. These were all national treasures. When the National Army withdrew, they did not move a single screw. Chu Xichun said it well: "Two brothers quarreling should not destroy the ancestors' property!" But the Communist Army destroyed everything! The eight coal mines are now being mined using old methods, producing only 700 tons of coal per day. The Pingwang power plant is now a dilapidated ruin. Some "busy bodies" believe that the destruction was due to the war. Regardless of how the war started, both the National and Communist Armies were parties to it, but the National Army did not move a hair, while the Communist Army carried out extensive destruction. This is a significant difference, and it allows the people to clearly see their true colors, which cannot be covered up with a single sentence.

We lingered and mourned in both places for a long time before taking a car back to the city. Halfway there, in the swirling yellow sand, suddenly more than 300 workers and their families knelt down in front of our car. This caused my heart to tremble violently. I thought it was the scene of "stopping the road to appeal grievances" that often appeared in old novels.

"Do you have any grievances?" Chu Xichun asked them.

"Uh, Commander-in-Chief..." A few elderly people at the front knelt down again. "The Eighth Route Army..."

"Oh! They are talking about the Eighth Route Army." Chu said, turning back to us, and then he told the workers: "Don't kneel, tell me quickly what you want to sayâthey are Chinese and foreign journalists who have come specifically to interview you."

We immediately felt ashamed! Endless wars have caused countless tragedies, and what help can writers offer to these victims?

Rain Delays Us in Datong

According to the planned itinerary, we were supposed to return to Nanjing on the 4th, but the special plane suddenly developed a malfunction, so we stayed in Datong for another day. We had some spare time to appreciate the historical sites. Yungang was only recovered on the afternoon of the 3rd, and it was said that the Communist Army had planted many landmines, so it was inconvenient to go. We only visited the Nine Dragon Wall and the Upper and Lower Huayan Temples. The Nine Dragon Wall is made of glazed tiles, and each dragon has a different expression. The Huayan Temple has been turned into a warehouse, so we only saw a few statues.

Commerce in Datong has declined and not yet recovered. Only copper kettles and copper pots are famous products. There are many women with bound feet in the city, said to be refugees who have fled from the countryside. The women in the city like to imitate Beiping, but they are always several decades behind. There is no Peking opera here, only one theater performing Shanxi Bangzi opera, which is full of noisy sounds and not a single sentence can be understood. The Datong Executive Headquarters left when the city was besieged, and returned after the siege was lifted, as if they were also seeking refuge. Regarding the Communist Party representative in the Executive Headquarters, a person from Datong told me a news item: the original Communist Party representative was named Li Bo, and he was a brigade commander in the Communist Army. In the city, he always ran around alone. When the Communist Army besieged the city, this representative disappeared before the government and American representatives left. Later, people discovered that he was serving as the commander of the western part of the city, attacking according to the map! This time, the Communist Party representative has been replaced by another person, who no longer dares to run outside, knowing well how the people of Datong would treat him.

On the 5th, it rained in Datong, making the airfield muddy and impassable. The broken plane could not be repaired, and other planes could not land. The reporter group took the opportunity to go to Jining for inspection, and also sent telegrams to Beiping and Nanjing, requesting that a plane be sent to Jining to pick them up, because the airfield in Jining was better than the one in Datong.

### The Smiles and Tears of Andong

â Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

Andong Airmail on the 7th

Andong is a good place. It is a national gateway, an industrial center, a mining area, a fishing market, a water and land terminal, and also a scenic area.

Flying from Shenyang to Andong takes only forty minutes. The takeoff is across a vast plain, and after passing Benxi, one enters mountainous terrain. The mountains are barren, and only in the valley areas do some villages and towns occasionally flash into view. Soon, the view opens up again, revealing another plain that stretches to the Yalu River and extends into Korean territory. Andong has arrived.

The climate is better than Shenyang. The fields and trees in Shenyang are already bare, but here one can still see a yellow-green expanse, interspersed with splashes of red leaves. The green waters of the Yalu River flow leisurely, originating from Mount Paektu, winding for two hundred miles, flowing from here into the vast ocean. The scenery is exceptionally beautiful.

Two large iron bridges, different in appearance, span the Yalu River, connecting international transportation. Along the river stands the growing urban area of Andong. Across the river is Sinuiju in Korea, facing each other across the water, with the sound of boat whistles intermingling. The chimneys of our factories, the orderly factory buildings, already show a tendency to overwhelm the other side. From the airplane, looking down at the ground, the two urban areas are connected by the iron bridge, forming the special importance of Andong.

Black Smoke Disappears, Plane Sounds Quiet

The airfield is far to the southwest of the city center. There is a long asphalt road leading from the city to the airfield. Traveling this road, thirty-eight li long, one soon sees the large factories standing along the road, at the foot of Maoer Mountain, on the edge of the Yalu River. In the past, black smoke filled the sky, and the sound of machinery rumbled. Now it is quiet.

In terms of factories, during the puppet Manchukuo period, there were the "Manchuria Automobile Manufacturing Factory," the "Toyo Steel Andong Factory," the "Andong Cement Factory," the "Manchuria Industrial Factory," the "Manchuria Light Metal Factory," the "Manchuria Mining and Refining Plant," the "Yalu River Lumber (Shipbuilding) Joint Stock Company," the "Yalu River Paper Company," the "Andong Paper Factory," the "Liuhecheng Paper Factory," and the "Manchuria Textile Company Factory," among others. In addition, there were also large and small factories producing rubber, matches, and paper, thus creating the phenomenon of Andong's industrial development.

Unfortunately, only a few remain now. Some have even been burned and bombed by the Communist Army. Last evening, the reporter visited the huge substation that had been reduced to rubble, and also saw the Yalu River Paper Mill, which was in the same condition as the substation. Everyone felt very heartbroken. The common people said: "At first, the Soviet army moved some of the machinery from the major factories. Today, the Communist Army, in addition to moving some away, thoroughly destroyed the rest." When visiting the "Mudanjiang Shipyard," we were fortunate not to see the tragic scene of fire. Several unfinished large wooden boats and piles of lumber were quietly there. A person who claimed to be "the person in charge of the company" said: During the puppet Manchukuo period, 300 large wooden boats could be built each year. After the restoration, there were 92 unfinished small wooden boats on the shore and 42 in the river. After being used and towed away by the Communist Army over the course of a year, there are now fewer than 20 left.

Once Turned Into a Dark Hell

From the front of the destroyed "Anfeng Railway Bureau," we walked to the Yalu River Bridge. The two large iron bridges spanning the Yalu River stood tall and serenely over the river. The one on the right was completed in 1911, during the Meiji era in Japan. The one on the left was marked with the year 2601 of the imperial era. Each bridge was crisscrossed with barbed wire, woven in the same pattern below. Two sentries were watching the other side of the bridge. Barbed wire was also set up on that side, and Soviet soldiers were stationed there. Traffic was cut off, but a friendly attitude was maintained between the two sides.

Andong City no longer had the Communist Army. Several substations had been thoroughly destroyed, and the Soviet side was not supplying electricity. As a result, Andong City became a dark world. At the same time, there was no tap water to drink, and people had to drink bitter well water. Because of this serious problem, the local maintenance association once sent people to negotiate with the Soviet side. The negotiation location was the center point of the iron bridge. Neither side took an extra step. There were a total of two pairs of people, one interpreter and one negotiator. Three negotiations failed to produce any results. In addition, there was also a note from me, who was also the garrison commander, Zhao Gongwu, stating: When the National Army first arrived in Andong, Soviet aircraft from Sinuiju flew over the Yalu River and soared over Andong City. The note stated: "If an accident occurs, our side will not be responsible." The Soviet aircraft have not crossed the river since then.

The Sinuiju power plant is jointly owned by the puppet Manchukuo and Korean administrations, because the puppet Manchukuo also invested in it. However, Sinuiju has a large surplus of electricity, and the people of Andong are suffering from a lack of electricity. At the same time, the high-voltage line from Andong to Dalian is intact. The switch for transmitting power from Sinuiju to Dalian is located at our bridgehead. In addition to hoping for friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, we are also carefully protecting the bridgehead switch and the power plants and dams on our ground.

We stood on the bridgehead, looking across the river. Black smoke billowed from the factories, and steam rose. Trains came and went incessantly, and the riverbank was filled with ships of all sizes, some traveling upstream and downstream. Everything showed a tense and energetic atmosphere. On our side, the factories were crippled, the riverbank was silent, and the remaining three locomotives were shouldering a difficult responsibility, traveling back and forth between Andong and Caohekou. Everything is waiting for restoration and rebirth!

The People's Enthusiasm is Overflowing

Since the construction of the Dadong Port during the puppet Manchukuo period, Andong City has expanded its urban planning. The city limits extend from Dongdingzi in the north to Dadongman in the south, a north-south distance of about forty li. The rectangular urban area relies on the Yalu River, covering an area of about 297 square li. The population is estimated at 330,000, according to the statistics of the puppet Manchukuo in 1942. This includes 54,000 Japanese and Korean people. At that time, it was planned to create a city with a population of 400,000 within five years. Now, Japanese people are rarely seen, and the number of Koreans who have remained is not large.

The people of Andong have the typical characteristics of Shandong people, both in character and accent, and are mostly forthright and enthusiastic. Although they still hold many "Liaodong Military Region" Communist Army banknotes earned with blood and sweat, they still welcome the National Army, whom they see as "divine soldiers descending from heaven." This enthusiasm should be cherished and maintained!

Prices are lower than in Shenyang, but because much of the material has been taken away by the Communist Army, and because there are more people coming from outside, there is a trend of gradual price increases. Currently, only pork has increased from 50 yuan per jin in puppet Manchukuo currency to 80 yuan. Other price increases are similar. The circulating currency has been transported to Andong, and merchants from Shenyang have also come, which is also a factor in rising prices.

Almost all merchants have opened their doors for business, but goods are very scarce. The famous Andong silk fabrics have also disappeared. Inexpensive fish, shrimp, and seafood are also in short supply in the market. The reason is that people fishing on the riverbank or seashore are often shot at from the Korean side. Now, the road connecting traffic with Korea is also cut off, so where will the fish, shrimp, and seafood come from!

There are 36 elementary schools in Andong City, and all have started classes. The three temporary schools, Provincial Junior High, Senior High, and Girls' High, have more than 1,200 students and have also started classes. However, there is a lack of educational funding, and there are many other difficulties. Textbooks alone have become a problem. Although the provincial government took the great risk of "linking the seven provinces" by printing 10,000 copies of elementary school textbooks, this has not yet solved this serious problem.

Zhenwang Mountain, praised by the Japanese puppets as the "Number One of Manchuria's Eight Scenic Spots," although it no longer has cherry blossoms, its scenery remains. However, the Shinto shrine buildings, which cost a lot of money, are now bleak. Many defensive fortifications have been built on Yuabao Mountain, a key point in the city. The areas outside the city are also stable, and the people are accepting and supporting the government's construction with enthusiasm!

### Ghosts in the "Liberated Zone" â Excerpts from "I Know Everything and Say Everything"

â Zhu Yaotian

Ghosts Come to the Door Wanting Money â If the Ghosts Don't Leave, Something Will Go Wrong

Let me tell you a story about fundraising for "serving the people." Your ward chief, who later also became the village chief, often came to the place I frequented on patrol, so I knew clearly that he could only say two sentences: "The Communist Party is the best" and "No one else is good." Besides that, he knew nothing and was capable of nothing. I'm digressing a bit. Let me tell you the fundraising story. One day, I was chatting in the home of one of your people, and this ward chief brother of yours came. Your people generously took out your banknotes, 150 yuan, and presented them with both hands, saying, "â¦This 100 yuan is my donation, and this 50 yuan is for Zhang's family." At this time, the ward chief's beady eyes were staring at me, as if saying, "Why are you giving me the money in front of a stranger?" But finally, he put it in his pocket and left. After the ward chief left, I learned the details of this fundraising from your people. The fact is:

Your ward chief said the day before that a poor old person had died and had no money to buy a coffin. The ward chief had bought one on credit from the coffin shop, and now the body had been carried out. The debt to the coffin shop had to be paid by everyone donating some money. "Is there a donation register, a receipt, or an invoice from the coffin shop?" I asked. Your people said, "There's nothing." "Then why do you have to donate money to him?" I asked. Your people said, "If ghosts come to the door and you don't spend money to buy some paper to burn, the ghosts won't leave, and something will go wrong." We ended our conversation with a bitter smile. I think this fundraising story is neither "the Communist Party serving the people" nor "the people serving the Communist Party," but rather "the people and the Communist Party both serving real scoundrels." I wonder if Mr. Mao agrees with my statement?

### A Chorus of Anti-Soviet Voices

â Special Dispatch from Our Reporter Zhu Zun, October 25th

On October 22nd and 23rd, the British House of Commons discussed British foreign policy. On the first day, Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a report; on the second day, Prime Minister Attlee, opposition leader Churchill, and Minister of State McNeil delivered successive speeches. The atmosphere in the House of Commons chamber was tense and noisy. From my seat in the gallery, all I could hear was a chorus of anti-Soviet voices.

Bevin's report was unremarkable, simply outlining British foreign policy. However, Churchill's questioning caused a stir: "Currently, the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies have 200 divisions of Soviet troops, all organized for wartime. Is the Labour government aware of this?" He continued, "Before 1939, Hitler wrote 'Mein Kampf,' which made it easier to predict Nazi Germany's actions. But what are the Kremlin's current intentions and ambitions? It's a complete mystery!" Although some members of Parliament accused Churchill of being alarmist, and the London Times criticized him for making such startling claims in the current tense international situation, no one denied the gravity of the issue. British public opinion was united in the view that the era of "appeasing Stalin" should come to an end. Prime Minister Attlee, at a British Trades Union Congress gathering on October 24th, vehemently denounced the Soviet Union's policy of keeping its people ignorant and harshly criticized the Communist Party for its reckless behavior. Churchill followed up by referring to the Communist Party as vermin. This unanimous anti-Soviet sentiment in British government and society is unprecedented. After World War I, the British government spared no effort in attacking the newly established Soviet government, but that was merely a difference in ideology and ideals. The current attacks, however, stem from facts and the evolving international political situation, and may sow the seeds of a third world war!

Supporters of Churchill and some Conservative newspapers seized on the issue, drawing parallels between the current Churchill and the Churchill of the Munich era. They argued that Churchill's current startling pronouncements were similar to his warnings before World War II. Back then, he was also accused of being an alarmist, but his words were based on facts, and subsequent international developments confirmed his foresight step by step. The current darkness in the international situation is no less than that of the Munich era. Churchill has once again issued his warning, and although his voice may seem lonely for now, its truth will gradually be recognized by discerning individuals. This kind of argument is simply trying to re-heroize Churchill. Churchill himself does not believe his voice is lonely. He stated in the House of Commons: "A year ago, I gave a speech in Fulton, Missouri, advocating an Anglo-American alliance to defend against aggression. That caused a global uproar, and some British parliamentarians even rudely accused me of stirring up trouble. If that statement were made today, no one would be surprised."

Widespread dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union and the communist parties under its sway is evident everywhere in the British government and society. Churchill's explanation of the term "reactionary" was particularly humorous: "The Communist Party attacks us with weapons, we resist, and therefore we are considered 'reactionaries'!" Prime Minister Attlee also said, "If you are not a communist, you are a fascist." One member of Parliament, when mentioning Poland, made a very witty remark: "Every time Stalin sneezes, the Polish government suffers a major illness!" When McNeil mentioned that both the British, American, and Soviet governments desired peace, one member of Parliament retorted loudly: "Hitler also desired peace!"

British foreign policy is often seen as being in the wake of the U.S. State Department. This may be an exaggeration, but there is some truth to it. Given the Soviet Union's growing ambitions, it is to be expected that Britain and the United States would move in lockstep. Therefore, while it is true to say that the British Foreign Office is in the wake of the U.S. State Department, it is also true to say that Byrnes is Bevin's comrade. The conflicts between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union at post-war international conferences are similar, especially from a military point of view. If the Soviet Union is the target, there is no difference in the steps taken by Britain and the United States, nor can there be any difference. Unfortunately, the confrontation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is entirely a power grab. Both sides have great demands, and neither side has achieved its goals. Because the Soviet army is in Eastern and Central Europe, the Soviet Union refuses to compromise on any issues related to the Red Army's location. In North Africa, Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean regions, the British and American armies are stationed, and Britain and the United States refuse to compromise on any issues related to these areas. As a result, this dispute is becoming increasingly deadlocked.

Vernon Bartlett, a renowned political commentator and member of Parliament who is about to visit China, once wrote to Foreign Secretary Bevin, warning him that Britain's current friends are all right-wingers and reactionaries in various countries, using the nationalism of various countries to resist the Soviet Union's international policies. He advised Bevin to abandon this approach and not to lose the support of moderate left-wingers. He believes that Bevin's foreign policy, whether in Greece, Spain, or China, is one of "defense," so the so-called "masses" are inclined towards Moscow. Although Bartlett is non-partisan, his views may represent the general Labour Party members who oppose Bevin's foreign policy, but whether they can reach the ears of the Labour government's leaders is another matter. Although the British Labour Party claims to be socialist, it is difficult for its foreign policy to abandon its deep-rooted imperialist tendencies for the time being. Therefore, a cartoonist drew a satirical cartoon of Bevin. The cartoon is divided into two parts. The first part shows a group of British diplomats lined up, with former Conservative Foreign Secretary Eden standing beside them. The second part shows the same group of British diplomats, with Labour Foreign Secretary Bevin standing beside them. Moreover, Eden and Bevin are in the same pose, both giving instructions, both with their right hands in their suit pockets.

Given the British diplomatic style, especially during these days of heightened anti-Soviet sentiment, British communists and extreme leftists are undoubtedly in unspeakable pain. However, their power on the British political stage is limited. There are only 45,000 communist party members in the whole of Britain, and they only hold two seats in the House of Commons. Their mouthpiece, the "Daily Worker," recently slammed the flirtation between the Conservative and Labour governments, harshly criticizing Churchill and Bevin for embracing and exchanging kisses with Eden and Attlee. But this faint voice is unlikely to have any effect, and is merely an outlet for their own frustrations!

### "Nightingale Flies in the World" - On Screenplay

â Guan Yu

The screenplay for "Nightingale Flies in the World" depicts a singer who wishes to sing for the masses. This is a very bright and good theme. However, its plot has too little connection to this theme. Because the fact that the protagonist wants to sing for the masses is not deeply integrated into the plot. Her words and actions cannot be integrated as a whole. Language that is not put into practice, we call it a slogan. Here, the theme of "singing for the masses" becomes a slogan. But I do not deny some of its sporadic expressions, such as: issuing a 500,000 check to allow them to establish a music group, opposing price increases, etc. These do not completely fit the theme. Although she joined Ren Yun's band and provided free comfort to civilians, what connection did the lyrics of the songs she sang to comfort civilians have to civilians? The purpose of singing for the masses should not be just to let civilians listen to the songs, but to give civilians some inspiration and strength in life in the songs, which would be more in line with this theme. If it is only for the purpose of letting civilians listen to the songs, I think it is very possible to let the ticket prices in the theater increase, and then offer some complimentary tickets in the theater and distribute them to civilians. Wouldn't this kill two birds with one stone? Why must the theater and the civilians be separated? If the things sung in the theater are absolutely two different kinds of songs than what civilians can hear, then it must be separated.

In the play, Ruth committed suicide. Liu Ying and Ren went to wander around, truly singing for the masses. But we also see song and dance scenes on the stage. Are these also performed for free for civilians? If it is really performed for civilians, we have not seen a single civilian.

What else can we see in this screenplay besides singing and dancing scenes? Which line in this screenplay represents the character of the characters? Which plot in this screenplay is inevitable? No, everything is accidental, opportunistic.

Although the theme of this screenplay is expressed by a theme song, if we only look at the lyrics, which section can fit the plot or the characters? No, there is not even a shadow. All that is present are fragmentary shots taken by the director and moved in front of the audience in coordination with the lyrics.

If this screenplay was not saved by the director's flexible lens, it would become an empty thing. If the director's handling of the song and dance scenes is not beautiful and spectacular, then it will be a film that is not worth watching. Fortunately, the director's technique made us feel that it was not bad and worth watching after watching the film!

### On Directing

â Ju Lei

The second domestic film "Nightingale Flies in the World" has been released at the "Empress" theater. Generally speaking, it is commendable that Mr. Fang Peilin was able to use more than a month of work to shoot this complex song and dance film. The protagonist, Ouyang Fei Ying, is also appearing on the screen for the first time, and everything must be painstakingly planned and save time and money. Using the current situation of the Chinese film industry as an estimate, we should not make harsh demands, because Mr. Fang has used his bold talent and done his best.

I want to harshly review it, anyway, this is just my personal opinion, and it will definitely not detract from the crowded situation of tens of thousands of people in front of the Empress these days.

From the director's point of view, Mr. Fang started his career with clever set design, and the flexible use of lenses laid the foundation for his directing. In this film, the use of set design is his forte. The sets in "Shangri-La," the theater, and Liu Ying's home can be said to be perfect. It is a pity that Mr. Fang's energy is devoted to this, and he lightly neglects the "emotion" and "atmosphere" of the whole play. For example, in the opening scene where Liu Ying and the musician meet, it is said that she is disturbed by the blind pursuit of wealthy businessmen and the competition of reporters, and she is busy all day long. The audience will only applaud and shout good at the red singer standing on the magnificent stage. No one will hear her tired sigh when she takes off her makeup and stands in front of the dressing mirror. To cherish her fleeting years, to cherish her beauty, she gives her love to the audience on the stage, and after suffering all kinds of ridicule and flattery, she will still feel exhausted and lonely. Therefore, she has reveries about the soft and quiet night outside the window. Where can she find this source of life to nourish her withered soul? Just like Joan MacDonald in "Maytime," after accepting the marriage proposal of her guardian, John Barrymore, she immediately became confused and distressed. She avoided the warm applause in front of the stage, and in the quiet alley, she told her coachman to drive the horse's bridle and drive randomly towards the star-lit and gem-like sky. On the way, she met Paul in a low-grade hotel. Passionate, bold, handsome, and unrestrainedâshe had never missed this chance encounter in thousands of years, and she had been waiting for this moment wholeheartedly in thousands of years. The little boat of her dreams was parked in front of her, ready to carry her to the more vast and wider human sea. The love between the two people was not accidental, but had been waiting for a long time. Therefore, that night, Miss Liu Ying drove home, met Chen Tianguo in the rain, and was full of love and pity. But Mr. Fang did not deliberately deal with the crowd surrounding Liu Ying when she took off her makeup, so as to set off the scene of her exhaustion. Liu Ying avoided her pursuers and went home happily. There was no accumulation of fatigue in front, and there was a lack of passionate overflow behind. Therefore, it feels unnatural for the two to fall in love at first sight.

### On Ouyang Fei Ying

â Lao Bo

An actor who is on the screen for the first time is excited and scared. Because she always feels that she is acting. But Ouyang Fei Ying's play is unexpected. She is not as "stage-shy" as the actors who are on the screen for the first time. The director also fully increases the singing scene to reduce her chances of acting. The tone of her voice is similar to Mizzo-Soprano. The theme songs "Oath" and "Rainy" are not bad. She is a singer, and she sings really well, and it is pleasant enough. However, her acting skills cannot be considered successful. But she is a person who can be made, as long as she can humbly learn.

I hope that Ouyang Fei Jing can practice Mandarin more, watch the performances of foreign stars more, so that she can understand the starting point and methods of their acting skills, and even the degree of their acting skills, that is: how to be just right, how to overdo it, and how to be insufficient. Such an understanding is equivalent to having a foundation. This is a condition that an actor should have, and the purpose of learning.

More importantly, she can withstand criticism. Don't laugh when people say good things about you. Don't jump when people say bad things about you. Treat any kind of criticism as a reference, or use them as a mirror of your success and failure. However, the most important thing is to work hard and make preparations for the next level. Otherwise, there will only be failure!

### On Yan Su

â Jiang Wu

Yan Su has already met us once in "Loyalty and Righteousness Home". This time in "Nightingale Flies in the World" is his second appearance. Obviously, he is more successful than in the previous drama. In "Nightingale Flies in the World," he plays a stubborn and prejudiced old musician. He uses "stiffness" to express his stubbornness and self-righteous nobility, completing part of the character. His acting skills are very good, especially when he is in the hospital bed, driving Liu Ying away with a roar that is higher and more powerful than the other, forcing the other party to succumb to his three "get out". When he conducts, the smile on his face shows his pride and his success in training Liu Ying, and also shows his self-confidence.

He is an accomplished actor, so he can play his acting skills leisurely and naturally in front of the camera and under the mercury lamp. In the whole play, his acting skills are the most successful!

He is from Beijing and speaks fluent and melodious Mandarin, which has the power to make people intoxicated. But his appearance limits his acting, making him only able to circle in the negative roles, which is a pity!

### Right picture: Yan Su

### Random Thoughts

â Zhu Defeng

"Nightingale Flies in the World" finally followed "Loyalty and Righteousness Home" and was released. In the face of a constant stream of American films, the production of a domestic film is naturally welcomed by the audience, especially in this difficult and prolonged process.

Song and dance films have always been rare in domestic films. Everyone knows that the shortage of talent and the lack of material conditions are the fatal wounds of my country's film industry. However, we cannot stop doing it because we lack the above conditions. Although it cannot be compared with Hollywood films, it can at least gradually progress, promote some educational significance and make some achievements.

"Nightingale Flies in the World" is the first song and dance film after the victory. The director, Fang Peilin, can be said to be an experienced expert in directing song and dance films in domestic films. After watching the whole film, I feel that several song and dance scenes are very good.

Ouyang Fei Ying plays Liu Ying. Although her voice is clear and bright, she sings well. However, some of her expressions are not profound enough. This is her first film on the screen, and generally speaking, it is not easy. Guan Hongda is very vivid, and his acting skills and expressions are very appropriate and quite natural. Yan Su's Ruth is also not bad. Although this film cannot be compared with Hollywood's colorful song and dance films, domestic films have their own characteristics, and of course their style is different from Western films. It has a different taste.

### Weekly Movie Short Reviews

â Zhu Xi

Mad Love

The theme is similar to "Jealousy in the Sea of Love", but the male protagonist's jealousy is changed to the female protagonist's. In the end, they all destroy themselves and cause harm to others, and the trial in court ends the injustice.

From its structure, "Mad Love" is better than "Jealousy in the Sea of Love", because the latter lacks too many strong components, and the threshold for teaching the audience to harm people is too refined. The former is better in these two points.

The screenwriter of "Mad Love" pays too much attention to dialogue and ignores the drama. Although some of the dialogues are very delicate and vivid, for example: the flirting couple Chang Kang Nawei Erde just finished typing "I want to marry you" on the typewriter. But its dull and boring scenes can be found everywhere, which is the screenwriter's negligence. Fortunately, the director took care of this point for him, and tried to use the activity on the lens as much as possible to make it "have drama" when there is no drama. When Kang Na came out of the living room door to work by the typewriter, the director deliberately let him walk out of the room, passing a swimming pool, turning a corner, quietly, of course, the scenery and colors are very beautiful, and it is matched with harmonious music; then he sat down to type. For the sake of "drama", Jenny Ge, who is about to have a lot of "dialogue with little drama", is specially placed on the flower shed, and Qi En Tai Ni is placed under the pool, so that the scene is not too dull.

The overall director's drama is not very good, but his efforts can be seen all the time. Qi En Tai Ni's first scene is too theatrical, but the latter part is very good. Kang Na Wei Erde is competent, and Jenny Ge is mediocre.

Between Men and Women

The story depicts the emotions of mutual consideration between mother and daughter and the depth of each other's intentions, but due to social habits, it does not match our country's situation. But the play is a good discussion.

If you say that this movie's director is not bad, it is better to say that the screenwriter's foundation is good; it is better to say that the success of the screenwriter is due to Dai Na Ba Li Mo Ya's prominence.

Dai Na Ba Li Mo Ya is the daughter of the late superstar John Barrymore, an American "artistic family" - they have been good at performing Shakespeare's famous plays for generations. The producer of this play used her ability to perform many aspects of the play, and picked a play with a stage actor as the protagonist for her to perform, which may be said to be specially written for her. In this way, the producer is quite smart.

Sure enough, Dai Na's performance is not bad, especially it is rare to play a twelve or thirteen-year-old girl. Although this kind of play is easy to please, it is also a fact that it is difficult to perform.

The old nanny's last return is superfluous. The screenwriter's intention is reunion, but this cannot avoid being "vulgar."

The opening and ending are both on the stage, and they are both used very well.

The whole play is about watching Dai Na alone. She alone can give you two hours of satisfaction.

Queen of the Nile

Mary Montan and John Hall are always the same -

However, the scenery and colors of this film are not bad. The several scenes of riding horses are also handled well. The several shots of rolling rocks are not too careless. Compared to "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" and "Arabian Nights", it is a notch better.

As for the actors, they are all their old partners. Mary Montan has played a lot of this kind of film. Before watching it, you can almost make a certain conclusion. But in a word, Mary Montan sells "beauty" and not "drama". If there is an actor whose acting skills can surpass Mary Montan, he will never be willing to act with her. In this way, you can know more about the actors in the film.

### Miscellaneous Comments on New Films

â Ma Boliang

Torrid Zone

Beautiful mountains, beautiful rivers, lakes, sunshine, moonlight, beaches, houses, what a beautiful world. If there is no love, all beauty is but desolation. I have always felt that a person's life is always their own world. They can never occupy another person's world, especially not share another person's eternal emotions. The heroine here is unwilling to endure the loneliness of her personal world, and suddenly harbors murderous intent, killing others while also killing herself. The theme of "Torrid Zone" can be said to be a gender reversal of the protagonist in "Jealousy of Love," with the motivation being the same. Although the heroine of "Torrid Zone" is more vicious and hateful than the hero of "Jealousy of Love," the despicable man is the one who is truly reprehensible. This heroine is certainly selfish, but she is more worthy of sympathy. She is a pitiful tragic figure. Sometimes we can quietly think about it, whose love life can insert the shadow of a third party?

Director Stahl is not an outstanding talent; the messiness of "Golden Earrings" is clear evidence of this. The achievements of this film are relatively good. It has captured many previously unseen landscapes, matched with pleasing colors, combined into a splendid backdrop. The scene of drowning the little uncle while wearing sunglasses has a dual subtle effect, incredibly clever. The pair of hands reaching out for help on the water surface and a few bubbles are the most vivid and powerful, unforgettable. The dubbing, with a few chimes from the mountains, has the lingering effect of three days around the beams. Other aspects are not explicit enough. The leading actress, Joan Tetzel, acts far more brilliantly than in "Modern Paradise." Some women are not necessarily beautiful, but they know how to make themselves look beautiful. Joan is the best example. Her train encounter and bedroom kiss request are more than seductive. Her clothing is very gorgeous, coupled with her unique sex appeal, fully sufficient to maintain her success. The leading actor, Richard Widmark, is not as profound as Gregory Peck, the quickly rising male lead in "Days of Glory."

Between Two Women

Is a string of farcical laughter. Cary Grant is still in his true colors from "The Awful Truth" and "Every Girl Should Be Married," treating love as a childish game, letting a daughter who works as an actress make a scene for her mother, causing chaos everywhere. The play begins on the stage and ends on the stage. Henry Koster's directing technique is fluent and smooth, constantly adding layers of humor, sometimes too exaggerated, like driving a car recklessly while ice skating, and throwing a woman into the river in a few scenes. It seems too degrading to women, noisy and lively, slightly crude, but otherwise brings gentle happiness. The leading actress, Diana Barrymore, gives a stunning performance, handling it with ease. She is truly favored by the muse. When not making a fuss, she opens her almond-shaped eyes and smiles sweetly, as lovely as June Duprez, and her demeanor is more elegant than Deanna Durbin, whom Koster personally promoted in the past. I think one day she may surpass Claudette Colbert. Her youth, health, and liveliness will make her an excellent comedy actress. Now she alone brings "Between Two Women" to life. Katharine Alexander can only play the mother. As the beauty fades, what can be said? Robert Cummings is just adequate.

Stone Flower

Scene after scene of dreamy paintings, dreamy colors, we are fundamentally following a path in dreams. The gathering of savages on the mountain plains, the flute playing in the forest, the little lovers' sad first kiss, the shadows and fallen leaves of girls by the stream, the buds of flowers, late-night conversations, the illusion of goddesses... Unable to understand the crude language of the Russian prairie people, the meaning of dreams sweeps across the eyes like layer after layer of colorful clouds. The clarity of the photography and coloring surpasses the paintings. It is the crystallization of music and art. Hollywood lacks this clear temperament. "Torrid Zone" has another kind of radiant scene, but it is definitely not the hazy nature of "Stone Flower." Americans have never imagined the green forests and cold rocks. The director's technique is slightly complicated, with dissolve in and dissolve out shots used uniformly. The dubbing failed to be fully utilized. Sometimes it is silent, not helping the emotions, but that one burst of pastoral flute is better than any other ten thousand sounds.

Spring and Autumn

### Moon Over the Qinhuai River

â He Tianjian

The moon over the Qinhuai River is no different from that in other places. It is not that the Qinhuai River is the only place with a moon, nor is it that the moon over the Qinhuai River has any particular sentiment. The moon is everywhere, and the Qinhuai River is just the Qinhuai River. However, to say where in the world the moon is most abundant, I feel it is most abundant over the Qinhuai River. Thus, the moon on the waters of the Qinhuai River becomes the central theme of this article.

I have not seen the Qinhuai River for ten years! If I were to visit the Qinhuai River during these ten years, I would be unable to bear hearing "Still singing 'Flowers of the Rear Courtyard' across the river." Therefore, I have decided not to go. But "The moon of old, east of the Huai River" is always lingering in my heart! Today, the enemy is defeated, the country is restored, and I must go! If I go, the moon will still shine on me over the Qinhuai River. â The moon over the Qinhuai River is no different, but the north bank of the Qinhuai River has become a marketplace. Singing sounds are noisy and fill the sky, the sounds of hawking mix on the streets. The Kuiguang Pavilion is no longer visible, and only the front building of the Qifang Pavilion remains. Wine shops and teahouses are covered in phlegm, and the Wende Bridge and Lishe Bridge have a piercing stench. The day boats are dilapidated, moored on the eastern side. The Qinhuai River is never clear and remains as filthy as ever. I got drunk at the head of the Wende Bridge, and a round cool moon gradually rose in the middle of the sky. I was slightly drunk, and saw no acquaintances around me. I only felt that the moon had a questioning intent, a sense of sadness! As if asking me, how could we meet here on this day, in this place? Your head is half white, how could you be here at this time, looking at me? Life is fleeting, how long has it been, and the head of youth has turned white! I cannot help but recall the Qinhuai moon ten years ago.

Ten years ago, in the spring of the 25th year, the spring moon, its color was bright. The autumn moon, its color was clear. This moon now is different from the moon then â at that time, my head was not white. I held a "solo exhibition" by the side of Zhonghua Road, and Teng Ruoqu wrote an article to promote it for me. â Now Teng is already dead! â One evening, Teng and I hired a singing boat on the Qinhuai River. Teng took out his composition in classical Chinese for discussion, asking me, is this classical Chinese? I said, those who study classical Chinese write new essays and think they are extremely new, but those who study new essays still find them old. It is the same for those who study new essays and write classical Chinese. Teng nodded. I further said: How can there be new or old essays, it is merely a matter of habit. The wine was already plentiful. A maiden of thirteen or fifteen plucked the pipa, playing the curved moon, bay after bay. The boat was already moved near the east city, and in the distance, Zhongshan Mountain stretched across the horizon, a stroke of ink in the sky. At that time, I did not know what fame or fortune was. And the moon was increasingly bright, watching the eyes of the singers, extremely charming. I cannot help but think of Little Jin Hong of the Qinhuai moon night ten years ago.

Twenty-one years ago, which was the 14th year. At that time, it was early summer. I held a teaching post south of the Qinhuai River. The painting boats of the Qinhuai River were densely packed like combs. On both banks, there were still river houses and waterside pavilions. The setting sun was on the mountain, and under the bright lights and painted curtains, there were those leaning on Xiao, and those laughing and talking. One evening, the moon was like water. I and a friend hired a painting boat, planning a drunken drinking session. There was a young and beautiful girl named Little Jin Hong, singing tunes like an oriole. I privately inquired about her, and learned that she was from a good family, who was tricked into prostitution, and I pitied her. Her ransom was very low, easily raised. A few days later, Mr. Huang Boqiu gave money to purchase my paintings through Mr. Sun Naizhan from the same hometown, obtaining fifteen yuan. This was insufficient, so I painted a picture of listening to songs for a fellow townsman in Beijing, obtaining forty yuan, and immediately bought Little Jin Hong's freedom, and pawned a fur coat to make travel expenses, sending her home. â Little Jin Hong indeed had a maternal uncle in Beijing, who was a stingy and unbearable person, hoping for his assistance but he would not help. Only at this point did he acknowledge her as his niece, which was also due to my intervention. From then on, I was on the Qinhuai River every night, and on evenings with moonlight, my interest grew stronger. But at this time, looking at the moon, I often had the bewilderment of "Thirty years like flowing water!" Truly, there was none of the mood of being in my twenties!

When I was twenty-one years old, I was studying at the Republic Prison School at Huaiqing Bridge, close to the Qinhuai River. I listened to songs and drank every night. Whenever I was drunk and flushed, I would often discuss national affairs with enthusiasm with Mr. Dong Hangtian from Anhui Province, taking the responsibility of clearing up the world as "Who else but me!" Putting a boat east of Banqiao, with willows on both banks; the bright moon shifted westwards, still lingering within, unable to bear to return.

Alas! The Qinhuai moon of today is still the Qinhuai moon of old, but people are already gradually old! What responsibilities, what affairs, are already unbearable to speak of to me today. I love painting, I love poetry, but I am not good at business matters. How to advertise, how to play tricks, I am truly unwilling to do. Although the water of the Qinhuai River is turbid, the moon of the Qinhuai River is still pure. I am on the Qinhuai River, my heart is like the moon. With a cup in hand, I call on the moon to drink together. O moon, will you regard me as a confidant!

### Chrysanthemum Art

â Chuntai

General Discussion on Painting

Chrysanthemums are spherical or a part of a sphere, so they are planar or three-dimensional radial. The painter who grasps this point will get their general form.

Chrysanthemums vary in thousands of ways, but analyzing them, they do not exceed the following types:

1. Petal Chrysanthemums: The flower head of a petal chrysanthemum has petals as its basic state. The lower end is tubular, but very short, not easily seen.

2. Tubular Chrysanthemums: The tubular shape of the petals extends, not showing the petal shape, but showing the color in the tube. Generally, the color inside the tube is darker than outside.

3. Lip Chrysanthemums: The ends of long tubes open into petals, and their color is often different from the color of the tube. Some tubes are long and lips short, some tubes are short and lips long.

4. Needle Chrysanthemums: The mouth of the tube is closed and slender, forming a needle shape. It is difficult to create such a needle ball entirely. Used in combination with thick flower heads, it has a special charm.

5. Silken Chrysanthemums: Single petals that are thin and long are called silk. These are rare and precious, being old Chinese varieties.

6. Curled Chrysanthemums: Petals that curl inwards are called "Ten Thousand Books," which are very beautiful. In the lower right corner of the drawing, "Buddha's Curly Hair," the tube color is yellow, and the inside of the lip is red.

7. Hairy Chrysanthemums: To create a striking effect, hairs grow on the petals, called hairy chrysanthemums, also known as prickly chrysanthemums. They come in red, yellow, purple, and other colors.

8. Dotted and Dyed Chrysanthemums: Even more so are those with dots added to the petals, such as the "Maple Leaf Reed Flowers" variety, which adds white spots to red flowers.

In addition to these eight types, there is another change, which is the evolution of the flower center, called "Supporting Cassia," which is also interesting in painting.

The basic colors of chrysanthemums are white, yellow, and red. Before the flowers bloom, these three major categories can be distinguished by the leaf color. As for the thickness of the petals, it is consistent with the thickness of the leaves. Chrysanthemum leaves are more difficult to paint than chrysanthemum flowers.

The green chrysanthemum is the most valuable, and its nature is also more delicate. Purple and orange colors are variations of the basic three colors. The so-called ink color is only the deepest red and purple. As for the composition of the petals, there are curved shapes, curves, jets, hanging threads, rotations, and various changes, increasing the complexity of the flower shape.

The illustrations shown are all cultivated in Tsinghua Garden, Beiping. More than a hundred species were written out in 1925, and subsequent works were added each year. The chrysanthemums of Tsinghua Garden have long since ceased to exist. I do not know if there are still many good varieties in Beiping.

### Poet's Character

â Bin Jia

A warrior and a poet are merely two incarnations of the same god. The existence of a god among us is like the existence of reason in our thinking activities. Therefore, let poets and warriors be our highest ideals.

One must first have the character of a poet, and then there will be "poetry."

### Shu Tieyun and Zheng Shuwen

â Huang Lou

During the Qing dynasty, there were two northerners who resided in Suzhou and were shaped by the Jiangnan culture. The former was Shu Tieyun, who had ten thousand rooms, and the latter was Zheng Shuwen in the Guangxu period. The clear and beautiful scenery of Wu, and the elegant and gentle human relationships, are truly enough to make people linger and be intoxicated, to achieve their metaphysical attainments. Even now, they make people unconsciously yearn for them.

Shu Tieyun married a woman from Wu, and was related to Wang Zhongqu of Xiushui. His wife was also capable in literature. The poems in Tieyun's "Ping Shui Qi Poetry Collection" sent to the person of NÃ¼chuang Mountain are affectionate and poignant, and one can imagine the elegance and depth of his boudoir. When he served in the military in Guizhou, there was a beautiful Miao girl named Long Yaomei. It is said that the commanding officer intended to give her to him as a concubine, but he refused. It was very common at that time for Miao girls in Guizhou to be captured by officers and soldiers to be used as slaves and concubines. The eldest sister described in the "Romance of Heroes and Heroines" was tall, with black skin, very similar to the race of Qianxi. Perhaps she was from the Shui An clan. Although the novelistic technique of "Romance of Heroes and Heroines" is not particularly outstanding, what it depicts is indeed the real social situation, which other novels do not have. After Tieyun passed the imperial examination, he had difficulty advancing, but instead gained some of the pleasures of a wandering scholar, probably influenced by his wife. He could speak the Wu dialect, so he became fond of Kunqu opera. Living near the Chuihong Pavilion, he naturally had the heroic and triumphant spirit of a little red singing softly while I play the Xiao. I once saw his handwritten drafts of Ci and Qu poems, written in small regular script on red squares, the characters were very precise and refined, already with a hint of the style of the Daoguang years. The people of the three Wu regions are all elegant and appreciate themselves, full of sentiment. Famous figures of the time, such as Sun Yuanru, Sun Zixiao, Wang Zhongqu, Cao Wenke, and even Zhang Chuanshan, who later made a living as a recluse, all liked to talk about the pleasures of marriage. This is not often seen elsewhere.

Zheng Shuwen was originally a Han Bannerman. In Suzhou, he worked as a famous staff member, a famous scholar, and a famous doctor. He married a woman from Wu, built a refined residence, and purchased and researched epigraphy, calligraphy, paintings, books, cultural objects, ornamental rocks, porcelain, and cuisine. He excelled in everything, especially in Ci and Qu poetry, calligraphy, and painting, which made him famous at the time. Contemporary officials and gentry all interacted with him, respectfully praising him. His ability to enjoy his talents and also enjoy his blessings is probably unparalleled in recent decades. His style is somewhat like Gu Aying of the late Yuan dynasty, although not as wealthy. His temperament is somewhat like Yuan Suiyuan in the Qianlong period, but his character seems to surpass him. He can also be considered a remarkable person. Generally, Bannermen have seen more of the world, and have always been keen on the enjoyment of life. Moreover, he came from a prominent family, and he resided in a peaceful and beautiful Wu region, and he was rich in knowledge and talent. This kind of achievement is not easy to put together. Elegance is a rare blessing. It requires the right time, the right place, and the right fate, as well as shared cultivation and talent. Moreover, this blessing of elegance is fleeting and not easy to maintain for a long time. Not only are there few such people in a generation, but even in a lifetime, one does not know how many days one has. His death was after the founding of the Republic of China. Peking University once offered him a generous salary of four hundred yuan to teach, but he declined. However, the sense of desolation at Jiangguan in his later years can be imagined.

Presumably, he was accustomed to the old family house structures of Yandu, so his residence, Qi Wangxiangkan, was a secluded and winding studio, small and exquisite. What Geng Zishan called "connecting the enclosed rooms" can be imagined as its compact structure. This type of residence is most suitable for living. In winter, it can avoid wind and keep warm, and in summer, reflecting the lush parasol trees and bamboo in front of the window, the scorching sun does not invade, and the mundane world does not reach it, naturally filling the room with coolness, as if in an ancient cave. It is also convenient for storage. The books, scrolls, stationery, incense, tea, wine utensils, and even the essential medicines, clothes, bedding, fans that are indispensable for living, can be easily taken and carried, easily accessible. Especially for people with broad interests, it is necessary to have several rooms with different facilities. One place for storing books, convenient for writing, with scattered paper and pens, which is fine. For painting by the pond, the windows must be bright and the table clean, with silk, brushes, inkstones, and water jars arranged on the long table, and the walls should be plain and slightly high so that painting axes can be hung. As for leisure and rest, and talking with three or five friends, it is also necessary to have strange rocks and famous flowers, accompanied by tea and incense burners, and musical instruments can be taken at will to play with. All of these layouts must be carefully designed.

In recent years, I saw a small axis with the meaning of "Drawing of Flowers and Shadows of Flute Blowing Under the Curtain, Pale Yellow Moon" painted by him at a friend's place. It depicts a concubine sitting on a Taihu rock step with her back to the viewer, holding a reed. The vermilion railing is winding, and the fine grass covers the feet. A branch of cassia stands tall beside her, set off by several clumps of bamboo. A round window is facing her from a distance, in which incense coils curl. A brocade bag containing a zither hangs on the wall. A faint color on the horizon sets off a moon, giving people a sense of etherealness like Guanghan. The brushwork is not much, but delicacy is still seen in the simplicity, probably written for a certain concubine. This kind of high and simple brushwork is often sought from people who are fortune tellers.

### Chronicle of Returning Home

â LÃ¼ Baihua

Rowing on the Lake

The rickshaws in Hangzhou are quite cheap. I got off at the city station and was charged 1,000 yuan to go to the provincial government. Later, a friend said that it was because I was a "stranger," and the actual price was 500 yuan. After the drizzle, the road was still muddy. The rickshaw pulled through winding deep alleys, white powder walls, black tile curtains. I seemed to be going to the countryside. While marveling that this famous city would retain such a flavor, what I came into contact with and felt was particularly cordial. Apart from the central streets, Hangzhou was not "superficially westernized."

Zongen and I walked towards the causeway road. There were few cars coming and going. We boldly walked forward. The chaotic state of jeeps was not found here. In front of us, several willow strands fluttered, sparsely shading a narrow and winding water. The road sign was labeled "Huanxi Road," so this was Huansha Creek. Everyone knows that Huansha Creek is the place where Xi Shi washed silk, but the location should belong to Shaoxing County, originally named Ruoye Creek. Perhaps Hangzhou is the capital of Yue, so it is not impossible to commemorate it nearby. However, a bay of water, shallow and silted, made it difficult to find the legacy, and I felt a bit lost. After passing Huansha Road, we arrived at the lakefront. I looked far and wide at the area of ââWest Lake, which seemed boundless, reflecting the Su and Bai dikes. If it really was the ancient beauty Xi Shi, then the north and south peaks, faintly visible in the distance, were her twin buns. Naturally, the illusion was too absurd. This must be blamed on old man Dongpo for singing a poem, "If West Lake is compared to Xizi," but later generations replaced "if" with "simply" in their eyes. I think if West Lake is to be compared to a beauty, it should be compared to an abstract beauty, "That beauty, a person from the West," the poet's nostalgic words for the flourishing governance of the Western Kingdom, such a comparison is more meaningful. It is best to compare West Lake to a mirror, a large mirror hanging in the air, reflecting all the good and evil in the world, or what people generally call a "bright mirror hanging high." According to the Song History, it was not a bright mirror hanging high, but rather "a mirror hanging in an empty hall." There was Chen Lianghan who was the magistrate of Duan'an County, and the people said, "Your heart is like a mirror hanging in an empty hall!" What exactly have we been shaped into after eight years of the forge? Will we be ashamed of West Lake's hanging mirror! In the light of the setting sun, we hired a boat and lightly floated on the lake.

Ten years without seeing the mountain spirit,
And passing over Huansha Creek again;
The lake's color is as bright as Lianghan's mirror,
How near does it reflect people's hearts?

A three-thousand-foot inverted hanging mirror,
All the ancient style is here;
Who is the person from the West to look forward to,
Green mountains like Dai and added eyebrows.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 95

â Ye Jingfeng

(The somersault with the gun that Tiger Brother used is one of the "barehanded weapon seizure" methods. I used to practice with my teacher. The method to break it is to aim the gun steadily, take two steps back, or jump to the side one or two steps, and you can still cover the enemy with the gun. I think this method, although adopted by Western detectives and combatants, is probably derived from our country's martial arts. Because without a martial arts foundation, no matter how hard you practice, you won't get very good results. Why do a somersault with the gun on your back? First, it surprises the enemy; second, it avoids the opponent firing the gun. No matter how much you lie down and dodge, it is not as magical as somersaulting with the gun on your back, and it can directly take care of the enemy in front. It's just a pity that this guy today is not an expert. He froze for a moment, so Tiger Brother was able to do what he wanted and solve him. If he had learned this trick, and retreated or dodged to the side, I know that Tiger Brother would have had more exciting boxing and kicking to perform. However, before using this somersault with the gun, you must consider three conditions: first, the opposing enemy is within the distance that I can reach; second, you must be alert to the weapon seizure technique, otherwise even if the gun has passed, it is useless and harmful; third, your own energy cannot be completely used on the somersault with the gun, you must take into account the fight after jumping up from the ground. This kind of fight is not limited to seizing the enemy's weapons, it is best to have one or two killing blows. At this time, don't hold back and try to launch the attack as much as possible. This is a game of life and death, it's either you die, or I die, there is no way to be polite.)

Just under Tiger Brother's blow, the tall man fell to the ground like a collapsing mountain, grunting in his throat, wanting to shout but unable to, only holding his hands on the injured area, struggling desperately, his legs kicking and thrashing wildly. Tiger Brother didn't care whether he was dead or alive. He grabbed the guy's collar, dragged him up and ran towards the gasoline area. I was a bit stunned at this time. When Tiger Brother started running, I was awakened and hurriedly picked up my and Tiger Brother's pistols, inserted them into my waist, and grabbed the hand-held machine gun to defend against the enemy catching up, and I could resist for a while. While running around the gasoline barrels, I quietly warned Tiger Brother to follow me quickly. The burning fuse on the ground was burning, not much was left. At the same time, it seemed that I could hear the pack of dogs running towards here.

We crossed the heavy obstacles, crossed the stream, and the gasoline area of the demon cave was already on fire. Before long, the fire grew bigger, and I thought it had burned to the oil barrels. I could also hear the sound of explosions. At this time, Tiger Brother was carrying the hand-held machine gun weighing twenty or thirty pounds, and I had German-style twenty-round pistols on my left and right (one was Tiger Brother's). I was not afraid of three or five people, but because I was afraid of a large team tracking us, we did not dare to take the main road, but walked diagonally up the high and low wastelands and mounds. After walking about five or six li, looking back, the fire was still raging and the smoke was billowing, illuminating half the sky red. The more than two thousand barrels of gasoline could probably be burned to the last drop. After running another one or two li, I suddenly heard a loud "boom," followed by a series of "ping-pong" explosions, truly shaking the mountains.

"Eh!" We stopped at the same time, looked back, and saw only a puff of thick smoke rising into the air, with a layer of yellow fog underneath, followed by a width of about an acre of fire, rushing straight into the sky. The fire flashed past, and the lingering sound of the loud noise was still vibrating in my eardrums, but the place where it burned was extinguished, and everything returned to silence.

### Poetic Language

â Bin Jia

The task of the times entrusted to the fate of the poet is hardship and scourge, it warns and urges: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair..." (Dickens: A Tale of Two Cities)

Poets know how to choose their own path, and when necessary, they will go from "emotional people" to "action people."

World Student Day

Today, Seven Years Ago:

After the German army occupied Czechoslovakia, they carried out massacres against students and professors in Prague and other major cities, resulting in thousands of deaths. Most of the remaining students were detained in concentration camps, and all higher education institutions were shut down. This was a tragic day.

To commemorate this suffering, the World Student Congress designated this day as World Student Day in 1941. This year marks the fourth commemorative conference, which will be held separately in Nanjing and Shanghai.

During this great war, all countries in the world have suffered, especially the youth of this generation, who have been most affected both physically and mentally. Today, as we commemorate the past, we must be vigilant for the future. Students around the world should unite and work together for peace!

A Song to Remember

A musical film telling the story of the musician Chopin, "A Song to Remember," will be showing in this city. I am willing to recommend this film.

Good music can cleanse the soul. In this city, which is almost devoid of music, this sound film is indeed very necessary to fill the void.

### Zhou Fohai's Death Sentence Is the Public's Will

When the traitor Wang Jingwei stole and occupied Nanjing, the traitors Zhou Fohai and Chen Gongbo were his right-hand men. The traitor Zhou harbored wild ambitions and intended to replace Wang. Therefore, he gathered his ilk and organized a puppet tax police corps to cultivate his power. At the same time, as the puppet Minister of Finance, he controlled financial power, further creating his countless crimes. When he was riding high, abusing his power, other matters can be discussed later. Just take the issue of issuing puppet currency as an example, it is already not enough to kill him. He halved the assets of the people in the Chongqing occupied areas, causing countless families to be ruined. If the traitor Zhou is not killed for this kind of loss, who will be held accountable? It is only because the Chinese people have always valued emotions and neglected right and wrong, and are also prone to forgetfulness. Seeing this generation of traitors, who were once powerful and influential, now succumb to the solemn national law, people cannot help but feel sorry for them and beg for mercy. Thus, they forget all their past sins at once, and instead sympathize with them. They believe the absurd nonsense of the ugly and wicked, saying that they should be forgiven. To be honest, if the traitor Zhou is spared, not only will our anti-Japanese martyrs sigh with regret in the afterlife, but even the likes of the traitor Chen Gongbo, if they have knowledge after death, will see that they were punished differently for the same crime, and I know they will also cry out in vain!

According to the indictment, the traitor Zhou committed ten crimes. Committing even one of them is already unforgivable, let alone committing all of them. Sentencing him to death is in line with both reason and the severity of his crimes. However, there is one more crime committed by the traitor Zhou that has not been listed, namely, his control of special agents and the brutal killing of loyal and righteous people. Today, when people talk about "No. 76," they are full of resentment towards the traitors Ding Mocun, Li Shangqun, Wu Shibin, and others. Little do they know that all these traitors were cultivated, brought together, and trained by the traitor Zhou. For example, in the case of the collective kidnapping of the employees of the Central Trust Bureauâs villa, the traitors Li and Wu, although acting as lackeys, were actually commanded by the traitor Zhou. This is clear evidence of this. How can the death of such a sinister and vicious person be enough to atone for his sins? If he is executed by shooting, it would be a great favor to the traitor Zhou himself!

Furthermore, the traitor Zhou's wife, Yang Shuhui, relied on her evil power to hoard goods, openly sell official positions, and recklessly plunder. After the victory, she was allowed to go unpunished, running around in Shanghai and Hong Kong to rescue her husband. A certain tabloid also reported that she was lending money at high interest rates in Jiangsu. Although the crime does not extend to the family, as stipulated by law, this adulterous woman herself is already riddled with sins and should share the same fate as the traitors Ye Jiqing and She Aizhen, and should not be allowed to escape the net of justice!

In February of this year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Shanghai and I was fortunate enough to meet him and speak about matters, advocating that the captured traitors should be tried and sentenced as soon as possible. In early April, I received his reply, stating that the matter had been submitted to the relevant authorities for prompt investigation and handling. At that time, seeing that the traitor Zhou was still detained in Chongqing, I planned to send another letter requesting that he be transferred to Nanjing for legal proceedings. Soon after, it was reported that Zhang was already transferred, saying that the traitor Zhou was about to be sent to Nanjing, so I refrained from sending it. Now that he has been sentenced to death, there is a possibility of commuting his sentence, which I really do not understand. To express public outrage, I do not avoid being trivial and write this article. I believe that among the compatriots in the occupied areas, there must be those who agree with me. I hope everyone will advocate together that this generation of major traitors must not be allowed to escape execution! (Que Chou)

### Shameless

â Wen Zongkong

When a bereaved family sets up a memorial tablet for the deceased, those children who are steeped in feudal ideas often like to prefix their father with "Illustrious Deceased Father" and their mother with "Illustrious Deceased Mother," as if to add to the mourning? If the deceased had indeed done great deeds in his lifetime, benefiting the country and making his parents famous, then prefixing the words "Illustrious Deceased Father/Mother" would be truly fitting. However, many deceased people lived ordinary lives with no achievements. If their conduct was clean, they brought neither fortune nor misfortune to others, and the matter simply passes.

Only on the 13th, I saw in an interview with a female reporter from the Heping Daily that when she interviewed Ms. Yang Yi (other newspapers wrote Yang Zhen), the wife of the veteran traitor Liang Hongzhi, at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road, she felt that the situation was very bleak. There was a memorial tablet on the table that read: "Spiritual Tablet of the Illustrious Deceased Father, Lord Liang Zhongyi." Isn't this a joke?

The traitor Liang Hongzhi organized the Reformed Government, and of course, he was also a major traitor who colluded with the enemy and plotted to resist our country. His crimes of harming the country and the people can be said to be outrageous. Now he has been executed by shooting, and the people are happy. His wife even said, "My husband and I had the best relationship. I suffered with him." She engaged in treasonous acts without offering loyal remonstrance, so "suffering with him" was of course self-inflicted. It is truly a waste to be from a family of scholars for generations, and now she still prefixes his memorial tablet with the words "Illustrious Deceased Father." Isn't this shameless! What exactly did he "illustrate"?

As for the traitor Liang calling himself "Zhongyi," it is also laughable. Only now do I realize that the reason he was named "Zhongyi" was to explain that he was willing to engage in treasonous acts. This point is indeed different from "everyone."

### Wise Words

â De Cai

Marriage is a landmark event in life, with three meanings:

(1) Transitioning from individual life to collective cooperative life;

(2) Transitioning from an era when others are responsible for me to an era when I am responsible for others;

(3) Ending training and practice (school life) and entering the era of entrepreneurship (social life).

Therefore, life should attach importance to the issue of marriage and should have a great and noble ideal. This ideal should be: "How can we create happiness for future generations!"

### Great Shanghai

â Hu Yan

The plan for the Greater Shanghai Municipality is already under study. East to Pudong, south to Nanhui, west to Longhua, north to Jiangwan Dachang, the planned Greater Shanghai is a world-class city with a population of fifteen million, the upstream of the Huangpu River, building active bridges, downstream opening underground tunnels, traffic flowing, bustling, it is really beautiful!

However, we must know that planning is the ultimate goal, and the realization of the plan must be gradually advanced step by step. The expansion of the city, like water flowing to the ground, first has small streams trickling in all directions, then expanding and converging, forming a decent river or pool. The expansion of the city depends first on the extension of transportation routes and second on the expansion of security police force.

In the past, our government, in order to establish a decent, own Shanghai outside the concessions, spent a lot of money to build a new Shanghai. The plan at that time cannot be said to be magnificent, and the vision at that time cannot be said to be beautiful. However, the plan is, after all, a plan, and the vision is, after all, a vision. The new urban center that Shanghainese have dreamed of for a long time has still not prospered and become lively, and the most important issue is still transportation and security. (This security mainly refers to seeking the fundamental stability of society, and the enrichment of the police force is only a temporary solution.)

If the stinky river near TushanwanâLujiabang, has already been filled, if the tram on Linsen Road extends to Caohejing, or there is a public bus every ten minutes between Caohejing and Shanghai, if the railway from the City Station to Longhua, Xinzhuang, or even Songjiang has been converted into a motor vehicle road, and the trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line are changed to terminate at Songjiang, if the police substations in Longhua and Caohejing are all changed to police stations with ample police force, guaranteeing the safety of manufacturers and residents, I don't see what obstacles the development of Greater Shanghai will face in the south.

To the north, if the terminus of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is changed to Nanxiang or Zhenru, and the railway extends south and west to connect with Songjiang, then the northernmost area of Shanghai Municipality has implicitly expanded to Nanxiang and Zhenru, and passengers and goods are transported to the city center via light railways or public buses, and the frequency of traffic will indirectly promote the prosperity of the market.

I believe that it is wasteful to use Pudong as a residential area in Shanghai. Pudong, this coastal area bordering the river, will be more suitable for factories and warehouses.

To the south, to the west, to the north, the development of Shanghai is unlimited, but we must pay attention to transportation and, more importantly, to security. Jiangwan could have been the headquarters of Shanghai, there are schools and factories there, but because the security in the area between Jiangwan and Shanghai is not well guaranteed, Jiangwan is still just a town.

The Story of a Psychoanalyst

### The Innocent Murderer 5

â Xu Guiting

Luson listened, paused for a moment, and said with a smile, "Mien, you won. You are my master, and I hope your insights are correct. But I don't know how I can pay your consultation fee."

"Let's talk about that problem when you have money."

"Then, when shall I come again?"

Mien hesitated for a moment and said, "Aren't you unhappy to talk about it anymore?"

"No, let's talk about it next time."

"Then, Monday, same time."

"Alright, I'll definitely remember to return this cane to you," Luson reached out and said, "Mien, goodbye."

Mien watched him limp out of the gate and stood by the window for a while in a daze. There was still a veil of mystery between the two of them, and Luson's figure gradually blurred.

Mien came home a little late. His wife, Bally, was waiting for him and said, "Hey, my love! I called many times to find you. Half an hour ago, the police called from Luson's house."

"The police?"

"Yes, they wouldn't explain anything. But they really want you to go there."

"That guy must have stolen another cigarette case," Mien said, "But I'll still go and see."

He hurriedly took a streetcar to Luson's house. There, a policeman was stationed. Mien said to him, "I am Mien. You asked me to come here, right?"

"That's right, Dr. Mien. Our police chief is currently in the hospital. You'd better go there."

Mien asked, "What happened? Is Mrs. Luson having trouble?"

The patrolman looked at him in surprise, then hesitated for a while before saying, "Yes."

"Is she okay?"

"I think it's better for you to talk to the police chief. The hospital is nearby."

The police chief was wearing a very neat uniform and looked a bit like a bank manager. He said, "You've come at the right time, Dr. Mien."

"I'm not a doctor. How is she?"

"Well, her condition is not good, but she is still alive. You said you're not a doctor?"

"Not a doctor, I am a psychoanalyst."

"But aren't you treating Luson? You must know his psychological situation and everything."

"Yes, I know everything. Does she still have hope of surviving?"

The police chief shrugged and said, "She took four bullets, that poor child!"

"Did he shoot her with a gun?"

The police chief looked at Mien and asked, "Yes, why do you ask?"

"I'm surprised that this happened."

"But he did do this thing, there's nothing strange about it?"

When Mien's eyes met the police chief's gaze, he suddenly trembled and felt that he shouldn't have said that. So he shook his head, showing a look of doubt, and didn't answer anything. (To be continued)

News Figures

### The Elegant General Bai Chongxi

â Gan Lai

Bai Chongxi and his nickname "Little Zhuge Liang" have long been famous throughout the country, and there is no need to introduce him further. The general is tall and burly, with a bald head. The shiny scalp, combined with his tall body, looks just like a thick copper pillar. He was born in Guilin, Guangxi, in 1893, and is now fifty-three years old. He graduated from the third infantry class of the Baoding Military Academy in 1916. Although Bai is from a military background, he is gentle and approachable in dealing with people. He often has a smile on his face when he speaks, and when he is happy, he laughs loudly, his voice is clear, making people feel happy.

When he was the deputy commander-in-chief of the Fourth Group Army, he stayed in Guangxi and co-chaired the administration and construction of Guangxi Province with Mr. Li Zongren, holding civic military training, so Guangxi once had the reputation of "the whole province is soldiers." During the Anti-Japanese War, General Bai served as the Deputy Chief of Staff and Minister of Military Training. When he returned to Guangxi for inspection, Guangxi was experiencing a widespread epidemic, and soldiers were falling ill one after another. The general was familiar with medicine, so he personally drafted effective prescriptions for treating dysentery and malaria, and printed and distributed them to various troops. The prescriptions are: Treatment for Dysentery - White Peony six mace, Aurantii Fructus Immaturus two mace, Aurantii Fructus two fen, Plantago Seed six fen, Angelica six mace, Glycyrrhiza eight fen, Areca Seed six fen. Treatment for Malaria - Chinese Sweet Gum, Dichroa Febrifuga, Pangolin Scale, Areca Seed, Red Dates, Glycyrrhiza three mace each, raw Ginger three slices. It is said to be quite effective. It turns out that General Bai is not only a good general, but also a good doctor.

Bai understands humor quite well and knows that it is the only good medicine to adjust the serious military life. Years ago, Luo Wengan, who once served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice Administration, traveled to Guangxi. General Bai had always admired Mr. Luo's knowledge and cultivation, so he held a banquet to welcome him and introduced him to the public: "Minister Luo is gentle and elegant." He has long had the nickname "Miss." Now he has come from afar, and he must have wonderful insights. I hope everyone present will hold their breath and listen quietly..."

General Bai's "resourcefulness" is, of course, due to his extraordinary intelligence, but it is said that half of it is due to his past staff, these four little brains are: Zhang Dingfan, Wang Gongdu, Liu Weizhang, Pan Yizhi. Zhang once served as the mayor of Shanghai and was most relied upon by Bai. General Bai used to dislike approaching news reporters, but recently he has learned how to deal with the clever words of reporters.

Weekly Chat - Discussion on Wedding Ceremonies

### A Cliche

â Hong Yin

The transformation of wedding ceremonies in recent years has two reasons:

The collapse of the old etiquette and the death of vulgar customs have made it necessary for weddings to have a new form, this is one;

The poor national economic situation and social instability have made it impossible for wedding ceremonies to be simple, this is two.

Due to these two main factors, wedding ceremonies have become varied in recent years, each with its own set of rules. From a good perspective, the social atmosphere has gradually tended to strive for practicality and not make excessive extravagance on "face"; from a bad perspective, general weddings are sloppy and chaotic, forming a disregard for the ceremony, so it is easy to get married and easy to divorce, which cannot benefit social stability.

Judging from the current situation, it is difficult to have a fixed form for wedding ceremonies other than religious ceremonies, and the detailed form can only be determined by each person's economic strength and preferences. However, if we talk about the matter on its merits and strive to be close to reason, then the decision of the wedding ceremony cannot overturn the two major principles that most people consider to be correct: simple and solemn. This may be an old tune, but it is the most enlightened proposition.

I believe that starting a family is like starting a business. There is no need to be unconventional, no need to deliberately make a splash, and no need to force extravagance to be happy for a while! The legal ceremony cannot be omitted. The atmosphere in the wedding (including music, clothing, organization...) must be expressed in an orderly, solemn, enthusiastic, and simple manner. On the other hand, such as the wording of the certificate, the advertisement in the newspaper, the content of the wedding invitation, etc., there is no harm in using vernacular, using more meaningful words, and not inheriting the old clichÃ©s of thousands of years! This shows that the new couple has a spirit of reform towards the old customs and bad habits of society. In addition, new couples should resolutely cancel all superstitious actions without taking a compromising attitude.

For a newly married couple, we hope that they have a deep impression of the ceremony, understand the social significance of marriage, and on the other hand, in the pursuit of simple ceremonies, we hope that they understand: the meaning of this "simplicity" is to be realistic in everything, not to make gimmicks for empty showmanship, and not to consume a lot of social resources for personal marriage! Marriage is the starting point of entrepreneurship, and the handling of the wedding shows their attitude towards the career from now on!

### Group Wedding

â Stubborn Stone

The wedding ceremony I idealize is to advocate the current "group wedding" ceremony. Below are my reasons:

(1) The group wedding ceremony is neither too simple nor too troublesome. (2) I think it is not necessary to pay much attention to the ceremony of marriage. The group life is certainly not as grand as the "old method" or "new method" of marriage in the ceremony, but it is more practical. (3) The group wedding ceremony can save money and reduce time. (4) Group weddings are popular, regardless of treasure and poverty, everyone can enjoy this wedding ceremony.

### Being Realistic

â Li Fengchi

Although the wedding ceremony had few changes in the past, it is unknown how many colorful changes have been made from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the present. In a nutshell, it is from complexity to simplicity. I remember when I was a child, I went to relatives' houses to eat wedding banquets with my parents, and it always took five or six days. At that time, the habit was that even middle-class families had to busy themselves for four or five days to hold a wedding. Rich merchants and wealthy officials often spent half a month or twenty days on a wedding. Relatives from afar had already come to congratulate them many days in advance.

Such extravagance cannot be said to be without the intention of stabilizing the relationship between men and women, but in today's poor and turbulent world, the rich are free to hold extravagant weddings, and the poor do not have to pretend to be "tycoons," resulting in being heavily in debt after marriage, and being sorry for the little babies of the next generation, and sorry for themselves!

### Holding a Dance

â

I advocate that, in addition to the statutory ceremonies that cannot be avoided, the remaining detailed methods should be left to the free decision of the newly married couple. Those who like dance music may hold a dance party and hold a music performance at the same time as the ceremony, so that everyone can enjoy themselves and leave. Dance parties and music are properly implemented and do not waste financial resources!

### To Tell the Truth

â Sha

Young people are most likely to have extreme attitudes towards wedding ceremonies. I think marriage itself is the most ordinary and simple thing, and there is no need to strive to be different in the ceremony. If you want to show transcendence, you might as well not get married! Not getting married, true celibacy, is indeed not "åº¸å¡"!
