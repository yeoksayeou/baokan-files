### Negotiation Conference Opens This Morning, Chairman Chiang to Preside in Person

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] On the eve of the Political Consultation Conference, proposals from all parties, after many days of preparation, are largely completed. Government representatives will host representatives from all parties at a tea party this afternoon. Public opinion in the temporary capital expresses deep hope for the future of this conference, and encourages all representatives to abandon personal prejudices and prioritize the nation and the people. Social organizations have also held meetings successively, issuing declarations, expressing incomprehension regarding the Communist Party's continued military actions in areas like Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Hebei, and Southern Shandong, while simultaneously proposing an unconditional cessation of military conflict. Consequently, although the Three-Person Committee has reached an agreement in principle, concrete measures are still lacking in practice. According to the Communist Party's conditions, their so-called cessation of conflict seems to imply guaranteeing their current state of division, while the government believes that thorough implementation must be achieved under the principle of unified military command for any progress to be made. This is the focal point of disagreement between the two sides.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] On the eve of the opening of the Political Consultation Conference, the temporary capital is filled with a tense atmosphere, and all parties place their greatest expectations on it. Today, representatives from various parties are extremely active outside the conference, unanimously hoping that this conference can achieve the goals of unity and democratization. Of the thirty-eight representatives attending tomorrow, only a very few will be absent due to illness or inability to arrive in time. The conference secretariat has established regulations for news reporters attending as observers. Foreign reporters entering the venue must first obtain a light green admission pass, which specifies their name and news agency, and stipulates that they must not carry handguns or wooden canes, otherwise they will be denied entry.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Political Consultation Conference will open at 10:00 AM on the 10th in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Chiang will preside in person and deliver a speech. In order to end political tutelage and return power to the people, the government legally conducted the election of representatives to the National Assembly before the war. However, after most of the representatives were elected, the War of Resistance broke out, making it impossible to convene the assembly. The government then convened the Political Participation Council in the 27th year (of the Republic), based on the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, as the national public opinion organ during the war, contributing significantly to supporting resistance and reconstruction. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the government, in order to plan for peaceful national reconstruction and implement constitutional government as soon as possible, has convened representatives from various parties and social elites to hold the Political Consultation Conference to discuss relevant issues. Although the conference will only last for two weeks, all parties have high hopes.

[Another Dispatch] A press conference for foreign reporters will be held at 3:00 PM on the 9th, hosted by Minister Wu Shunzhen, Vice Minister Liu Cuo, and Counselor Zhang Pingqun. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows: Question: What is the procedure for the opening of the Political Consultation Conference tomorrow? Answer: Tomorrow's opening will be presided over by Chairman Chiang, who will deliver a speech. The Secretary-General of the conference will also make a report. Question: Has Special Envoy Chiang Ching-kuo returned to Chongqing? Answer: Mr. Chiang is on his way back to Chongqing.

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Political Consultation Conference is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning in the National Government Auditorium. Thirty-eight representatives will attend, and the conference will last for fourteen days. The success or failure of this conference will determine China's new destiny. Chairman Chiang will serve as the chairman at the opening ceremony and deliver an opening address. The meeting will end at noon, and there will be no meeting in the afternoon. News reporters may enter the venue, and each foreign reporter will be issued an admission pass to facilitate news coverage.

[Our Report] A San Francisco broadcast on the 9th stated: An afternoon newspaper correspondent telegraphed from Chongqing, saying: "The eyes of the Chinese people, filled with hopes for China's peace and prosperity, are focused on the National Government Auditorium in Chongqing." The hall, under intense scrutiny, is slightly larger than a medium-sized dance hall. Over the past few days, craftsmen have done their best to make the venue an immortal chamber in Chinese history. This hall is where Chairman Chiang receives ambassadors from various countries. A portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen hangs high above, his benevolent gaze fixed upon the participating representatives. The conference will begin at 10:00 AM, with Chairman Chiang delivering an opening address, which will not conclude until 12:00 PM. There will be no meeting in the afternoon, and the real discussions will begin the next day.

### Ceasefire Order Not Yet Issued, Various Details Awaiting Discussion, Three-Person Committee Holds Fifth Meeting

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Three-Person Committee's attempt to find a solution to the Chinese civil war failed tonight. The hoped-for issuance of a "ceasefire" order has also not been realized. After the meeting from 5:00 PM to 6:40 PM tonight, government representative Zhang Qun said: "Various details have not been resolved, the future is not bad, but difficult!" He admitted that there is still hope to resolve all outstanding issues tomorrow night. At that time, "we will have something more to say." When a reporter asked if there was still hope, US Special Envoy Marshall replied: "Yes, of course! Of course!" The reporter asked if there were any unforeseen difficulties? Marshall said: "No." The reporter further asked if tomorrow's meeting would be the last one? Marshall said: "Hard to say." When asked about the ceasefire order before the opening of the Political Consultation Conference, he pointed out: The Political Consultation Conference will open at 10:00 AM, and the Three-Person Committee will reconvene at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Another Dispatch] Today, Marshal Marshall, Zhang Qun, Zhou Enlai, and others declared: an agreement has been reached on all key points. The meeting of the Three-Person Committee concluded at 4:30 PM today. Last night, Robert Smith, the US Charg√© d'Affaires in China, also joined the talks. This was the longest meeting since the Three-Person Committee was formed. Marshal Marshall had originally planned to dine with the Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, at 7:30 PM last night, but he did not leave the meeting until 9:10 PM. He smiled as he walked out of the long meeting room, as did the other participants. Marshal Marshall refused to make any statement. Zhou Enlai said that although an agreement has been reached, the "ceasefire" order has not yet been issued. Other key points resolved include the restoration of transportation and the repatriation of Japanese troops. Zhou Enlai issued an oral statement saying: "The main parts of various issues have been resolved, but some details remain to be discussed and addressed." The actions of the National Army in Jehol Province have been criticized in some quarters, but the government authorities insist on their position that, based on the reason that Jehol Province was an Allied victory after the Japanese surrender, the actions of the National Army are clearly legitimate. The government side claims that there was no trace of the Communist Army in Jehol Province before the Japanese surrender, and the actions of the National Army cannot be compared with those in other regions and regarded as hostile actions against the Communist Army.

[Our Report] A San Francisco broadcast on the 9th at midnight stated: Marshall, Zhang Qun, and Zhou Enlai held their fourth meeting this afternoon. This fourth meeting may be the last meeting, and it is possible to issue the order before 8:00 AM tomorrow (the 10th) and organize an agency to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire order.

[United Press, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] The Three-Person Mediation Committee held its fourth meeting today. No final agreement has been reached on the cessation of conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists. The meeting will be extended to tomorrow. If the ceasefire order is not issued today, the hope for a ceasefire before the opening of the Political Consultation Conference tomorrow will be dashed. After today's meeting, Zhang Qun told reporters: "The situation is not bad, but the problem is difficult. The committee's task is not completed and cannot release news. Negotiations will continue." When reporters asked Special Envoy Marshall whether he still had hope, Marshall replied affirmatively, saying, "No unexpected difficulties have arisen."

### Working Together to Achieve Unity: Guangdong Provincial Assembly Proposes Five Demands, People's Organizations in the Temporary Capital Urge the Communist Party to Awaken

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th dispatch] The Provincial Assembly recently telegraphed the Executive Yuan to forward to the Political Consultation Conference five demands: (1) Return power to the people. (2) Return power to the nation. (3) Communist Party troops should immediately cease their actions and restore transportation. (4) The scope of the Political Consultation Conference should be limited to not infringing upon the authority of the National Assembly. The results of the consultation should still be decided by the national government to uphold national laws and discipline. (5) All parties should adopt an attitude of working together harmoniously to seek a plan for peaceful reunification and national reconstruction, and no attempt should be made to extend their influence or divide political power for personal gain.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th dispatch] Various people's organizations in the temporary capital held a New Year's celebration on the 8th, attended by more than 400 representatives from 185 units.

After heated discussion, they unanimously agreed to issue a declaration on the current situation in the name of the association, citing the ancient saying "All under heaven will be unified" and pointing out the importance of national unity. The return of military power and the elimination of division cannot be delayed for even a moment.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th dispatch] Compatriot associations from various provinces in North China residing in Chongqing jointly wrote to the Political Consultation Conference and the attending members on the 9th, stating the hardships of the people and appealing to the Communist Army to stop instigating chaos and seek national administrative unification as soon as possible.

### National Army Has Entered Yingkou, Expected to Victoriously Enter Shenyang Within Five Days, Vanguard Troops in Jehol Province Arrive at Yebaishou

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 9th dispatch] The troops advancing eastward from Jinzhou and Panshan entered Yingkou on the 9th.

[United Press, accompanying General Du Yuming's headquarters correspondent, 9th dispatch] The National Army entered the important port of Yingkou in Liaodong Bay on the morning of the 9th. While I was in General Du's office, the commander of the 52nd Army happened to send a report stating that his troops had arrived in the suburbs of Yingkou last night and began entering the city this morning, "The entire city can be in the hands of the National Army by dusk." The National Army's entry into Yingkou puts approximately 60,000 Communist troops stationed south of the city at risk of being cut off. The commander said that residents of Yingkou came to welcome them this morning, and hundreds of Communist troops surrendered to the army. It is estimated that approximately 5,000 Communist troops are strongly defending Yingkou, in addition to 1,000 Koreans. Most of the Communist troops in Yingkou come from the Shandong Peninsula and are equipped with weapons from the Japanese Kwantung Army. The 52nd Army has been marching on ice and snow from Goubangzi at sub-zero temperatures for three days, mostly on foot because the railway line has been severely damaged.

[Another Dispatch] Recent news states that the Soviet side has agreed that General Du Yuming's troops may enter Shenyang on January 15, but it is reported that a large number of Soviet troops are still stationed in the city, showing no signs of withdrawal.

A part of the Second Army Corps will guard Changchun, and the majority will be assigned to various cities in the Northeast to assist in the takeover. It is reported that the Second Army Corps, estimated to be about 10,000 people, originally belonged to the puppet Manchurian army. After the Japanese surrender, they surrendered to the central government. The soldiers are highly educated and well-equipped. A cavalry regiment of the corps has been ordered by General Du Yuming to enter Jehol Province.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 8th dispatch] The situation in Jehol will soon take a sharp turn for the worse. The National Army can enter the hinterland of Jehol from the southeast and two routes. A part of the National Army here will open up the Gubeikou direction.

(4) Exported goods that are transported from Kunming or through Kunming to Vietnam must be taxed in Kunming. Those transported from other places in Yunnan to Vietnam can be taxed in Simao, Mengzi, Maguan, Hekou, Bisezhai, and other places.

### Correction of Letter

The Central Wireless Yuan Equipment Factory recently sent a letter stating: "The news published in your newspaper on December 30 that the Wireless Electronic Equipment Factory will move to Peiping is inconsistent with the facts.

### Peiping and Tianjin Begin Exchanging Puppet Banknotes, Finance Ministry Officials Say Financial Prices Will Not Be Affected, Central Printing Factory Prepares to Start Work in Peiping

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 8th dispatch] Yesterday was the first day of the exchange of puppet United Reserve Bank notes for legal currency in the Peiping-Tianjin area. In addition to the Central Bank, 11 public and private banks and 2 silver houses in the city exchanged at the same time. Because the exchange period is still more than four months, people are not rushing to exchange, so there is no crowded scene in front of the banks, and the bank staff are unexpectedly relaxed. The reporter personally went to the exchange office of the Bank of Communications in Jiaomin Lane at 10 o'clock and saw only a dozen exchangers, mostly shop clerks, holding mostly five-yuan and ten-yuan United Reserve Bank notes. Because in the midst of rising prices, these small notes have gradually lost their status as payment tools. It is heard that the official preparation work for the exchange in Peiping and Tianjin is generally good. A considerable amount of small-denomination 100-yuan legal currency notes transported from Chongqing is available. Soon, the printing of legal currency in Shanghai can also be transported to Peiping along the sea route. The printing factory is also preparing to start work, and the source of banknotes may not be a major problem. The social impact of the exchange of puppet United Reserve Bank notes is worthy of attention. Today, a Finance Ministry official told reporters that after the announcement of the exchange rate of one to five between legal currency and puppet United Reserve Bank notes, there was no fluctuation in the Peiping-Tianjin market. Today, the exchange has begun, which is the implementation of the established exchange rate. It is expected that it will not affect financial prices. However, according to newspaper commentary and street talk, it is not so optimistic, because the so-called small-denomination 100-yuan legal currency notes in Peiping are equivalent to 500 yuan of United Reserve Bank notes, which is the most common payment tool for daily life. In the future, 100-yuan and 10-yuan United Reserve Bank notes will decrease daily due to the exchange, then at least five times the 100-yuan legal currency notes will circulate in the market, and its banknote prices will definitely affect finance. As for the issuance and circulation of the puppet United Reserve Bank, according to the reporter's investigation, the total amount issued by its head office and branch bank vault, a total of 190 billion, is mostly circulated in Hebei, especially Peiping and Tianjin, followed by Shandong, then Shanxi, and the least in Henan. There are more in cities than in rural areas. Its reserve fund is calculated based on 170,000 taels of gold and a small amount of silver. According to the current price, it accounts for one-tenth of its issuance amount. It is also learned that the Peiping-Tianjin area is the first phase of the exchange of puppet United Reserve Bank notes. Ji and Jin can only be processed after order is stable.

### A Record of Walking Around Pengcheng (Part 1)

‚Äî Shao Shenzhi

Xuzhou is the ancient Pengcheng. King Huai of Chu once moved his capital here from Yuyi. At that time, Xiang Liang was fighting Zhang Han, breaking through Dingtao, and besieging Yanggu. Qin sent reinforcements to counterattack, and the Chu army was defeated. Liang died, and the Chu generals Xiang Ji and Liu Bang were engaging in Chenliu. They then led their troops eastward, and Chu moved its capital north, which was an active measure to reorganize the declining situation in military and political affairs. In the second year of Chu-Han, Xiang Ji attacked Qi, and Liu Bang came out of Hanzhong with 560,000 soldiers of the lords, attacking Pengcheng and holding a grand banquet. Xiang Ji personally led 30,000 troops, starting from Yutai in Lu, reaching Xiaoxian, circling around Pengcheng. The Han army heard of it and was defeated. More than 200,000 people died entering the Gu, Si, and Sui rivers, and Liu Bang himself was almost captured. According to historical records: there was a great wind and darkness, the Chu army was in chaos, and Bang escaped.

Looking back at the great battle of Xuzhou seven years ago, the Japanese invaders also moved around Xuzhou from our right wing, encircling it. However, the scale was unprecedented in the history of warfare. Xuzhou fell on May 19, 1938. A large group of reporters broke through with the army, and the shadows of the flames of war are still vivid. When I, the reporter, returned to this land and got off the train, I only saw cattle, horses, and donkey carts under the dim light. With large armies gathered and strict guards, I still felt the pressing war intent of this ancient battlefield. I stayed in Xuzhou for several days and visited various parties, but due to the hurried pace, I could only record my impressions.

Currently, the Jinpu railway north of Xuzhou is still not open, but eastward to Lianyungang and westward to Kaifeng, passenger and freight transportation is very normal every day. A special express train will also be opened between Bian and Kaifeng soon. The Linzao branch line is repaired and then cut off. It is said that there is a force of the Eighth Division of the New Fourth Army near Linyi. When asked when the train could cross Lincheng and go north, the military and railway authorities made no statement.

The Jinpu railway was originally uniformly dispatched by the Jinpu Railway Bureau. After the Japanese invaders occupied it, they used Cao Lao Ji as the boundary. The north was operated by Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway), and the south belonged to the Central China Railway Company. When we took over, we also proceeded according to the two systems of North and Central China. However, for the convenience of management, the Puxu section was extended to Yangqi outside Xuzhou, and the Puxu Section Management Office was established. Xuzhou is the Xuzhou Railway Bureau, with its jurisdiction extending north to Yanzhou, east to Lianyungang, and west to Yangji, west of Dangshan. In the future, when the takeover is completed and order is fully restored, it will need to be readjusted. In any case, Xuzhou will still be the hub connecting the Jinpu and Longhai railways, and the center for the distribution of merchants and goods. Looking forward to the future of peace and national construction, Xuzhou undoubtedly has its new mission. The following lists the agricultural products transported from Xuzhou each year before the war, which were sold in various places in Beijing and Shanghai (in tons):

Peanut kernels 24,000 Watermelon seeds 10,000

Soybeans 20,000 Wheat 100,000

Golden needles 600

As for livestock products, 10,000 yellow wolf skins, 8,000 dan of cowhide, and 5,000 dan of sheepskin were transported to Beijing and Shanghai annually. A large quantity of sorghum wine was concentrated in Donghai and shipped to Qingdao and Shanghai. According to Donghai statistics, it reached 800,000 dan annually. The importance of Xuzhou's commercial transportation can be seen in general.

In the past, freight transportation on the Jinpu line accounted for 70%, and passenger transportation accounted for 30%. According to current statistics, freight transportation only accounts for 30%. This figure is an indicator of the order of local production. As for the current transportation capacity, taking the 107 locomotives received in the Puxu section as an example, it has exceeded half of what it had before the war.

The Japanese invaders obviously operated Xuzhou with the purpose of military control and economic exploitation. I, the reporter, have a deep impression of the architecture in the Xuzhou urban area. The roads are as wide as those in Nanjing, and the houses are mostly built of reinforced concrete, and they are mostly in the "—Ç–æ—á–∫–∞" (pillbox) style, with gun holes as dense as honeycombs, full of war intent. Compared with the old and simple old city area around the Xima Terrace, I deeply feel the great terror of the aggressors. Their construction focus was on transportation, to strengthen their occupation of points to meet military needs. I, the reporter, visited the Zifang Mountain tunnel, which had two automatic thousand-door telephone switchboards and a 250-kilowatt wireless radio station. There was also a railway hospital, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 mu, with no less than thousands of beds, comparable to another field hospital in the suburbs. The equipment included a complete laboratory that could perform various biochemical tests. The president of the hospital, Japanese Dr. Yokota, is still retained. According to what he told me, he is cultivating penialin. Climbing Yunlong Mountain, you can overlook the urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãXuzhou, with barracks lined up. In addition to the four barracks in the southeast, northwest, and north, there are also urban barracks. Judging from the architecture, each barracks can accommodate a division. What is noteworthy is that the staff dormitory of the Jinpu Road is the same in size and layout as the barracks. Looking at it from a high place, it is not easy to distinguish them.

I, the reporter, talked about this with a trustworthy businessman. He said, "Those Japanese lads are not bad. They don't smoke or drink, and they build houses and roads every day." It seemed that after the restoration, this kind of construction project had stopped, and some extravagant new phenomena were not liked by the northern people. I, the reporter, felt deeply worried when I heard this.

The Japanese invaders' publicly stated plan was to build a city with a population of 500,000. The first phase of the plan, the setting of road zoning, ended last year and entered the second phase. According to Japanese statistics, the population last year reached 200,000, with more than 13,000 Japanese residents. Compared with 1938, it increased by one-third, which was due to the expansion of construction projects and the absorption of a large amount of labor. Many enlightened people shouted loudly: "Don't just look at the surface, the current Xuzhou is built with the blood and flesh of the Chinese people!"

There are indeed many buildings in Xuzhou, but the housing shortage is still serious. The reason is mainly due to uneven distribution and abuse. There are many units of troops entering and passing through Xuzhou, each with a communication office or garrison office, or even other names. This may be a factual need, but what I, the reporter, saw was that each unit occupied a large Western-style building, and some officers even occupied Western-style houses, marked at the door with "Residence of the Director of So-and-so," and stamped with the unit number. After Gu Zhutong, the director of the Pacification Headquarters, arrived, he stated that no more communication offices would be allowed below the army, but the rectification of discipline must be based on learning from the past to avoid future mistakes, and not just start with new regulations. Because the army needs barracks, Xuzhou established a Barracks Allocation Committee to coordinate housing. All those occupied by the enemy and puppets could be allocated, putting the property rights of the people second. However, the people returning to their hometowns to visit their homes are coming from the Longhai Railway in an endless stream. They are running around and appealing to all parties, but no signs have been seen. Generally speaking, the reception order in Xuzhou is not as good as in Beijing and Shanghai. It is said that Haizhou is far inferior to Xuzhou. The reasons for these shortcomings are very complicated, but ultimately, they are nothing more than issues of authority, responsibility, and personnel. The failure to make timely decisions at the time of reception, and subsequent remedies, may not be too late, but it is ultimately a regret. For example, in the banking sector, no personnel have been seen to take over, and the conversion of puppet currency has not yet begun. As for the Korean Bank Building on Qiming Road, it is not known which party took over. The building is now used by an unrelated agency. The reception personnel of the Ministry of Social Affairs arrived in Xuzhou relatively late, and there is nothing left to take over. The whereabouts of the materials related to the cooperative business are unknown, and the accounts have been destroyed, making handling difficult. These phenomena only reflect a part of the whole picture. In the future, the task of promoting righteousness and suppressing evil is important. Xuzhou is a transportation hub, and the focus of attention is on actively building the country. The Japanese invaders ruled the Xuzhou area, marking the so-called "Independent Administration of Northern Jiangsu." Initially, the Puppet Northern Jiangsu Administrative Commissioner's Office was established, governing 22 counties in Northern Jiangsu. Later, it was changed to the "Huaihai Special Zone Administrative Commissioner's Office." Before the Japanese surrender, it was changed to "Huaihai Province," replacing the puppet Hao Peng with Hao Pengju. These two people have the same surname and similar names. The people of Northern Jiangsu sarcastically said, "Replacing Peng with Peng, why bother?" This is the essence of "independence"! It is actually a euphemism for the special control of the Mantetsu financial clique. It is said that there are as many as 39 large and small factories in Xuzhou, mostly processing agricultural products, including alcohol, flour, oil, leather, soap, gauze, glass, brewing, and bricks. There is an alcohol factory that has not been completed and put into operation in Liuquan, which can go east to Jiawang, where the famous Jiawang Coal Mine is located. Before the war, it sold 150,000 tons annually along the Yangtze River. Now, the output of the mine is extremely low. As for the above-mentioned factories, the phenomenon of stopping work after reception is similar to other places. According to what Mayor Luo Dongfan told me, the municipal government plans to ask the authorities to have these factories operated by local and central governments according to their nature. However, when asked about the specific situation of the 39 factories, most senior officials in Xuzhou could not explain it in detail, but they only knew that after they closed down and stopped work, the situation did not seem to be very good.

### The Future Destiny of Mankind is at Stake The United Nations General Assembly Opens The representatives of 51 countries attended more than 2,000 people

[Our report] London broadcast on the 9th: In a few hours, the United Nations General Assembly will open. This meeting is the highest peak of various meetings between countries in recent years. Its success or failure is related to the future destiny of mankind. In addition to resolving difficulties and disputes, the conference will also lay the foundation for permanent peace and ensure that the scourge of war never recurs. In view of this, the King of England will host a banquet for all United Nations representatives at St. James's Palace tonight. US Secretary of State Burns and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived in time to participate, which added a lot of color to the conference.

[United Press, London, January 9] Tomorrow is the 26th anniversary of the founding of the League of Nations in Versailles. The United Nations is meeting on this day, which can be described as a coincidence.

[Reuters, London, January 9] Representatives from the 51 member states of the United Nations have almost all arrived in London. The King of England and Prime Minister Attlee are preparing to hold a grand welcome party. Tomorrow morning, the greatest peace-making conference in history will be grandly opened in the Central Building of Westminster. Nearly 2,000 representatives from various countries have arrived in London, some of whom have never been here since the outbreak of the war. Therefore, special guides and interpreters have been assigned to facilitate them. About 400 journalists from various countries have arrived here. The authorities have allocated 70 telephones specifically for journalists to use.

Atomic Issues The United States and the United Kingdom Take the Same Attitude

[United Press, London, January 8] US Secretary of State Burns arrived by plane at 2:00 pm today. When meeting with reporters from various countries, he said: After the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, the issue of security guarantees for atomic bombs will be the focus of the meeting. He is convinced that a satisfactory solution can be negotiated by all countries. There is a danger of division into two factions within the US representative country on the issue of keeping the basic secrets of atomic energy. One faction believes that the US proposal to the United Nations General Assembly to establish an atomic energy management committee may inevitably leak secrets in the wording of the proposal, so there is concern. It is believed that this opposition situation in the US delegation can also be resolved satisfactorily, that is, the establishment of the committee will also take into account safety. The United Kingdom also takes the same attitude on this.

[Reuters, London, January 9] US Secretary of State Burns made a statement in Washington on Monday, saying that the United States may use its veto power when organizing the proposed atomic bomb control committee to protect its own interests. This statement has caused considerable tension in all aspects. Burns arrived in London yesterday, which may help to clear up this tense situation. The agreement established by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers to organize the Atomic Energy Control Committee has a provision that "investigates all aspects of the issue." US personnel once feared the intention of this wording, believing that the United States should provide all secrets about the atomic bomb to other powerful countries. Some US representatives who have arrived in London also have some misunderstandings about the wording of the Moscow Communiqu√© on the atomic energy agreement, so they have expressed that such wording should be revised.

Agenda of the General Assembly Resolve Five Issues First

[United Press, London, January 9] The focus of the issues to be discussed at the General Assembly is the control of atomic energy. In addition, there are the following five major issues: (1) The Security Council, with the five countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France as permanent members, also needs to elect six small countries as non-permanent members. The United States is responsible for the Western Hemisphere to be elected by Canada, Brazil, and Mexico. The remaining three countries are approximately like Egypt, the Netherlands, and Poland. However, after Canada is elected, Australia will have no hope of being elected, and disputes may arise between the two parties. (2) Elect the Secretary-General and staff of the General Assembly. (3) Whether a trusteeship committee should be established to manage the mandated territories of the First World War. This will be an issue between the United States and the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The United Kingdom and the United States are responsible for organizing a temporary committee in accordance with the former League of Nations mandate system, and advocate organizing a permanent committee from the beginning. (4) Whether the United Nations will immediately find a way to settle refugees in the world's war-stricken areas. This incident will force the General Assembly to discuss the issue of Jewish immigrants in Pakistan. British Foreign Secretary Bevan once said that he urgently wanted the United Nations to discuss this issue. (5) The issue of the permanent site of the United Nations General Assembly. The Preparatory Committee has suggested that it be located in New York and Boston. Some people believe that China and Australia will insist that the site should be located in San Francisco.

### Behind-the-Scenes Activities of Representatives of Various Countries Worth Noting Tricky Issues Avoided Open Discussion France Will Be Personally Led By De Gaulle

[Central News Agency, London, January 7] January this year will be an important January in international relations. This is not only because the United Nations agency was established in London, but also because the foreign ministers and senior political figures of various countries gathered here, which will provide a great opportunity to conduct informal "behind-the-scenes" discussions. Informed sources predict that this kind of informal consultation will have a greater impact than the formal discussions of the United Nations General Assembly, especially on European relations. All major countries are extremely eager for the United Nations agencies to maintain the greatest possible harmony and unity in their deliberations. Therefore, any issues that may cause controversy and are tricky may not be raised in the United Nations General Assembly. The relationship between Suez and Su-Turkey is two tricky issues. The United Nations General Assembly stipulates that any international discussion items can be submitted to the agenda before midnight on the 4th, and will not be accepted after the deadline. The Turkish-Iranian delegation did not submit its issues to the General Assembly and include them in the discussion agenda. It is rumored that the reason why Turkey and Iran did not submit the above-mentioned two issues to the General Assembly was due to the powerful and informal opposition of the US government. The US government is adamant that no issues that may cause discord between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should be discussed at the time of the establishment of the United Nations agency. However, some European issues are still extremely tricky. London has expressed considerable anxiety about the tense relationship between Suez and Su-Turkey in the past few days. The United Kingdom claims that its major interests are involved in these two issues, which will affect its "lifeline" to India and the Far East. The Spanish issue will also be raised for discussion. It is reported that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France may work to coordinate the policies of the three countries towards the West.

### Han Wants to Cancel The Trusteeship Resolution The Korean Delegation in Chongqing Cables Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union

[United Press, Chongqing, January 9] The Korean Provisional Government delegation in Chongqing today cabled the British Foreign Secretary Bevan, US Secretary of State Burns, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, requesting the cancellation of the decision on the five-year trusteeship of Korea in the Moscow Conference. The telegram stated that otherwise, "We will fight to the death, we can never accept it." The telegram to Molotov pointed out that Lenin recognized the Korean Provisional Government in 1920, and Stalin reaffirmed the independence of Korea at the Tehran Conference.

### The US President Hosts Reporters Reports on the International Situation Expresses Satisfaction with the Achievements of the Moscow Conference The United States Recognizes Southern Romania with Conditions

[US News Agency, Washington, January 8] President Truman announced at a press conference today that he was satisfied with the communiqu√© and the achievements of the three foreign ministers announced at the recent Moscow Conference. When answering questions, the president stated that he had fully approved the agreement reached in Moscow regarding the occupation of Japan. He said that he had always supported the establishment of a Japanese Advisory Committee, and the Allied forces should also have the right to establish this committee. A reporter asked what criticism the president had of Burns' statement yesterday on the international control of atomic energy. The president replied that Burns' statement had made a detailed and complete discussion of the issue. The President replied to another question, stating that the planned Atomic Energy Commission would only be for the consultation of United Nations representatives, and this matter would be submitted to Congress for discussion. The President also stated that the Atomic Energy Commission would propose legislation in the United States to control atomic energy, and the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission would make the issue of international control of atomic energy reach a conclusion that satisfies everyone. Asked if Burns' statement would satisfy those who had expressed doubts about the issue of self-defense and international control of atomic bombs? The President replied in the affirmative, saying that this was the intention of Burns' statement. When asked what criticism the President had of the suggestion published in the Washington Post that the United States should immediately stop manufacturing atomic bombs, the President gave a negative answer.

Balkan Issues When discussing the Balkan issue, Truman said that according to today's New York Times, constructive results have been achieved in Romania. A reporter asked what plans the government had regarding the recognition of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria. Truman emphasized that unless the governments of these countries have the guarantee of free and unsuppressed elections as stipulated in the Yalta Conference, the United States will not recognize them.

A reporter pointed out that although the recent elections in Yugoslavia were not a true expression of the people's wishes, the United States had already recognized the Yugoslav government. The President replied that the recognition of the Yugoslav government was conditional, and it is still a conditional recognition. He said that recognition was necessary under the prevailing circumstances, but the United States hoped to see progress in the situation in Yugoslavia. Another reporter asked what criticism there was regarding the dispatch of ambassadors to Moscow and Rome.

The President said that Ambassador Harriman intended to resign after the surrender of Germany, but he agreed to continue working, which was commendable. He said that he had urged Ambassador Harriman to remain in his position and hoped that Ambassador Harriman would not resign again. The situation in Rome was the same as before.

Indian Immigration to the United States Finally, when asked about the issue of Indian immigration, Truman answered in the affirmative that he supported allowing Indians to immigrate to the United States, with the same quota as Chinese immigrants. According to reports, the House of Representatives passed a bill last October allowing 100 Indians to immigrate to the United States each year, and allowing approximately 4,000 Indians currently in the United States to be naturalized.

### There is a Theory that the Soviet Union Has Atomic Bombs The US President Has Not Heard of It

[Reuters, Washington, January 9] President Truman stated at a press conference yesterday that he had no knowledge of the claim by the London Terry news that the Soviet Union has an atomic bomb that is far more powerful than those possessed by the United Kingdom and the United States.

[Reuters, London, Terry, January 9] Dr. Anmaito, a British scientist, said that the Soviet Union has a newer type of atomic bomb than the United Kingdom and the United States. President Truman denied this yesterday. Our reporter asked Dr. An for this. He replied, "Bismarck once said that political remarks are not true unless they are denied. Future remarks should come from the Soviet authorities. Only facts can prove whether President Du's words are true. This question should be asked of the Kremlin, not the White House. Then President Du can know whether his belief that the Soviet Union does not have atomic bombs is true."

### Soviet Officers Arrive in Seoul in Snow Carrying Official Letters They Have Contact with Hodge

[United Press, Seoul, January 9] Several Soviet officers arrived here today in two small planes in the snow. It is reported that the Soviet officers carried an official letter from Lieutenant General Chistyakov, commander of the Soviet army in northern Korea, to Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US army in southern Korea, regarding the address of the meeting between the US and Soviet occupation forces authorities.

### Viet Minh Gains Popular Support

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, January 9] The preliminary results of the general election in Vietnam show that the Viet Minh has gained the support of the people of Vietnam and has won. The Vietnamese government has scheduled to convene the All-Vietnam National Congress on March 3.

### Shidehara Cabinet Prepares for Resignation; Forming a Coalition Government; Liberal Party's Ichiro Hatoyama to Become Prime Minister

[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] It is heard that the Shidehara Cabinet intends to collectively submit its resignation, yielding to the more capable to rise and form a new coalition government. The candidate to succeed as Prime Minister was revealed this morning: Ichiro Hatoyama, leader of the Liberal Party, who has been attempting to overthrow the current cabinet. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, the strongest proponents of the cabinet's resignation are Nara Hashimoto, Director-General of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, and Hitoshi Ashida, Minister of Health and Welfare, both members of the Liberal Party. Should the Shidehara Cabinet resign en masse, Hatoyama is prepared to succeed in forming a cabinet. However, it is widely believed that the Liberal Party under his leadership may not be sufficient to shoulder this responsibility alone. The Social Democratic Party, thus far, seems to be responding to the Liberal Party's actions, so Hatoyama will likely invite that party to cooperate. Hatoyama has now begun discussions with various leaders to select them for cabinet positions when the Shidehara Cabinet resigns en masse. (Editor's Note: Ichiro Hatoyama was born in Tokyo in 1883, is 63 years old, and is the current president of the Liberal Party of Japan. He is a lawyer and a leading figure in Japanese liberalism. He has served as a member of the House of Representatives and in key government positions. He graduated from the Law Department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1907 and later served as Chairman of the Tokyo City Council, Secretary-General of the Seiyukai, and Executive Committee Member of the Seiyukai. In 1927, during the Tanaka Cabinet, he served as Chief Cabinet Secretary. Before the outbreak of the war of aggression, he opposed the militaristic actions of the warlords during parliamentary inquiries into the war, which caused a great uproar. His recommendation by Prime Minister Shidehara to lead the Japanese cabinet is clear evidence that the liberal faction is about to rise, and it is expected that Hatoyama will cooperate with the socialist faction to overcome the difficulties in the Japanese political situation.)

[United Press International, Tokyo, 9th] Well-informed sources in Japanese political circles claim that there is a strong possibility of forming a coalition government after the upcoming general election in Japan. Observers say that if none of the four major parties wins a significant victory, this possibility will likely become a reality. The so-called four major parties are the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party. Members of each party have already begun to consider what policies they will follow if a coalition government is proposed. The election was originally scheduled for January 20th, but has been postponed due to MacArthur's recent "purge" directive and the crisis facing the cabinet.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] The Asahi Shimbun reported today that approximately 200 judges and prosecutors will be forced to resign due to MacArthur's recent directive, including some members of the Supreme Court and key officials from the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice will convene a meeting of key officials on the 11th and 12th of this month to discuss the resignations. Judges and prosecutors from the Supreme Court, eight high courts nationwide, and 52 district courts will be affected. Normally, Japanese judges have lifetime tenure.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] According to a report by Kyodo News this morning, officials and employees of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are demanding that Japanese government agencies be thoroughly "democratized." This demand, made by civil servants themselves, is unprecedented.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] The Asahi Shimbun reported today that as a result of MacArthur's recent directive, two major figures in the Japanese business community have decided to resign: Matsumoto, Chairman of the Economic Federation and the Major Industries Committee, and Fujiyama, Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Meanwhile, Godo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations, the fourth largest economic group in Japan, was previously arrested as a war crimes suspect.

### Truman Issues Statement Regarding U.S. Military Demobilization Requests; Demonstrations by U.S. Troops in Yokohama and Honolulu

[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman declared at a press conference today that the delay in army demobilization is due to the urgent need for troops around the world. The efficiency of demobilization for the army and navy since its inception has been commendable, and it has been fair to all parties. As for soldiers complaining about demobilization, it must be understood that the reduction of the army has been proceeding as quickly as possible, but for various reasons, it has not been possible to quickly discharge everyone. The United States faces a difficult task and must bear full responsibility for maintaining peace and destroying the enemy's war potential so that war does not rise again. Demobilization is not an arbitrary action, but an inevitable part of the nation's efforts to fulfill its obligations during the difficult postwar period. The future of the United States is still precarious, no different from wartime, so we must do everything we can to lay a solid foundation for the future peace of the world. Judging from the number of people demobilized from the army, navy, and overseas forces, it is a miracle, not that some army and navy soldiers have not yet returned home, but that so many soldiers have already returned home.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman's secretary, Patterson, presented the President with a stack of papers six inches thick, reportedly signed by 30,000 American soldiers in the Philippines, protesting the army's demobilization policy. The petition was mailed to the United States and included the slogan "No Ships, No Votes" before the signatures.

Near Mutiny [United Press, Yokohama, 9th] U.S. Military Police Commander Colonel Mahoney announced today that a portion of the U.S. Eighth Army troops shouted "We want to go home" when welcoming Army Secretary Patterson yesterday. This situation was close to mutiny and was dispersed by him. He also gave a short speech to the offending soldiers, severely criticizing them. Today, an unsigned mimeographed pamphlet called "Discharge" was found among the soldiers, accusing Mahoney of insulting the soldiers as "bastards." The pamphlet also announced that a mass meeting would be held in front of the Eighth Army Headquarters at 5:30 p.m. on the 10th of this month.

[United Press, Honolulu, 9th] 1,500 American soldiers here also held a rally today to protest the delay in demobilization. The atmosphere was boisterous, but order was maintained. The meeting decided to send a telegram to President Truman. Speakers criticized Army Secretary Patterson's demobilization process and various State Department policies. Prior to this, Lieutenant General Richardson, commander of U.S. forces in the Central Pacific, warned his subordinates not to take any "foolish actions," but to no avail.

### U.S. Invites Soviet Union to Participate in Far Eastern Commission; U.S. and Chinese Delegations Arrive in Yokohama

[United Press, Yokohama, 9th] The U.S. delegation to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission arrived here today aboard the U.S. ship "McKinley." After unloading its cargo, the ship will sail to Tokyo to serve as the headquarters for the Advisory Commission. According to U.S. representative McCoy, the U.S. State Department invited the Soviet Union two days ago to send a representative to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, and is now awaiting a reply. We have come here to discuss and examine the situation with MacArthur to help the Allied nations that participated in the war against Japan to ensure that Japan fulfills the terms of surrender. Participating countries should also jointly determine future policies toward Japan. We are well aware that participating countries are deeply satisfied with the occupation of Japan and the various policies implemented by MacArthur.

[United Press, Yokohama, 9th] Lieutenant General Zhu Shimin, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to the Far Eastern Advisory Commission, also arrived here today.

[Reuters, Yokohama, 9th] Major General McCoy, Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, revealed here today that the State Department in Washington had again invited the Soviet Union to participate in the work of the Far Eastern Commission two days ago.

### Japanese Women Representatives Demand Suffrage

[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 9th] A delegation of Japanese women today visited the Allied Headquarters and stated: "The election is approaching, which will be the first opportunity for Japanese women to elect government officials. Candidates should be non-discriminatory in terms of gender and should belong to those who have worked to eliminate feudal remnants." The statement was signed by Mrs. Saito of the Socialist Party and others.

### Lifting of Restrictions on Italian Funds in Japan

[This Newspaper, Tokyo, 9th] The Japanese government ordered on the 9th to lift the restrictions on the funds of the Italian government deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, to be used by the Italian embassy for staff salaries, to maintain Italian property rights, and to provide for Italian residents.

### France to Demand Siam Return Vietnamese Territory

[Reuters, London, 9th] It is expected in Paris that France and Siam will negotiate in the near future to return the Vietnamese territory annexed by Siam when Japanese forces occupied Vietnam.

### Xing Senzhou Visits Siamese Prime Minister

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 8th Dispatch] Mr. Xing Senzhou, Director of the Overseas Department of the Central Committee's Office in Vietnam and Special Commissioner for Party Affairs in Siam, visited the Siamese Prime Minister today.

### International Snippets

Britain and the United States will soon recognize the Romanian government. Meanwhile, the political situation in Bulgaria is becoming complicated due to the participation of the opposition party in the Georgiev government.

The Soviet ambassador to Greece assured the Greek Prime Minister that he would adhere to a strict policy of non-interference.

Britain has allowed U.S. oil companies to lay pipelines through Arabia to Palestine, exceeding 1,000 miles in length, with an annual oil transport capacity of 15 million gallons.

Britain and the United States will hold an aviation conference in Bermuda, which will have a direct or indirect impact on the future of air transport in the world.

### U.S. Atomic Experts Organize; Federation of American Scientists; Creating Large-Scale Educational Program for the Welfare of the Public and the Nation

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th Dispatch] The majority of atomic experts, who actively advocate international control of atomic energy based on full cooperation with the United Nations, have successfully organized a national association of scientists, called the Federation of American Scientists, to create a large-scale public education program to regulate scientific research on atomic energy, etc. The federation has 2,500 individual members, and various groups composed of individuals who have contributed to the manufacture and research of atomic bombs, radar, and other secret weapons are the organizational constituents of the federation. The federation will participate in active political work aimed at conducting scientific education for the public and the welfare of the nation, and will use its power to influence legislation related to scientific education. The federation's headquarters will be located in Washington.

### How Dreadful! The Power of the Atomic Bomb; No Grass Will Grow in Hiroshima This Spring; Nagasaki Only Shows Scrap Metal

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch] Unless one has experienced the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, it is difficult to understand the absolute dreadfulness of the atomic bomb, and even harder to believe that a single bomb could inflict such great destruction on a city. It has been seven months since Hiroshima was bombed, yet people are still dying from the effects of the atomic bomb explosion, and no green grass will grow in Hiroshima this spring. The destruction in Nagasaki is similar to that in Hiroshima, and it is fortunate that the surrounding mountains served as a barrier, but rows of scrap metal can be seen in the factories, and the factory foundations are tilted and cannot be restored to their original positions due to the impact. The mountains of Nagasaki insulated the power of the atomic bomb, preventing other parts of the city from being affected, but as a result, the foothills were almost uprooted. Statistics show that in Hiroshima alone, the number of people killed, injured, and missing due to the atomic bomb reached 130,000, and 49,727 buildings were damaged. In one affected area, the circumference of the damage reached four kilometers in diameter. The extent of the damage in Nagasaki was less severe, with 66,144 people killed, injured, and missing, and 19,587 buildings damaged. According to Hiroshima Mayor Kihara, the reconstruction of Hiroshima is still being planned, but even the planning itself will take six months to complete. The destroyed area still looks as it did five months ago, with only a few simple dwellings hastily built to protect against the cold winter. The reporter then said, then how will Nanjing and Manila be rebuilt?

### Local Dispatches

Songjiang: Announcement of Temporary Councilors

Having received a telegram from the province to organize a temporary county council, the county government convened a second consultation meeting on the 7th, and decided on all the qualified candidates: Zhang Zhuocheng and ten others from the urban area, six each from Sijing, Fengjing, and Zhu Yushu, four each from Tiankun, Tinglin, Ye Lan, and Caojing, and sixteen professional candidates including Zhu Yian.

Changshu: Changtai Ferry Plundered by Bandits

The ferry operating between Shaxi Town in Taicang and Changshu was plundered by bandits near Dongtang City the day before yesterday. Six bandits, armed with two Mauser pistols, claimed to be conducting an inspection and ordered the ship to stop, robbing passengers of cash, clothing, and accessories, with a loss of approximately six million legal tender.

Suzhou: Soliciting Proposals for the Business Association Congress

The various industry guilds in Wu County publicly recommended Fan Junbo, the current chairman of the county's Chamber of Commerce reorganization committee, to attend the National Business Association Congress. The Chamber of Commerce believes that in order to restore pre-war commercial normality, business people should bear a major mission. Yesterday, it circulated a notice to various industries, limiting them to submit all proposals to the association before the 12th of this month, so that they can be organized and submitted to the conference in the accompanying capital by Representative Fan for discussion at the conference.

Wuxi: Actively Repairing Highway Transportation

Before the war, the highways in this county, such as the Xihu, Xicheng, Xiyi, and Suxi main lines, were intact. Merchants and travelers from all over the world could travel from morning to night, which was very convenient. During the war, the roads and bridges on various highways were destroyed by the enemy and puppets. After the victory, they were destroyed again by bandits, and transportation on various roads could not be quickly restored. The Third Front Army and the Jiangsu Provincial Government are actively repairing the highways north and south of the Yangtze River, and limited the start of construction to December 16th of last year, and the completion of the repairs before January 10th of this year. Among them, the Xicheng Highway has been repaired and opened to traffic by the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company. The Suxi Road has also been repaired by two-thirds, with only a few bridges waiting to be repaired. The road from Wuxi to Yixing was also repaired the week before, and cars can now travel on it. Regarding the Shanghai-Nanjing National Highway, the section from Shanghai via Suzhou, Wuxi, to Wujin, and the section from Zhenjiang via Jurong to Nanjing, have been repaired. The section from Wujin via Jintan Danyang to Zhenjiang will also be repaired and opened to traffic before the 10th of this month. From then on, the highway from Shanghai to Nanjing, more than 400 kilometers long, will be unimpeded.

Haizhou: Bandit Troops Drive Women and Children Away from Their Homes

The villages in the two counties of Hai and Gan, and the two counties of Dongzhu, have long been occupied by the majority of bandit troops, and the people are in deep water. In recent months, the pressure of the bandits on the people has become even more intense. Now they are even implementing their poisonous methods of sealing up, and the property and houses of all those who are wandering outside are sealed up, and their families are driven out of the bandit area. All the women and children in the bandit area, unable to bear the abuse of the bandit troops, resolutely abandoned everything and fled to the recovered area, which also shows the people's attitude towards the bandit troops.

Pinghu: Frequent Robberies, Troops Sent to Suppress

Since the New Year, robbery cases by bandits have occurred frequently in the suburbs of this county. The machine boat that opened from Ping to Jiashan Xitang was ambushed by bandits hidden in the boat near the Catholic Church the morning before, and they robbed at will, with a loss of 100 million yuan. Yesterday, five or six people in grass-green uniforms, armed with guns, suddenly shouted to lean against the boat after the paddling boat that opened from Fengjing to Ping Shaoxing arrived at the port. As a result, the men's and women's clothing and accessories and cash were robbed. The authorities have sent Wang Hu's troops to set out to suppress the bandits according to the opportunity.

Wuhu: Founding Anhui Tea Company

Anhui's production is dominated by rice tea. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was hijacked by the enemy and puppets, and production and sales were greatly damaged. Now, Xu Shiying and others from Anhui in the accompanying capital have founded the Anhui Tea Company, raising a capital of 200 million yuan, and appointed Han Junheng as the general manager, and hired experts Hu Haochuan Fang Junqiang as design commissioners. Han has arrived in Wuhu from Chongqing to prepare for the establishment of an office. The main company plans to set up in Shanghai, and factories will be set up in the tea-producing areas of Huizhou and Liuan. In addition to exporting abroad and selling domestically, planned improvements will be made to production and baking.

### Adapting to Domestic and International Realities: Britain Implements Austerity Policies

‚Äî Special Correspondent in Britain, Xu Chengbin, reporting for this newspaper

Whenever eating is mentioned in Britain, everyone's spirits dampen. After six years of war, the food situation has worsened, and friends often complain. "During the London Blitz, shops had wine and meat, but we were too busy to enjoy it. Now that the war is over, we should be able to relax, but everything is still restricted." This is the truth. In terms of clothing and food, victory has not loosened the grip of control, and old ladies who hoped to return to their old lives already realize their expectations were wrong. When the clothing coupons for the second half of the year were issued in September, everyone thought that with the war over, more coupons would be issued, but instead, the twenty-four coupons used for six months during the war (not enough to buy a set of clothes) now have to last eight months. There may be hope for an increase next summer, but it is definitely impossible at present.

**U.S. Dollar Exchange for Military Supplies Leaves National Treasury Empty**

The post-war economic difficulties of Britain can be seen from clothing and food alone. For six years, industry was entirely devoted to military production, and the policy of balancing income and expenditure through exports could not be advanced. War expenses reached 5 billion pounds per year. Most of the U.S. dollar exchange was used for military supplies, and the national treasury is in an unprecedented state of depletion. According to the government's white paper, in the six years of the war, foreign assets amounting to 1.18 billion pounds had been sold off by the end of June this year, and in addition, there were more than 3.3 billion pounds of foreign debt, itemized as follows:

Sterling Area  Amount (in Pounds)

Dominions 384,000,000

India, Burma, and the Middle East 1,732,000,000

Other 607,000,000

Non-Sterling Area Amount (in Pounds)

North and South America 303,000,000

Europe 267,000,000

Other 62,000,000

Gold and U.S. dollar reserves, as of the end of October this year, amounted to only 453 million pounds. The imbalance between income and expenditure is very obvious. The only income during the war came from domestic taxes and public bonds, which in the final analysis, were still the people's own money and cannot be considered income. Inflation was avoided entirely due to effective control and the people's compliance with the law, but control cannot be maintained forever, and the people cannot wear patched socks forever. After the Labour Party came to power, the first difficulty was how to maintain prices, meet the needs of the people, increase production, and restore the economic advantages of the pre-war era. After calculating, the only way is to tighten the belt. Purchasing food overseas costs money and tonnage; relaxing controls on department stores would affect exports. The economic life of Britain originally depended on a few ships. The purpose of the ships is to transport goods abroad, and only by earning foreign exchange can they load goods back home. To load goods for export, the country can only implement austerity policies.

**U.S. Halts Lend-Lease Act, a Blow to Britain**

The economic sources during the war were nothing more than two: one was tax revenue, and the other was U.S. aid under the Lend-Lease Act. Not long after the end of the war, Washington issued a warning and immediately stopped the Lend-Lease Act, leaving British officials and the public feeling like they had been struck on the head. The seriousness of the problem was no less than during the most tense moments of the war. Temporarily, exaggerated rumors arose. Some said that the United States might not approve of the policies of the newly appointed Labour Party and was deliberately giving this warning. Others said that the United States wanted to dominate the world market and not allow other countries to compete; in any case, everyone felt that the Americans were not good friends. The reaction from Whitehall (i.e., the British government) was to immediately dispatch senior officials and experts to Washington to negotiate, while the temporary ambassador Halifax resumed his post, and at the same time, announced at home that it would intensify efforts to save U.S. dollars. For example, ships sailing to Australia and New Zealand would no longer take the Panama Canal but would rather detour around South America and travel more than two hundred miles, saving more than five million U.S. dollars in transit fees each year. In fact, although Britain is poor, it certainly is not too poor to pay the Panama Canal transit fees. This measure was simply an expression of dissatisfaction with Washington.

**Britain Opposes Open Competition and Refuses to Give Up its Privileges**

Washington's attitude is not difficult to understand. The Lend-Lease Act implemented the principle of "those with money give money, those with strength give strength" during the war, and it cannot continue to be maintained after the war. Conversely, lending money to others to do reconstruction work and restore the world market is beneficial to both parties, as long as the interest rates are negotiable. The Washington negotiations lasted for three months, and were suspended several times in between, but finally, as of this writing, they have been successfully concluded. Britain wants to borrow money, but is unwilling to pay interest, because it feels that it is beyond its ability. The American demand, according to the speculation in newspapers here, is to terminate the Imperial Preference system within the British Dominions. The sterling area is Britain's most stable market, and it is not easy for other countries to break into it. Although Canada is not within the sterling area, it also respects the imperial preference system. The United States is willing to lend money, but hopes that Britain will abandon this privilege, open the market in the Dominions, and engage in open competition. This is a condition that Britain absolutely cannot consider. Borrowing money with interest is already difficult, not to mention giving up the only market that it has a grip on. In fact, the economic situation of the British Empire is more difficult today than it has ever been in history. After many years of occupation, the countries of Western Europe have been stripped bare of domestic resources by the occupying powers. Their monetary systems are unstable, and their purchasing power is weak, making them unable to absorb British goods. The advantages in the Middle East that Britain previously had cannot be asserted today. The United States has already gained the upper hand in the Far Eastern market. The first batch of commercial goods arriving in Hong Kong after its liberation were American goods, and the ships carrying them were American ships. A British naval officer who personally witnessed the unloading of these goods immediately wrote to the editor of The Times of London, pointing out the unfavorable position of British commerce and proposing that the government send a senior official to be stationed in Hong Kong for a long time, holding the title of Cabinet member and specifically responsible for supervising Far Eastern commerce. The markets of Western Europe and the Far East have become problematic. If it abandons the market within the Empire, it would be tantamount to suicide. Washington also appreciates Britain's difficulties. After months of consultations, their views have become much closer. Although the United States insists on not waiving the 2% annual interest rate, it has agreed to waive interest when British commerce is in recession. This condition broke through everyone's difficulties.

**Obsolete Equipment and Low Production Are No Match for the United States**

The $4.4 billion loan cannot solve all the problems of reconstruction. Manpower, factory equipment, and the quality of products are all thorny issues. Several mining experts from the United States came in the first half of the year and studied Britain's equipment and production. They believed that it was too far behind and could not be compared with the United States. Obsolete equipment, low production, and high labor costs inevitably lead to high costs. This is the case in the mining industry, and the same is true for other industries, only to varying degrees. In terms of labor, the recent wave of strikes across the country reflects a fundamental problem in British industry.

This problem is also a natural consequence of the austerity policy. During the war, factories were taken over by the government to specialize in military supplies, and the income of ordinary workers far exceeded their normal income, in some cases by several times. After the war ended, factories resumed their pre-war operations, and employers wanted to abolish war-time allowances, which labor refused to accept. The negotiations became a stalemate, and the wave of strikes began. Two months ago, more than 40,000 dockworkers across the country went on strike, and ships waiting in the harbor could not unload, and the food being transported was in danger of rotting, affecting the distribution of food within the country. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the government dispatched more than 10,000 soldiers to unload the goods, and the Ministry of Labor set up a special committee to mediate the dispute. The result of the mediation was that the union agreed to resume work first and then hold negotiations. As of this writing, the negotiations are still in progress. The workers are demanding a minimum wage of 25 shillings (equivalent to five U.S. dollars) per week, while the employers are willing to increase it to 19 shillings. What the outcome will be is unknown. Other railway and gas workers' slowdowns all stem from the same source. The workers' demands are not without reason. Prices are 40% higher than before the war, and income tax is high. Without a wage increase, they cannot make a living. The government's heavy income tax is also unavoidable. To suppress prices and maintain domestic economic balance, the only way is to ask the people for money. Workers demand wage increases because of high prices and heavy income tax, the government levies income tax to stabilize society, and employers refuse to raise wages in order to reduce costs and maintain old prices‚Äîthis is a vicious circle, which the British call a Vicious Circle. It is not a problem that can be fundamentally resolved by any one party compromising.

**The Cost of Living is 40% Higher After the War Compared to Before**

The people who suffer the most from income tax are not the workers. Recently, Churchill attacked the government in Parliament, saying that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was incompetent and could not find a way to reduce the burden on the people. The income tax in Britain is the highest in the world. For those with an annual salary of more than 2,500 pounds, 19 shillings and 6 pence must be paid in income tax for every 20 shillings. Calculated this way, the actual difference between an annual salary of 5,000 pounds and 3,000 pounds is only 2,000 sixpences, equivalent to 50 pounds. Middle-class people with an annual salary of 400-500 pounds also have to pay a quarter of their income in income tax, and single people are taxed even more. Under wartime tax rates, single people have 80 pounds that are tax-free, and next year the marginal amount of 120 pounds before the war can be restored, but the cost of living before and after the war differs by at least 40% to 50%. Just for the sake of collecting income tax, the people have to automatically tighten their belts, and when other indirect taxes are added, the standard of living naturally drops a lot.

The government's policy of austerity on the people can be seen even more clearly in the recently announced interest rates. The interest rates on bank deposits in Britain are much lower than in the United States, and interest is unearned income, which is one of the items most heavily taxed by income tax. During the war, in order to promote savings and thrift, the government issued taxable bonds, divided into savings bonds and public bonds, with annual interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 3%. Savings bonds alone sold more than 300 million pounds, and over the six years of the savings movement, banks received deposits of more than 1 billion pounds. In the second half of the year's austerity plan, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the issuance of bonds with an annual interest rate of 3% would be stopped, and the interest on bonds that had not yet matured would be reduced. According to The Times, reducing the interest rate by half a percentage point would save 70 million pounds per year. If this money were not saved, it would only be domestic debt, which is not as serious as foreign debt. From this, we can see the scope of the austerity policies adopted by Britain.

**Britain Implements Control and Austerity Aimed at Two Major Goals**

All controls and austerity measures are aimed at two goals: one is to save foreign exchange, and the other is to export goods for sale abroad. Because it is necessary to save foreign exchange, imported goods such as food must be strictly controlled. Because it is necessary to export domestic products, domestic consumption must be tightened. The difficulties first encountered by British industry after the war can be illustrated by the automotive industry. The government taxes based on the number of cylinders, and the tax rate is so high that people in the country dare not even ask about it. At the same time, foreign markets have not yet recovered, there are no customers, and there is no way to promote exports. The automotive industry asked the government to reset the tax rates in the hope of restoring the domestic market, but the government refused to consider it. Recently, the President of the Board of Trade, Cripps, was a guest at the Federation of British Industries, and had a heated debate with the chairman, almost ending in a complete breakdown of relations. The government blamed the businessmen for only knowing how to make money and not understanding the country's difficulties, while the businessmen blamed the government for only planning to collect taxes and ignoring the businessmen's capital. The truth is that everyone has difficulties.

**Borrowing Money is Not a Good Solution; Not Borrowing Money is Even Worse**

"Taking on foreign debt and saving foreign exchange are only temporary measures and cannot be relied upon for long. The way for an industrial country to recover lies in revitalizing industry and increasing exports. One factor in revitalizing industry is manpower. At the current rate of demobilizing 12,000 people per month, British industry will only be able to restore half of its pre-war level this year, and whether it will be able to fully recover by next summer is a question. Secondly, the U.S. loan must begin to be paid off in five years. If industrial production does not exceed pre-war levels by 50% to 70%, there will be problems with the money to repay the debt. The White Paper estimates that the trade deficit for the coming year may reach 750 million pounds, which may be reduced to 500 million pounds in 1947 and 1948, and may be further reduced in 1949 and 1950. The total deficit within five years is projected to be no less than 1.25 billion pounds. This estimate was published before the U.S. loan was established. With the U.S. loan, financial circulation will be flexible, and economic life can be expected to recover at an accelerated pace.

Yesterday, the opposition began to attack the conditions of the U.S. dollar loan. Some domestic experts believe that borrowing American money to buy American goods to get through the difficulties will lead to an even greater crisis in the future, especially since some of the conditions of the loan restrict the freedom of British commerce. Lord Keynes, the British economic representative in the United States, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton's explanations both contained endless bitterness: "We admit that the terms of the loan did not meet our wishes, but under the current circumstances, what we have won are the best terms." Borrowing money is not a good solution, and not borrowing money is an even worse solution.

### British Cargo Ship Arrives in Hong Kong for the First Time, Commodity Prices Plummet

‚Äî Special Correspondent, Lin Youlan

Four Christmases ago, the people of Hong Kong hoped for Santa Claus to bring them a battleship. Four years later, the gift the people of Hong Kong are hoping for is a large cargo ship.

The "President Grant" arrived in Hong Kong last month, carrying the first batch of commercial goods since the war, including 2,500 tons of foreign wine, foreign boots, cosmetics, medicines, women's underwear, canned goods, grains, flour, apples, and California oranges‚Ä¶ These are now precious items in department store windows, attracting the eyes of the general public. The fragrant apples appeared on the market that very evening, priced at six yuan per catty (before the war, each catty was only worth 60 to 80 cents). Lucky Shanghainese may taste this long-awaited delicacy before the people of Hong Kong. After the "President Grant", it is said that the "President Pierce" and "President Taft" are already loading goods on the west coast of the United States and will soon bring more goods to Hong Kong.

The President Grant brought American goods (and another 1,500 tons of goods from Shanghai). This reminds us of the remarks made by Hong Kong Governor Vice Admiral Sir Cecil Harcourt to British and American reporters on the 12th. According to Associated Press reporter Ball, citing the Hong Kong government, "American ships and aircraft have complete freedom of movement in Chinese territorial waters, but the British do not have this right. Therefore, in terms of trade, the British seem to be at a disadvantage."

Vigorous Activities of American Merchants in Hong Kong

The Governor also said, "In Hong Kong, American merchants are very active because they feel that the security guarantees they can obtain in Hong Kong are far more long-term than those in Shanghai. In Shanghai, they are subject to tax restrictions imposed by the Chinese and local governments."

Regarding the current situation in Hong Kong, Harcourt said, "Hong Kong has gradually returned to its old appearance. Since the restoration, the price of food has fallen by 50%, but the supply is still insufficient. However, it must be admitted that Hong Kong will remain a burden on British taxpayers until industrial and commercial development is possible."

The Governor Revealed His Wish to Meet Chairman Chiang

Harcourt said the following about the issue of Hong Kong's return to China: "We are very friendly with Chairman Chiang. I hope I will be able to meet with the Chairman soon." Harcourt continued, "Admiral Fraser will establish the British Pacific Fleet headquarters in Hong Kong, or at least temporarily establish the headquarters there. However, whether Britain will make Hong Kong or Singapore the main base of the British Pacific Fleet has not yet been decided."

Various Taxes Begin to Be Collected One After Another

Harcourt said, "Hong Kong is a burden on British taxpayers." This statement may require an explanation: Currently, Hong Kong is in a period of military and political‚Äîor rather, semi-civilian‚Äîadministration, and various taxes have not yet been fully collected. The Hong Kong authorities' expenditures must rely on allocations from the British treasury. This is why the burden of Hong Kong's political expenses falls on the shoulders of British taxpayers. This, of course, cannot be accepted for long. The authorities have now issued successive announcements, declaring the commencement of the collection of various taxes, including entertainment tax, tobacco tax, alcohol tax, land tax, police fees, water fees, business license fees, and so on. The British Empire does not engage in loss-making business.

As Harcourt said, American commerce is very prosperous in Hong Kong, but British merchants are not necessarily standing idly by. The Hong Kong Economic Delegation initiated by the Civil Affairs Department of the Hong Kong Military Government departed for Australia on the 18th to purchase daily necessities and building materials. The delegation consists of five people, including two Chinese merchants, and is expected to stay in Australia for half a month. Therefore, it will not be long before Australian goods appear in the Hong Kong market after American goods.

Authorities Announce Measures for Opening Up Trade

The goods that Hong Kong currently lacks the most are clothing materials, wool felt, bedding, porcelain, and kitchen utensils. A month ago, the authorities announced the opening up of Hong Kong's trade and ordered importers and exporters to register. If the imported goods purchased by merchants are related to Hong Kong's reconstruction efforts, the government will provide convenience and issue foreign exchange specifically. However, one point must be noted: the amount of foreign currency stored within the pound sterling group is not large. US dollars, Canadian dollars, and Swiss francs are extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore, merchants must carefully consider their applications for foreign exchange, as they are not easily approved, as stated by Horace, the financial advisor to the Hong Kong Military Government.

Merchants cannot apply for US dollars and other foreign currencies, but they can apply for pounds sterling. Therefore, if they order goods from Britain and its territories, they will not have the trouble of the authorities' "careful consideration" in granting foreign exchange. In this regard, even if American merchants are active, they will not easily seize the British market.

Two Key Points Specified in the Prosperity Policy

Regarding the policy of prospering Hong Kong, the authorities have announced its two major points:

(1) It is necessary to have a low-cost service system in Hong Kong, such as low labor wages, cheap shipping costs, and port cargo handling fees.

(2) It is necessary to lower the standard of living in Hong Kong and strictly implement price controls (the authorities have already expressed disapproval of merchants selling the newly arrived American goods at high prices).

The authorities are asking merchants who previously traded in Hong Kong to return to Hong Kong from various places as soon as possible, and they also hope that other merchants will come to Hong Kong to start new businesses. They clearly stated that if Hong Kong's commerce shifts to other areas of development, it will not be easy to seek recovery in the future.

Two Tons of New Banknotes Airlifted from England to Hong Kong

The new Hong Kong banknotes printed in England, weighing two tons, have been airlifted to Hong Kong by the British Air Force. The people of Hong Kong also have new banknotes rustling in their pockets, and they do not have to envy the "straight-print Customs Gold Unit" in mainland China. Bank safe deposit boxes are also being processed for opening. Brilliant jewelry will soon reappear in the light of day, and valuable deeds or documents will not be locked in iron vaults for long. Houses and properties that have not changed hands or been traded during the Japanese occupation period can also be freely traded in the near future. Currently, the general public is looking forward to the "unfreezing" of pre-war bank deposits and the reinstatement of the "fifty, one hundred, and five hundred dollar banknotes that the Japanese forced British bank officials to sign and issue." However, the authorities stated that this will have to wait until Hong Kong is restored to civilian administration before a new decision can be made. But when will Hong Kong's civilian government be restored? Hong Kong has been under military government control for four months.

Putting aside the major military, political, and economic issues, Hong Kong currently has two or three minor issues that are giving people a headache: the housing problem, the prostitution problem, and the public security problem. Regarding the first two issues of housing and health, foreigners seem to be even more vocal than our fellow countrymen.

Serious Housing Problem of Requisitioned Civilian Houses

Foreigners pay more attention than we do to the comfort of their lives. Currently, in Hong Kong's upscale residential areas, such as The Peak, Happy Valley, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Tong, and Prince Edward Road, the houses that were rented to foreigners before the war were occupied by the Japanese during the war, and now they are being requisitioned by the British Royal Marines, Royal Air Force, or other military personnel. These soldiers inevitably live a bit luxuriously. The English-language South China Morning Post commented: "The requisition of houses must meet practical needs. If they are used as warehouses, offices, or canteens, small wooden houses should be built instead of requisitioning civilian houses." The newspaper appealed to the highest military authorities to give sympathetic consideration to the construction of those wooden houses and to return some houses for the residence of the people.

Fellow Countrymen Find Housing Supply Falls Far Short of Demand

The housing for fellow countrymen is also in short supply. The former tenement houses have been bombed, with the areas of Wan Chai and Hung Hom being the worst. The entire Jaffe Road in Wan Chai no longer has a single complete house. Some houses have been destroyed by thugs who removed the wood from the houses. It is estimated that this type of damaged house accounts for about 2% of all houses. Some houses have been demolished by the Japanese to meet military needs. In Kowloon City alone, more than a dozen streets and three villages were razed to the ground and converted into airfields. People who survived under the iron heel of the Japanese are now discovering their golden opportunity. They are raising the rental value of houses, and even pre-renting some houses to wait for "good prices to be topped." Some people coming to Hong Kong from the mainland are even spending hundreds of thousands of national currency to rent a house. If they do not have that much money in their pockets, they can only live in slums, but they still have to pay three or four times the pre-war price.

Compulsory Enforcement of Prostitution Hygiene Advocated

Chinese people have always been embarrassed to discuss the issue of prostitution publicly, and in some places, there is even a custom of "laughing at poverty but not at prostitution." According to the current situation, if we say that Hong Kong is a "world of soldiers" because there are so many soldiers, then it seems that Hong Kong is almost a "world of prostitution" without shame.

Hong Kong was a civilized city that banned prostitution before the war. Therefore, some people who care about social morality are reiterating the old tune of banning prostitution. Foreigners pay more attention to hygiene. Foreign newspapers have repeatedly published reports of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, advocating the implementation of management of prostitutes in order to enforce hygiene inspections. A certain foreigner wrote to the newspaper, saying that there are so many prostitutes in Hong Kong, how can he feel at ease bringing his wife and daughter back.

Bandits Are More Terrible Than Prostitutes

A friend told the reporter that in Hong Kong, it has become difficult to find a woman who has not been a prostitute to be his wife. However, why should we men interfere so much in women's affairs? Men who become thieves are not necessarily more honorable or justified than women who engage in prostitution. Currently, bandits in Hong Kong are indeed more terrible than prostitutes. In the past few days, the English-language "South China Morning Post" has been filled with news of bandit activities. Robbery in broad daylight and shooting at night are almost daily occurrences. If it were really possible, I would like the red-robed, white-haired Santa Claus to send me a state-of-the-art self-defense pistol.

Japanese Weapons Thrown into Aomori Sea

The work of destroying Japanese munitions factories has been initiated by the Allied Headquarters' directive. The image shows Japanese soldiers and laborers ordered to load munitions onto barges and head out to sea off Aomori, northern Honshu, to throw them all into the sea.

Editorial

### Today's Double Celebration

Today should be our happiest and most exciting day! Today, we really have two joyful events worth celebrating. In London, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly opens today. All plans to uphold human justice and ensure world peace are awaiting the United Nations General Assembly's open discussion and practical implementation in the future. In Chongqing, the Political Consultative Conference convened by the National Government is also being held today. After the Three-Person Committee discusses ways to stop the conflict, the "ceasefire" order may be issued immediately, and the door to peaceful resolution will be wide open from then on. If all parties can truly be sincere and open, it will not be difficult for the Chinese political situation to embark on a bright and happy path. After China fought bloody battles for eight years, and the world was engulfed in war, humanity suffered greatly. Today, we can see calm and quiet, and the smoke of war has cleared, allowing us to glimpse the dawn of true peace for the whole world and China. This is indeed fortunate and a joyful event. Our wartime capital was in Chongqing, and the Political Consultative Conference is also being held in Chongqing. Today, both at home and abroad, there are joyful events, which is truly worthy of "double celebration".

Whether the United Nations General Assembly can proceed smoothly in the future is, of course, not something anyone can guarantee. However, judging from the spirit of cooperation among the major democratic countries during the war, from resisting aggression shoulder to shoulder to working together to create peace, the repeated meetings, although there may be some twists and turns in between, generally seem to be progressing step by step and helping each other at all times. Especially the recent Moscow Three-Foreign Ministers Conference resolved many outstanding issues, and the undeniable gaps between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding Eastern issues have indeed been more than half eliminated. Between China and the Soviet Union, in addition to the signing of the Thirty-Year Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, Chiang Ching-kuo's recent trip to Moscow resolved many relevant issues regarding the reception of the Northeast. The National Army has already been airlifted to Changchun, and the political situation in the Northeast will inevitably gradually become clear. Looking at the overall world situation, as long as Britain and the Soviet Union can negotiate a reasonable solution to the German issue, the European issue, the Near East, and the Middle East issues, and China and France, as well as other Allied countries, can have their proper status and reasonable demands in their respective relevant issues, then everyone's open discussions can make a great contribution to world peace. We believe that humanity cannot see a cruel war again, especially after the invention of the atomic bomb. Whether scientific progress is a blessing or a curse depends on humanity's own decision. Today's opening of the United Nations General Assembly is the true beginning of "one world". Although we do not dare to believe that the theories of "world state" or "world government" advocated by some British and American philosophers and politicians can be realized today, we can at least believe that humanity is moving in this direction. As long as all countries, especially the major countries, can maintain a spirit of sincerity and cooperation, there will be a better future for the whole world. Therefore, the domestic and foreign joy is overflowing and worthy of great celebration.

As for China's internal problems, it is shameful to say the least. China was the first major country to resist aggression and was also one of the last major countries to fight against aggression to the end. After victory, China has its deserved international status, and the Chinese people have the right to live and work in peace and contentment. Unexpectedly, after the victory in the war against foreign aggression, there was inevitably fighting in the country. Transportation was destroyed, industries and mines were damaged, and local disturbances were constant, making people "unable to return home", farmers unable to cultivate, workers unable to work, and merchants unable to transport, and peace and tranquility became illusions! These three or four months of great time have been spent in the Communist army's struggle for cities and territories. Fortunately, God blesses China, and peace has not become hopeless. The government has been able to tolerate it fully, and the Allied countries are also willing to mediate, so that the Communist Party representatives who came late arrived in the capital. Today, not only has the Three-Person Committee held four meetings, negotiated the main points of stopping the conflict and restoring transportation, and the ceasefire order will be issued immediately, but also the Political Consultative Conference officially opened to discuss the plan for peaceful nation-building. Peace, peace! Nation-building, nation-building! What joyful and congratulatory terms, what beautiful scenes that millions of people pray for day and night and wish to realize soon! We wish the conference a smooth consultation, and we especially hope that this glass of celebratory wine can be truly drunk to the fullest.

We believe that the political consultation must disclose the facts at any time, not promote one-sided propaganda, and allow national public opinion to make fair judgments. The success or failure of this matter is not only of great concern to the Chinese people, but also to people all over the world. If the consultation succeeds, there is hope for peace; if the consultation fails, war is inevitable. One move and one person are too important. Our first hope is to achieve a ceasefire first, a real and serious ceasefire. Secondly, the restoration of transportation must be done in the shortest possible time, with railways and shipping unimpeded, and no party should be allowed to delay or obstruct it under any pretext. And the unification of military and political orders is the minimum condition for a country. Today, the most important task of the Political Consultative Conference is nothing more than this. If these core issues are avoided and there is no concrete solution, and the Communist army is still allowed to independently organize, independently issue orders, independently determine defense zones, and independently set up checkpoints, then all consultations are empty talk to fool people! Therefore, we believe that the representatives of all parties must rely on their conscience and tell the truth. Everyone must work for the country and the people, and must not let go of this great opportunity for peaceful nation-building. And it must not be that they are scheming against each other, always holding a "party" and a "faction" in their hearts, but still forgetting a "country"! The country is shared by all the people. Today, the public is consulting on national affairs. Right and wrong, in the end, we must let the people say a word. If the public has any unresolved disputes, we must also ask the people for a fair decision. To achieve a consultation of "the world is for the public," we must first have a spirit of "no self". If everyone is still thinking about "my" party and "my" faction, naturally there is no understanding, tolerance, and mutual concession. Therefore, we believe that only when the conference is conducted in absolute openness, and the people participating in the conference hold the mentality of "nothing cannot be said to others," and can do what they say, and must do what they say, can they succeed, and the joyful event can truly be celebrated greatly.

### China and the UK to Develop Gliding Together

The China Gliding Association held a model glider flying competition this past Christmas. China's aviation industry has indeed made significant progress recently, and the UK is also working hard to train glider pilots. Training flight personnel is a very important matter, and it is also an indispensable condition for military operations.

Recently, the UK has drafted a new method to train glider pilots. This plan is usually included in the aviation training group plan. The aviation training group is a branch of the Royal Air Force, and its mission is to train boys to join the Air Force. The children start training from the age of fourteen until they grow up and join the Royal Air Force. Although these children participate in the training group voluntarily, and they are trained in their spare time, their service to the Royal Air Force during the war has been remarkable. They are the young branches of the Royal Air Force, their uniforms are very similar to the uniforms of the Royal Air Force, and they also receive military training under the guidance of Royal Air Force officers.

In British life, the aviation training group will become a permanent and unique organization, and it is the training center for future aviation personnel in the UK. The new plan released by the British Aviation Department also includes the training of two-seater gliders, and the accommodation and supply of students are also included in the plan proposed by the Aviation Department.

According to this new plan, the UK will add many two-seater gliders. The original gliders were standard single-seater aircraft. At the same time, the UK also plans to add 100 standard single-seater aircraft to supplement the 300 new single-seater gliders in the aviation training group's primary school.

In the gliding school of the aviation training group, the students' accommodation and meals are all provided by the school, with the same treatment as the Royal Air Force.

In order to implement the new plan, 200 aviation officers are now being trained as school instructors. At the same time, the authorities have specially allowed the issuance of travel permits so that students from remote areas will not be hindered when entering aviation schools.

These new evaluations will not only enable students to make rapid progress, but also enable most of the 100,000 aviation school students to learn gliding skills.

The glider pilot regiment is a main and sound part of all air force units. According to the new plan of the aviation training group, a core organization is needed in the glider pilot regiment. In modern warfare, in order to deal with various strange tactics, such a core organization is very necessary.

### Ban on Exporting Yarn and Cloth Causes Price to Plummet; Textile Companies Yesterday Released Large Quantities of Special Double Horses, Which Fell by 150,000

Yesterday, the yarn market fell sharply. The price of each yarn fell by another 10%. It was rumored in the market that the customs authorities temporarily banned the export of yarn to Hong Kong, which caused the Hong Kong and Guangdong customers to sell off. This is the truth. Therefore, the special double horse, which rose to a new peak of 910,000 a week ago, plummeted to 680,000. The closing price was 150,000 lower than the previous day. The remaining 20 yarns also fell by 50,000 to 70,000. People's hearts were weak, because the China Textile Construction Corporation continued to sell a large amount of 20 blue phoenix yarn for 680,000.

The China Textile Construction Corporation continued to release yarn and cloth yesterday. Although the price was lower than the market price, the goods could only be picked up in ten days. It is also heard that the company will slightly adjust its plans today before releasing goods again. The prices are listed below (including commodity tax, unit: yuan):

20 Blue Phoenix Yarn 680,000

32 Blue Phoenix Yarn 1,040,000

32 Fairy Peach Thread 1,100,000

40 Colored Ball Yarn 1,100,000

42 Water Moon Thread 1,250,000

### Speculative Capital Trends Towards Securities, Category C Rises to 1,600, Real Estate Stocks Soar Together

Spot Gold: Yesterday, it did not break free from consolidation. Although interday sentiment was good, the prevailing city price did not keep up, resulting in ample supply at higher levels. As the upward momentum was thwarted, speculative capital turned elsewhere. After the morning opening, it gradually declined from 8.74 million. Cotton cloth prices continued to worsen due to President Song's order to sell off sealed materials, which affected sentiment. (It is said that 700 cotton bales and 70,000 bolts of cloth are to be allocated). At noon, it struggled around 8.5 million. In the afternoon, it weakened further, with the current futures price retreating to 8.32 million before entering consolidation. As a result, it closed 28,000 lower than the previous close. Gold jewelry was quoted at 90,000 yuan, silver taels at 700 yuan, and silver dollars hovered around 460 yuan. The unofficial interest rates were around six to ten percent yesterday as money lenders had excessive capital. Spinning factories also have capital to lend. The rate is depended on need. Industry is now focused on stocks, so the need is less, and interest rates are unlikely to rise in the short term.

Foreign Exchange: The US dollar was initially firm but later weakened, still unable to deviate too far from the gold market. Arbitrageurs were more diligent, and spinning factories also absorbed some. After the low, it remained relatively stable. Many US material ships arrived yesterday, making the trend more powerful than the gold market. It opened at 1,480 yuan but later declined due to the drop in gold prices, triggering a selling spree. Later, factory absorption and arbitrage revived somewhat, and the price found support around 1,460 yuan, consolidating for a long time. In the afternoon, it was affected by the gold market, retreating to within 1,440 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar remained sluggish with no sales. Compared to the previous close, old notes fell by 5 yuan, and new notes by 1 to 2 yuan.

Government Bonds: The environment favored buying, and the pull-up was reckless. The ceasefire order between the Nationalists and Communists is imminent, boosting buying sentiment from all sides. Category C opened immediately with the residual momentum from the previous day, rising to 980 yuan. After opening, there was a slight dip, but major players continued to pull it up, gradually recovering from around 960 yuan to a new high of 1,060 yuan. During this process, a certain bank on Sichuan Road and bullish players in the industry gradually liquidated, causing the market to feel gradually loosen. Although it rose, the situation did not break free from mediocrity. At noon, some of the floating gains were realized, struggling at the 1,000 yuan mark. As a result, it rose another 70 to 110 yuan compared to the previous close. Miscellaneous bonds were more advantageous than Category C and E due to the time factor.

Chinese Stocks: Continued to be absorbed by speculative capital from foreign stocks, and the market was exceptionally heated. New long positions were continuously added, and some industry players sold off, diverting residual capital to foreign stocks. Due to the rally in foreign stocks, Chinese stocks also echoed remotely, resulting in extremely confused supply and demand. Market prices fluctuated unpredictably. Yongxing Spinning opened at 1,120 yuan and later rose to around 1,220 yuan. Mei Ya rose from 780 yuan to 865 yuan, and Xinyi rose from 270 yuan to 330 yuan. At noon, due to major players in the industry releasing shares, Yongxing Spinning retreated to 1,100 yuan, Mei Ya to within 800 yuan, and Xinyi to 280 yuan. The "Three Small Heats" were more mediocre. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongxing Spinning continued to rise by 85 yuan, Mei Ya by 45 yuan, and Xinyi by 45 yuan. The "Three Small Heats" rose by 3 to 5.5 yuan each. Various unpopular stocks continued to follow. China Underwear, which had been neglected for a long time, was suddenly favored by major players, rising from around 45 yuan to 60 yuan, finally settling at 54 yuan. Xinyi Real Estate also rose to around 30 yuan due to news of a reduction in land tax.

Foreign Stocks: Continued to exchange with speculative capital from Chinese stocks and were continuously bought by major players from the Chinese stock side, gradually rising. Ye Guang was highly sought after due to rumors of a reduction in property tax, with buyers rising one after another. At noon, compared to the previous close, Yisha rose by 350 yuan, Yipi by 130 yuan, Paper Industry by 120 yuan, and Ye Guang soared by 470 yuan. Other rubber stocks declined slightly because securities firms did not pay attention to them.

### Silk Market Shows Slight Weakness

Yesterday's silk market followed the decline in gold prices and traded in a small range. The morning opening price for Tianqiao No. 120 was 850,000 yuan, which quickly recovered to 860,000-870,000 yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 850,000 yuan, down 40,000-50,000 yuan from the previous day. As the authorities suppressed prices and sold off large quantities of materials, most commodities showed a slight fatigue. No. 150 was scarce and expensive, trading at 930,000 yuan for the East. No. 75 semi-gloss silk had sluggish sales, trading at 690,000 yuan. There were slight transactions in factory silk, and the price was slightly lower than the previous day. The silk fabric market was actively bought by all parties for several days, and yesterday the raw materials fell, and the price also looked smaller. Mei Ya lining traded at 585,000 yuan, and Minsheng brocade traded at 8,800 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Not Allowed to be Shipped to Hong Kong

The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that, according to the order of the President of the Executive Yuan, all cotton yarn and cotton cloth should be immediately prohibited from being exported to foreign countries. All cotton yarn and cotton cloth already booked for shipment to Hong Kong will be temporarily cancelled, and customs clearance procedures will be handled.

### Food Prices Rise Across the Board, White Yuan Soars by 600-700 Yuan

After a long period of weakness, rice and grains are now rising due to the increase in various commodities. Northern rice saw a slight increase in absorption, and production areas in the mainland rose, with Shanghai following suit. Japonica rice increased by 300-400 yuan, early thin rice by 200-300 yuan, and customer indica and sheep indica by 200-300 yuan. Glutinous rice (i.e., white yuan) rose sharply by 600-700 yuan due to active consumption as the New Year approached. Flour had very active outgoing routes to Fujian and Taiwan, soaring by 300-400 yuan. Soybeans continued to be processed in Ningbo and loaded in the South Seas, rising another 200-300 yuan. The oil market saw sluggish sales of peanut oil, and soybean oil softened by 1,000 yuan. Raw oil was also weak. Raw peanuts remained scarce and expensive, rising another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were actively traded in the South Seas, Fujian, Shantou, and Taiwan, rising another 100 yuan. Local wine remained flat.

### Sichuan Traders Process Woolens

The trend for woolens remained flat, with few transactions. Only major and minor Sichuan traders slightly increased their intake. The standard market price at the Public Tea Association mostly shifted with customers' needs. Yesterday, such as broadcloth, gabardine, fancy suiting, melton, palisce, and herring bone all saw slight increases. Riding breeches, Tussah silk, heavy kersey, overcoating, grass green French lining, horse hair, long-haired velvet, etc., all trended downstream.

### Tea Sales are Quite Brisk, Inventory is Very Depleted

Since the victory, although the overseas routes for red and green tea in this city have remained stagnant, domestic areas such as Tianjin and Guangdong are gradually returning to normal due to transportation, so sales are increasing daily. Unfortunately, the current inventory in this city is very depleted, so the trend is that supply cannot meet demand, and market prices have been rising steadily in recent days. Yesterday, in addition to Tianjin traders continuing to import fried green and baked green tea, the shops in this street also showed interest in red and green tea. It is also heard that Qingdao traders may also start processing tea in the coming days, so sentiment is strengthened, and the market atmosphere is generally rising by more than 2,000-3,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were extremely active, with a total outgoing volume of approximately 400 dan.

### New York Cotton Market Firm

[Reuters, New York, 9th] Yesterday, the New York cotton market opened slightly higher by 5 to 7 points. Shortly after opening, buying interest was active, and new cotton rose by 20 points. Later, due to a strike by the Western Telegraph Company, communication was interrupted, and news of transactions was suddenly restricted, and the market situation returned to calm. At the close, old cotton fell slightly, and new cotton prices were quite reactive. The midday close was higher by 5 to 14 points.

### Commercial Summary

Knitwear: Yesterday, the situation of tight yarn prices had disappeared, and yarn prices were significantly lower than the previous day. Gold prices also saw a slight recovery. Another reason is that there are rumors in the market that knitwear exports will be prohibited.

Raw Sugar: The factory's white sugar production is short, and the amount of sugar purchased at parity prices is not satisfactory, so there is a strong upward trend.

Northern and Southern Goods: Market prices are generally high, and the sales performance of traders in this street is even better than before. At this time of the Lunar New Year, it should continue to show a firm trend, especially red dates, where a move by traders in Guangdong caused the market to become even more scarce.

Dried Longan: After new large-piece dried longan appeared, the price rose as sales in this street were more active. Listed prices rose by about 10% before and after. However, those with inferior color were not surprising. Other small pieces and old goods were also flat and weak.

Red Yeast Rice: Arrivals were high, but sales were sluggish, and the market trend fell. The highest price is compared to the current market, and the decrease has reached two-thirds. Yesterday's market saw less than 40,000 yuan for shops in the middle, around 30,000 yuan for ordinary shops, and 50,000-60,000 yuan for upper shops. It is also heard that Chaozhou qu are being shipped, so there is little hope of recovery for the time being.

Seafood: Those that are suitable for actual sales saw rising prices. When traders ask for goods, the brokers immediately raise prices, and they are even less willing to let go of top-quality goods.

Dyes: Traders are very keen on chasing popular brands, and BB indigo powder is scarce, even requiring sourcing from small dyeing factories. Furthermore, the goods of a certain two major foreign companies of former German merchants are packaged by dyestuff traders and monopolized, making the available chips in the market even scarcer.

Foreign Paper: Market prices are firm, but lightweight Dowling paper is particularly popular due to high demand and limited inventory. Other goods saw slight discrepancies, and transactions have decreased, with a slightly weaker customer appetite.

Cigarettes: Due to the authorities suppressing prices and Japanese cigarette factories resuming production soon, small factories are constantly shipping goods such as Swan brand, causing buying interest to decline, and market prices were weak at the morning opening. In the afternoon, they continued to fall as selling was more than buying. As a result, they were all lower than the previous market. Old Dao retreated to within 6,000 yuan.

White Coal: Frequent declines. White coal fines and firewood are slightly better.

Western Medicine: There are people asking about them, sales are continuous, and sentiment is firm. Yesterday's market continued to report increases.

### Economic Briefs

6,000 tons of American wheat, loaded on the Huilin Weier Pifeier, will arrive in Shanghai today. This ship is managed by Fulai Company. This wheat is entirely for relief. Also, the rescue goods brought by the Tuoli Haituoweiya have been unloaded, and a portion will be shipped to Xiaoluson, Hong Kong tomorrow on the original ship.

The Samotai, managed by the British Far East Shipping Manager's Office, arrived in Shanghai today with 8,300 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao. The coal was shipped by the Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Canned green peas, manufactured by member factories of the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food, and Bread Industry Association, were previously sold in the South Seas Islands. The volume was huge. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Economic Affairs prohibited exports, and the ban has not been lifted since the victory. Therefore, the Industry Association has submitted a document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that the Jianghai Customs be allowed to export to facilitate export trade.

The Shanghai Gas Company has strict overage limits for users and has established penalty regulations. The proportion of fines increases greatly. Most of its users are in the tinplate can manufacturing industry, and the demand often exceeds the limit. Therefore, they gathered for consultation and submitted a document to the Public Utilities Bureau through the association, requesting that the gas company be ordered to cancel this restriction, which would damage the industry excessively and be contrary to the government's policy of encouraging production.

The foreign wine and food industry in this city had an independent trade association before the war. During the puppet government era, it was unreasonably merged. Now, the Social Bureau has appointed Shen Zhaomu and others as organizing committee members to prepare for the organization, and the registration is now underway.

The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the industry associations be instructed to compile a membership roster and submit it by January 15th for reference. The Cloth Merchants Association, considering this to be a solid preparation before taxation, requested that each association first list the registered members, and divide them into four structures according to the above format (namely, shop name, shop address, name of the person in charge, and organizational situation), and submit them to the association before January 10th for compilation and forwarding.

The income tax and excessive profit tax for the previous year will be levied in February. The excessive profit tax is a wartime tax system and is abolished one year after recovery in accordance with precedents in various countries. Therefore, the excessive profit tax for this year should still be levied.

The duty-paid value of goods is adjusted every three months. The Ministry of Finance has convened a valuation meeting in accordance with the legal formula in December last year, based on commodity prices in various regions, to review and approve the taxable prices for January to June of this year, and implemented them on January 1st of this year. In order to be practical, it is said that the authorities have authorized the competent district bureaus to approve the taxable prices in the recovered areas.

### The Music Education Needed Today

‚Äî Song Shou Chang

In this new year, we are presented with a new atmosphere, and we should embrace endless new hopes for everything. If last year was the year of victory, then this year should be called the year of nation-building. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, various construction projects have been actively promoted, especially cultural and educational undertakings, which have more new plans and new facilities. Taking Shanghai as an example, regarding the promotion of art education, the Education Bureau has plans for the establishment of art centers, labor centers, and music centers, as well as the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Drama School, while the Shanghai Municipal Museum is being prepared for restoration. These plans and implementations are of utmost importance to the promotion of cultural and educational undertakings. However, in the process of implementation, I believe that we should start with what is currently essential. Regarding music education, I would like to offer a few opinions based on my limited knowledge:

(1) Emphasis on the Popularization of Music Education: The primary goal of music courses in primary and secondary schools is to develop students' musical talents and interests. Therefore, in addition to general learning, we should also focus on cultivating musical talents. However, at present, music, art, and other subjects are still regarded as leisure subjects in the school curriculum. We should first enable the general public to have a considerable understanding of music and provide them with active guidance to achieve the goal of music education.

(2) Training of Music Education Teachers: To popularize music education, we must have a large number of teachers to shoulder this task. However, in the current actual situation, there is a real shortage of excellent music teachers. It is hoped that art vocational normal schools will be established everywhere, art departments will be added to normal colleges, and music vocational schools will focus on the cultivation of music teachers, training excellent teachers to meet the current needs. In the current situation of a shortage of music teachers, it can only be undertaken by incumbent music teachers. However, we must find ways to assist them and improve their teaching techniques. In this regard, the Ministry of Education or the Education Bureau should promptly organize short-term music teacher training classes to give them opportunities for further study.

(3) Supply of Music Teaching Materials: The most difficult thing for general music teachers in implementing education at present is not so much the lack of technical cultivation, but the lack of teaching materials. Because music teaching materials are different from others, they are most subject to timeliness. For example, the songs sung during the War of Resistance were mostly about charging and killing enemies and arousing emotions, but now that the War of Resistance has been won, they cannot be applied. The main themes should be completing the great cause of nation-building, promoting the national spirit, and advocating the new life movement. To solve the shortage of music teaching materials, those who promote music education should take responsibility for selecting, producing, distributing, and applying them.

(4) Utilizing Broadcasting: In the main areas of the country's provinces and cities, public radios and broadcasting machines should be universally installed to broadcast noble music for the appreciation of the public, so as to achieve the effectiveness of social education. Other activities, such as holding concerts and inviting famous musicians to give lectures on broadcasting, are also essential tasks for promoting music education.

### Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth in This City Prohibited from Exporting to Foreign Countries: Customs Announces Order from the Executive Yuan Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hong Kong route by British ships, goods shipped from this city to Guangdong and various places in Southeast Asia have been transshipped through Hong Kong, and the number of cotton yarn pieces is also large. The British Far East Shipping Agency has two ships, Yong Sheng and Yue Zhou, scheduled to set sail for Hong Kong tomorrow at the same time. Yong Sheng only sells seats in the dining room, and Yue Zhou and other low-class passenger tickets are generally not sold. There are many merchants' goods. The two ships are scheduled to transport no less than 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to Hong Kong. The transportation companies signed customs documents and were carrying out customs declaration and loading procedures to the customs. The customs export counter suddenly announced that cotton yarn and cotton cloth were not allowed to be transported to Hong Kong. The transportation companies then withdrew the scheduled cargo spaces from the British Far East Shipping Agency and handled customs clearance procedures. The cargo volume of the two ships was reduced as a result. It is now planned to fill the gap with relief supplies. Regarding the prohibition of exports, the Customs Department has received an order from the Executive Yuan. The Jianghai Customs Announcement No. 25 is recorded as follows: "On the order of the President of the Executive Yuan, cotton yarn and cotton cloth should be immediately prohibited from being exported to foreign countries. You should comply accordingly, etc. I hereby announce this in addition to complying. Simultaneously serving as Tax Commissioner Ding Guitang, January 9, 35th year."

It is also learned that the total number of spindles received by the China Textile Construction Company is 920,000, of which 800,000 are managed by the company. The factory sites include Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao, with Shanghai having the largest scale. However, only 250,000 of this huge number of yarn spindles have started operation, so it is still necessary to actively rectify them.

General Chen plans to go to Chongqing this morning, but later changed the date to go to Chongqing by plane the day after tomorrow to visit President Chiang.

### If France Does Not Change Its Attitude on the Case of French Ships Smuggling War Criminals, We Will Consider New Actions

[Reported by this newspaper] Because it is often rumored that a French government spokesman has formally stated that regarding the "Bairexiang" ship incident, the French government has decided to support the position of Fei Lihuo, the French Consul General in Shanghai, the reporter specifically interviewed Lu Huaijun, the secretary of the Shanghai Office of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Lu said: What France insists on now is that a new Sino-French treaty has not yet been signed, so it believes that France still maintains consular jurisdiction in China.

However, my country formally declared the abolition of this privilege of the French government as early as May of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, in a note to Peng Gu'er, the acting consul of the French Embassy in China. Years have passed, and the French side has never raised any objections. Even when our country recognized the de Gaulle government, the de Gaulle government did not raise objections to this point, which shows that the French government has actually

Tacitly Accepted This

Since the French government uses the failure to sign a new treaty as an excuse to maintain consular jurisdiction, then in the same note to Peng Gu'er in the 32nd year of our country, the Chinese government also declared the abolition of the French concession. Does the French government still want to maintain its concession in China today? The privileges stipulated in unequal treaties can be unilaterally abolished by our country, and the aforementioned statement to Peng Gu'er was originally a kind of

Retaliatory Measure

Because France illegally recognized the puppet organization and signed a treaty with it. It has its basis in international law. Mr. Lu also said that this case is now being negotiated in Chongqing. If the French still do not change their attitude, our country may consider taking further new actions. The reporter also specifically asked Mr. Lu for his opinion on the report that the French government will submit this case to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. Mr. Lu asked in return, does France's desire to maintain its consular jurisdiction that comes with unequal treaties today conform to the ideals of the United Nations itself? Moreover, without the consent of the two countries involved, one country cannot independently request international court arbitration.

### Our Protest to France

[Reported by this newspaper] A broadcast from San Francisco late at midnight on the 9th stated: Chinese Foreign Minister Liu Jie declared: The new Sino-French treaty stipulates that the French side gives up its extraterritorial rights, and the French side has been ordered to abolish its consular court in Shanghai. The Chinese side protested against the French Consul General in Shanghai's unauthorized arrest of French collaborators.

### Hoping that China Can Unite Like the United States: An Interview with General Chennault

‚Äî Our Reporter, Mai Tian

After arriving in Shanghai, General Chennault, the former commander of the American Fourteenth Air Force Flying Tigers, undoubtedly had to keep busy again. At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, when the reporter stepped into his reception room, he saw a guest talking to him. Just as he bid farewell at ten o'clock, another person came to find him, which shows that what he said, that someone is always coming to see him here, is true.

This is General Chen's second visit to Shanghai. In May 1937, he came to Shanghai, but later returned to China because the Sino-Japanese War broke out. He felt that Shanghai, as he saw it this time, was somewhat different from what he had seen for the first time. However, he said:

Praising the Shanghai People for Their Diligence in Work

"The Shanghai people are happy, they have not suffered any losses from war bombings, etc., only the roads and transportation have been damaged." One thing General Chen thought was very satisfactory was: "The Shanghai people are still diligent and busy, and they are all working as usual. Although it will take a long time to restore the prosperity of before the war." He said, "I have been to various places in Europe, and those people are depressed and don't want to work at all, which is very wrong."

"General, you have been to the interior of China. Do you think there is any difference between the people in the interior and here?"

"Well, of course, I think the people in the interior are better than here, they are more simple, unlike the people here who are a little false and learn the foreign style." He means that the Chinese people should best keep their inherent customs.

Deafness in Both Ears from Too Much Flying

While talking, the phone rang. But General Chen didn't hear it. Later, I told him that there was a ringtone, and he asked me whether it was a knock on the door or a phone. He said that because he had flown too much, he couldn't hear his ears. It always seemed that the sound of airplanes was ringing, and he couldn't even hear the sound of the phone next door. Although many doctors have treated him, they can't cure him. General Chen's contribution to the air force of the United States and China can be known from the sound of his ears.

Regarding the training of the Chinese Air Force, General Chen said that he has no plans at the moment. He came this time only to see China after the war. He will go to Chongqing in a few days to meet with President Chiang and Marshal Marshall, etc.

"If President Chiang asks the General to assist in training the air force, what are the General's plans?" "I still want to think about it before deciding."

Enrich the Air Force and Build More Weapons

General Chen believes that air force schools should be established in many places, distributed in the east, south, west, and north. But China should build several arsenals itself to manufacture military equipment. China's current air force and army are very good, but they lack weapons and equipment. The reason why the United States is strong is because its industry is developed and it supplies its own weapons. At present, the number of Chinese air force personnel receiving training in the United States is constantly maintained at one thousand, and new ones are sent after each graduation, but he personally has no direct relationship with this matter.

"What kind of work did you do during your return to China?"

"I didn't do anything in the United States. I traveled everywhere."

Americans Have Very Little Understanding of China

"What is the impression of the Chinese among Americans?"

"Americans have very little understanding of China. They think that China is similar to the United States and is a unified country, but they don't know that China is divided into many regions."

"What is the situation in the United States after the war?" "The United States has not yet returned to a state of peace. There are disputes over labor issues in the country, and prices are also rising. People just want to revel for a while. The United States needs to build six million new families after the war, which will take many years! At the same time, it will take the United States a year to return to its pre-war state."

"What is the General's own opinion on the political situation in China?"

"I hope that China, like the United States, can unite and make everything in the country developed in the future. In terms of transportation, we must shorten the journey, just like it only takes a few hours to get from the east coast to the west coast of the United States."

The Communist Party Should Be Incorporated into the Government as Soon as Possible

"Regarding the Communist Party issue, like other Americans, I think the Communist Party should be incorporated into the government. There are also many parties in the United States, but a democratic country should adopt an election system. It is possible to elect the Republican Party this year and the Democratic Party next year, but once elected, it should become a unified country."

General Chen is prepared to stay in Chongqing for about a week, and then come to Shanghai for a period of time. The plan after that has not been determined. He would very much like to visit northern China, Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou, and would also like to revisit his old residence in Kunming. If he has the opportunity, he plans to go to Tokyo.

General Chennault is a good friend of China. He helps China and loves China. I remember last autumn, when General Chen resigned and returned to China, the sincere retention and warm welcome from all walks of life in Kunming and Chongqing. This is not something that can be achieved by his achievements in one or two days.

### Film Distributors Agree to Free Movie Admission for Military Personnel

[Our Newspaper's Report] Representatives from various cinemas in this city and representatives from American film distributors held a meeting at the Dahua Theater yesterday at 4:00 PM to discuss arrangements for military personnel to attend movies. According to Mr. Li Dihao, a representative from the theater side, during the previous meeting, film distributors firmly opposed the theater's proposal for free movie admission for military personnel. Later, Mr. Li personally requested assistance from Mr. Howard, the U.S. Deputy Consul in Shanghai, and submitted a formal written request. Mr. Howard endeavored to find a solution acceptable to both parties. As a result, yesterday's meeting concluded with the film distributors agreeing in principle to free admission, provided that the theaters pay the rental fees for the films. The theaters have also agreed to this condition. However, the issue of the fees still needs to be discussed. The film distributors view this as a serious matter and have imposed rather harsh conditions: If similar incidents of trouble caused by Chinese military personnel during non-free admission times occur again, they will decide to withdraw all films distributed to the city. They are now awaiting a guarantee from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on this point before implementation. Mr. Li plans to bring the conditions proposed by the film distributors to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters today for a report and to discuss other solutions. It is heard that the theaters intend to rotate a group of ten cinemas each Saturday at noon to offer free admission. However, the Garrison Headquarters requests Sunday at noon. The final decision will be made after further negotiation.

### High Court Special Criminal Tribunal to Try Li Ze This Morning - Summons Sent to Employee Representatives for Confrontation

[Our Newspaper's Report] After being detained by the police and interrogated by the High Court, Li Ze is scheduled to be publicly tried at 9:30 AM this morning at the High Court Special Criminal Tribunal in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. Yesterday morning, summons were sent to the four original informants, Han Wucheng, Shu Yueqiao, Yao Zhuoren, and Ye Qiubin, employee representatives of the Xinxin Company, to appear in court on time for confrontation. Huang Zhenguang, the former chief of the General Affairs Section and the current head of the Dispatch Department of the company, was also summoned to bring the account books of the Xinxin Company for September 1944 for verification. In addition, Han Zhiming and Han Zhiyun, owners of the Senda Iron Factory on Zhongzheng South Road, were summoned to bring their factory's account books for September 1944 to compare with the Xinxin Company books and determine whether the Xinxin Company's 20,000 catties of scrap iron were used to support the enemy. A Mr. Fu was also summoned, but his identity is unknown.

Employee Representatives Collect Evidence

Lawyer Sha Qianli, who recently came to Shanghai from the rear area and is a voluntary legal advisor for the Xinxin Company employees, is assisting them in resolving all legal issues. The employee representatives have made every effort to collect all relevant documents to submit to the judge when the court convenes this morning. The representatives also stated that their accusation against Li Ze is purely based on a sense of justice and has nothing to do with any personal gain. For example, other colleagues recently requested improved treatment, but they refrained from making similar requests for fear of being implicated, which is clear proof of their motives. They hope the public will understand.

Board Members Sent to Visit Director of Hubei Office

The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, upon the instructions of Mayor Qian, is investigating the internal situation of the Xinxin Company. The company's board of directors appointed Xiao Zongjun and Cheng Hanxing as representatives to visit E Sen, the director of the First Division of the Bureau, at 9:30 AM yesterday. Director E stated that Mayor Qian is very concerned about the recent situation within the company and social stability, and instructed Xiao and Cheng to handle the matter properly. The two representatives replied that all business is proceeding as usual and that they will do their best to maintain the status quo.

Traitor's Testimony in Trial is Evasive

Wang Shiliang, a former printing worker at the Sino-American-Japanese Newspaper, harmed Xu Zhong, an underground worker for the Three People's Principles Youth League, while serving as a member of the ship escort team at the Changtai Transportation Company, leading to Xu's arrest by the enemy constabulary and severe torture. After the victory, Xu Zhong reported Wang's crimes of communicating with the enemy and organizing puppet troops to harm underground workers. Wang was arrested by the Shanghai Gendarmerie and handed over to the court. Yesterday, Chief Judge Liu Yugui of the High Court opened the trial. Wang Shiliang evasively claimed that he did not provide intelligence to the enemy puppets, receive firearms, or organize puppet troops. The court ordered further investigation and a future hearing, and the defendant was remanded to custody.

Shen Zhangming and Shen Zhaokui led enemy gendarmes to the home of their sworn brother, Zhu Dexing, at No. 4 Ma Lu Bridge, Gaoqiao, at 2:00 AM on the night of the 27th day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. They broke down the door and took Zhu and his wife, Zhu Yingdi, to Zhaowa Island (now renamed Fuxing Island) in the Huangpu River, where they were detained. Zhu Yingdi was later released on bail by local villagers, but Zhu Dexing's whereabouts remain unknown, and his life or death is still unclear. After the victory, the two traitors were arrested by the Tiandunkou Police Station of the Gaoqiao Police Sub-Bureau and handed over to the High Court. The court opened the trial yesterday, with Judge Zhu Shaozhou presiding. However, both defendants evasively denied the charges. The court then summoned the victim, Zhu Yingdi, to testify about everything and ordered a future hearing.

### Trolleybus Plan to Add New Lines

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Public Works Bureau convened a meeting with responsible parties from the British and French Tramway Companies yesterday to discuss improving various lines and reached the following decisions: (1) To restore the No. 18 trolleybus line between Boundary Road and Xieqiao as soon as possible, starting from the 15th, without the need to transfer vehicles along the way.

According to an announcement from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Zhenhai branch reported that there is a mine in the mud under the North City Reef, north of Zhaobao Mountain.

### Austrian Nationals Request Reconsideration of Repatriation

[United Press Local News] After the Chinese government ordered the isolation and repatriation of Austrian nationals on November 27th of last year, the 4,650 Austrians in Shanghai were greatly alarmed. According to a statement by Austrian national representative Shi Duan, Austrian refugees should not be treated the same as German nationals. These people are not people subordinate to Germany, but citizens of the independent Republic of Austria. The Republic of Austria has not entered into a state of war with China, so Austrian refugees cannot be regarded as enemy nationals. The Austrian nationals in Shanghai have requested the Chinese government to reconsider this matter.

### Granddaughter of Famous Doctor Xu Shaofu Sues Brother for Embezzlement of Inheritance

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Xu Meijuan, the granddaughter of the famous doctor Xu Shaofu, is now 42 years old. She recently hired lawyers Cai Zhihe and Yang Zitang to file a lawsuit in the District Court, accusing her brother Xu Yaozhang of embezzling her inheritance and obstructing her freedom. Yesterday morning, Judge Lian presided over the interrogation in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court. The defendant was represented by lawyers Fei Xizhen and Wang Hengyi. The plaintiff alleged that Xu Shaofu left a large inheritance. Since the death of his wife, Ms. Gu, in 1941, it has fallen into the hands of his grandsons Yaozhang, Di San and their brothers. Xu Meijuan's own property was also embezzled. Although she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit at that time, she was forced to abandon the property in exchange for 25,000 yuan in puppet currency due to the influence of the enemy puppet forces, who leveraged pressure from the Japanese naval officer's office through her brother. Now that the homeland has been restored, she is demanding its return. The court ordered a future hearing.

### New Model Locomotives to Arrive Next Month, Powered by Diesel

Transportation Minister of the Huazhong Railway Management Committee, Mr. Hou, told reporters that passenger transport on the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines is currently extremely crowded, with the number of passenger cars insufficient. There is no way to add new cars in the immediate future.

This project is quite large and was completed on the second of this month. These new locomotives are not powered by coal, but by diesel fuel, and our country's railways have not yet operated this type of new locomotive.

### Small Statistics on the Purchase Price of Gauze

In August of the 32nd year [1943], the enemy puppets forced the purchase of gauze in this city. Relevant trade associations are now requesting the government to return the remaining portion. According to statistics, at that time, the market price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 1,500 yuan in puppet currency per bolt, while the purchase price was 375 yuan in puppet currency, only one-quarter of the value. Although two installments of bonus money were issued, due to the slow installment payments and the increase in cloth prices, even if the original goods were replenished upon receipt of the payment, the loss would be more than three-quarters. A table is provided below:

First installment, January 1, year 33 [1944]: Bonus money 0.0234375 taels, gold price at that time 78,000 yuan, equivalent to puppet currency 182.81 yuan, calculated at the same time cloth market 1,500 yuan, the value of the payment equals 121.9/1000 of the payment of the cloth.

Second installment, April 1, year 33: puppet currency 31.25 yuan, calculated at the same time cloth market 4,000 yuan, the value of the payment equals 7.8/1000 of the payment of the cloth.

Second installment, October 1, year 33: puppet currency 31.25 yuan, bonus money 0.0234375 taels, gold price at that time 540,000 yuan, equivalent to puppet currency 1265.63, calculated at the same time cloth market 8,000 yuan, the value of the payment equals 162.1/1000 of the payment of the cloth.

Third installment, April 1, year 34 [1945]: puppet currency 31.25 yuan, calculated at the same time cloth market 100,000 yuan, the value of the payment equals 0.3/1000 of the payment of the cloth.

The total payment received is 292/1000 of the payment of the cloth at that time. If calculated as a percentage, it is slightly less than three-tenths.

The outstanding payments are the fourth installment of puppet currency on October 1, year 34, the fifth installment of puppet currency on April 1, year 35 [1946], and the sixth installment of puppet currency on October 1, year 35, totaling puppet currency 93.75 yuan.

### Berliners in the Ruins

‚Äî Anton

A dead lion is always more majestic than a dead dog. The remains of Berlin are more moving than the small towns of Aachen, Essen, or Cologne. The aura of glory and might is still faintly visible. In its deceased state, it retains a cold dignity.

However, one can tell that Berlin is an upstart city, not one of ancient lineage. Even before the war, Berlin was cold and awkward. It was not as magnificent as Rome, as comfortable as Paris, nor did it possess the solemnity of London. It is too new, lacking the charm and warmth of other ancient metropolises. Similarly, Berliners are a breed apart, quite different from the straightforward Germans of the southwest. They are arrogant and rude ‚Äì outspoken and boorish, yet remarkably shrewd and adept at cunning.

Today, the Berliners living in the ruins are even more ill-tempered than before, their speech even more dangerous, their behavior even more crude. In this city, there is no trace of friendship. Walking on the street, listening to Berliners' conversations with each other, one can hardly believe that brotherly love, or even a sense of shared belonging, could allow such an appalling attitude to exist.

They seem to be venting their anger towards the enemy on their own people, erupting into curses at the slightest provocation, living in an atmosphere of constant tension and bestiality.

Because Berlin is now under the joint control of the victors, the air of tension is further increased. The Yalta Conference's decision for the United Nations to jointly occupy Berlin is like planting a time bomb. Clearly, the purpose of this approach is to save face for everyone. Berlin is divided into three zones, each controlled by one of the three powers. Currently, the only occupation of the three million clever, sharp-tongued, and desperate Berliners is to sow discord and spread rumors among the three powers.

At a public bartering market in West Berlin, I mingled with dozens of middle-class Germans. I spoke with a neatly dressed man carrying a greasy paper package. "This is a pound of bacon," he explained, "I traded a camera and several hundred marks for it." He used to be an engineer, with his office nearby. People immediately crowded around. Among the expressions of Berlin public opinion, the most interesting were the constant shifts in perspective and the skill of their speech.

As I got into my jeep, an old man suddenly touched my elbow and said: "Mr. Reporter, perhaps you can help us. Please tell the United Nations government to grant us an amnesty. If all the Nazis were released, we would be truly grateful. Of course, excluding the leading war criminals."

I feel that Berliners have not been completely defeated, nor have they been "liberated." They firmly believe that the destruction of Berlin and the destruction of Germany are only temporary phenomena. They have already begun to focus on the future. Three million people is not a small number. Three million people standing amidst what was once their home, now ruins, is quite dangerous. Although Berlin is no longer the center of a living political entity, it remains a barometer of the German psyche. Especially with winter approaching, the actions and reactions of these three million clever and violent Berliners, amidst hunger and despair, are truly worthy of attention.

Psychology

### Cold and Heat

‚Äî Yang Tongfang

"Cold" and "heat" are two different feelings. Although these two different feelings appear distinct, both extremes can produce "pain." Therefore, extreme "heat" and "cold" will both bring pain to people. As psychologist Woodworth said, "Cold spots and warm spots give a kind of sharp pain to the stimulation of people's skin." Almost everyone has a psychology of disliking cold and heat. In the harsh winter, we always like to gather around the stove to avoid the cold. In the hot summer, we like to find a cool realm, enjoying the cool breeze and relieving the heat.

As for the weather, we certainly like the turn of spring and summer, or mid-autumn, because it's neither too cold nor too hot at this time, which is warmth. The reason why people are happy to pursue warmth is that warmth gives people a feeling of warmth and comfort, an indescribable pleasure. Most people are greedy for warmth. Who wants to get up right away from a warm bed? When describing the intensity of friendship, warmth is sometimes used as a metaphor. "Warm friendship" is so envious! The pleasure of mood is often said to be a "warm heart." Warmth makes people envious and nostalgic. Just think of the opposite of warmth: coldness, desolation, bleakness, and you will understand.

The feeling of "cold" and "heat" on the skin is different for everyone. This is due to the different skin reactions of each person. But extreme "cold" and "heat" are hated by anyone, that is certain. There is also "cold" and "heat" in human relationships. If they each go to extremes, there will be malpractices. To have a purely indifferent attitude towards others, even to hurt people with "hidden arrows," to mock people with "cold words," so that people dare not approach, is somewhat close to coldness. Where is the principle of being a person? There are also some people who claim to be "experienced in the world" and "rich in experience in dealing with people." They treat others entirely based on so-called "reason" (in fact, "reason" is not like this). They are stubborn by nature, rigid and self-willed, and unwilling to show any emotion to others. People should originally seek each other's sympathy and understanding. To get along with people solely on the basis of a so-called "rational" mind, how is this different from coldness? I think that except for people who live in an ice cellar, no one wants to encounter people as cold as ice. In addition, there is another type of person, whose emotions are particularly rich. They often pour out bursts of "enthusiasm" when getting along with relatives, friends, acquaintances, and new friends. What they believe in is Rousseau's famous saying "The spark of passion can revive the withered heart." Who doesn't need some passion to irrigate the withering heart in this cold society of human relationships? Who doesn't hope to find some passion from great friendship and beautiful love to comfort themselves?

People's psychology is not the same, and their likes and dislikes are different, so the natural expressions in their temperament will not be the same. Psychologists often divide people's personalities into two main categories: extroverted personality and introverted personality. The former likes to develop outward, likes to participate in social activities, has organizational interests, and the expression in personality is mostly the unrestrained emotions, bold and unrestrained. The latter likes to develop inward, likes to think quietly, has a relatively calm mind, and of course, there are also many people who are between these two personalities. Extroversion and introversion each have their biases. Allowing these two personalities to go to extremes will equally contribute to psychological unhealthiness and incompleteness of personality.

People with excessive enthusiasm often lack normal and appropriate reason. Their psychology is disturbed by excessive enthusiasm, causing their mental state to lose balance and their emotions to be unstable. Over time, it can lead to a "perverted personality." Many romantic writers in literary history, their works, intertwined with extremely strong enthusiasm, have touched countless readers, but eight or nine out of ten of these writers have suffered from varying degrees of "hysteria." Goethe and Shelley are prominent examples. A calm mind is good, but a cynical attitude is the "fatal wound" in our dealing with the world. To observe others coldly, treating them as objects of one's own "playing with" and "deliberating," is simply bullying others, belittling others, despising others, and oppressing others.

The most ideal thing is to maintain an objective and calm mind, carefully observe everything in society, and contribute one's own ability to society and the people with a warm heart of sympathy. To transform human life in the society to be more ideal and more advanced. Not a blind action without reason, nor a passive cold observation without work enthusiasm. Not an outsider, but a collaborator. Not a simple and pure calm, nor an unmodulated and extreme enthusiastic indulgence. This is a philosophy of life and a work attitude that contains "constructiveness."

War

### Treating Wounded Enemy Soldiers

‚Äî Xingju

When the US Navy attacked Attu Island, the Japanese army resisted stubbornly, and many American soldiers were injured.

In the operating room on the ship, it was filled with wounded American soldiers waiting for treatment, but suddenly a wounded Japanese soldier was carried in. From his fierce expression, it could be seen that he was suppressing his fear. His body was filthy and stinking, making people want to vomit.

The American soldiers on the ship immediately clamored, "This is our enemy! So sinister, so despicable and filthy! He hates our American soldiers, kills our Americans! Why don't you throw him away, why don't you kill him!" How? You are going to use American medicine to treat him, use blood transfused by Americans to save him?"

At this time, Ito was afraid in his heart. He thought that the American soldiers would not stab him to death. They will torture him, cut off his ears, pull out his teeth, cut him into pieces, and chop him into minced meat!

The doctor on board ignored these voices. He ordered Ito to be carried into the operating room. He began to wash him, transfuse blood for him, perform surgery on him, cut off his destroyed leg, and carefully bandage him for a full hour.

Ito's expression gradually changed. He was sweating on his forehead, his lips trembling. "America! America!" He suddenly shouted, tears streaming down. Everyone was stunned.

After a few days, Ito's injuries had improved, and he was sent to a room below deck and locked up.

One day, a soldier talked to the doctor about this matter. The doctor said, "If I encountered Ito that day during the charge, I might have stabbed him to death with a knife. Maybe he had another bomb hidden somewhere. But our army did not stab him to death, but captured him, because in war it is sometimes worth the risk to capture the enemy. Since he was sent on board, he is a suffering human being. He has all the rights of a prisoner of war. We should respect this right, and our naval medical department should do its best to treat and save him."

"Do you treat him as carefully as you treat American soldiers?"

The doctor said, "Of course, doctors do not distinguish between high and low when saving lives. I treat the captain like this, and I treat the Japanese devils like this. Our treatment of Ito was like this: At first, we were entirely for military considerations. Our soldiers did not hesitate to risk their own lives to capture him, so I did not hesitate to use blood tests to save him, because Ito may be very valuable in military terms. Later, seeing that Ito had already boarded our ship, and his body was so filthy, we had to remove the damaged parts of his body and clean the remaining parts. This is not only for Ito, but also for our own sake. Finally, we are considering from a humanitarian point of view. I think that Ito's moved expression is indeed a very promising phenomenon."

The doctor continued slowly, "I think that we should treat the Japanese people in the same way as we treat this wounded soldier. We should remove the corrupt and toxic parts, but since we have to live with these people in the same world, we must treat the remaining part and restore it to a healthy state in body and mind."

Medicine

### The Toxicity of Vitamins

‚Äî Moming

Vitamin D is toxic, and patients must not take it by themselves. Recently, a woman in the United States died from poisoning, which is the first case in medical history. The woman suffered from arthritis. She did not follow the doctor's instructions and took large amounts of vitamin D preparations, up to 100,000 to 500,000 units per day (the normal requirement is 400 units per day), continuously for up to a year. As a result, she developed calcification, with large amounts of calcium deposited in the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and other places, which caused her death. The signs of chronic vitamin D poisoning are stomach weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle fatigue, lethargy, headache, and frequent urination, but because there is no doctor's supervision, it is not easy to detect and pay attention. Now, some people in the American medical community have proposed to include vitamin concentrate preparations in the category of poisons and prohibit patients from buying them themselves to avoid similar incidents.

Miscellaneous Thoughts

### Everyone, Respect Yourselves!

‚Äî Jiang Yuliang

All status, high or low, is created by one's own efforts. Of course, if one has made a certain degree of effort and struggle, one will naturally enjoy a certain degree of status. This is the inevitable law of cause and effect.

After eight years of arduous war of resistance, our country has fulfilled its due responsibilities among the Allied countries in the world's smoke of gunpowder. Today, the world's fascists have been defeated, and our current enemy, the Japanese bandits, has surrendered! Amidst the chorus of celebrations around the world, our country is entering a new stage of building an independent, free, and democratic China at home. Internationally, our country ranks among the world's five great powers. In terms of international status, our country's status has increased. But this is entirely due to eight years of arduous war of resistance that produced today's brilliant results.

Now that we have attained a glorious status, we must also strive to consolidate the existing status. Because our enjoyment today is not a fluke, nor an accident, but rather accumulated through eight years of arduous process, at the cost of countless amounts of fresh blood. Therefore, we must never have the psychology of a nouveau riche, easy come, easy go. We can only respect ourselves and strive for self-improvement from now on.

Shanghai is the heart of our country and the easiest place for our people to get close to people from the Allied countries. Hence, it is also the place where our people have the easiest opportunity to show their character. Therefore, we must especially respect ourselves.

Recently, one can often see Allied soldiers walking through the streets with their chests out, but behind them, there are often three or five of our young people, holding embroidered towels in their hands, calling out "Want one! Want one!" as they follow them. Most of the Allied soldiers proudly shake their heads slightly and move forward, and then our young people retreat dejectedly. Of course, this is also a kind of business soliciting, but this scene invisibly forms two kinds of national character attitudes. And for international observation, it is really not very elegant.

In the expression of certain facts, we often can't help but ask others to do more self-examination, and not use the psychology and attitude of eight years ago to treat us again; but we should also do a lot of self-examination. Today, we can no longer use the psychology and attitude of eight years ago to deal with people from the Allied countries. Today, we should recognize that we have acquired a glorious, noble, and equal status, and we must first respect ourselves.

Of course, the above facts are just one example. In today's facts, there are more and greater existences. In short, we must all respect ourselves and work hard. New relationships must have new expressions to establish firmness. Because everything, when despised by outsiders, must first have its own worthy of being despised.

### Common Sense of Respecting the National Flag

‚Äî Yijun

The national flag is a symbol representing the country, and its dignity and sacredness are self-evident. Yet some people still do not understand its importance, and often hang it arbitrarily, fold and place it improperly, and there are various phenomena such as the national flag being damaged, discolored, or the size being incorrect. Moreover, it is exposed to wind and rain, or it is flown in the dark of night, which damages the national image and loses dignity. All nationals should pay special attention to this. Since the city police department implemented the "Hanging of the National Flag" uniformly, the city's appearance has been renewed. Under the clear blue sky and white sun, it is not only a spectacular view, but also the national flag suddenly appears majestic and flying high.

The national flag should be raised at sunrise and lowered at sunset. It has a certain fixed method. After the flag is lowered, it should not be rolled on the flagpole, or thrown into the corner of the wall, or propped up in the corner of the wall, allowing it to be stained by dust and dirt. The placement method is provided below for reference. If you take down the national flag, lay it flat and fold it once on each side, up and down, left and right, so that it becomes a quarter of its original size, then put the national emblem up, but absolutely never fold it again. It is best to make a wooden flat box, or use white paper and cloth to wrap it. This way, it will not be soiled and will be dignified and respectful. This simple common sense is truly something that every national should know.

### Deliberately Making Things Difficult or Abusing Civilians?

To buy a train ticket at the Shanghai √ó√ó agency, one needs to ask for connections, otherwise it is difficult to get one. At the train station to buy third-class tickets, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has one window for Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Songjiang, and one window for small stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Unexpectedly, yesterday, buying a ticket back to Chang'an in Shanghai, when I arrived at the station, it was terrible. Starting from the window, the queue went all the way to Baoshan Road, a distance of at least a mile. It was two o'clock when I arrived. Although there were still more than ten hours until the train's departure, after waiting for half an hour, it still did not move a step. Fearing that waiting for a ticket for a long time would cause me to miss the train and have to spend another night, I changed to buying a second-class ticket. How could I know that there are two ticket offices for second-class tickets? May I ask, villagers and children all know that there are more people taking third-class trains and fewer people taking second-class trains. Now, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has a total of twenty-one stations, and third-class passengers account for eight-tenths of the total, while second-class passengers account for two-tenths of the total. Now there are two ticket offices for second-class tickets, and only one ticket office for third-class tickets. May I ask, is this deliberately making third-class passengers wait for several hours to buy tickets? Or can ordinary civilians be abused at will?

### Request to the Municipal Government to Construct Municipal Housing within a Limited Time

‚Äî Shen Huaxing

This year is a year of construction. Among the construction issues in Shanghai, the most urgent problem that needs relief and resolution is the housing shortage. Since the eight years of the War of Resistance, the number of houses destroyed in areas around the city center, such as Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, Wusong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Nantao, is countless. Therefore, a large portion of citizens and refugees are crammed into small rooms, with dozens of people living in a single room, which is extremely pitiful. Nowadays, renting a municipal house or a regular house is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. The phenomenon of housing shortages is prevalent everywhere, and the brokerage fees and rents are shockingly high, unlike before the war, when one could rent a house by paying only three months' rent as a deposit. Therefore, I implore the municipal government to construct the destroyed houses within a limited time. At the very least, it should aim to restore the pre-war state within two years. This is truly a construction that brooks no delay and a benevolent policy that benefits the people's livelihood. At the beginning of this victorious year, I offer this humble opinion to the municipal government, hoping it will be adopted and implemented!

### Vagrants Starting Anew (Part 2): Impressions of Visiting the Caohejing Shelter

‚Äî Dong Yan

There are children standing guard in the corners, monitoring those who are willing to be degenerate and escape. Many "white powder ghosts" (referring to addicts) have kicked their habits and are sunbathing on the grass. Those who have realized earlier are given positions to be more free. The ferocious ones are confined until they repent. The entire management is militarized. The director, Zhou Zuwang, a graduate of Normal University, is willing to do the work of an unsung hero, which is truly rare. The other staff members also receive meager salaries and do heavy work. They treat the shelter as a large family, caring for it, protecting it, and hoping it will grow and take on part of the responsibility for the construction work.

After nearly four hours of stay, this shelter gave me a very satisfactory impression. They are not only passively providing shelter, they treat the sick, help refugees and children overcome addiction, and then teach them to start anew, to do the work they should do. Especially the children, because they are easier to change, almost all of them abide by the rules and reform themselves. Imagine that five or six hundred children grow up and can take two paths: one is that they are all good citizens, producers, the second generation of individuals; the other path is that they are still wandering on the streets, begging, stealing, and growing up to be hooligans and thieves. How much difference does the impact of these two completely different paths have on society?

Please, every conscientious citizen, think about it: for the country, for society, and also for yourself, we must save this group of people. We must not only enable them to live, but also make them useful to do things for society and do their best for the country.
