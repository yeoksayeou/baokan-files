### The First New Year After the Victory of the War of Resistance: Chairman Chiang's Proclamation to the Military and Civilians – Although External Threats Have Been Removed, Internal Troubles Remain Severe; Wishing to Fulfill the Legacy and Seek Stability and Revival

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, December 31st] Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang, on the evening of the eve of the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, at 8 PM, held a grand banquet at the Shandong Linyuan official residence to commemorate the year of the Allies' joint victory and to celebrate Envoy Marshall's sixty-sixth birthday. Present were 151 people, including ambassadors from various countries to China, senior generals from the US military headquarters, members of the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee, standing committee members, members of the National Government Committee, heads of various departments and ministries, and the chairman of the Political Participation Council. During the banquet, Chairman Chiang and Envoy Marshall delivered speeches successively, mutually congratulating the Allied victory and permanent cooperation. The guests and hosts dispersed with delight at 10:30 PM. (Chairman Chiang's speech and Marshall's reply will be broadcast tomorrow.)

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, December 31st] Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day address to the military and civilians of the country in the 35th year of the Republic of China, the original text of which is as follows: Fellow countrymen, military and civilians of the whole nation: Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China in its thirty-fifth year, and it is our first New Year's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance. In the fourteen years since the September 18th Incident, we have spent this holiday in an environment of darkness and humiliation. In the eight years since the July 7th Incident, we have spent this holiday in a battle of life and death. Now that our War of Resistance has been won, Japan has surrendered, and the national humiliation of many years has been washed away, all the citizens of the Republic of China should be able to raise their heads, stretch their brows, and take a breather to celebrate this New Year's Day. Every one of our compatriots is, of course, exceptionally joyful and exceptionally excited, but the situation of our country is still extremely difficult. Although external threats have been removed, internal troubles are even more serious. The developments of the past few months, it cannot be denied, have left a heavy shadow in the hearts of our compatriots, even after seeing the light of day again. The national status and national glory that we have gained through more than eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice have been diminished at once. And the spirits of the military and civilian martyrs in heaven during the revolution and the War of Resistance cannot be comforted. Speaking of this, regarding the current situation of the country, it is truly a mixture of joy and sorrow. But we can see that the nation will have a bright future after the victory of the War of Resistance, and how to open up this bright future, eliminate the internal worries that exist, and dare to obtain the fruits of true victory, this is our common and unshirkable responsibility.

What is currently occupying my mind is how to fulfill the legacy of our Founding Father and how to realize the demands of the people. The last legacy of our Founding Father was to strive for peace and save China, and to complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. As for the urgent demands of the people today, they can be summed up in one sentence: to seek stability and revival. The demands of the people and the legacy of the Founding Father are consistent. At this time after the war, with devastation everywhere, our compatriots in various places are suffering and awaiting relief, displaced and awaiting return home, unemployed and awaiting re-employment, damaged and awaiting repair, and oppressed and awaiting liberation. But simply put, the premise of all reconstruction work is nothing more than peace and stability. Public sentiment is an absolute necessity for our country and nation, and it is also the greatest key to world peace and security. Therefore, the first urgent task for us is to create a peaceful and secure environment for the entire country. Only when there are no more incidents of unrest and division within the country can there be the possibility of peaceful construction. Only when there are no more factors of disturbance and strife within the country can the foundation of the country be consolidated. Only then can the people live and work in peace. Today, after defeating the invasion and learning from the pain, all political transitional measures may have shortcomings, but the government is actively improving them and will never be perfunctory and delay the opportunity for national revival. But the most important thing is to determine the overall national policy, so that the government and the people have a common track to follow. If the country is in turmoil every day, and the people suffer from fear and anxiety every day, then the post-war peace and construction cannot begin. Therefore, today, at this time of the New Year's renewal, I want to briefly and concisely present the current important national policy, the decisions of our government, and the responsibilities of our people, to make it clear to our compatriots across the country.

### The Goal of the National Revolution: To Build a New China Based on the Three Principles of the People

Because today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, I want to first present the purpose and course of our National Revolution to show the path of our future efforts. The greatest goal of our National Revolution is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, and in terms of its course and steps, it can be divided into three periods: The first period was after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, from 1895 to 1911. During this eighteen-year period, its goal was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty's imperial system and establish a Republic of China where sovereignty belonged to the people. The second period was from the second year of the Republic of China to the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1928. During this sixteen-year period, its goal was to eliminate the situation of warlord separatism and achieve national unification. The third period was from the twentieth year of the Republic of China to the victory of the War of Resistance last year. During this fourteen-year period, its goal was to defeat the invasion of Japanese imperialism, remove the obstacles to national construction, and complete the construction of a new China based on independence, freedom, and the Three Principles of the People. These three periods have different emphases, but the purpose of the revolution and national construction has been consistent and unchanging. When the Founding Father was alive, he personally led the compatriots across the country in the struggle. After the Founding Father passed away, the members of the Kuomintang have striven to carry on his legacy. During this period, there were many obstacles, and internal and external troubles were intertwined, but they were all destroyed by the great power of the National Revolution. Our Founding Father, from the beginning of advocating revolution in 1894, recognized that without overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's autocracy, there was no way to save China from danger and realize China's democracy.

The Founding Father only knew the responsibility of saving and building the country and never had selfish or self-serving ideas. Therefore, once the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, he yielded power to Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai stole the country, and the Republic of China was in danger. The people could not truly express their free will and power, which led to the separation of warlords. Then came the revolution after the second year of the Republic of China. Until the completion of the Northern Expedition, China's unity was finally achieved. However, Japanese imperialists were jealous of our country's unity and, from the beginning, colluded with warlords and created separation, wanting to achieve the goal of destroying China by dividing China. First, there was the September 18th Incident, creating the puppet state of Manchukuo; then, there was the demand for the special status of North China. Our National Government deeply knew that if Japanese imperialists were not driven out one day, the country would not be unified one day, and democratic politics could not proceed. Not only would the survival of our country and nation lose its guarantee, but the entire peace of the world would also be threatened. Our July 7th War of Resistance was to carry out this sacred and great task, and the Second World War also began because of Japanese aggression. From this, it can be seen that if China cannot maintain unity and independence, it will threaten the peace of the world. If we cannot smoothly complete the national construction plan and democratic construction, we cannot build a strong China to stand among the modern countries of the world.

### National Unity and Democracy Are the Focus of Our Future Efforts in National Construction

Now that Japanese imperialism has been defeated, and the external obstacles that hinder China's unity and obstruct China's democracy have been eliminated. However, the destruction and sacrifices suffered by China, resisting a strong enemy's force for fourteen years with its weak national power, are truly countless. The nation's vitality and the people's livelihood are also hanging by a thread. If we do not seize this opportunity today to actively recover, quickly restore social order, and put national politics on the right track, then the country will have no chance of revival. Today, we truly need to seize the opportunity, consolidate national unity, realize the politics of all the people, and work together for national construction. Therefore, after the victory last year, I earnestly proposed to my compatriots the importance of taking advantage of the recovery work and carrying out construction. I also specifically stated that the focus of future efforts lies in "national unity and political democracy." If our compatriots across the country can carefully understand the needs of our country, they will know where the important national policy lies today.

Fellow countrymen, it has been thirty-five years since the founding of our Republic of China, why have we not been able to complete the national construction plan and the politics of all the people? The only reason is that our country is not unified. And the cause of the Second World War can be traced back to the lack of unity in our China. The purpose of our revolution and War of Resistance was to eliminate the invaders' attempt to divide China in order to destroy China. More than eight years of bloodshed and sacrifice were also to realize national unity in order to protect the survival of the nation. Therefore, in these years, I have earnestly explained to the people the necessity of national unity. I once said that national unity is an absolutely necessary element for modern nation-building, and it must be cherished and protected by the cooperation of all the people in order to have a solid guarantee. Only a unified country can truly obtain the fruits of victory; only a unified country can smoothly promote constitutional administration, guarantee the democratic system, promote public opinion, concentrate the strength of the people, and complete the great plan of national construction; and only a unified country can smoothly promote various economic constructions and improve the living standards of our hard-working compatriots. Moreover, only a unified country can contribute to the peace and well-being of mankind in the new post-war world. And in terms of current facts, we can only jointly maintain national unity in order to smoothly carry out our recovery work. Otherwise, if military orders and political orders cannot be unified, transportation is destroyed section by section, and local order is disturbed everywhere, then the country's recovery work will inevitably be hindered everywhere, and the people's most basic demand for living and working in peace will be impossible to achieve. Therefore, we can be tolerant and yielding in all national affairs, and we can be sincere with each other, but the unification of military orders and political orders, the military must be uniformly under the jurisdiction of the state, and any military actions that separate territory, destroy transportation, and obstruct recovery must be absolutely avoided, which is the only prerequisite for resolving the current disputes and unrest. This is a fact and a truth. Anyone with patriotism and conscience cannot but recognize and fulfill it.

### This Year's Two Major Tasks: Completing the Recovery Plan and Implementing Constitutional Government

After understanding this important premise, I want to propose to my compatriots the two tasks that our government urgently needs to address this year.

First, we must complete the recovery plan, relieve the suffering of the people, and establish a foundation for construction. Therefore, on the one hand, we must first restore transportation so that people can return home and materials can circulate smoothly, and then economic construction can be developed. On the other hand, we must end military operations, universally disarm the Japanese army, send prisoners back to Japan, effectively reorganize the army, quickly restore local peace and order, and prohibit the exploitation and oppression of the people by local bullies, so that the people can live and work in peace. Only in this way can the people's lives and property be guaranteed, the cause of reviving the country can be carried out, and the military and civilians who suffered, bled, and were disabled in the War of Resistance and the heroic spirits of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives can be comforted.

Second, we must implement a democratic constitutional government as soon as possible, and the constitutional government should belong to the people, creating a government for all the people. Regarding this point, our government has declared it more than once. The ultimate goal of our National Revolution is politics for all the people, and convening the National Assembly and electing politics to the people is the only necessary procedure for national construction. On New Year's Day last year, I declared that the National Assembly could be held in advance without waiting for the end of the war. On March 1st of last year, I officially announced to the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association that it would be convened on November 12th of last year. Later, because of the opinions of the military council and various parties, the method of convening the National Assembly was agreed upon, but unfortunately, various obstacles were encountered, so that the meeting had to be postponed. Therefore, the National Government issued an order to reschedule the meeting to be convened on May 5th of this year. This major and necessary event cannot be delayed any longer. In order to enable post-war public opinion to be fully expressed, the government is preparing to increase the number of representatives to the National Assembly so that people from all walks of life and various parties can jointly participate in the National Assembly. Now that there are only five months until the date of convening the National Assembly, in order to further promote the stability of the domestic environment, to achieve the sincere unity of the whole country, and to make political cooperation a more substantial and powerful institution, before the National Assembly is convened, if preparations are made to invite social elites and people from various parties to participate in the government, whether it is to participate in decision-making meeting bodies or to participate in administrative bodies that implement policies, the government, based on the principle of public ownership of the world and the ability of the virtuous, will sincerely accept them in order to gather wisdom and benefit widely. And what our government hopes for in this regard is nothing else, only that the various parties participating in the government cannot possess their own independent armies to be used as tools for political struggles. This is because if a country allows armies other than the national army, it is tantamount to creating another country within the country. Then the country cannot be unified under one government. If there are two armies of different natures and orders, then the government must not be healthy, and politics cannot be cooperative, united, healthy, and powerful. To have this is not only to cause the government to belong to different factions at any time, but also to cause the country to be in danger. This is a matter of fact that cannot be avoided, whether it is for the sake of national unity or for the sake of political cooperation. Today, for the sake of the country and for the sake of the people, we must be frank and sincere, with the same heart and mind, to achieve thorough cooperation, not formal cooperation. The most important point is that we must never allow the country to fall into a state of disorder and anarchy, and make the government become an irresponsible government. During the War of Resistance, the fact that China still had independent armies other than the national army was the country's greatest shame and loss. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, there is an urgent need to create a peaceful and stable environment and concentrate the country's strength to begin the work of national construction. Therefore, the government must open up politics as much as possible and realize democracy in advance, and all the country's troops must be under the command of the state and obey the government. This is what truly patriotic people should carefully consider and immediately implement.

### Hoping to Clearly Distinguish Right and Wrong, Advantages and Disadvantages, and Seize This Once-in-a-Millennium Opportunity for Construction

What has been said above is the direction of our government's efforts this year. We believe that the suffering of the people after the war cannot be allowed to deepen any further. The foundation of the country must not be shaken in the slightest. The fruits of victory must not be destroyed in the slightest. The work of recovery and construction must not be delayed any further. Therefore, we will not show any tolerance in maintaining domestic peace; we will spare no effort in restoring social order; we will not avoid any obstacles or difficulties in promoting the implementation of a democratic constitutional government as scheduled; and we will use all possible peaceful means to resolve any domestic disputes. Except for the revolutionary responsibility that cannot be abandoned, the unity of the country that cannot be harmed, the fundamental law that cannot be changed, and the foundation of the government that cannot be shaken, everything else can be tolerated and everything can be negotiated. I sincerely hope that all our compatriots will recognize right and wrong, clearly distinguish advantages and disadvantages, deeply remember the suffering and humiliation of China's national weakness and decline over the past century, be aware that the once-in-a-millennium opportunity for national revival and construction cannot be obtained again, observe based on facts, understand the beginning and the end, and will not be incited by rumors to shake their confidence in the future of the country and abandon their duty to the nation. I earnestly hope that all our compatriots across the country, on the one hand, must do their best, be responsible and dutiful, and stand up bravely to promote the success of recovery, democracy, and the construction of the Three Principles of the People; at the same time, they must support the government in implementing democratic and unified policies, supervise all the government's military and political measures, report corrupt and illegal officials, clear away accumulated malpractices, and cleanse corruption, so that the country can truly embark on the track of peaceful construction.

Chiang Kai-shek followed the Founding Father and devoted himself to the revolution, aiming to save the country and restrain the powerful. Internally, he maintained national unity; externally, he sought world peace. He contributed his life to the country, and success or failure, life or death, had long been put aside. Now that the War of Resistance has been won and his long-cherished wish has been fulfilled, personal gains and losses are even less of a concern. Today, I personally have nothing else to ask for, I only hope that all compatriots across the country will recognize the hardship of the country's future, realize the importance of their responsibility, and everyone will work together with the spirit of "yesterday's death, today's life; yesterday's wrong, today's right" to be responsible, so that the achievements of the National Revolution for more than fifty years can be inherited, and the hard struggle and sacrifice of the military and civilians for fourteen years will not be wasted. This May, the National Assembly will be convened to implement constitutional government, so as to achieve our wish to elect politics to the people and realize politics for all the people. The great responsibility of the country's prosperity and decline, as well as the world's safety and well-being, will soon be entrusted to all our citizens. I deeply hope that all my beloved compatriots will take timely action and actively prepare to shoulder this sacred and arduous responsibility. In the future, will we complete the great cause of the National Revolution and realize the construction of the Three Principles of the People? Or will we allow the achievements of the revolution and the War of Resistance to fall short? Can we ensure that the country does not repeat the mistakes of the early Republic of China and fall into a state of disintegration and collapse? Can we truly build China into an independent, free, and democratic country based on the Three Principles of the People? Or are we willing to bear the shame of a semi-colonial country for a century? Can we truly achieve national liberation? Or will we still be inevitable to suffer from crises and sufferings again? Should China become a major factor supporting world peace? Or should we allow China to become an outcast in the international community? This heavy burden will fall on the shoulders of all compatriots across the country. The prosperity and decline of China, the safety and well-being of our descendants, after the implementation of constitutional government, will not only be borne by the National Government of China, but will be decided by all compatriots as the true masters of the country. It is not long until May, so I want to take this opportunity to earnestly exhort, to make our government's desire to return power to the people, as well as the Founding Father's wish to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete politics for all the people, can create lasting happiness for the future of the country. This is what all our compatriots should strive for in a timely manner.

### We Must Cheer Together to Welcome Victory and Implement Politics for All the People

Fellow countrymen! After this War of Resistance, the country's vitality has been depleted, and the work of national construction has been delayed. We must look around at today's world, a world that is advancing by leaps and bounds, an era that is making rapid progress. China is lagging behind in everything, and if we want to stand among the modern countries of the world, we need to make efforts to catch up. Looking back on the history of the past century, the country was in a semi-colonial position, and the people were living inhuman lives as slaves. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the Boxer Rebellion, the country almost fell into a state of eternal doom. Fortunately, our Founding Father rose up and led the revolution, and the compatriots across the country followed him and worked together. By the victory of this War of Resistance, the country was able to gain an independent and equal status because of the abolition of unequal treaties, and the nation also gained liberation and freedom. And our allies are also sincerely assisting in the revival of our country. This opportunity is truly unprecedented. This opportunity for revival and construction can be said to be once in a millennium, and it will be fleeting. We must not delay any longer and make mistakes. We have many things to be done, and we rely on our compatriots to be especially frugal, hardworking, and striving. Everyone should be polite, know shame, be responsible in everything, and abide by discipline. Only then can our economic construction and other national construction work proceed as planned. Only then can all the plans for the revival of our recovered areas be implemented smoothly. Since the War of Resistance, how many military and civilian martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the war. They have not had the chance to personally witness the victory, but we are able to witness the washing away of national humiliation for fifty years and the revival of the country. This is truly the greatest happiness in life. Fellow countrymen: Today, with a passionate heart, I congratulate you on your happiness! At the same time, I want to use the proverbs of "seek more blessings for yourself" and "self-help and others help" as my personal New Year's gifts to you. I deeply hope that you will inherit this incomparably arduous task of post-war construction with an excited and positive spirit. Fellow countrymen: We must cheer together to welcome the victory of the War of Resistance, complete the work of recovery and construction, consolidate national unity, implement politics for all the people, long live the Three Principles of the People! Long live the Republic of China! (End)

### Chairman Decides to Convene Political Consultative Conference on the 10th of This Month; Government Yesterday Proposed a Ceasefire Plan

[Central News Agency Telegram, Chongqing, 31st] It is learned that Chairman Chiang of the National Government has decided to convene the Political Consultative Conference on January 10th, with the conference scheduled from the 10th to the 23rd. Furthermore, at 6 PM on the 31st, Chang [unclear character], Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi [unclear character], Zhou Enlai, [unclear character] Biwu, Ye Jianying, and Gan Ruofei continued their discussions. The government representatives formally presented the following practical plan for cessation of conflict: Ceasing domestic military conflict has always been a hope of the government. To achieve this goal, both sides must have a practical agreement on methods; otherwise, an agreement to cease conflict will be difficult to effectively implement. To this end, the following is proposed: (1) Cease all military conflicts in all parts of the country and restore railway transportation. (2) Because domestic military conflicts and transportation obstructions are related to our country's obligations to the Allied nations regarding surrender acceptance and repatriation [of prisoners], all matters related to the cessation of military conflict, restoration of railway transportation, and other matters related to surrender acceptance will be addressed by one representative from the government, one representative from the CCP, and General Marshall jointly discussing methods and submitting them to the government for implementation. (3) The Presidium of the National Political Consultative Council will nominate five impartial individuals to form a military investigation team. This team will go to conflict zones nationwide to investigate military affairs, traffic conditions, and other matters related to domestic peace restoration. They will submit reports and publish the true facts at any time. When the Political Consultative Conference is established, they will also be asked to nominate impartial individuals to participate.

[Reuters Telegram, Chongqing, 31st] During negotiations with Zhou Enlai, the government stated that the Kuomintang is giving Chiang Kai-shek’s consideration to the three-point proposal for unconditional comprehensive cessation of hostilities put forth by the Communist Party. The Communist Party also pointed out yesterday that Chiang Kai-shek previously reached an agreement with Mao Zedong that included a provision that "resolute measures should be taken to avoid internal [conflict]."

### Soviet Troops to Withdraw from Northeastern Provinces Before February 1st; Confirmed by Byrnes' Speech

[Associated Press Telegram, Washington, 31st] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated in a radio address today that the claim that the Soviet Union is preparing to withdraw its troops from the northeastern provinces before February 1st has been confirmed at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers. Byrnes said that the Moscow Conference reaffirmed the policy of non-interference in China and that the plan decided upon by the conference would serve as "valuable support for U.S. Special Envoy to China, General Marshall." In addition, Byrnes defended the agreement of the Three-Power Conference to control Japan.

U.S. Secretary of State Broadcasts

[United Press Telegram, Washington, 31st] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes gave a radio address to the American people last night, reporting on the situation of the Moscow Conference, saying that the various agreements and understandings established at the Moscow Conference fully considered China's interests. China participates in the Five-Power Conference of Foreign Ministers, the Far Eastern Commission, the Four-Power Control Commission for Japan, the Korean Provisional Government organization, and trusteeship. However, if China is divided internally, it will not be able to occupy an appropriate position in the United Nations to legally fulfill its international responsibilities. President Truman's recent announcement of China policy was also discussed at the Moscow Conference. The United Nations agrees on this policy. The three governments all acknowledge that China should end its internal conflicts and that all parties should expand their participation in the National Government, and reiterate their adherence to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. Molotov discussed the issue of U.S. and Soviet troops in China with me. In accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union plans to withdraw its troops from the nine eastern provinces before February 1st. U.S. troops in North China will either disarm Japanese troops and repatriate them, or withdraw when China can complete this task itself without U.S. assistance. The Three-Power reaching an understanding on China policy can also help General Marshall fulfill his mission.

On the Korean Issue

Cooperation with the Provisional Government

Or Trusteeship May Not Be Necessary

Regarding the Korean issue, Byrnes said that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, in cooperation with the Korean Provisional Democratic Government, may find that trusteeship is not necessary. Our goal is to expedite the date when Korea becomes an independent member of the United Nations. The Korean management government has tried to solve this problem. The Joint Commission will recommend to the U.S., Britain, Soviet Union, and China to establish a Korean Provisional Democratic Government and will make suggestions to those governments regarding the preparation of Korea for independence within five years under four-power trusteeship.

Signing of Peace Treaties

Soviet Union Has Made Concessions to the U.S.

All Participants Are Eligible to Attend

Byrnes also revealed that one of the obstacles to the London Five-Power Conference of Foreign Ministers was the Soviet Union's insistence that peace treaties be drafted only by the major countries that signed the armistice treaty, while other representatives said that all countries that actively participated in the war should be allowed to participate in the peace conference. No agreement was reached on this matter in London, so many considered the London Conference a complete failure. However, the Moscow agreement has accommodated the position insisted upon by the United States, that all those who participated in the war are eligible to participate in the peace conference, and it has been clearly recognized that major countries are responsible for the formation of the peace treaty. This agreement stipulates that the initial drafting of peace terms will be done by the major countries that signed the armistice treaty, but immediately after the draft is completed, it should be submitted to a peace conference convened by the five countries of the U.S., Britain, Soviet Union, France, and China. These five countries form the Council of Foreign Ministers and are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. All countries that actively participated in the war will be invited to attend the peace conference, which should be convened before May 1 of next year.

U.S. Far East Policy

Creating Conditions for Peace

Cooperate with Allies

Creating conditions that can maintain lasting peace in US policy in the Far East, and cooperating with allies, is an essential part of this policy. Although the United States shouldered difficult responsibilities in defeating Japan, it often regarded the war against Japan as part of the war against the Axis powers. Therefore, from the beginning, it intended to make the control of Japan a joint responsibility of the United Nations. As early as August 20 of this year, it invited the three countries of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly implement the Potsdam Declaration and the terms of Japan's surrender. Although the Far Eastern Advisory Commission was established in October, the British retained its advisory nature, and the Soviet Union requested that the Tokyo control mechanism be decided before participating in the work of the commission. The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the consent of China, recognized the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission at the Moscow Conference. The commission will be composed of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, and the Philippines. Byrnes forcefully stated that the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission and the Control Commission for Japan does not bind MacArthur's administrative policies. The United States remains the primary leader in the formation of policy. The Far Eastern Commission has the power to formulate principles for the control of Japan. Its decisions can be included in the directives of the U.S. Supreme Commander. Although the policy toward Japan must be agreed upon by the three powers, its basic policy cannot be implemented without the consent of the United States. Before the United States concludes any agreement on the establishment of the Far Eastern Commission, it can freely issue temporary directives to deal with all emergencies. It is expected that the United States will use this temporary authority to deal with only the following three issues: (1) changes in the methods of controlling Japan stipulated in the terms of surrender, (2) the fundamental policies of the Japanese constitutional structure, and (3) changes to the entire Japanese government.

The Atomic Bomb Issue

Technical Aspects Not Discussed

The Soviet Government Did Not Inquire

Regarding the issue of atomic energy, according to Byrnes, the discussion of the three foreign ministers on atomic energy was limited to the British and American proposal to establish a management committee by the United Nations. As for technical or scientific matters, there was no time to discuss them. The Soviet government did not inquire about this new weapon. Byrnes said that with regard to the agreement to convene a 21-nation peace conference before May 1, 1946, the United States insisted that all countries that actively participated in the war should participate in the peace conference. Regarding an agreement on the expansion of the governments of Romania and Bulgaria to obtain British and American recognition, Byrnes did not fully express his satisfaction but hoped that the governments of the two countries would substantially improve their "democratic nature". Byrnes was also not disappointed that no agreement was reached on the Iranian issue.

### People in the Northeast Celebrate the New Year

[Central News Agency Telegram, Jinzhou, 30th] The people in the Northeast after liberation are all in the most excited mood to celebrate this first New Year after victory. The weather in the Northeast has been clear recently. Over the past week, the people of Jinzhou City and various counties have actively raised funds and materials, bought wine, slaughtered pigs, and comforted the national army to celebrate New Year's Day.

[Central News Agency Telegram, Shenyang, 27th] (Delayed) Shenyang, which was first invaded by the Japanese army fourteen years ago, has now formally returned to the embrace of the motherland. The urban area here has expanded compared to the past, and the city's population is nearly two million.

On December 27th, Deputy Commander Wang (Yuancai) of the Special Security Commissioner's Office, along with Chief of Staff Yang (Ziqin) and Regiment Commander Cheng Shouzhi, led the troops and arrived at the location at 10:00 AM on that morning. Because the inspection procedures were not completed, they stayed in Xuqiao that night.

### Published Correspondence

To the Editor:

Regarding your newspaper's local dispatches on December 26th stating: "The Songjiang County government has received orders to purchase 50,000 shi of military grain, priced at 5,000 yuan per shi, but has only received 35 million yuan. It is difficult to complete the order. Furthermore, due to severe financial constraints in the county treasury, borrowing is impossible. After discussion among various government agencies, legal entities, and local gentry, it was decided to temporarily issue military grain exchange vouchers to serve as proof of purchase, not to be circulated in the market. It is stated that upon receipt of funds from the provincial government, a public announcement will be made to invalidate the vouchers," etc.

We have verified that the funds are disbursed in installments. The county believes it is essential to purchase the grain in a timely manner and must place the order all at once. To meet the deadline, they are forced to exhaust all resources. The method of issuing temporary military grain exchange vouchers was not submitted to the province for approval beforehand, and the procedure is indeed not in compliance. However, it is claimed that these vouchers, although not circulating in the market, have been ordered by this office to be collected and destroyed by the county.

Furthermore, your newspaper continued to report on the county's grain purchase situation on December 27th, stating: "It is heard that Zhu Ziyu, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, has avoided going elsewhere, leading to the surveillance of the actions of Director Wu Zijing, etc." According to a telegram from the county to this office, Zhu Ziyu, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, absconded with a large sum of 14 million yuan for grain purchase. This differs from the newspaper report. In addition to a thorough investigation, we are sending this letter to your newspaper to clarify the facts of the matter and request that you publish it.

Sincerely,

Jiangsu Provincial Land Tax and Grain Management Office

### General MacArthur's New Year's Message to the People of Japan and the Philippines: The Japanese People Have Been Liberated and Should Act Accordingly in the Future; Encouraging the Filipinos to Unite Closely and Strive for Post-War Reconstruction

[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] General MacArthur issued a New Year's message to the Japanese people today, stating: "The future of Japan will no longer be decided by a minority. Militarism, feudalistic thinking, and all other physical and mental restraints have been completely eliminated. Freedom of thought and militarized education have been liberated. The Japanese people can now enjoy freedom of religion and freedom of speech without unreasonable interference. Freedom of assembly has also been guaranteed. All measures to enslave the people have been removed, and the Japanese people have now obtained full freedom. However, after gaining freedom, the Japanese people must create their own thoughts and actions and must not blindly follow others. This is the responsibility of the Japanese people. The Japanese people must realize that they now have the ability to govern themselves, and they must do everything that should be done themselves. I hope that this New Year's Day can be the beginning of 'the right path, truth, and light' for the Japanese people."

[Our Correspondent, Tokyo, December 31st] General MacArthur recently issued a New Year's message to the people of the Philippines, saying: "I will never forget your determination and unity in achieving victory. You are currently in urgent need of establishing a new country and becoming a member of the United Nations. The completion of this great task depends on the full application of your faith and strength."

Multiple-Nation Control of Japan Will Only Create More Chaos

[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] Well-informed sources here announced today: General MacArthur is most dissatisfied with the establishment of a four-nation committee regarding the new method of controlling Japan, because it has already taken great pains to force the Japanese to implement the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. The establishment of the four-nation committee will only create more chaos. General MacArthur's special statement last night that he "disagreed" refers to this. This dispute arose in early October when the Soviet Union requested the organization of a four-nation committee to jointly control Japan. General MacArthur's aides told United Press reporters that "such a committee would only cause disputes." The Japanese government organization and the thinking of the Japanese people are deeply ingrained. It is already difficult to make them obey and force them to make thorough reforms under the command of one person. If the government comes from multiple sources, it will disrupt the process. The cunning Japanese will definitely seize the opportunity to be opportunistic. Since the first landing of American troops in Japan, only General MacArthur has issued orders to the Japanese Emperor and his cabinet. As for General MacArthur acting on the instructions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, the Japanese do not care. They only know that the supreme power in Tokyo is General MacArthur's headquarters. Once they see that General MacArthur's power has been reduced, it will "lose face" for General MacArthur in a country that values face, which will not help the situation. The new plan decided by Moscow has caused disturbance among the Japanese. The implementation of the various instructions issued by General MacArthur will inevitably be slackened.

### General MacArthur's Government to Reform Educational Curriculum Today

[Our Correspondent, Tokyo, December 31st] General MacArthur recently ordered the reform of the Japanese educational curriculum. From New Year's Day 1946, all history, geography, ethics, and other subjects that shaped Japanese students into extreme nationalist military figures should be stopped. General MacArthur ordered the Japanese Ministry of Education to recompile the curriculum to replace these subjects. The newly compiled curriculum should focus on the basic truths of the social economy and politics of the world and the students' lives. The classroom open debate system should be implemented as much as possible. At the same time, the Ministry of Education should submit the compilation plan for the school textbooks for the coming spring to General MacArthur for review.

### Japanese People Allowed to Display Rising Sun Flag on New Year's Day

[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] According to Japanese sources, Japan has been allowed by General MacArthur's headquarters to display the Rising Sun Flag on New Year's Day and on January 3rd and 5th.

### Deputy Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies to Return to Java with Concrete Proposals

### Strong Protest from Korea Against Five-Year Trusteeship; Telegram Sent to United Nations Agencies

[Our Correspondent, Chongqing, December 31st] Members of the Korean Provisional Government's delegation to Chongqing announced today: They have lodged a strong protest with the United Nations agencies against the trusteeship system established by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Martial Law in Southern Korea

[United Press, Seoul, Korea, December 30th] After some Koreans claimed that they had been "sold out by the Allies," Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, issued a curfew order to all Americans in Korea today, prohibiting passage after 8 pm every night. Although Korean leaders have called on the public to take a passive stance to deal with the trusteeship proposed by the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, some nationalist elements have expressed that they will resist the occupying troops. There is now a possibility of a general strike in the transportation and business sectors. Lieutenant General Hodge invited Korean political leaders to discuss ways to clarify the situation, but the more important leaders ignored it.

### Looking Forward to Japan in Turmoil and Confusion: Transitioning from a Modified Feudal System to a Democratic Category

[United Press, Tokyo, December 31st] In turmoil and confusion, the ideal new Japan will be realized next year; however, the Japanese people are still at a loss as to what they should do. Countries around the world hope that Japan will reform quickly and achieve results early, but expectations are too high, and the results may not be satisfactory. However, after being busy, hesitant, and making several mistakes, they can gradually progress and transition from a modified feudal system to a democratic category. The blueprint has now been handed over to the Japanese leaders. This measure will be completed in a dramatic setting. The following are some of the most important aspects, such as the trial of major war criminals, which will begin in mid-February, the food shortage will become increasingly severe, inflation and the increase in crime (which will reach its peak in mid-April), and the control of the United Nations. Japan is not a democratic country, and it is not even ready to become a democratic country at present, but compared with Japan a few months ago, it has changed a lot. There have been some important basic changes, but the reform work is still in its early stages. A few months ago, when the Allied forces were approaching, the Japanese people waited anxiously for the Emperor to broadcast an order to fight the Allied forces to the death. The arrogant leaders intensified their control at home and exaggerated the vast empire occupied by the Japanese army, without revealing that the empire had been shattered. Propagandists continued to smear the savagery of Westerners in the newspapers. When they were exhausted and surrendered, the truth was revealed, and the country was filled with resentment, just like people who were walking near a cliff, startled and retreated. The war maniacs, once their dreams were shattered, were all silent, and the people openly rebuked the leaders they had followed for a long time and turned to the victorious Allied forces. Therefore, after the American troops entered and occupied the country, they did not encounter guerrilla duties, but were praised as liberators. The Japanese also found it easy to get along with the Americans, and the Americans brought comfort and peace. Eight years of darkness and suffering made them eager to laugh and forget the past. Therefore, the friendship between the Americans and Japanese became more and more widespread. Moreover, the Japanese public sentiment has fundamentally changed. Although they still vehemently opposed the Emperor's abdication, General MacArthur recently ordered the abolition of Shinto as the state religion, which directly infringed on the position of the imperial family, but the people did not say anything. If this had been proposed a few weeks ago, it would have caused the Japanese people to resist silently. Now, even the position of the Emperor has become a political issue for public discussion, and it is no longer a violation of the law. According to Jiji News Agency, Japanese public opinion on the Emperor's issue can be divided into three categories: (1) Unconditional support for the Emperor system; (2) Advocate for constitutional monarchy, the Emperor continues to be in office, but his privileges are reduced; (3) Support the abolition of Japan and the establishment of a republic. In fact, among the many political parties that have emerged in Japan after the war, except for the Communist Party, all advocate for the retention of the Emperor. Only the Communist Party advocates for the abolition of the monarchy. Many public tests have been conducted on this issue. Most of them are either lacking in system, or the subjects are unimportant parts of the public. However, the results of the tests all show conflicting opinions, and coexist. The Social Research Society of Tokyo Imperial University tested 131 students of the Imperial University. The results showed that 40% supported retaining the Emperor with partial changes, 35% supported retaining the Emperor with fundamental reforms, 12% said that the Emperor should not be discussed, 6% advocated complete abolition, and the rest did not express their opinions.

### Nehru Predicts Future War: Eastern National Movements Are Surging, and Cannot Be Suppressed by Atomic Bombs

[Reuters, Raipur, December 31st] Nehru, one of the leaders of the Indian National Congress, presided over the All India States People's Conference (an organization of people in the Indian chieftain-ruled states supporting the policies of the Congress Party) here today and predicted that millions of people in Asia would rise up to resist, leading to a third world war. Mr. Nehru mentioned Southeast Asia and Indonesia, saying: Britain is now engaged in a battle that will surely fail, and its source of strength is gradually drying up. This is becoming increasingly clear. Judging from recent developments, the United States has allowed this action, which has very serious consequences for all parties concerned. Because the countries of Asia do not want to be ruled by any empire and will rise up to resist, and it is the continuous resistance of millions of people, whose enthusiasm cannot be suppressed even by atomic bombs. This resistance will lead to a terrible third world war. The British intervention in the war in Indonesia is very similar to the intervention of Germany and Italy in the war in Spain, and the Spanish war was the prelude to the Second World War. We are deeply resentful and ashamed that Indian troops are being used to engage in Britain's dirty work and to fight against our friends. Mr. Nehru concluded by saying: India will have great developments in the future. The chiefdoms have served as the British "fifth column" in India for 150 years. Now they should understand that great changes are bound to come, and the chieftains cannot rely on foreign protection for long.

### Strengthening Revolutionary Forces: Vietnamese Parties Unite; All Issues to Be Resolved by the National Assembly

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th] (Delayed) The Vietnam Independence League, the Vietnam Revolutionary League, and the Vietnam Nationalist Party had frictions from time to time due to different political views. In recent months, the leaders of the three parties have repeatedly consulted on ways to unite and strengthen revolutionary forces. After the meeting, they jointly signed and issued a statement of unity and agreed to resolve all issues by the National Assembly elected on January 6th. The provisional government reorganized on January 1st will be a joint provisional government, in which all parties participate. A new Vietnamese government will be organized after the National Assembly.

### United Nations General Assembly: Arranging Matters for the Opening of the Meeting; Six-Nation Group to Go to the United States

The arrangements for the United Nations General Assembly and the dispatch of 2,000 representatives to the meeting are about to be completed.

### Heart Transplant Experiment Successful

[Reuters, London, December 31st] Moscow Radio broadcast today that Soviet young biologist Shenixin had previously experimented with heart transplantation on frogs and other animals and achieved success. Now he has transplanted two hearts into a bird and achieved satisfactory results. According to Shenixin, "There are now warm-blooded animals with two hearts in my laboratory, and they are in good condition. In the initial experiment, I placed the second heart under the neck skin. Although the transplant was successful, the bird could not survive for long due to temperature. Now I have found a safer place to transplant the second heart, that is, to remove a lung and replace it with a heart, which can share the labor of the main heart." The radio also said that if patients with heart failure transplant a second heart, they can avoid blood stoppage and save the patient's life.

### Second Part of Hitler's Will Published

[United Press, Nuremberg, December 30th] The second part of Hitler's will was published today by the United Nations authorities, proving that Goering and Himmler were dismissed by Hitler during the war because they negotiated with the enemy. The will stated, "Goering and Himmler colluded with the enemy and conspired to usurp the country, not only failing to be loyal to me, but also humiliating the country and the nation." At the same time, British and German intelligence officers also announced that an annex to Hitler's will was found in Hanford, drafted by the late Propaganda Minister Goebbels, dated April 29, 1941, at 5:30 am, half an hour after Hitler's will was drafted, signed only "Dr. Goebbels." In the annex, Goebbels decided to respect Hitler's order to leave Berlin and assume the position of Prime Minister of the new government. Hitler believed that the new government could fight to the end. He also said, "At this critical time, the leader is surrounded by rebels, so at least a part of the people should be loyal to the leader to the end." In the first part of his will, Hitler announced that all his possessions, regardless of value, would be given to the Nazi Party. If the Party no longer exists, they will be given to the country. If the country is destroyed again, then I have no need to order anything else. The paintings I have collected are not for my own sake, but to establish an art gallery in my hometown of Linz on the Danube River for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts.

### After the Moscow Conference: The Trend of World Politics: The United States Concedes on the Issue of Controlling Japan to Win Soviet Endorsement of its China Policy

[Reuters, London, December 31st] The Washington correspondent of the London Observer said: Secretary of State Vinar wants to win the favor of the Senate, but the Soviet Union's participation in the control of Japan is often a major obstacle for him to show his power. This is a part that cannot be fully understood in the agreement. Although the daily administration of the control of Japan is not hindered, the Soviet Union has the right to veto the reconstruction work of Japan. However, there have been many changes, and these must be reviewed. The United States can use its veto power here. Stalin's permission this time to end the current situation in Korea and reiterate his endorsement of China's policy are due to the concessions he obtained on the control of Japan. There is no connection between the US and Soviet occupied areas of Korea. What is known to the outside world is only reports about confiscation and chaos. As for China, there is no problem with the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from the Northeast. The Soviet Union is not very interested in Yan'an. The issue of unifying China will be handled by the US special envoy to China, General Marshall. It is surprising that the Moscow Communiqué did not mention the issue of Iran and Tatar Niel. Turkey has not won much sympathy due to its attitude during the war. Most of the Soviet Union's nerve war against Turkey is also due to this. Although the Soviet Union's actions are not in line with the times, there are not many comments. As for the Iranian issue, it is different. The Tehran Agreement is in danger. It is said that the best way to solve the Iran-Soviet issue is to promote the cooperation of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to develop the oil fields in Iran.

### Concern for the Situation in Iran: Britain Can Hardly Act Alone

[Reuters, London, 31st] London diplomatic correspondents report: London is paying close attention to the situation in Turkey and Iran. When Foreign Secretary Bevin departed for Moscow, it was deeply hoped that Iranian officials would have the right to attend, but in the end, the Iranian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister did not obtain the convenience of traveling to the Soviet capital. Now, almost all American troops have withdrawn from Iran, and the Soviet Union's intentions in Iran are unclear, so Britain finds itself in a position where it can hardly act alone in Iran. As for Turkey, the psychological warfare against Turkey has neither weakened the Turkish government's control nor has it seen the emergence of autonomous movements in Kars and Ardahan. On the contrary, the Turkish people are becoming more united to support the government. The Soviet Union may not forcibly seize the requested land. However, if the Soviet Union continues to make indirect demands, and Turkey refuses to yield, the future development is difficult to predict.

### Promote a Unified and Democratic China Through Peaceful Means

Today is the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and also the first New Year after the people of the whole country bravely resisted for eight years and achieved final victory. The people of the whole country, after much pain and reflection, should, amidst the singing and dancing of this New Year, accurately recognize the great responsibilities that the post-war world has given to China, as well as the ways in which China should shoulder great responsibilities, and then exert strength so that our Chinese nation, with its glorious history, can stand alongside the world's great powers and permanently establish the foundation for human peace and progress.

On December 15th of last year, US President Truman issued a statement on US policy toward China when US special envoy Marshal left for China, firmly stating that the US government firmly believes that the success of the United Nations organization and the guarantee of world peace both hinge on the strength, unity, and democracy of the Republic of China. This firm belief of the US government not only represents the opinion of the American people but is also shared by insightful people around the world. A strong, unified, and democratic China is indeed the greatest and most noble goal that our people should strive to achieve in the future.

After the final victory of the war of resistance and the elimination of the Japanese Empire, the only factor hindering China's strength has been eliminated. In the future, China must become prosperous and strong in order to fulfill its major responsibilities for post-war world peace.

However, the so-called strong China refers not only to military equipment but also to the construction of modern politics, economy, society, and culture. It must possess the conditions of a modern country and keep pace with the world trend to achieve a position of strength. A modern and strong country must first achieve unity and stability, and domestic problems, especially political problems, can be resolved satisfactorily through peaceful and reasonable methods and equal consultation. The era of seizing power by revolutionary means or seeking unification by force has become an outdated historical relic. Therefore, using force in domestic warfare, whether called internal strife or rebellion suppression, is a sign of national backwardness.

President Truman stated in his statement: "The failure or devastation of any part of the world is a threat to the peace of the entire world." If China experiences war due to internal problems, it will directly threaten the stability and peace of the world. Therefore, whether China can achieve domestic peace has become a major global issue. The post-war world no longer allows China to engage in self-destruction. Our people should keenly recognize that in order to achieve national unity, especially democratic politics, we should no longer blindly believe in force, but should advance bravely along the path of political consultation, democracy, and peace.

Since the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Japan on August 6th of last year, world scientists have believed that human history has entered a new atomic age. If humans can use the power generated by atomic fission for war, they can destroy the world in a very short time. If it is used for peaceful construction, human life can enter an unimaginably prosperous state.

Unfortunately, a small number of backward people in China have a very mistaken mentality. They believe that China's national strength has not yet been successfully built, and that its own strength is not enough to deal with a second or third strong country. They fantasize about using the friction and conflict between the great powers, or even a third war, to take advantage of the situation. This kind of mentality is extremely erroneous, backward, and dangerous, because among the great powers, only the United States and the Soviet Union are capable of confronting and balancing each other today. If there is a conflict between the US and the Soviet Union that cannot be reconciled, leading to war, then the traitorous country will use atomic bombs to quickly end the war, but no one can guarantee that the Soviet Union will not also use atomic bombs for retaliation. If the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union involves China, then China will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. If this is the case, how will China cope? Therefore, for the sake of China and the world, this kind of erroneous and dangerous mentality must be eliminated. China's future nation-building must strive for domestic and international peace, which is the best policy.

Furthermore, strength, unity, and democracy are inseparable, and democracy is an important prerequisite for strength and unity. If China's democratic politics are not realized and a democratic system cannot be established, then true and lasting strength and unity cannot be achieved. What we seek and what the world hopes for is a strong and unified China based on democracy. If we only seek strength and unity without democratic construction, then Germany and Japan can serve as a warning.

Therefore, the victorious democratic countries demand that China be strong and unified, and at the same time, they demand that China be democratic to avoid the mistakes of Germany and Japan, and do not want China to become a second Japan and become a new threat to the world. In the future, our goal of nation-building must first be to complete the construction of the Principle of Democracy, so that the people have full freedom to express their opinions and decide policies on national politics. In this new year, the people of the whole country should thoroughly understand and unanimously accept President Truman's policy statement on China and strive to realize it, using all kinds of peaceful methods and means to promote the strength, unity, and democracy of the country. This goal is the requirement of the post-war world for China, the responsibility given to China, and the only goal of our future nation-building. I hope that all people with political views in the country can deeply understand this and adhere to this policy with the greatest determination to achieve the goal of building a country based on the Three Principles of the People for the happiness of the country and the peace of the world. For this, I respectfully wish the Republic of China eternal prosperity and the Chinese people boundless happiness!

### Wishing a Victorious New Year and Sending Endless Hopes

— He Yingqin

Today is the first New Year's Day since the victory of the War of Resistance. The enthusiastic celebrations throughout the country are different from the past. Compatriots in the occupied areas, who have been liberated after eight years of oppression, and Taiwan, which was lost for fifty years, have also returned to the embrace of the motherland, and naturally, everyone is even more happy and inspired. As we welcome the change of year and prepare for the new, we look forward to the future with endless hope. But when we recall the dangers, obstacles, hardships, and the great sacrifices of the military and civilians over the past eight years, as well as all the losses of the country and the powerful assistance of the Allied nations, we must first commemorate and thank the officers, soldiers, and compatriots who sacrificed for the country, as well as the Allied nations that assisted us, especially the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Thinking about the difficulty of obtaining victory and the arduousness of future nation-building, we will deeply feel the greatness of our responsibilities and become more vigilant.

Looking back at this painful history is truly thought-provoking. If there had been no warlord separatism after the establishment of the Republic of China, and if the country could have been united after the completion of the Northern Expedition to work hard on nation-building, then with the twenty-plus years from the Xinhai Revolution to the July 7th Incident, according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction, we would have completed democratic politics long ago by transitioning from military government to tutelage government to constitutional government. Moreover, with these twenty-plus years of national defense construction, we could at least have a decent scale, and how would Japan dare to deceive us and invade us? Simply put, it is because the country was not unified and could not build itself into a strong nation that it was subjected to aggression. Today, we feel deeply that the construction of our country cannot be delayed any longer. In other words, what the country urgently needs now is true unification. Only with true unification can we talk about democracy.

Some people think that China's inability to unify is due to the failure to implement democratic politics. This view is completely putting the cart before the horse. If the country is not unified, and there is a phenomenon of separatism and division, and even the use of force as a tool and backing for separatism, and the true will of the people is controlled and manipulated by the separatist forces, then how can there be any democracy? In the world, no matter what kind of political system a country has, there can only be one government that issues orders to ensure the implementation of military and political orders. Although various political parties can criticize the shortcomings of the government in Parliament, everything must be based on the interests of the country, the nation, and the people, and guided by truth. There is absolutely no other government existing besides the central government, and no army in any country that does not obey the orders of the central government. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all countries with democratic politics, but their people can all love the country loyally, and their armies can all absolutely obey the orders of the government. Everyone can sacrifice personal interests, even life, to seek the welfare of the country, so they were able to defeat Germany. If they were divided and orders were not followed, how could they defeat Germany? Therefore, to realize true democratic politics, we must also have a truly unified country.

Compatriots all over the country have been affected by the eight-year war, especially those in the occupied areas, who have been directly subjected to the exploitation and oppression of the Japanese army and traitors, and their lives have been extremely difficult. This is what I have personally seen during my inspections of various places in the past three months. The lives of our ordinary compatriots were already very difficult, but now they are even more unimaginable. Therefore, in the future, we must not only restore the wounds of our compatriots over the past eight years as soon as possible, but also gradually improve the living standards of our compatriots throughout the country, so that everyone can have reasonable solutions to food, clothing, housing, and transportation. However, to this day, it has been more than four months since Japan surrendered, and some compatriots cannot even return to their hometowns because of the destruction of transportation and the lack of restored security. How can we talk about improving living standards? This is because there is still a phenomenon of disunity in the country. Therefore, to restore the wounds of our compatriots over the past eight years and to improve the living standards of our compatriots, we must also have a truly unified country.

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is the best opportunity for our country and nation to build and revive. If we let this opportunity for revival pass and cannot concentrate our will and strength to complete the work of unification and nation-building, then the country will inevitably be despised by foreigners again, and even be invaded again, and will never have a chance to recover. At the beginning of this new year, our compatriots throughout the country should make up their minds and not have any selfish ideas. We should be of one mind and unite sincerely, based on the principles of "nation above all" and "national interests above all," and put the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country on our own shoulders. In particular, the officers and soldiers of the national army must understand the importance of their responsibility to protect the country and defend the people. Everyone should work together to promote unification, maintain unification, and consolidate unification. Everyone should work hard to build the country, realize democracy, and improve the living standards of the people. We celebrate the victorious New Year and place infinite hope in the future of the country.

Editorial

### New Year's Address for the Thirty-Fifth Year

What day is today? Is it not the New Year's Day of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China? Is it not the first time since the victory of the War of Resistance that we have encountered the renewal of the year? The sunshine is just beginning, and hundreds of splendors are flashing. The deep sorrow of China's fragmentation and destruction has followed the old years into insignificance. The excellent and outstanding hope is coming with the new vitality. Everyone, above and below, has this aspiration, and everyone's mind has this new demand. Ask one person, and a hundred mouths will agree. The emotion is inevitable, and the reason is solid. We reporters, whose duty is to be the voice of the people, have a word of dedication to the year at the turn of the year. However, its meaning is profound and far-reaching, and its emotion is so exuberant that there has never been such a thing as this. Why? The eight years of the War of Resistance in the past were already deeply painful. The enemy ravaged us, and the hardships were beyond the ordinary. Millions of sincere and good people were subjected to the cruelty of slavery and torture, or they were dedicated and fearless, or they were displaced and carried away by the flood. The bitterness of this is not worth discussing in depth. When the situation suddenly changed and the devilish obstacles disappeared, due to President Chiang's firm and unyielding leadership, we were finally able to achieve the goal of final victory. It is appropriate for the country to rejoice. However, when we pick up our pens today, we feel that there are still some flickering shadows lingering in our minds, and there are some sour emotions swirling in our chests. Is it a disorder of the spirit? Is it a failure of human planning? Who is in charge? It is difficult to say. It is almost like waking up from a nightmare, with lingering fear. If we encounter something contrary to our wishes, we will become angry and uneasy. Removing the unfortunate past and cherishing the future, we will start anew. I dare to take this opportunity to express a sincere wish.

Since the Japanese warlords, with their ambition to unify the world, embraced the dream of swallowing Asia, disasters and misfortunes gathered together. Germany and Italy, with their foul stench, responded to each other from east to west, and called themselves axis nations, and made a desperate gamble. The smoke of war was overwhelming. The damage and loss of years of war are difficult to estimate with ordinary numbers. Not only was culture destroyed and lives devastated, but the currents reached the point where the world was in danger of sinking, and humanity was lamenting destruction. To call it an ancient and strange disaster is not an exaggeration. However, the facts show that those who are warlike and reckless will eventually commit suicide, and those who uphold justice will be able to hold the ticket to victory. England, America, and the Soviet Union may have different objective doctrines, but their democratic spirit should be consistent. Just as they said that they would learn from the past and be careful in the future, there must be closer cooperation among the three powers. However, the London Conference of Five suddenly announced a loss of communication, and rumors arose, and speculation was rampant. For a time, the gloomy clouds shrouded us again. Why is that? The remnants of fascism have not been completely eliminated, and the alliance itself is not firm. Only because the elimination of evil is incomplete, it is inevitable that there are dormant and concealed generations, secretly launching an attempt to succeed. Only because their unity is not firm, they give people the opportunity to take advantage of the gaps and crevices, and they are calculated without realizing it. A single spark can start a prairie fire. Those who worry about the sky are more than just a few. Fortunately, the Moscow Three-Power Conference was able to quickly reach an agreement to clarify the chaotic situation of no rain for two months. From now on, we can use a more harmonious spirit to seek a more united cooperation, abandon selfish opinions, and express sincere intentions, so that the tragic disasters of the world and the holocaust of the universe will no longer appear before us, and will be completely eliminated from now on. This is one of the things we pray for.

Since the establishment of the Republic of China, warlords have been in chaos and civil wars have been frequent. The people of the country have been deeply tired of suffering and resentment, and they often harbor a curse. After the Northern Expedition was completed and the country was unified, the people in various places began to enjoy the pleasure of living a little. After that, the Japanese invaded, and the soldiers were in constant trouble. In the past eight years, the iron hoofs have spread almost all over the country. At this time, although the people suffered from the pain of oppression, devastation, and death, no one did not regard the victory of the War of Resistance. It is enough to know that the people's hearts are clear, and the foreign invasion should be resisted, and it cannot be compared with the dispute between the walls. Now, after the loss of everything, in this land full of scars, there is a brewing of internal strife and war. How can the melons under the Yellow Terrace be picked again? No wonder people across the country are distressed, running around to warn us. The original brothers and sisters born of the same root and the things of the same kind who seek each other have feelings of harmony and no unsolved grievances. Why must they meet with soldiers and horses to be the final solution? The chants of cooking beans to burn the silk and the rumors of a foot of cloth and a bucket of millet are what the ancients deeply grieved about. Today, they can serve as a warning. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference is about to be held, and the important figures of the government and the public are sitting together. It is expected that all kinds of complicated and disputed issues can be discussed calmly, and reasonable arrangements can be made, and the people's panic can be eliminated invisibly. This is the most wise measure of our government authorities, and it is also the most favorable gift for the New Year. I hope that all parties and factions can concentrate their opinions, seek mutual understanding, strengthen their belief in sincerity, avoid unnecessary suspicions, and work together to revive the country after the war and lay the foundation for a stable people's livelihood. This is the second thing we earnestly pray for.

The inevitability of eliminating corruption has been a common fact, and the phenomenon of public officials bullying people is also not a phenomenon that should exist in a democratic country, and it must be corrected or punished. The general national character of our country has always been known for its integrity, but it also has its great weaknesses, that is, it cannot maintain its ambitions, and it is easily dominated by the environment, or it ignores its own strength, and it is good to rely on attachment as a good plan. Therefore, when he is a commoner, he is afraid to see the government and is afraid of disputes. Even if there is a coming of injustice, he only takes tolerance as the main thing. Once he gains the support of power, he also thinks about using his power. The so-called one-time officer, the face is completely different, and today, it is really everywhere. A few days ago, President Chiang inspected the old capital and allowed the people to complain about their grievances. He received more than a thousand posts, and those who did not dare to petition were not more than horses. This proves that the people's daily suffering from oppression is not small, and public officials who do not know how to love themselves and use their power for private purposes are seeing more and more of them. There is a President who cares about the people's suffering, but there are no subordinates who deeply embody his efforts. It is a pity. I deeply hope that from now on, the whole country will be vigilant and self-discipline. Those in power should take the heart of President Jiang to protect the people as their heart, and do not use their authority recklessly. Those who are oppressed should know to take the principle of complaining and reporting, and do not seek to indulge and tolerate. The meaning of equality is consistent, and the meaning of democracy is extended. This is the third thing we eagerly look forward to.

The above points are mostly old sayings, and the original essence can be respected. However, to achieve this, it is a common aspiration of the people. It is not a very high argument, it is just to see that our words are in line with what is recited. We hold three wishes to look forward to the glorious beginning of the future and to wait for the prosperity of the Republic of China.

### Shanghai Citizens Enthusiastically Celebrate the First New Year After Victory, Mayor Qian Hosts Leaders from All Walks of Life This Year

Today is the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, and it is also the first glorious National Founding Day of the Republic of China after victory. All agencies, public organizations, schools, etc. in the city will have a day off, and the entire city will hang national flags to celebrate. In addition to holding a group worship ceremony at the City Hall at 9:00 am, Mayor Qian Dajun will also hold a reception at the conference room on the second floor of the City Hall at 12:00 noon to entertain Chinese and foreign military, political, party, and police officials, as well as celebrities and distinguished guests from all walks of life in society and culture. The Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the Municipal Party Department will also hold a joint group worship at the same time. All police stations will be decorated with colorful decorations. General Wedemeyer is scheduled to hold a cocktail party at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 pm today to entertain American military officers and celebrate New Year's Day in 1946.

End of the Year and Beginning of the Year, Full of Peaceful Atmosphere

Yesterday, Shanghai celebrated New Year's Eve in 1945 for the first time in eight years. This last day of 1945 was full of peaceful atmosphere. Shanghai, the oriental port, has always been known as the "city that never sleeps." This winter, with nearly 10,000 American troops spending New Year's Eve here, it is even more lively. After the recovery of Shanghai, the business of dance halls, bars, and restaurants has doubled. The establishment of so-called "night clubs" (dance halls and bars combined) has sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Some are operated by Chinese, some are operated by Jews, and there are also many operated by White Russians and French. The films shown in the theaters here are all those that have been screened in the mainland. There are several old films that have been screened for nearly a week, and the box office is still strong. Seeing that the entertainment venues are charging exorbitant prices, the US military has set up several clubs to provide rest and entertainment for the US military. Among them, there is fine wine and music, and the cost of enjoyment is less than one-tenth of the price charged outside. Last night, there were dances in all the US military clubs, and the American Red Cross provided free hospitality to the soldiers. The Military Commission's Battlefield Service Corps and the Allied Forces Service Committee also had various programs to entertain the Allied Forces. The sports programs for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are more exciting than usual. Major companies and stores are vying to win by designing their large discount advertisements. The streets of Shanghai are crowded with pedestrians all day long, and New Year's Eve is even more bustling. The weather has been clear and sunny for several days. In addition to the deepening cold, there has been no cloudy or foggy weather. Although the New Year's Eve scene is not very significant, the people of Shanghai, who have been under Japanese control for several years, feel that this New Year's Eve is very different from the past once they are free from bondage.

Chinese and American Generals Enjoyed Themselves Together Last Night

Since the Asia Ballroom of the Dashin Company in this city was rented by the Battlefield Service Corps of the Military Commission as a place for the noble entertainment of the Allied and National Armies, last night, on New Year's Eve, senior generals of the Allied and National Armies, including Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, Zhang Yulin, the head of the press liaison group of the Third Front Army, and more than 200 senior Chinese and foreign military officers, Chinese and American soldiers, enjoyed themselves together, and the situation was very enthusiastic, fully demonstrating the spirit of Sino-American friendship.

### A Whistle Blows, A New Beginning

The first New Year's Day after the victory began with the simultaneous sounding of whistles across the city at the stroke of midnight. What were once air raid sirens have now transformed into sounds of peace, lasting for half an hour, giving residents a sense of renewal with each whistle. Simultaneously, naval vessels in the Huangpu River shone their lights, illuminating the city, symbolizing brightness, to celebrate the New Year's Day of the 35th year.

### Wang Shuxian and Yu Jianmin Arrested Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Shuxian, the third son of the late philanthropist Wang Yiting, 53 years old, from Wuxing, residing at 64 Route Doumer, had served as a compradore for Nisshin Kisen Kaisha for many years. During the enemy and puppet period, he was once in charge of the "puppet organization's" grain monopoly. Yu Jianmin, 45 years old, from Zhenhai, residing at No. 8, Lane 5, Rue de Gasi, had served as the "Business Director of the puppet organization's China Merchants Steam Navigation Company." Both were arrested at their residences yesterday by military authorities on suspicion of aiding the enemy.

### Another Foreign Spy, Mike Berou, Detained

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following Shali'er, another foreign spy named Mike Berou was captured by our Songhu Garrison Headquarters. He claimed to be of Dutch nationality, but after investigation, he was found to be a member of the Nazi Party. During the War of Resistance, he specialized in collecting important information about the United Nations and secretly providing it to Germany. After the victory, he resided near Rue Lingsen and Rue Muling, living a secluded life. After days of investigation by the Headquarters, he was finally captured a few days ago in a bar on Wuchang Road, Hongkou, and is currently detained at the Dege Bridge concentration camp.

### Murderous Demon Brothers Dos Arrested

The Russian murderous demon brothers Dos were arrested one after another a few days ago. During the enemy occupation, they boasted of having killed many people, and countless patriotic individuals were murdered by them. The elder of these two murderers is named Shaji Dos, and the younger is named Balis Dos. They initially worked as special agents in the puppet Manchukuo Military Police, and came to Shanghai in the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]. They then joined the ranks of Wu Shibin under "76." All major assassinations carried out by "76" were presided over by the Dos brothers. The unprecedented large-scale assassination bloodbath at the Jiangsu Farmers Bank in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], and the major acts of violence in which the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury was bombed several times, resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries, were all the "masterpieces" of the Dos brothers. They always carried two pistols with them and could fire with both hands. Their agility and accuracy with firearms were second to none among the enemy and puppet executioners. After the victory, their whereabouts were extremely secretive. The American military here had investigated them, but failed to capture them. A few days ago, Shaji Dos was finally captured by our side. Balis Dos was also implicated in another arms trafficking case and a lead was obtained. He was captured by the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters the night before last. It is reported that Dos has admitted to his atrocities at "76."

### Vehicles Keep to the Right, Starting This Morning

[Our Newspaper's Report] Starting at 6:00 AM this morning, vehicles across the country began to drive on the right side of the road at the same time, and pedestrians are required to keep to the side. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has completed the reconstruction of all tram waiting platforms in the city and has also replaced the "turn right" signs at midnight last night. Today, the police局 will dispatch a large number of traffic police to direct vehicles and maintain order in the bustling street areas.

### Mr. Ye and Mr. Niu Sympathize with and Relieve the Hidden Poor

The Central Government's special envoys, Ye Chucang and Niu Yongjian, after arriving in Shanghai, noted that many hidden poor people in the area were coming to plead their difficulties. Therefore, they requested the Shanghai branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to coordinate everything, so that honest and upright people could gradually alleviate their distress.

### The Truth About Jiang Weizu's Rumored Detention

Recently, various newspapers have repeatedly published reports about the chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Court, Jiang Weizu, going to Chongqing to report on his duties and being mistakenly reported as being detained. Yesterday, our reporter visited relevant figures in Shanghai's legal circles to inquire about the truth of the case. According to them, Jiang's ancestral home is Jiangsu, he has a bachelor's degree in law from Great China University, and later graduated from the judge training institute. He has served as president and chief prosecutor of courts in Zunyi, Qijiang, Luxian, Wanxian, and other places. He is known for his upright character, integrity, and hard work. This spring, the Ministry of Justice launched a training class for judicial personnel in Taiwan, and Jiang was transferred to receive training. Upon completion, he ranked first in his class. After the victory, he was promoted to the position of chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Court. After arriving in Taiwan, due to differences in style with the court in handling handover matters, he was summoned to Chongqing to report the details. On December 14, Jiang boarded an American military plane to Shanghai and then to Chongqing with documents personally signed by Chief Executive Chen Yi. Various bizarre rumors immediately spread, which were believed to be malicious slander from those who were jealous of him. In addition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration denying this in newspapers in Chongqing, the relevant authorities are currently investigating and handling the matter.

### Flagpole Installation Fees Vary Between Districts

[Our Newspaper's Report] The various police stations in the city were ordered to standardize the method of hanging the national flag throughout the city, and ordered the various sub-bureaus to hire workers to install iron frames and flagpoles. According to the announced prices, each set of triangular frames costs 450 yuan, and each flagpole costs 255 yuan, totaling 705 yuan. However, the amounts charged in various districts of the city vary. Most of them are higher than the prescribed prices. Our newspaper's reporters specifically investigated the actual prices paid by citizens in various districts, and the figures are as follows: Huangpu District, 705 yuan; Old Gate District, two types: 705 yuan and 955 yuan; New City District, 960 yuan; Taishan District, 955 yuan; Changshu District, two types: 955 yuan and 1,000 yuan; Jing'an Temple District, 955 yuan.

### British Ship Yushan Encounters Danger, Investigation Reveals It Ran Aground

The British ship Promethius, which transported more than 6,700 bags of wheat from the US Relief Administration to Shanghai, encountered difficulties in navigation when it sailed to the waters of Yushan, 90 nautical miles from the Wusongkou, and entered the port yesterday afternoon. According to the ship's crew, on the evening of the 26th, when sailing to the waters near Yushan, it suddenly ran aground, and the bow cabin hit a reef, immediately piercing a hole. Seawater entered, but fortunately, the ship's cabins were separated, so only the bow cabin was flooded, and the second cabin was unaffected. The shipowner immediately took rescue measures to plug the hole.

### Abolition of Livestock Monopoly Tax Implemented from New Year's Day

Mayor Qian gave a speech yesterday about the abolition of the livestock monopoly tax: "It has been found that the city's livestock monopoly tax is levied on livestock passing through the border, similar to the old likin. It was originally a bad policy during the enemy and puppet period. After the city was recovered, various taxes were gradually sorted out, and the consumer special tax, poultry special tax, beef and mutton special tax, miscellaneous license tax, telephone donation, gold special tax, etc., which disturbed the people and did not comply with the central government's regulations, were abolished in succession. Now, in order to take into account the difficulties of the people and avoid harsh harassment, this livestock monopoly tax will be abolished starting from New Year's Day of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946]. The Bureau of Finance has been ordered to do so, in order to relieve the people's difficulties."

### American Invention: "Scented" Movies

According to the China Amateur Radio Association, an American film studio has recently produced a film that, in addition to having sound and color like ordinary sound films, can also allow the audience to smell various fragrances at the same time, corresponding to the plot of the film. This kind of "scented" movie is truly a shining point in the film industry. Scientific progress is endless, which is amazing.

### Military Authorities in the City Rectify Military Discipline, Arrest 97 Soldiers Who Caused Trouble

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the unfortunate incidents that have occurred recently in various cinemas and theaters in the city, the soldiers involved will be severely punished. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has drafted a plan, which will be implemented after Chief Commander Qian approves it. Generally, soldiers will be allowed to enjoy entertainment once a week, and the time will be set during the daytime. This is in accordance with Chairman Chiang's handwritten order that soldiers are not allowed to go out without reason after 6:00 PM every day. The preferential theater tickets will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters by the theaters and then distributed. When each theater opens, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters will send troops to supervise, and anyone who enters the theater without a ticket will be prohibited.

More than 120 soldiers were arrested the night before last at the China Grand Theater on Niuzhuang Road for causing trouble while trying to watch a free show. However, about 20 of them were found to have been arrested for forcibly trying to pass through the prohibited area where the incident occurred. The Garrison Headquarters released them yesterday morning because they were not related to the trouble caused by watching a free show. The remaining 97 are still temporarily detained in the Old Gate Branch Bureau and will be severely punished separately to serve as a warning and rectify discipline. Regarding the military discipline of soldiers in this city, Mayor Qian had received a telegram from Chairman Chiang two months ago, ordering that "From October 1st, officers and soldiers are not allowed to go out except on Sundays, and on Sundays, they must all return to their units before 6:00 PM without delay. Senior officers at all levels should set an example and strictly comply to avoid undermining discipline, harming military reputation, and preventing the gradual deterioration of the physical and mental strength of officers and soldiers." After receiving the order, Mayor Qian immediately forwarded it to the military units and military organs in the city for strict compliance, and then repeatedly reiterated the previous order that officers and soldiers must not enter the theater without a ticket, and the Garrison Headquarters stipulated regulations for soldiers to watch theater. However, some soldiers still did not obey the order, forcibly watched free shows, and repeatedly beat theater personnel. The authorities were extremely angry about this and resolved to rectify the military discipline in the city as soon as possible. The Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters first arrested and punished all the soldiers who caused trouble at the China Grand Theater last night and planned to prevent similar incidents from happening again. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Director Cheng Yiming of the Investigation Department personally went to the Old Gate Branch Bureau to speak to all the arrested soldiers who caused trouble. Cheng detailed the responsibilities and duties that soldiers should fulfill and the discipline they should observe, and told them that their mistakes this time not only damaged the reputation of soldiers but also hindered the reputation of the entire country. After listening to the speech, some soldiers were moved to tears. Cheng left the Old Gate Branch Bureau and returned to the Headquarters at 11:15 AM.

The unfortunate incidents of soldiers causing disturbances in various cinemas, Peking opera theaters, and dance halls in the city for days are deeply and greatly related to the city's public security and military discipline. Our reporter specially visited the Changju of the Third Front Army stationed in Shanghai for this matter. According to the organization, after the headquarters of the Third Front Army and the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters moved to Wuxi, only the Shanghai Command Post was established here, responsible for handling the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war and all unfinished surrender matters. All troops stationed in the city are not within the command system of the Command Post. The incidents of military disturbances for days are indeed related to public security and should be investigated and severely punished by the responsible authorities to rectify military discipline.

### Major Extortion Case on Taicang Road, Preliminary Hearing Yesterday, Ring Leader Claims to be a College Student

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 7th of last month, at the residence of tobacco merchant Li Wenxiang at No. 158 Taicang Road, Zhao Shiji, who falsely claimed to be a confidential secretary of the Intelligence Section of the US Army Headquarters, suddenly led three accomplices, riding in a black-licensed car, to Li's residence and extorted a huge sum of money from Wenxiang. The driver, Jiji, climbed over the wall and secretly reported it to the Taishan Branch Bureau, and they were all arrested on the spot, sent to the Garrison Headquarters, and punished according to law. Yesterday, the chief culprit was questioned by the Military Law Office. According to his confession, his name is Zhao Shiyi, 29 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 2 Apartment, North End of Sichuan Road. He had studied at St. John's University for three years and studied at Waseda University in Japan. He falsely claimed to be a confidential secretary of the Intelligence Section of the US Army Headquarters, forged documents, and signed his name as Major Major Malson, Chief of the Intelligence Section of the US Army Headquarters. He did not deny leading three accomplices to extort money. He was forced to take this measure due to unemployment, but his subordinates and accomplices have not yet known their true identity. After an hour and a half of interrogation, he was ordered to be temporarily detained. Our reporter learned that when the suspect was arrested by the Taishan Branch Bureau, his clothes were neat and his documents were complete. The documents were sent to the US Army Headquarters in writing. According to the reply, there were no such personnel, and he was ordered to be severely punished. Therefore, the case was reported to the Headquarters for handling according to law.

### Zhou Yiwei's Case of Enlisting Laborers for the Enemy Concluded, Debate Ended and Sentencing Scheduled for the 7th

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of traitor Zhou Yiwei enlisting laborers to supply the enemy was heard at the Shanghai Prison High Court in Tilanqiao at 9:30 AM yesterday. First, Prosecutor Lin read out the main points of the indictment, stating that the defendant had served as a translator and instructor at the former "Shanghai Branch Office of the Petroleum Joint Venture for Recruiting Chinese Laborers." In May of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], he was entrusted by the office to use huge

wages as bait

and recruited about 80 laborers in the Yangshupu area. After gathering them in Pudong, they were transported by ship to Taiwan and other places to be used by the enemy's military. On October 4th of last year, Tang Qinzhang and others, family members of the recruited laborers, tied up the defendant at No. 30, Yongchang Lane, Lane 385, East Changzhi Road, and handed him over to the police局, who transferred him to the Prosecutor's Office. The facts have been admitted by the defendant and testified by family members of the recruited laborers at the police局. There are also two or more people whose whereabouts are still unknown and two certificates. It is sufficient to prove that the defendant violated Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors,

communicating with enemy countries

and recruiting laborers for military use. He requested the court to punish him according to law. Then, Zhou Yiwei asked Judge Liu for leniency. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Yu Huimin, stood up to defend him, listing eight reasons and requesting the court to declare him innocent. At 10:15 AM, Judge Liu announced the end of the debate, the defendant was returned to custody, and sentencing was scheduled for the 7th.

### After the Announcement of the Taiwan Dollar Exchange Rate, Gold Notes Show a Slight Decline, Chinese and Foreign Stocks Still Trend Strong

Because yesterday's newspapers reported the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender was temporarily set at 1 to 30, and US$1 could be exchanged for NT$37.05, some people estimated the new exchange rate of the US dollar should be 1,111.5 yuan, triggering a selling trend. The opening price in the morning fell from 805,000 to a low of 790,000. Later, due to the absorption of US dollars by large investors, it was able to be supported. At this time, the output of US dollars to gold has been as low as 570 yuan or less, and there are quite a few people who exchanged notes for gold. It gradually rose back to 808,000. At noon, the bulls and bears fought slightly, hovering around 800,000. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to around 805,000, a slight drop of 7,000 compared to last Saturday. Silver bullion was 86,000, silver 600 yuan, silver dollar 440 yuan, and the secret discount was initially weak at one tenth of a yuan, but later, due to the slight setbacks in gold stocks, the road was slightly stagnant, about eight cents.

Because the temporary exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar to the legal tender and the US dollar has been announced by Chief Executive Chen, the general public calculated that the US exchange rate was only over 1,110 yuan (this is the price of the Taiwan Bank's exchange of Taiwan dollars, which was ignored by the general public), and the prices in Chongqing's note market were also reported lower, and people's hearts were slightly hit, but large investors took advantage of the low price to absorb them. After opening at 1,385 yuan in the morning, it gradually rose to 1,425 yuan, struggling around 1,420 yuan at noon. As a result, it fell back a little compared to last Saturday by 10 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar is still stable, and there is news that the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai is flattening. Many non-industry people are interested in new goods, forming an excess of demand over supply. As a result, compared with last Saturday, old goods were flat, while new goods were 2 yuan better.

Due to the closing of accounts by people in the government bond industry, there were no public sales yesterday, but the dark market slightly opened at the previous day's closing price.

Large investors in Chinese stocks repeatedly used a strategy of wanting to catch but letting go, first releasing and then receiving. As a result, the upper market was quite weak. Cotton mills retreated to the 800 yuan mark, Meiya broke the 600 yuan mark, Xingguang saw a transaction of 49 yuan, and Qinxing broke the 40 yuan mark. Immediately, large investors came out to cover their positions, and individual investors rushed to cheer, and non-industry people also divested gold to buy stocks, and the recovery was particularly rapid. Cotton mills saw a high price of 900 yuan, Meiya 700 yuan, Xingguang rose to over 57 yuan, Jingfu 53 yuan, and Qinxing 48 yuan. Near noon, large investors first released and then advanced a second time, and the shares wrote back more than half a percent, but the closing price was still pulled up. In the end, Meiya rose sharply, and the trend was even stronger than that of cotton mills. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, cotton mills rose by 50 yuan, Meiya by 75 yuan, Xingguang by 3 yuan, Jingfu by 4.5 yuan, and Dongxing by 5 yuan. All small and medium-sized unpopular stocks were also able to keep up.

Foreign stocks also moved up and down with Chinese stocks, and were extremely firm in the middle of the day. The noon closing gradually stabilized. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yisha rose by 230 yuan, Yipi by 20 yuan, Paper Industry by 15 yuan, and Rubber stocks were still in excess demand, but the supply of goods increased gradually with a 10% increase in the closing price.

### Spot Yarn Sales are Smooth

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to soar, because passenger sales from all directions were still extremely active, and they all took spot goods as their goal. The going rate for customers from Shantou and Xiamen was quite smooth, and customers from Beijing and Hangzhou also absorbed them as the market rose. Most of them were 20 counts, and the price rose by about 20,000. Cloth factories and socks factories still need fine yarn and double money, and the price has risen by another 560,000. Although the supply and sale from the factory side is not much, the people in the industry think that it is extremely flat.

### White Coal Price Increase Slows

The coal market is as firm and stable as ever. Due to the year-end, transactions are slow. The price increase of Yangquan white coal has gradually slowed down, but it remains stable at its peak. Lump bituminous coal is eagerly sought after by users, and the market is trending briskly. Bituminous coal from layered factories sells very slowly, and the potential is quite soft. Although the arrival of firewood from overseas has decreased, the arrival on inland rivers has increased instead. However, there are also many buyers who are actually selling, and the price remains stable.

### Banking Industry Holiday for Three Days

Today (the 1st) is the founding anniversary of the Republic of China. The 2nd and 3rd are for the banking industry to handle the annual accounting. All banks, firms, and exchanges in the city will uniformly take a three-day holiday. However, various companies, firms, the Jianghai Customs, and the Post Office will only take a one-day holiday. During the holiday period, all bill exchanges will be handled after resumption of business, it is said.

### Rice Market Stable, Peanuts and Sesame Slightly Rise

The rice market digestion is still weak. Northern rice is moving but not brisk, leading to a stagnant situation. However, early thin rice from central, lower, and southern regions shows a slight increase of 100 yuan. After the continuous sharp drop in Baiyin yuan, yesterday, due to the stores taking advantage of a clever pickup, it recovered from fatigue and rose again, increasing by 300 to 500 yuan. Flour is sluggish, continuing down by 100 to 200 yuan. Medium and inferior miscellaneous brands are oversupplied and lack buyers, with prices down by 200 to 300 yuan. The oil market continues down by several hundred yuan. Flat-price oil is being sold by various oil stores, and it is expected to be sold after the New Year's opening. A portion has already been distributed, and there will be continued distribution in the future. Soybean cakes in Shantou and Xiamen continue to be processed and remain firmly established. The high price of soybeans is slightly reduced. Peanuts are exceptionally popular, increasing by another 1000 yuan. The price of sesame has risen by more than 1000 yuan, and the destocking is still active. Cottonseed cake is firming due to the rising price of fuel. Wheat bran is stable. The wine market is expected to rise from tomorrow.

### Summary of Market Conditions

A fierce price increase has been triggered in the dye market. Large quantities are being absorbed in Jiangbei, Hankou, Qingdao, Wenzhou, and other areas. As a result, dyes such as vulcanized black, indigo powder, double goose yuan, and fast indigo have all increased by 20% to 30% compared to last weekend.

Walnuts have not completed the customs declaration procedures for arriving ships, and delivery must wait until after the New Year holiday. Therefore, dealers who have existing stock are reluctant to sell, and bargaining is brisk.

Twelve-pound fine cloth white fabric is still in short supply. Dyeing and weaving factories are eager to dye them and are willing to pay higher prices to purchase them.

### The Financial and Commercial Situation Over the Past Year

— Chong Bo

The 34th year of the Republic was the most painful and darkest period for Shanghai's entire society. Although Germany and Japan surrendered in May and August respectively, and victory belonged to our country, the price inflation surged turbulently, and the depreciation rate of counterfeit currency was shockingly low. It was truly a memorable page in Shanghai's commercial history. Recalling the past events, I will describe them as follows:

Finance: At the beginning of the year, credit was relaxed, with the daily interest rate for 1000 yuan only at 3%. In late January, it was changed to 6.5%. It was not until late August, when World War II ended and prices began to fall sharply, that banks and money shops closed down and went into liquidation in large numbers. The rate gradually decreased from 3% to 2%, and even fell to 0.5% in late September. After October, when the exchange rate of 200 counterfeit yuan to 1 legal tender was determined, the use of silver by the speculative market and hoarding households increased, and it rose again from 1% to 3%, remaining unchanged until the end of the year. The highest interest rate was probably 50% in early August when Russia declared war on Japan, but it only lasted for three to five days in the stock market. The counterfeit currency fluctuated around 800,000 yuan in early January. On the 17th, it reached a low of 760,000 yuan. In late January, it broke through the 1 million yuan mark, and from then on, it soared. In late February, during the red plate trading at the beginning of the lunar year, it was suddenly rumored that Japanese merchants and Deng's troops were buying up, breaking through 3 million yuan. In early March, it was heard that the price of gold in Chongqing was cheap, and counterfeit gold securities were listed, causing the price to weaken slightly. Later, as the situation in Germany deteriorated, speculative buying became tighter. In mid-April, it suddenly reached 12 million yuan. In May, when Germany had surrendered, counterfeit gold securities were oversupplied and slightly leveled off. In June and July, as Japan suffered repeated defeats in the Pacific War, the price of gold soared. In late July, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, the price of ten taels of gold rose to 130 million yuan. On August 10, Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced unconditional and total surrender, and the peak reached 200 million counterfeit yuan. At that time, as the world war ended, our troops were successively airlifted to Shanghai, and hoarding households rushed to sell, causing it to plummet to 23 million yuan in just nine days. However, at that time, the exchange rate of counterfeit currency was only 60 or 70 to 1. Afterwards, the black market price of counterfeit currency fell further, and the price of gold rose further, returning to 10.6 million yuan. It was not until September 28, when it was clearly stipulated that 200 to 1, and all prices in Shanghai were traded in legal tender, that the price of gold stood at 384,000 yuan. In late October, the reception of North China and the Nine Northeastern Provinces suffered setbacks, and the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party failed, causing asset owners and speculators to buy gold again. On the 31st, it saw a peak of 1.1 million yuan, which was 20 million yuan higher than the peak of 200 million counterfeit yuan on August 11. In November, it hovered around 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. Later, due to the resumption of sea transportation and the beginning of foreign trade, the US dollar fell to 1000 yuan on December 11. Due to the understanding of 60 US dollars per tael of gold, the price of gold fell to 583,000 yuan. However, the financial authorities were quite in favor of raising the US dollar exchange rate to reduce the large amount of imported goods in order to protect the country's nascent industries. Therefore, it returned to a high of 813,000 yuan at the end of the year, which was 33,000 yuan higher in legal tender than the 780,000 counterfeit yuan at the end of the 33rd year, and actually a huge increase of 161.82 million counterfeit yuan. The price of silver was the same as at the end of last year, but it also rose significantly in counterfeit currency. At the beginning of the year, the US dollar was sold for 1200 yuan. In late September, after our troops reached Shanghai, the US dollar soared to 170,000 counterfeit yuan. In early October, after switching to pricing in legal tender, the low was 675 yuan. Later, due to the uncertainty of foreign exchange, import and export merchants used the US dollar as the price standard for goods. On the 31st, the peak was 1780 yuan. On December 10, when American and British banks resumed operations, it was suspected that the US exchange rate would be listed, and the US dollar fell to 930 yuan. Finally, because our country's laws did not allow foreign merchants to re-engage in foreign exchange, and the authorities tended to raise the US dollar, it rebounded. At the end of the year, it closed at 1430 yuan in legal tender, which was 430 yuan higher in legal tender than the 1000 counterfeit yuan at the end of the 33rd year, and actually an increase of 185,000 counterfeit yuan.

Securities: Among government bonds, the Unified C-type was the most active. At the beginning of January, it stood at 360 yuan. Later, due to the increase in the exchange rate of legal tender and the international situation being favorable to our country, the market price gradually rose. In mid-August, the Japanese army surrendered, and it soared to 170,000 yuan. After switching to pricing in legal tender in late September, it once fell to 210 yuan in late October due to face value repayment. Finally, due to rumors of Sun Yat-sen's bonds being redeemed and victory subsidies, and at the same time, the exhaustion of actual chips, it caused a short squeeze. On December 19, the peak reached 850 yuan, which was comparable to the peak of 170,000 counterfeit yuan in August. At the end of the year, it closed at 770 yuan, which was 390 yuan higher than at the end of the 33rd year. The buying of Chinese and foreign stocks was very tight, and both closed at new high prices at the end of the year. The leading Chinese stock, Wing On Textile Factory, closed at 820 yuan at the end of the year, which was 395 yuan higher than at the end of the 33rd year.

Goods: Among commodities, yarn and flower cloth fell in name but rose in reality. Raw silk rose greatly in both name and reality due to export relations. British and American cigarettes also rose sharply due to foreign merchants and American tobacco leaves. White coal rose in both name and reality due to insufficient inventory. Although other goods fell in name, they were all higher than in the 33rd year when calculated based on the counterfeit currency exchange rate. The market prices of major commodities are listed for comparison below. (Unit: Yuan)

It is estimated that this work will take about two or three weeks, so the date of his return to China is currently difficult to determine.

They submitted a request to withdraw from the league to the Football Association yesterday. From then on, Group A will have one less strong team, becoming a situation of seven heroes competing for dominance.

### New Year Start

— Jin Chun

"New Year starts writing, all things are auspicious."

"New Year writes in red, all things are prosperous."

I remember from my childhood, every New Year, the first thing to do in the morning was to follow the adults and respectfully write auspicious words on strips of cut red paper. After writing, we would paste them on the wall next to the desk, and we would always go to look at them. At that time, I didn't quite understand the meaning of these sentences, but I was always so excited when writing them.

The auspicious words for the New Year start writing are pasted new every year, and then fade away with the years. I gradually developed a kind of attachment to writing auspicious words for the New Year start writing, and even more boundless regret.

Originally, a literati who made a living by the pen was naturally very cherished by his pen. The pen made him satisfied, but it also made him disappointed; the pen made him happy, but it also made him sad; the pen made him glorious, but it also made him shamed and unfortunate. He longed to use his pen to complete his great task, unwilling to write those trivial and untuned works; he longed to use his pen to describe the happy things of mankind, unwilling to record those tragic and unfortunate events; he longed to use his pen to freely express his thoughts and convey the public opinion of society, not wanting to get into unexpected disputes because of words. In the past, this kind of wish was probably not easy to achieve, but at least it was what he had always longed for. So, every New Year, we can easily imagine: he writes on red paper with that pious mood; "All things are auspicious," "All things are prosperous." I no longer see that it is a seasonal decoration, no longer feel that it contains some slight superstition or clichéd components, I see that the red paper strips fade year after year, and are pasted new year after year, I sympathize with the sadness of the literati, and even more admire the greatness of the literati.

For the past eight years, I have neglected the matter of writing for the New Year start writing, and the red paper strips pasted on the wall many years ago have also faded into a blur.

Today is the first New Year after victory. When I got up early in the morning, I was filled with a special excitement, felt more sincere and more confident, and wrote on red paper:

"New Year starts writing, all things are auspicious."

"New Year writes in red, all things are prosperous."

I take these two auspicious words to encourage myself, and I respectfully use these two auspicious words to congratulate the readers.

Customs

### New Year Anecdotes

— Dong Xin

New Year's Eve Vigil

"Customs Records" says: "In the customs of Shu, until New Year's Eve, people stay awake all night, which is called 'guarding the year.'" Su Dongpo's poem "Guarding the Year" says: "Wanting to know the year that is about to end is like rushing to catch up with a fleeing snake." People in Europe and America also have the custom of guarding the year. On New Year's Eve, they sit and stay awake, quietly listening to the bells in the church ringing out the old and welcoming the new. It is said that the ringing of these bells on New Year's Eve originated with the ancient British. According to British customs, before twelve o'clock on New Year's Eve, the bell is covered with cloth, and what is heard is a low sound. As soon as it strikes twelve o'clock, the cloth is immediately removed, and the bell immediately emits a clear and loud sound. One represents the declining old year, and the other symbolizes the brand new New Year. Men of letters also love to listen to the sound of bells. Deng Lisheng has a poem about hearing the bells on New Year's Eve, and Lan Bai also said, "The most solemn and moving of all bell sounds is the New Year's Eve bell."

New Year's Gift Giving

In our country, giving gifts for the New Year is a very old custom. In the West, giving New Year's gifts originated with the ancient Romans. Originally, the Romans were supposed to give gifts to the senators on New Year's Day, so that the senators would protect them during the year. The Roman Emperor Claudius even set a law stipulating that senators should not solicit gifts at ordinary times, but could openly solicit them on New Year's Day. Historians Suetonius and Tacitus have detailed records of this type of custom. At that time, the gifts given were just small trinkets. The custom of giving New Year's gifts later spread to the British, and gradually spread throughout Europe. In England, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the custom of giving New Year's gifts was most popular, and the gifts given were also increasingly extravagant and varied. It is said that Queen Elizabeth's first pair of black silk stockings was a New Year's gift from a favored minister, which was the beginning of women wearing silk stockings, because before that, Queen Elizabeth had always worn cloth stockings.

Speaking of giving New Year's gifts, among the Western countries today, France and Spain are probably the most authentic. At one time, the most common New Year's gift was gloves. Later, everyone became accustomed to using candy. Monthly calendars were also very popular because they were very timely. Recently, many people like to buy books as New Year's gifts.

New Year Greetings

We still follow the custom of New Year group greetings. Some elderly people and women, who do not go out all year round, will also cheer up, put on new clothes, and go out to pay their respects on New Year's Day. There is a book that talks about the British New Year's greetings very interestingly. The British habit of New Year's greetings was also learned from the Romans. At one time, everyone took this etiquette very seriously. On New Year's Day, the whole family would go out to pay New Year's greetings, but as a result, everyone couldn't meet anyone, because everyone was not at home. In fact, our New Year's greetings are also like this.

The American custom of New Year's greetings was passed down from the Dutch, because the Dutch are the most polite and hospitable. However, nowadays, because people are busy, this ancient custom has gradually become less valued in European and American countries.

Celebrating the New Year

Although the way various countries celebrate the New Year is equally enthusiastic, the methods are somewhat different. In European and American countries, Christmas is usually more lively than the New Year, but among them, the French pay more attention to the New Year. The New Year seems to be a social season.

People in Scotland have a superstition that whoever is the first to visit someone's house on New Year's Day will have good luck all year round. You are early, and I am early. Later, as soon as the clock strikes twelve on New Year's Eve, the New Year's greetings have already entered the house, so everyone celebrates wildly all night.

In the era of Imperial Russia, New Year's celebrations involved firing cannons. Nowadays, in Norway, Sweden, and other countries, people still like to fire guns when celebrating the New Year, so that all that can be heard during the New Year is the sound of guns and cannons.

On New Year's Day in Japan, pine, bamboo, and shrimp are hung on the door. It is said that pine represents longevity, bamboo represents youth, and shrimp represents happiness.

The most common way to celebrate the New Year is to have a big meal, but the way of eating and the types of food vary from place to place. Savages eat to wish for strong bodies, while civilized people also mix in superstitions about good luck when they eat. It is said that Persians eat eggs during the New Year, because eggs symbolize new life. That's why Westerners also give eggs at Easter. We also eat tea eggs during the New Year, but they represent the original reality.

### Passing the New Year, Becoming a New Person

— Jian Ru

In the blink of an eye, thirty-four years have passed unconsciously. What follows is the New Year of the thirty-fifth year, which is worth seizing—the first New Year after the victory of the War of Resistance. This is how I see it: passing the New Year, becoming a new person.

In fact, I misspoke. What is the New Year? What is a new person? Originally, the New Year is the moment of the future. A new person is someone who generates new strength in that moment, engages in new development, and toils to become a new person. The elusive moment is the New Year. We must seize the moment and remake our lives.

There are so many incomplete lives in the world that have shattered their fate. Byron's foot was lame, Beethoven's ear was deaf, Miró, with his flat nose, and Milton, who was blind—how unfortunate they were, their lives were flawed. However, they constantly struggled and resisted, constantly demanded to pass the New Year, and finally demonstrated their genius, achieved great careers, and became new people.

The New Year—what is the New Year? Every day is the New Year, as long as we strive every day. There is a bright lamp burning ahead. As long as we have the efforts of Byron, Beethoven, and Milton, and continue to move forward, the bright lamp will fall into our hands, and we will be new people.

### Forget Eight Eggs and Rampant Eight Eggs

— Du Yun

It is said that there was an old couplet that said, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, faith, propriety, righteousness, and integrity." The former hides "forget eight," and the latter hides "shameless." For this reason, in Mandarin cursing, there is the phrase "forget eight eggs." Today, we are delighted to celebrate the New Year's Day of the thirty-fifth year of our great Republic of China. How can we scold people? Let's explain these two phrases.

"Forget eight eggs" means we can forget the past eight New Year's Days. Those days were difficult, and the environment was depressing. Now we have won. We are passing this ninth New Year's Day, the sun and sky are shining again, and the world is at peace. We wish for the country to be settled this year, everything to be on track, prices to fall, people's livelihood problems to be solved, the nation to be built successfully, and the glory of a great power to be maintained, just like "a woman who is in labor has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child has been born into the world." After enduring the hardships of the past, this so-called "War of Resistance is a process!" has produced a lively and vibrant truly free country, and the true meaning of the revolution has been completed. This so-called "nation-building is the goal." With the goal achieved, how can we not rejoice!

Also, the enemy used to seek out opportunities to invade, always liking to create a day with the number eight, such as September 18th, January 28th, August 13th, and January 28th. Now that the enemy has surrendered, the coming of this New Year's Day tells us not to commemorate these ominous eights anymore. This is also called "forget eight eggs."

As for the people and property of our former occupied territories, which suffered the enemy's eight years of rampaging, passing through eight New Year's Days, this is called "rampant eight eggs." By the time of the ninth New Year's Day, that country that disturbed world peace and harbored the ambition to invade has been defeated and can no longer be rampant.

Society

### Coincidental Folk Prophecies

— Xu Jinqing

Ancient nursery rhymes often contained profound meanings that were incomprehensible at the time. However, sometimes the facts manifest themselves and have the wonder of "foreknowledge."

In the summer of this year, in Ningbo society, someone started to say that the enemy would scram in the autumn. When asked how they knew, they said that "at the latest" it would be at the time of "new rice fallen." The reason was that after Ningbo fell, the first "commissioner" was the traitor Shen Erqiao, the second was the traitor Tao Xiaojie, the third was the traitor Luo Mengxiang, and the last was the traitor Lu Maoyi. After the four traitors "New" (Shen), "Rice" (Tao), "Occupy" (Luo), and "Fall" (Lu), there would be no successors. Therefore, it was determined that "new rice fallen" was the "latest" time for the Japanese devils to scram. Because at that time, the chairman of the puppet Zhejiang Province was the traitor Ding Mocun, and the puppet county magistrate of Yin County was the traitor Yuan Duanfu, "Ding Yuan" was a homophone for "latest."

Unexpectedly, in early August, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the United States used atomic bombs. Under the double pressure, the enemy army could not bear it and surrendered unconditionally. When the enemy troops withdrew from Yongcheng, it was the day of the new rice harvest, which was really an interesting coincidence.

### Celebrating a Happy New Year After Victory—Wishing Readers to Work Hard for "Social Service"

Today, we are delighted to celebrate the first New Year after victory. After eight years of arduous war of resistance, everyone is having a happy New Year, and there is unspeakable joy in their hearts! Looking back, the people of the whole country, no matter where they were, north or south, no matter how old or young, who did not yearn for an early victory and to see the light again! Sure enough, final victory came, and we are delighted to celebrate a happy New Year. We can't help but shed tears of joy. The people of the whole country have today's glory and happiness. To state it clearly, the first thing we should do is thank the Supreme Leader, President Chiang, for his great achievements!

The New Year has arrived. We should examine our own responsibilities. For the society, the country, and the post-victory reconstruction, everyone must not easily abandon their responsibilities in any aspect. From now on, we must first ask ourselves, what kind of people will we be? Can we still follow the old ways, be complacent, have a declining will, outdated thinking, dissolute behavior, speculate and take advantage, and harm others to benefit ourselves? No! We must never retain the breath of inferior races. Everyone must be a first-class great citizen who is self-reliant, vigorous, diligent, cautious, loyal, and courageous. Everyone must serve the country and serve the society in everything. Only then can our country be revived and become rich and strong! Doesn't President Chiang say it very clearly in his book "China's Destiny"? Life is for "service." May all compatriots in the country do their best!

### Ensure Safe Navigation—Please Pay Attention to the Navigation Authorities

After our country's coast was occupied by the enemy army, they buried mines and other explosives. During the occupation period, I don't know how many ships have been sunk by mines. In May of this year, the Huatai Wheel, traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo, sank after hitting a mine in the Tongsha waters outside Wusongkou, resulting in thousands of lives lost. Since the arrival of victory, the relevant authorities have begun mine-sweeping work, but the effectiveness of the work is not known to ordinary citizens. This time, the Hua Sheng Wheel, coming to Shanghai from Fujian, again hit a mine and crashed at the above-mentioned location, causing considerable loss of life and property. Who is responsible for this? Yesterday's newspaper also reported that a British ship encountered danger in the Sheshan waters. It is reported that other ships have also suffered the same fate. Therefore, we respectfully request that the navigation authorities and relevant agencies discuss and carry out large-scale mine-sweeping work in the short term, in order to completely eliminate mines and ensure safe navigation.

### Prospects for the Cultural Movement

— Zhang Daofan

Written for New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China

The essence of culture is upwardness and freedom, which is what Hegel called "seeking a higher liberation." This liberation includes the individual's soul seeking upwardness and the nation's spirit seeking freedom. Its process is a movement. Since the Reform Movement of the late Qing Dynasty, there have been many routes for cultural movements in our country, and the pace has also been chaotic. At that time, we failed to choose and absorb foreign cultures well, and international political aggression shook our inherent fine national virtues. In the past hundred years of the late Qing Dynasty, "the country and the nation in politics, economy, society, ethics, and psychology, all suffered from declining customs, internal crises, and almost destroyed the foundation of our regeneration and blocked the source of our revival" (quoted from President Chiang). If it were not for the National Father adapting to the trends of the world on one hand and inheriting historical traditions on the other, the cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People, Chinese culture today would not have regained its upward path.

The process of a cultural movement should include two stages: cultural struggle and cultural construction. The cultural movement of the Three Principles of the People has already completed its mission of struggle in the process of the National Revolution. The task for the future should be to move forward on the path of active construction, with the ultimate goal of completing the five major constructions of psychology, ethics, society, politics, and economy.

The outline of the cultural movement promulgated by the Central Government in the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic of China briefly put forward the principles of the five major constructions. In terms of psychological construction, we must "establish a revolutionary worldview, reform the Chinese people's attitude of living in the moment, coldness, and selfishness, and be able to raise the spirit of initiative, establish self-confidence, and practice revolution." In terms of ethical construction, we must "improve the people's behavior, restore the nation's inherent morality, and promote it, cultivate the national character of nobility and soundness, so that our 450 million compatriots can all sacrifice the small self, benefit others, be loyal to the country, be filial to the nation, value integrity, love the people, and help each other peacefully." In terms of social construction, we must "enable the lives and actions of all members of society to follow certain rules, and enable all basic undertakings related to the people's welfare to be built in an orderly manner." In terms of political construction, we must "strengthen the ability to exercise the four powers based on the spirit of initiating the national autonomy and promote the realization of national politics." In terms of economic construction, we must "fill up national defense and enrich people's livelihood, with the aim that people do their best, land does its best, things do their best, and goods flow smoothly."

These five major constructions are actually the foundation of nation-building. In this short article, we cannot elaborate on them. What we want to say today is how the direction of the cultural movement in the future should be coordinated with the principles of these five major constructions. Regarding this point, President Chiang gave us clear instructions in his victory broadcast on the National Day of the 34th year of the Republic of China. He said that the direction of cultural construction after the war is to promote scientific research, guarantee academic freedom, and shift social customs. Please discuss it.

Nation-building work needs talent in everything, and needs technology in everything. Our China lags behind in everything, and science is even more so. The current world has entered the era of atomic energy, but the development of our industry has not yet entered the mechanical age, which is really lagging behind. In the future, we must catch up on one hand, and correct the tendency of neglecting the development of science in China in recent years on the other hand; that is, emphasizing applied science and neglecting pure science. From the perspective of academics themselves, this is neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing the branches. From the perspective of practical technology, it is also reversing the importance. Because practical science relies on deep academic theory as a foundation. Now that our country is a scientifically backward country, and there is such an unhealthy trend, we should be especially vigilant. In his instructions on the direction of cultural construction after the war, President Chiang has already clearly stated that pure science should be given the same importance as applied science.

However, the research of profound academics relies on the national education policy and political system to respect the development of people's individuality, and more relies on the legal guarantee of academic freedom, so that academic research can grow freely and flourish.

The great cause of nation-building has a myriad of details, but there is one fundamental thing, which is to practice realistic talent. In recent years, our social atmosphere has been too bad. There are indeed many people who are loyal to the country and the nation, but the general social customs are cold and selfish, competing and fighting. The direction of our future cultural construction efforts should be to transform the social atmosphere. There are a few old sayings in China, "The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, the virtue of a villain is like the grass, and the wind on the grass must fall." The so-called wind here is a kind of atmosphere. If our social atmosphere can be shifted to diligence, honesty, and compliance with the law, then the past ailments of inertia, laziness, hypocrisy, and extravagance can be eradicated. This is a very difficult task, but it is also the most basic task. We often hear that the social commentary on the failure of something is that human planning is not destroyed. If we make a deeper observation, we will find that behind this person lurks a bad social atmosphere. Now that nation-building is starting, we must first transform the social atmosphere.

As the saying goes, "Those who travel a hundred miles are halfway at ninety." Although our eight years of arduous war of resistance have ended in victory, there are still many hardships ahead for nation-building. The struggle mission of the cultural movement has been completed, but the work of cultural construction is more complex and heavy. At the beginning of the year, I would like to express my views and share them with the cultural figures of our country.

### The Rebirth of Christianity and Chinese Culture

— Ye Qiuyuan

The first day of the 35th year of the Republic of China is the first joyful New Year after the victory of the War of Resistance. This is the year when active nation-building begins. The departments included in the work of nation-building are originally broad; however, the most important and fundamental is cultural construction or spiritual construction. In terms of material construction, we may build 14,000 kilometers of railways and 1,500,000 kilometers of highways in the future, and have 14,417,400 merchant ships and 10,000,000 yarn spindles. However, if these material constructions are not accompanied by cultural construction or spiritual construction, it may lead to bad consequences. Therefore, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, in "China's Destiny," when discussing the focus of nation-building work, first discussed psychological construction and ethical construction; these are all parts of cultural construction or spiritual construction. From the historical facts of nation-building, we see two examples that can serve as our model for nation-building. The first is Japan, and the second is the Soviet Union. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan actively engaged in nation-building, transplanting almost all of Western material civilization; thus, it was able to become increasingly rich and powerful. However, in the process of its nation-building, it neglected cultural or spiritual construction, and failed to simultaneously adopt the core of Western spiritual civilization, so that sixty years of arduous nation-building work was destroyed in an instant. As for the Soviet Union, it took socialism as its highest ideal for nation-building, so during the consecutive five-year plans for material construction, it devoted itself to the work of socialist cultural construction. The outcome of this remains to be seen in the future; but in any case, its ability to pay attention to both material and cultural construction at the same time is worthy of our reference. China takes the Three Principles of the People as its highest aspiration for nation-building, emphasizing both material and spiritual development; this has been repeatedly proclaimed by our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and has long been regarded as a guiding principle. Now, at the beginning of the year of active nation-building, I would like to offer a perspective on the rebirth of our country's culture.

Speaking of our country's culture, including our thoughts, behaviors, habits, as well as daily life, clothing, food, and so on, it originally contains a large number of foreign elements, not just things of our own. It goes without saying that we live in Western-style houses and ride in cars, but even in ordinary things, we have accepted foreign things everywhere. Our "national music," such as the pipa and huqin, originally came from the Western Regions, not our authentic "national music." Our "national medicine" hangs a plaque of merit that says "Hua Tuo Reborn," but whether this Hua Tuo was an authentic Chinese is also a question. Our old ladies in the countryside, when seeing tragic things, burst out and shout "Amitabha"; this "Amitabha" is also not something we originally had; people in Confucius's time would not have shouted this. Even our "national costume" of a blue robe and black mandarin jacket is not our own costume, but the clothing of the Manchurian barbarians. Instances like these show that our country's culture contains many foreign elements. Perhaps it is not an overstatement to say that the times when China's interaction with foreign countries was frequent and its contact with foreign cultures was particularly abundant were also the most brilliant periods in the history of Chinese culture, such as the Tang, Song, and late Ming and early Qing dynasties. If Chinese culture has a characteristic, that characteristic lies in its ability to absorb foreign cultures.

China's initial contact with the West was guided by religion. The Nestorianism of the Tang Dynasty—a branch of Christianity—although not from Western Europe, already came from the Roman world in the Mediterranean, and its written language was mainly Syriac. During the Yuan Dynasty, the Roman Pope sent Franciscan friars to China to preach, which was the earliest record of our country's contact with Western Europe. Later, from the Ming and Qing dynasties to modern times, China's contact with Western Europe became increasingly frequent. Large numbers of students went to Europe and America, and European and American businessmen came to China one after another, causing changes in the lives of Chinese cities and Chinese people. The call for "industrialization" and "scientification" gave China's traditional life and culture the outward appearance of Western modern material civilization. However, Western spiritual life, that is, the religious life of Western Europe, was neglected. We see Western material civilization, but often do not pay attention to Western spiritual civilization. Some people even think that we ourselves have a high degree of spiritual civilization and disdain to pay attention to Western spiritual civilization. The result is that those who study abroad live in Western-style houses, ride in cars, and take concubines, even to the point of engaging in corruption and bribery, neither adhering to China's inherent propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame, nor understanding Western spiritual values, resulting in the loss of moral principles. Therefore, in the work of nation-building, ethical construction is the most fundamental.

Christianity is the foundation of Western European spiritual life. If Western Europeans have some virtues, the source of these virtues is not in the clarity of their politics, but in the fact that their lives are quietly influenced by Christianity. The clarity of politics is merely the result of the Christianization of their lives. In times of crisis, we often see British and American leaders invoking God with a religious tone. Their lives and behaviors are subject to the double restraint of religion and morality, so that they can be orderly. These are all things we should learn from. We should absorb the strengths of Western material civilization, but we should also adopt the strengths of Western spiritual civilization. In adopting Western spiritual civilization, we should adopt Christianity. Nation-building accompanied by "industrialization" must have nation-building accompanied by "Christianization." The rebirth of Chinese culture lies in how to absorb the essence of Christianity and blend it with our country's traditional culture, thereby promoting a new cultural movement. In our country's traditional culture, we must add some new blood, and this new blood is Christianity. Our country's inherent morals are all Christian morals. These moral ideals have been abandoned in recent years and need to be nurtured with the new blood of Christianity to grow.

Christianity seems to be something undigested in our country's culture. Although Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, and Yang Tingyun in the Ming Dynasty translated some books related to Christian faith, this work was later suspended due to the Qing court's management. In the past hundred years, Catholicism has mainly focused on penetrating into the people, so it has not devoted much effort to cultural activities; in the so-called anti-religious movement, even when establishing universities, it neglected the study of Chinese culture, so it has not had a profound impact on Chinese culture. Now that unequal treaties have been abolished, the spread of Christianity in China will become even more prosperous. If Christianity is to play a role in Chinese culture, it must first be accepted by the Chinese people; and to make it accepted by the Chinese people, it must first establish Christian literature. When Buddhism came to China, it played a role in Chinese culture by dedicating itself to the establishment of Buddhist literature. The number of Christian classics is countless, but few of these have been translated into Chinese; therefore, Christianity has not yet had an impact on Chinese literature and is not valued by the literati. In the future, Christianity must first establish Christian literature, and then the spread of Christianity in China can reach the general intellectual class. Our enlightened Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in the midst of his busy schedule, still devotes himself to the revision of the Chinese translation of the Bible, in order to establish Christian literature for China. His intention is profound, and there is no need to say more.

From the standpoint of Christianity, Christianity has a mission to absorb the cultural traditions of various cultures, but it itself stands above the cultures of all nations. Therefore, Christianity is French culture in France, American culture in America, and Spanish culture in Spain. But Christianity itself contains the strengths of the cultural traditions of various nations. Christianity originated among the Hebrew people, and it naturally contains Hebrew traditions, and when it spread to the Greek and Roman world, it absorbed the traditions of the Greek and Roman world. The historical mission of harmonizing Greek tradition with Christianity was not completed until the 16th century by Thomas Aquinas. He Christianized the tradition of Aristotle. This is an important synthesis. When Christianity comes to China, it must be harmonized with Chinese tradition, and the core of Chinese tradition is Confucian thought. Christianity's position as a world religion lies in its ability to absorb and harmonize, so it must absorb and harmonize the Chinese Confucian tradition. This absorption and harmonization can bring Christianity into a new stage, and at the same time, it can give a new force to the Chinese Confucian movement. This harmonization will undoubtedly be a brilliant page in the history of Chinese culture. The rebirth of Chinese culture lies in this.

Looking at the world today, the division of cultures clearly presents three trends. On the one hand, we see the Soviet Union actively attempting to build its socialist culture. On the other hand, Western Europe, the Americas, Australia, and most of the world are Christian worlds. In addition, there are culturally backward nations. If we want to extricate ourselves from cultural backwardness, we must either take the road of socialism or the road of Christian civilization, and only this road is our road. When discussing psychological construction and ethical construction, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly urged us to restore our inherent morality. The restoration and rebirth of morality in our country depend on the promotion of Christianity in China, Christianizing our old ethical concepts, so that a new force and a new atmosphere can be generated. We hope that the people of our country will pay more attention to the study of Christianity, and that Christianity itself will also pay more attention to the study of Chinese culture. Chinese culture will become more lively and brilliant by absorbing Christianity, and Christianity will become more enriched by absorbing and harmonizing Chinese tradition. Cultural construction, spiritual construction, are found in this.

### Democracy and the Rule of Law

— Yang Youjiong

The current trend of world political thought is inevitably toward democratic politics; however, democratic politics must be based on the rule of law. The democratic politics of Britain and the United States, which are admired by the Chinese people today, have been able to be implemented for a long time because of more than a century of rule of law habits and traditions. The British political habit is that when Parliament expresses a vote of no confidence in the Cabinet, the Cabinet must resign or dissolve Parliament to seek public opinion to determine whether to stay or leave; the American party law stipulates that a presidential election is held every four years. These are the legal norms that the democratic politics of Britain and the United States follow. If the British Cabinet did not resign when Parliament expressed a vote of no confidence, or if the American president refused to step down and run for election after his four-year term expired, could the democratic politics of Britain and the United States have continued peacefully to this day? Therefore, we believe that talking about democracy must not be separated from the rule of law. To be honest, without the intention to maintain law and order and implement the rule of law, one must not extravagantly talk about democracy. This principle is very clear and does not need to be discussed in detail.

Constitutional implementation is not far away, but the Chinese people's concept of the rule of law has not been deeply cultivated, and law and order have not been firmly established. If right and wrong are not clearly distinguished, how can the people have a deep understanding of democratic politics? The basic spirit of the rule of law is to make political life dominated by reason. Reason is opposed to force, so all issues that may cause political disputes in the country cannot be resolved by force. We currently need to establish a kind of law and order, so that the government and the people have a common norm to follow. The nation-building procedures stipulated in the Outline of Nation-Building have been recognized by the whole country as the political norms on which constitutional and party politics are based. We should not seek other political solutions outside of this political norm. Therefore, we pay attention to the evolution of the current political situation. We hope that the government and all parties will not abandon law and order, and will not fail to follow the normal path of democratic constitutionalism due to temporary political disturbances, otherwise there will be concerns that the more one tries to straighten out the threads, the more tangled they become.

Convening the National Assembly is the only way to resolve the current situation, but the government has repeatedly postponed it in the past, and cannot show the people of the country the determination to establish the National Assembly as a normal path for building constitutionalism; some people even believe that convening the National Assembly will be the main cause of political disputes. If one really wants to abandon the National Assembly and put it aside, how will those political commentators who use the end of tutelage and the implementation of constitutionalism as an excuse for unrest achieve true democracy? We believe that the spirit of democratic politics lies in reason and sincerity, but it is definitely not a tool for political struggle. If democratic politics cannot be established on the basis of the rule of law, the political situation will only become more turbulent, and political struggles will never end. Here, we must remind the people of the country that they should recognize that democracy and the rule of law are two major conditions for the implementation of good governance.

We certainly cannot say that having a constitution means democratic politics, but in today's China, we do need a constitution supported by the people. More than 30 years have passed since the founding of the Republic of China, and we still do not have a fundamental law. If the fundamental law is not established, how can the norms of constitutional politics become more solid? Therefore, we advocate that the National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible to complete the constitution-making work, so as to lay the foundation for the rule of law. The Chinese people's habit of the rule of law is not deep. It is not enough to actively create norms for constitutional politics to maintain social order. Even the so-called people from various parties and factions should compete intellectually and politically in constitutional politics, and should not always focus on the struggle for real political power. We only hope that the upcoming Political Consultative Conference can achieve the level of "consultation," and must not allow it to change the procedures of constitutional politics due to the consultation of parties and factions. How closely the people of the country pay attention to this!

Since the establishment of the Republic of China, most of the disturbances that have occurred have been due to political struggles that do not follow legal procedures and use unscrupulous means. Political struggle in democratic countries is not an inauspicious term. Political struggle must be within the scope of law and order, otherwise, even if everyone advocates democracy, it will not help the implementation of democratic politics. Today's political theories are complex, and the threads seem to be complicated. In fact, when it comes to theory, we only hear simple democratic slogans. The term democratic politics includes a broad history, and its content often varies considerably with time and place, but in historical development, or from the trend of the system, democratic politics has a significant material, that is, each political party seeks the support of the people with its own propositions, as a prerequisite for obtaining political power. We hope that the so-called people from various parties and factions today will put forward their clear political platforms, solicit the public opinion of the people across the country, and strive for the support of the people on the legal track of the country, and only a selfless political proposition that meets the needs of the times can be believed by the people. Democratic politics can never be realized by relying on political talk, nor can it be established by dancing parties and cultivating relationships. These are all perfunctory and expedient, and how can they really plan for the country's long-term interests? The foundation of true democratic politics must be built on policies supported by the whole people. We advocate that people from various parties and factions should publicly put forward their political propositions at this time, and launch debates on policies, oppose any ambiguous political deals, and any secret political negotiations. Only through debates on policies can the truth of democratic politics be discovered, and only by winning the belief of the people with policies can there be hope of obtaining political power or continuing political power. Otherwise, it is not the demeanor of a democratic politician. We stand on a pure objective position and believe that only by following the established nation-building procedures of the country, implementing constitutional politics, and enduring eight years of suffering, can the people have a day of peace and happiness.

### Proposal to Establish a Special Agency for Engineering Management

— Chen Ruxuan

With the victory of the War of Resistance, nation-building is becoming increasingly urgent. The central government has recently drafted a one-year construction plan. In accordance with the Industrial Plan personally drafted by the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and the industrial construction indicated by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the focus of nation-building work in the future has been followed. In summary, the main points include the construction of railways and highways, the construction of coastal and inland river ports, the dredging of rivers, the improvement of Chen Tian water conservancy, the development of power, the installation of telecommunications, the construction of public housing and mining factories, the installation of urban tap water and sewers, as well as the construction of national defense fortresses and airports, all of which belong to the scope of public works.

Public works have a guiding and driving role in economic construction. At the beginning of material construction in advanced countries, they almost all used them to establish the foundation of industrial construction. Especially during periods of economic panic, they often used the holding of public works as an important strategy to solve the problem of unemployment. The reason is that public works can employ a large number of workers and solve their livelihoods; they can increase the demand for tools and raw materials and stimulate their production. In 1933, when the economic panic wave was surging, US President Roosevelt implemented the "New Deal," and held flood control, reclamation, municipal electrification, and other projects, which were mainly based on public works, and finally safely overcame the difficulties, enriched national strength, and achieved remarkable results, which can be clearly demonstrated. After the completion of public works, they develop resources, promote production, facilitate the transportation of goods, the circulation of finance, improve the lives of the masses, and make the society prosperous. Their merits are long-lasting and benefit the people's livelihood, which is even more unnecessary to mention.

At present, China's social economy is in a period of turmoil. The war against Japan ended not long ago, but the industry in the rear area feels unable to support itself due to the sluggish sales of products and the tight money supply, and there is a sense of impending doom. Shutdowns and layoffs are occurring from time to time, and calls for relief are heard everywhere. The government has no choice but to issue industrial loans and implement subsidies to barely save the immediate emergency, but it is not a fundamental solution. At the same time, after the military ends, veterans are demobilized, and when demobilization is implemented, a large number of surplus officers and soldiers will need to be properly settled. In addition, the original military engineering projects have been stopped, and most of the technical employees must change their jobs, and it is not convenient to let them idle. The original organization and tools and materials should be used. All these circumstances are obvious. As the saying goes, "The stones of other mountains can be used to polish jade." The precedents of the Allied countries can be used as a reference. It is undoubtedly necessary to quickly launch various public works according to the plan, so as to settle personnel, stimulate production, and solve the current urgent social and economic problems.

According to this scope, the special engineering management agency will not have the problem of unclear division of labor with the original administrative agency, and can accelerate the progress of its business. It will be able to promote the construction plan to its full advantage, and the future of nation-building will be promising.

Public works are the basic work of nation-building, and are especially the current priority. Since they are as described above, the agency in charge of this project has a great impact on the effectiveness of the implementation, and it is necessary to review it. Now, according to past experience, I will briefly discuss the Chinese and foreign systems.

The progress of public works must be rapid and economical, and attention must be paid to the proper allocation of manpower and materials. When the project is in progress, a large amount of manpower and materials are needed to actively catch up, and after the project is completed, this manpower and materials do not need to be kept for a long time, and should be transferred to other new projects, so that people are not idle and materials are used to their full potential. Therefore, the engineering agency in charge should have a special agency, so that it can plan and coordinate as a whole. This is the first point.

The holding of public works requires a large number of technical personnel. These personnel must be reserved and organized in advance, so as to avoid temporary gathering and wasting time and effort. There are not many engineering specialists in China at present, and the tools and instruments that can be used are limited. Special effort should be made to concentrate strength, improve the organization, and unify command, so as to go to work. This is the second point.

The nature of engineering construction is different from that of administrative management. During the construction period of public works, the emphasis is on technology, and the need for engineering specialists is greater. After the completion of public works, it becomes a public enterprise, and the management and operation require more administrative talents. The situation is different from that during construction. In order to make proper use of the two and each fulfill their responsibilities, engineering and management should be separately managed, and should not be managed concurrently. This is the third point.

### A Prospectus for New Shanghai's Cultural Development

—

With the victory of the War of Resistance and the return of the concessions, the new Shanghai Municipal Government, since its establishment, has faced a multitude of issues to address. The greatest objective is to build a new Shanghai. We observe that while the various measures taken in the past concessions created Shanghai's prosperity, they neglected cultural endeavors. The most notable aspect was perhaps the Municipal Council's band. Initially, it primarily catered to Western audiences, but later Chinese people joined. Besides this, there were only the library and a few schools dedicated to training comprador talents in translation. The former Mayor Wu Tiecheng expressed his regret regarding this situation. During his tenure, Mayor Wu constructed a gymnasium, a library, and a museum in the city center, representing the preliminary achievements of Shanghai's cultural development. Unfortunately, these were all destroyed during the war. Now that the municipal authorities aim to establish a new Shanghai, they naturally recognize the importance of cultural development and are determined to actively pursue it. Regarding the restoration of the library, the former Municipal Council's library has already been acquired, temporarily sufficient to meet needs. Concerning [gymnasiums/sports venues], various venues within the former concessions can be utilized to supplement needs, so excessive considerations are unnecessary at this time. Recently, we heard that the municipal authorities are planning to establish a scientific research institute, which is excellent news, and we would like to express gratitude on behalf of young people dedicated to scientific research. However, there has been no news about the restoration of the museum. In the past, the museum's reputation exceeded its physical structure and the scale of its displays, which seemed disproportionate. During periods of local prosperity, undertaking such a venture still fell short of ideal standards. How much more challenging is it now, after a major war, when vitality has not yet recovered? Since restoring the museum may be difficult in the short term, I humbly suggest revising the approach, scaling down the scope, and establishing an art museum. This might be easier to implement. When funding becomes more abundant in the future, restoring the museum separately would also be acceptable. Once the scientific research institute is established, the art museum should follow suit, as the promotion of science and art should proceed in parallel.

Science and art are the two wings of modern civilization. Science is the driving force behind material construction, while art is the driving force behind the improvement of life. A country aiming to build modern civilization cannot lack either of these elements. (Here, we must especially commemorate the late Mr. Chiang Pai-li, who had the most profound understanding of this issue.) Placing exclusive emphasis on science while neglecting art is a biased and inadequate perspective. Indeed, after the victory of the War of Resistance, our urgent task is national reconstruction. Our national reconstruction involves not only demanding a democratic political system but also, and primarily, material construction. To complete the country's material construction, we need science and scientists. We have heard that the National Government already has considerable plans for the construction of a new China, preparing comprehensive steps to implement them in phases. The scale of this endeavor is certainly grand. However, our scientific talent is woefully inadequate. How the government should broadly plan to cultivate various kinds of scientific talent is a topic I will not delve into here. Judging from the situation in Shanghai, the scientific literacy of the people of Shanghai is slightly higher than in other places, and the tools and equipment for various research endeavors are also superior to those in other places. Currently, it is imperative to utilize Shanghai's foundation and intensify cultivation. That the municipal authorities can attend to the establishment of a scientific research institute amidst numerous pressing matters demonstrates their ability to see the bigger picture and grasp the fundamentals. Now that there is a plan in place, we hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible. Not only that, but we also hope that it will be gradually expanded, from one institute to ten, and from ten to a hundred, and that it will progress from general to specialized fields. It should not only be available to teachers and students in schools but also provide ample opportunities for researchers outside of schools to utilize it. I believe that if we unite schools, factories, and organizations to work together, achieving this aspiration is not impossible.

Regarding the construction of an art museum, it may currently be viewed as a municipal embellishment that can be postponed. Little do people know that while Shanghai has been dubbed a cultural center in the past, it has also long faced accusations of neglecting cultural development from another perspective. At this juncture of municipal renewal, there must be a new turn to refresh perceptions. Art has the most significant and effective impact on guiding and elevating human thought and life. From the perspective of artistic creation, it unleashes humanity's creative will and capacity. From the perspective of artistic appreciation, it inspires humanity's upward aspirations and empathy. The cultivation of art can elevate human life to the purest, most excellent, and most sublime realm, which cannot be compared to moral instruction or legal constraints. Mr. Cai Yuanpei said that aesthetic education can replace religion, which is truly the insightful observation of a great scholar, worthy of thorough consideration by educators and cultural figures today. In terms of the most immediate situation, clean and orderly environments are invariably cultivated from the cultivation of the idea of beauty. All cold, selfish, base, and degenerated tendencies are also naturally eliminated by the expansion of an appreciation for beauty. As for all industrial and craft production, they will naturally compete and progress due to the increased opportunities for observation, which benefits commercial and industrial development – this benefit is self-evident.

The promotion of art should be accelerated. Therefore, it is hoped that the municipal authorities will prepare to establish an art museum after the scientific research institute is established. In the initial stages, it is not necessary to strive for comprehensive facilities. It is sufficient to construct suitable buildings with adequate capacity to display three sections: Chinese painting, sculpture, and applied arts. Then, gradually expand to include Western-style paintings and sculptures created by Chinese artists. As the name suggests, the exhibits in the art museum should primarily focus on visual arts. The general approach in the past was to neglect the essential elements and seek only a wide variety of items, resulting in a complex and disordered display that overshadowed the main purpose. This situation must be rectified. If sufficient funding is temporarily unavailable to acquire exhibits, one may temporarily consider borrowing from private collections and rotating them periodically. According to my personal knowledge, there are many valuable works of art among the enemy and puppet properties in Shanghai. I wonder how the responsible authorities will handle them? If a thorough investigation is conducted and the municipal government manages to acquire them as the foundation for the municipal art museum, this would be ideal. At the same time, to subsidize the running costs, a portion of the museum could be designated for rental to various exhibitions, charging reasonable fees, which would be greatly welcomed in the art community.

We are aware that the current municipal expenses are extravagant, and the authorities are currently trying to tighten their belts. The establishment of the scientific research institute is already a rare achievement, let alone hoping for more such institutes, and even more so hoping to establish an art museum? However, cultural undertakings are related to the grand strategy of building the nation. Parents in families are even willing to tighten their belts and work hard to maintain their children's educational expenses. Leaders of the government should also have the heart of virtuous parents and, while saving and eliminating expenses in other areas, should not only avoid cutting back on cultural undertakings but also expand them to the greatest possible extent. It is hoped that in this year—the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China—three or more municipal scientific research institutes and one municipal art museum can be established in Shanghai. "The plan for the year lies in the spring, and the plan for the day lies in the morning." On this New Year's Day, I humbly offer this small suggestion, hoping that the municipal authorities will pay attention to it.

### The Full Picture of Shanghai's Municipal Administration

—Special Report from Our Newspaper's Interview Team—

The city of Shanghai has endured the flames of war and been ravaged in countless ways by puppets. For eight years, municipal facilities have been largely at a standstill. Today, with the initial arrival of victory, the municipal government is faced with a daunting task involving a myriad of details, all of which require proactive adjustment. To understand the progress of the city's municipal administration over the past three months, our newspaper dispatched its entire interview team to visit the municipal government and its various bureaus and departments. Our goal was to gather real-world data and provide citizens with a systematic report.

The main questions we posed were: (1) Since taking over, what have been the most significant achievements of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its various bureaus and departments in terms of the city's administration and construction? (2) What are the main obstacles facing municipal administration in the past three months? (3) What is the central plan for building a great new Shanghai? (4) How efficient are the work of the municipal government and its various bureaus and departments? What is the spirit of promotion?

Summarizing our reports, we have obtained the following answers: (1) Under the leadership of Mayor Qian, although the various units of the municipal government have faced significant environmental obstacles and numerous work difficulties in the past three months, they have made great achievements in rectifying past malpractices and promoting the city's overall development. However, citizens have had limited opportunities to interact with the municipal government, and therefore, the general public remains largely uninformed about its operations. (2) The biggest difficulty currently facing the municipal government is the financial shortfall. All administrative and construction projects require substantial funding. With the current financial instability, many projects cannot be actively promoted. (3) Due to time and financial constraints, the overall plan for building a new Shanghai is still in the throes of difficult birth. Based on current observations, in the short term, the municipal government can only focus on restoring facilities destroyed by the enemy and puppets, with little capacity to advance the grand plan of building a new Shanghai. (4) The administrative leaders of this city, from the mayor down, are among the most respected professionals in the country. The caliber of the bureau directors is unmatched by any other city in the country. However, the organization of each bureau is currently not tight enough. Therefore, if the efficiency of work is assessed based on the number of staff, it still does not meet the ideal level, and the procedures for handling affairs are still not as streamlined as they should be.

According to the various reports collected by this newspaper, the most important issues currently facing the municipal government are: (1) Establishing a solid financial foundation to ensure not only a balanced budget but also sufficient economic strength to promote various administrative and construction plans. All municipal facilities in the city, such as expanding education, establishing various social welfare programs, building new roads and docks, building affordable housing, promoting public health, and strengthening police force, rely on economic driving forces. Therefore, the most pressing preliminary issue is centered on the "money" factor. (2) Promoting municipal construction requires a comprehensive plan, formulating a five-year or ten-year construction plan for the entire city to ensure the balanced and reasonable development of various projects. Based on our observations, the municipal government should, in the short term, consult with city leaders to carefully study the overall construction outline, so that Shanghai's construction can be implemented step by step based on a "blueprint" as soon as possible. (3) On the one hand, the municipal government must actively cultivate the integrity of its general staff. At the same time, it is also necessary to gradually improve the treatment of staff within possible limits, so that the Shanghai Municipal Government can follow the examples of Britain and the United States to cultivate a general pool of healthy, specialized civil servants.

Municipal Government

Editor's Note: This article is Mayor Qian's New Year's Day essay, entitled "Shanghai's Municipal Administration After the Restoration," which is about 5,000 words long. It elaborates on future municipal facilities in ten major categories. Today, our newspaper is featuring a special report on the full picture of municipal administration, and Mayor Qian's article is perfect as the leading piece to provide an overall framework. However, since the manuscript is a bit long, the sections below B will be moved to page five for editorial reasons. The special report from our newspaper's interview team will follow immediately after section A. Readers' understanding is appreciated.

Today is the New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China, which is also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Since its establishment, our Republic has been full of sorrows and dangers. It was not until last year that we gained a position of freedom and equality, presenting a bright and splendid future. In addition, for eight years, our compatriots have been living in war and spending their New Year in the sound of artillery fire. It was not until this year that the hard times came to an end, and everyone celebrated peace and prosperity. This is truly something to celebrate.

At the beginning of the year, various newspapers publish articles. I think that instead of writing general platitudes, it would be better to selectively record the municipal facilities of the past three months. This can provide a basis for self-assessment and also help citizens understand the situation. Therefore, I wrote this article to replace discussions. However, municipal facilities are complex and involve countless details. Now, they are described in ten months, as follows:

A. Consolidating Public Security

Shanghai is an international city with a complex situation. After eight years of occupation by the enemy and puppets, bandits are rampant, traitors are everywhere, order is chaotic, and public security is worrisome. After taking office, I made restoring order and consolidating public security the top priority. The work can be described in two categories:

1. Purging traitors and preventing bandits. Since taking over, the city has been actively investigating the actions of traitors, collecting evidence, and conducting strict investigations. A total of 128 cases involving 573 people have been investigated and reported. To prevent bandits, in addition to strengthening police force, special household registration inspections, civilian gun registration, management of stations, docks, hotels, and other public and private places, and the arrest of scattered soldiers, vagrants, and hooligans are carried out to eliminate the source of bandits. Since taking over, 56 bandit cases involving 311 bandits have been solved. Currently, efforts are being concentrated on prevention and suppression in order to clear the situation.

2. Strengthening the police force and supplementing police preparedness. This is done from both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quantitatively, the city has a vast area, and the existing police force is still insufficient. Active efforts are being made to supplement it to ensure it is sufficient. Qualitatively, the qualifications for candidates are raised and training is strengthened. Training education, new management education, and refresher education are all actively underway. To supplement police preparedness, vehicle patrols, horseback patrols, and motorcycle teams are organized to patrol different areas in coordination with various branches to ensure public security. At the same time, a security committee is organized to unite with all sectors of society and supplement the security corps to share the responsibility of protecting the local area.

Bureau of Finance

Director of Finance, Pu Zhengdong

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the first measure taken by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance was to abolish the consumption tax and gold tax illegally levied by the puppet regime. The revenue from these two special taxes accounted for more than 70% of the city's total tax revenue each month. Suddenly losing it was indeed not easy to replenish. Therefore, the bureau turned to rectifying the accumulated malpractices in tax administration, eliminating embezzlement, and saving administrative expenses to replenish construction funds. The operation and work were extremely difficult. According to Shanghai's local taxes and levies, most of which are sporadic, such as the slaughter tax, entertainment tax, banquet tax, license tax, hotel tax, and property tax, the main local tax revenues during the enemy-puppet period, for example, from January to the end of August of the 34th year of the Republic of China, were converted into legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1. The average monthly tax revenue was 2,409,740 yuan for the slaughter tax, 15,434,500 yuan for the banquet tax, 5,427,493 yuan for the entertainment tax, 368,655 yuan for the license tax, 2,291,551 yuan for the hotel tax, and 971,124 yuan for the property tax, totaling 26,903,063 yuan. From September 24, when the Bureau of Finance started collecting taxes, to the end of November, the total tax revenue was 408,987,745 yuan, including 16,447,084 yuan in September, 113,626,274 yuan in October, and 278,806,387 yuan in November. It is estimated that the revenue for December will reach about 500,000,000 yuan, an increase of about 20 times compared to the monthly collection during the puppet regime. Calculating the collection amount by subject in recent months, the average monthly collection is 84,000,000 yuan for the slaughter tax, 100,000,000 yuan for the banquet tax, 74,000,000 yuan for the entertainment tax, 16,000,000 yuan for the license tax, and 25,000,000 yuan for the hotel tax, totaling 299,000,000 yuan. However, the property tax is still being re-evaluated and has not yet been collected, and the deed tax surcharge is also not included. In the near future, the total tax revenue is expected to increase to 700,000,000 yuan per month. In addition, among the various taxes collected by the central government, the percentage allocated to the municipal government is estimated to be 400,000,000 yuan for the business tax, 150,000,000 yuan for the land tax, 150,000,000 yuan for the stamp tax, 50,000,000 yuan for the inheritance tax, and 50,000,000 yuan for the property rental and sales income tax, totaling 800,000,000 yuan. Adding this to the local tax revenue, the total monthly tax revenue is 1,500,000,000 yuan.

Regarding the business tax, the city can collect about 800,000,000 yuan per month, which is collected by the central government, and the city can get 50% of it. In practice, the municipal government believes that it would be better if the tax revenue was directly collected by the city, because the local government is more familiar with the local situation and can easily collect taxes. Moreover, the tax can be collected by the city's tax collection office without setting up a separate agency, which can save expenses and may reach 1,000,000,000 yuan, exceeding the estimated number by 200,000,000 yuan. Then the city's administrative construction costs will be guaranteed, and there is no need for the central government to allocate other taxes, or even the surplus business tax of 200,000,000 yuan can be allocated to the central government.

As for the payment items, from the date of establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government on September 12 of this year to the end of November, the total payments were 56,870,000 yuan in September, 1,079,650,000 yuan in October, and 1,378,430,000 yuan in November, totaling 2,414,950,000 yuan. Among them, excluding the start-up costs of 360,000,000 yuan and the police uniform costs of 1,495,000,000 yuan, the actual administrative expenses were 559,950,000 yuan.

Property and land donations were originally a stable source of revenue for the city, but currently, the city's rents are being re-evaluated and have not yet begun to be collected. According to the previous records, the total property and land donation income in the Shanghai city area in the 24th year of the Republic of China was 2,760,000 yuan, the total property and land donation income in the former French Concession in the 24th year of the Republic of China was 5,810,000 yuan, and the total property and land donation income in the former Public Concession in the 26th year of the Republic of China was 16,320,000 yuan. The total property and land donation income of the three old districts of Shanghai was 24,890,000 yuan. If calculated at 60 times, the current annual property and land donation income should be 1,000,000,000 yuan, and the average monthly property and land donation income should be 130,000,000 yuan.

As for the major implementations of the Bureau of Finance in the past three months, they are (1) defining the tax system, striving for standardization and unity, and starting anew with the people; (2) adjusting the collection agency, striving to save manpower and material resources; (3) simplifying collection procedures, eliminating embezzlement, and avoiding harassment; (4) implementing a public treasury system, starting from November 10, all tax and administrative fee revenues of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its affiliated agencies are directly collected and deposited into the treasury by city bank personnel stationed in each collection agency, and each collection agency is only responsible for collection.

In addition, a Municipal Public Property Management Committee, a Municipal Rent and Land Estimation Committee, and a Tax Review Committee have been established.

The Bureau of Finance received a list of more than 1,600 staff members from the puppet regime's bureau, which has been repeatedly reduced. Currently, there are only more than 300 people to save costs and increase efficiency. In order to prevent corruption, the bureau has also set up a secret report box to allow people to file complaints.

Director Pu Zhengdong, courtesy name Xinya, is from Wuxi, Jiangsu. He is 55 years old and has served in financial administration, as a news reporter, a university professor, a member of the Hankou City and Chongqing City Provisional Councils, the chairman of the Hankou Banking Association, the director of the loan department of the Four Joint Offices, the manager of the major controlled banks of the Bank of Communications in Shanghai, Hankou, Harbin, and Chongqing, and the general manager of the Chongqing Electric Power Company. He is currently the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, the chairman of the Shanghai City Bank, and a director or executive director of the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, the Hubei Bank, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, the Minsheng Company, the Chongqing Electric Power Company, and the Pacific Insurance Company.

Bureau of Social Affairs

Acting Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Ge Kexin

Among the various bureaus under the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Social Affairs has a relatively wide range of policy objects. Whether in politics, economy, society, or culture, anything that promotes social harmony and progress is included.

Shanghai, after eight years of war, has had all its social organizations destroyed. Before the war, the production, transportation, distribution, and consumption processes of our national economy were organically linked, but now they are disconnected. The systematic social organizations of the past no longer exist. The consistent cultural traditions of the past are now confused. In the past, the city's houses were in excess, but now they are not enough. Therefore, social disputes are inevitable. The problem is not the number of disputes but how to reasonably adjust them to normalize them. Only when prices are stable and production is restored is it possible to reduce labor disputes. Only by reorganizing social organizations so that various groups can assist the restoration of the entire society under the leadership of the government can we talk about reform.

Today, the situation in Shanghai makes the tasks of the Bureau of Social Affairs so arduous. To rebuild what was destroyed by the enemy and puppets in the past eight years, to sort out the damages of the past eight years, to restore the connections between various sectors of society, and to maintain the harmony of all classes is like sorting out a pile of messy hair. It requires the patience and courage of the supervisors and staff, as well as careful and reasonable handling, to get it back on track from a broken and disjointed situation.

At the beginning of the restoration, the central government specially selected Wu Shaoshu and Ge Kexin to serve as the director and deputy director of the bureau. In a sick society full of thousands of details and ravaged sights, they carefully followed the established national policy and the instructions of the chairman, distinguishing between urgency and importance, and planning and reorganizing everything from scratch. So far, although it is still far from our ideals, the foundation for future work has been laid in this extremely short period of time, which cannot be ignored. After Wu resigned from his concurrent post as director due to heavy official duties last month, Deputy Director Ge is now temporarily acting as director. Ge is 41 years old, from Jiangsu, and a law student at Shanghai University. He has served as the secretary of the Political Department of the 33rd Army of the National Revolutionary Army, the chief secretary of the Hankou City Party Department, a member of the Hankou Municipal Government Council, a chief commentator of the Wuhan Daily, a specialist member of the Central Propaganda Department, a major general councilor of the Third War Zone Commander-in-Chief's Office, and an executive committee member and secretary-general of the Shanghai City Party Department.

Ge told reporters in a very amiable manner: "The policies of this bureau in the past three months have been obviously slow due to financial difficulties, limited manpower, and various other unavoidable obstacles. They are mostly of a transitional nature. The main ones can be divided into two aspects: (1) restoration and reorganization, (2) social stability."

Regarding the restoration and reorganization work, in addition to reorganizing and re-registering various old agricultural, industrial, commercial, social, cultural, and even charitable organizations, various regulations are being drafted to facilitate the establishment of groups or the progress of work. At the same time, in order to ensure that society quickly moves towards stability, various social works have been carried out, such as the mediation of labor disputes. This work is handled in accordance with the wage adjustment measures in the recovered areas. The determination of wages is based on the cost of living index. Therefore, labor disputes are resolved in the mediation stage, and no case needs to be resolved through arbitration. For example, the price control work and the organization of the evaluation committee aim to eliminate price fluctuations and assist various industry groups in procurement, so that production can be restored as soon as possible and people's livelihoods can be slightly improved. On the other hand, welfare undertakings are carried out, such as job registration, improvement of labor welfare undertakings, accommodation of refugees and orphans, restoration of public pawns, organization of civilian villages, and establishment of cooperative societies for municipal employees.

Then Ge told reporters about the planned work plan for the future. He said: "In addition to continuing to complete the unfinished work, we also plan to handle some newly created work." He casually flipped out a plan and handed it to reporters. It is divided into four categories: economic administration, social organization, labor administration, and social welfare. The following is an appendix:

Economic Administration

1. Continued items—(1) Registration, investigation, and statistics of factories and handicrafts, (2) Registration of commercial companies and accountants, (3) Investigation of the city's situation, (4) Assisting the evaluation committee in managing prices, (5) Registration of private agricultural fields, (6) Reorganizing markets for vegetables, meat, and other items, (7) Investigating the supply and marketing of civilian food, (8) Guiding farmers and workers in establishing cooperative societies.

Finally, Ge also hoped that the press would provide more impetus and guidance in terms of public opinion, and also hoped that the citizens would give approval and assistance. Because the work of the Bureau of Social Affairs is too closely related to the lives of citizens, it is absolutely impossible to act alone without the interests of the people. Therefore, the criticism and cooperation of citizens is necessary and urgent.

Bureau of Public Works

Director of the Bureau of Public Works, Zhao Huijue

The so-called public utility undertakings are generally nothing more than land and water transportation, water, electricity, and gas. The prosperity of a modern city is closely related to the development of public utility undertakings. At the beginning of the city's restoration, the assets of various public utility undertakings were confused, the equipment was damaged, the supply of water and electricity was on the verge of collapse, and the means of transportation were scarce. Trams and buses were all overcrowded, and it was as difficult to take a ride as it was to climb to the sky. Special class vehicles did not have license plates, and water navigation was also mostly suspended. At night, the street lights were dim. All kinds of declining phenomena cannot be described in words. The Bureau of Public Works took the lead in organizing a committee to carry out the reception and rectification. Except for the China Water and Electricity Company, which was received by the Ministry of Economy, the remaining public utility undertakings were received by the committee, together with the original operators of each company. In terms of transportation, such as trams, buses, and ferries, after receiving them, they were handed over to the original operators before the war to continue operating. However, the authorities discussed and agreed on three principles: (1) the undertaking must not be interrupted in the slightest, (2) all assets should be carefully checked and listed, and no omission should be allowed. If there are any losses, compensation should be claimed from the enemy according to law. The assets newly added by the enemy should be received by the municipal government, (3) all staff of public utility undertakings, regardless of nationality, should enjoy the same treatment as their counterparts in terms of salary and must not be discriminated against. During this transition period, the city's public utility undertakings were able to avoid interruption. The most difficult thing was the serious coal shortage. The authorities invited well-known people in the coal and shipping industries to organize the Shanghai Temporary Fuel Supervision Committee to take over the Japanese Coal Federation and its affiliated coal mines and to control the distribution. They gave priority to supplying public utility undertakings, restricted coal consumption, and dredged sources. After two months of efforts, public utility undertakings were fortunately spared from interruption. This was the most difficult period. Later, the Shanghai Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economy was established, and there was a dedicated agency for the matter, so it came to an end. Another issue was adjusting prices. The various public utility undertakings were affected by price fluctuations, and the difference between revenue and expenditure was too large, so prices had to be adjusted. The adjustment principles can be summarized into three items: (1) Strive for the unity of prices in the city and eliminate the unreasonable phenomenon of zoning pricing before the war, (2) On the one hand, consider the lightest burden on citizens, and on the other hand, consider the minimum cost of each undertaking, (3) Pay attention to the interests of small users and the needs of large industrial users.

In the past three months, the various public utility undertakings have been guided and reorganized by the Bureau of Public Works, and it seems that there is still progress. The more obvious ones are that the city's water and electricity consumption is currently unrestricted; the most important industrial electricity consumption has also been restored in part, and the gas is temporarily maintained. However, the Wusong Gas Plant is also actively preparing to start work, which can expand the supply range. In terms of land transportation, the tram has restored four lines and added two lines. The ring road in the Nanshi district of the bus has been opened to traffic on December 10, and other lines in the old city area are also planned to be restored in the short term. In terms of water transportation, the Pujiang ferry line has been expanded from two lines during the war to six lines. There were 35 private ferries before the war, and 26 have been restored. Others, such as the street lights in the old city area, have been increased to 3550, and the connection rate of telephones has increased from 65% to 72%. The coal used for power generation has been reduced from 3.8 pounds per degree to 3 pounds recently. All of these, based on current observations, are progressive phenomena. However, if Shanghai is to become a modern city, these achievements are not worth mentioning, and there are many more things to be developed and improved.

To understand the future plans of the Bureau of Public Works, the reporter specifically visited Director Zhao Huijue. Director Zhao is a native of the city and is 45 years old this year. He has a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Jiaotong University and a master's degree in electrical engineering from Harvard University in the United States. He has practiced in Britain and Germany for many years. After returning to China, he served as an associate professor and head of the department at Zhejiang University. Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau and Chief Engineer. Director of the Zhejiang Electric Power Plant. Director of the Zhejiang Industrial Improvement Institute. Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications for Electricity Administration in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi. Specialist member of the Resources Committee. Director and Counselor of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications. Member of the Central Design Bureau. Director Zhao is tall and has thick eyebrows and big eyes, which makes people feel awe. However, when talking to him, he is amiable and approachable. Therefore, his subordinates said, "We are afraid of him and love him."

Director Zhao said that Shanghai's electrical future has yet to be developed. According to statistics, the average monthly electricity consumption per person in London is 180 degrees, while Shanghai currently has only four degrees. In the future, Shanghai's total power supply may require a capacity of one million kilowatts. In terms of telephones, Shanghai currently has an average of one telephone for every 90 people, while New York has one telephone for every four people. Therefore, it is hoped that all automatic telephones with six numbers will be adopted as soon as possible. The central government is planning to form a national electrical and telephone network, and the city will assist in promoting the early realization of this plan. Tap water and gas are the most convenient, hygienic, and clean water and fuel in the city and should be promoted for use. This undertaking is purely local in nature, and the city should promote its joint management and development as much as possible. The exclusive labor contract of the British Shanghai Water Company will expire in 1947, and the French Shanghai Water Company will expire in 1950. It should be carefully decided whether the municipal government will handle it completely by itself or whether international joint investment will be made at that time. In terms of transportation, the city's original transportation lines are not only insufficient, but also have a bias towards east-west traffic, while north-south lines are very lacking. In order to promote urban development, it is necessary to form a Sino-foreign joint venture transportation company. The company will operate trams, buses, and ferries in a combined manner. The number of Pujiang ferries should be increased as soon as possible, so that the Pudong area will also have great hope for development. The above may be implemented one by one in the near future. I hope that the four million citizens will do their best to make Shanghai a perfect modern city. (Continued on page 3)

Bureau of Education

Director of the Bureau of Education, Gu Yuxiu

Chairman Jiang once announced to the whole country: "Military affairs should be the first during the war, and education should be the first after the war." Indeed, it takes ten years to cultivate people and a hundred years to cultivate trees. The rise and fall of education is related to the future of the entire nation. Shanghai has a dense population and is a cultural center. The government attaches special importance to it and appointed Gu Yuxiu as the director of the Municipal Bureau of Education. Gu once served as the permanent vice minister of the Ministry of Education, the president of the Central University, and has the demeanor of a scholar, simple and solemn. After taking office, he actively reorganized municipal private middle and primary schools, improved the treatment of teachers and staff, enriched library instruments and equipment, and has a complete plan for the future improvement of education in the city. The following is a detailed description:

Number of schools: The city currently has 13 municipal middle schools, 109 primary schools, 2 attached kindergartens, 226 private middle schools, 594 primary schools, 185 attached kindergartens, 3 Western schools, and 2 municipal Xinlu normal schools and vocational schools. In total, there are 1,154 schools. Given the large population of Shanghai, this number is obviously insufficient, especially primary schools.

Number of students: Municipal middle schools: 5,067 students, private middle schools 53,547 students, totaling 58,614 students, municipal primary schools 35,413 students, private primary schools 133,396 students totaling 168,809 students, municipal kindergartens 1,454 students, private kindergartens 7,220 students, totaling 8,674 students, Western middle schools 3 schools and attached primary schools 2 schools kindergartens 3 schools total students 693 people Xinlu Normal 206 people Above the total number of students reached 236,996 people, accounting for about 5% of the city's population. In other words, only one in twenty Shanghai citizens is receiving primary and secondary education. If calculated on the basis of one student per family, this number should be at least doubled, that is, the number of students should be about 15% of the total population of the city to be reasonable. There is no doubt that there are twice as many school-age children who are out of school. What is the impact of this on the future of the country and society?

In addition, the number of municipal schools is obviously insufficient, which makes students have to go to private schools with poorer facilities. In particular, there are only 13 municipal middle schools, while there are 226 private middle schools, which is a ratio of about 17 to 1. The ratio of students is 10 to 1. The Education Bureau is limited by funds and feels that it is difficult to maintain the existing schools, and it will inevitably be unable to create new schools. Excellent and poor students are waiting to be fed. If there is no subsidy such as scholarships, the number of students out of school will inevitably increase.

The treatment of teachers and staff in municipal primary and secondary schools was unspeakable during the puppet government era. It has now been gradually adjusted to the same treatment as civil servants, that is, calculated at 80 times the base salary plus a living allowance of 28,000 yuan. The salary standard is up to 520 yuan (president of the specialty school) and a minimum of 60 yuan (primary school staff). Assuming that an ordinary middle school teacher is paid 250 yuan, he can get a salary of 20,000 yuan and an allowance of 28,000 yuan. An ordinary primary school teacher with a base salary of 200 yuan can get a salary of 16,000 yuan and an allowance of 28,000 yuan. The salary standard for teachers and staff in people's schools is the same as that of primary schools. As mentioned above, teachers with simple families are able to make ends meet.

The Municipal Education Bureau is now divided into sixteen education districts throughout the city, which separately supervise education matters. Special attention is paid to the average distribution of schools in the region to avoid being too sparse or too dense in order to reduce the labor of students' trekking. It is also training principals of national schools and holding workshops for primary school teachers so that they can all be competent and happy. It is setting up academic lectures to facilitate the public's further education. It is setting up a municipal science experiment institute in Yucai Middle School so that students from schools with incomplete equipment can go to the experiment in shifts. There will be great help in academic studies. Physical education is also quite emphasized. It currently manages the city center sports field, Ximen Sports Field, and the City Gymnasium, and initiates various competitions at any time to enhance the physique of citizens.

In terms of bureau affairs management, there are: 1. The Secondary Education Office is responsible for the administration of municipal private middle schools, 2. The National Education Office is responsible for the affairs of municipal private primary schools. In the future, it may be planned to implement compulsory education, 3. The Vocational Education Office manages various vocational schools and tutoring schools, and has established one Shanghai Municipal College and one Shanghai Municipal Tutoring School, 4. The main work of the Social Education Office is to promote literacy campaigns and handle libraries, museums, sports fields, lecture halls, and other affairs. Now, it has set up three centers for music, work, and fine arts to actively promote social education, 5. The Inspectorate inspects and supervises the facilities of various schools in the city in order to improve them in the future.

Director Gu pays close attention to the further education of the internal staff of the bureau. He initiated the organization of the Municipal Education Bureau Colleagues' Further Education Association. Director Gu himself serves as the chairman. The internal departments are temporarily set up: (1) Reading Club, (2) Research Association. (3) Lecture Hall, colleagues from various departments can freely participate in the group meetings so that they have a full understanding and cultivation of the education system and other knowledge, so as to increase administrative efficiency. If the colleagues believe that the research results have important educational value, the bureau will award bonuses to encourage them. This approach can be followed by various places and agencies, which will definitely benefit the bureau's administration.

Finally, we hope that various undesirable situations in the city's education sector must be corrected. The existence of middle and primary schools in the alleys is a shame to the national education sector. In the future, after the city schools are widely established, private schools, except for those with outstanding reputation and excellent facilities, will inevitably be eliminated. However, at present, there is no doubt that this type of school still occupies the vast majority, and the quality of the students it cultivates is low and undeniable. The authorities should first conduct a thorough investigation, and those that are too simple should be ordered to stop running. Those that can be done should be strictly ordered to improve. The need to improve the quality of students should not be ignored at present. Since the occupation of the enemy and puppets, the quality of middle school students

### New Year's Message

— Tang Enbo

The New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic of China is a glory emerging from suffering, it is gained from mortal combat, and it is so worthy of our joyful and encouraging commemoration and celebration. However, how to uphold the glory of victory and ensure the fruits of peace, this is the main topic of the 35th year of the Republic of China. At the beginning of the year, we must consider it cautiously, with the spirit of learning from past pain, and with a self-improving attitude, to lay the first cornerstone of national construction.

I believe that the prerequisite for national construction lies in the unity of the country, in that there is no room for division or rupture in government orders and military orders. This is how the Chinese people see it, and this is how the international community sees it. The ancient Chinese saying, "Concentrate your spirit and unify your actions," clearly reveals this universal principle. Chairman Chiang led us to establish the clear banner of the National Revolution from the military rule, and also fought for a bright future of freedom and peace from the ravages of powerful and brutal enemies. He himself stands on the responsibility of national salvation, representing the interests of the entire nation and people, and the people of the whole country also stand on the responsibility of national salvation, representing the interests of the entire nation and themselves. With consistent goals and consistent positions, this is how a great force is formed. It has a center of gravity and a direction, and it will never be shaken or damaged by the interests of a certain part or the personal desires of a certain individual. That is to say, under the mighty torrent of national resistance against Japan and unified national construction, no reactionary force can stop it. However, I hope that the people of the country will recall history for a moment. Who gave us the bloody stains of separatism and the people's suffering in history? -- Enemies and bandits. At the same time, we must also understand the reality. Who gave us the victorious glory of freedom, peace, joy, and happiness in reality? -- The leader and the nation. In this comparison, supporting a unified country and supporting a wise leader is as essential as our life and breath, and we must not leave it for a moment, and we must not be separated from it for a moment. At the beginning of the thirty-fifth year, I hope that the people of the country will first have this understanding and establish this proposition. We must unite our country under the wise leadership this year. Whoever opposes it, whoever destroys it, is our common enemy.

Secondly, the purpose of national construction lies in the stability of people's livelihoods. We should enable our compatriots in the occupied areas, who have been displaced and suffered without recourse for eight years, to find peace as soon as possible. However, we know that under the rule of the enemy, the burning, killing, raping, and looting of soldiers, the deception and fraud of bandits, and even the unscrupulous wealthy gentry, officials, and corrupt troops, are all plundering the people. Who can bear to hear about this dark and inhuman situation without shedding tears, and who can bear to see it without feeling sorrow? We have won, and the enemy's brutality will naturally no longer exist, but we must clear away the internal crises. I expressed my determination to stabilize public order and proposed the idea of ​​abolishing harsh taxes at the Jiangnan Public Security Conference. I will spare no effort to remove obstacles that endanger public order and harm people's livelihoods. However, the military aspect is only a tangible force. As the saying goes, "Wildfires cannot burn it out, and the spring breeze blows it back to life." For the effort to eradicate it, I hope that comrades in the Party and government, local leaders, and all the people will work together to complete this task. We can say that there is a stable people's livelihood only with a unified situation, and it can also be said that unity has a stronger foundation only with a stable people's livelihood. Therefore, I think that in the thirty-fifth year, we must devote ourselves to this. Whoever opposes it, whoever destroys it, is our common enemy.

The government is the public servant of the people, and the army is the armed force of the people. In the first year of victory, we are all determined to make this selfless and lofty plan. But we believe that this is indeed the foundation of national construction, and we must lay an unshakable foundation when laying the foundation.

I respectfully present my feelings as a New Year's message.

### How to Revive the Textile Industry

— Pan Shihao

I. Should we focus on state-owned enterprises or emphasize both state-owned and private enterprises?

The textile industry is an important pillar of the light industry, which enriches the world. Before the war, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan relied on it to support their national power and developed it into a major export trade. After the war, the industry lost its normal track, but except for Japan, the advanced countries in the United Kingdom and the United States will be able to revitalize this industry to promote and enhance it, and it will continue to become the center of national power, which is beyond doubt. China has always been an industrially backward country, and the only thing that can be said to be commendable in the light industry is textiles. The government has recently divided the country into several cotton textile industrial zones to promote this matter. The attention to the cotton textile industry in these areas does not need our urging.

However, what should be noted first is whether the future cotton textile industry will focus on state-owned enterprises or private enterprises? In other words, will the government or the private sector be responsible for this important task of light industry? Before the war, this industry was not included in the list of state-owned enterprises, and general commentators only classified it as foreign merchants and Chinese merchants. After the war, British and American manufacturers were severely damaged. When victory came, the enemy and puppet factories were taken over and operated by the government. Then the state-owned part began to rise sharply. The government also established the China Textile Construction Corporation to manage it. In addition to the assets of the enemy and puppet textiles received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for valuation, its capital was also increased by 1 billion national currency. The head office was set up in Shanghai, and branch offices, offices and factories may be set up in China and abroad when necessary. Its business scope is

A. Manufacture and dyeing of textiles,

B. Purchase and sale of textile and dyeing raw materials and finished products,

C. Manufacture and purchase and sale of textile and dyeing machines and parts,

D. Operation of businesses related to the first three items,

E. Investment in other businesses related to textile dyeing and finishing.

In terms of scale, it cannot be said to be small, but according to statistics, Shanghai, the center of my country's textile industry in terms of remittances, has equipment that can be listed as follows:

Spindles (pieces)　Thread spindles (pieces)　Looms (units)

Received factories　963,492　234,020　16,974

Private factories　1,636,788　109,982　30,441

Then the production capacity of private enterprises seems to be above that of state-owned enterprises. According to the spindles already in operation:

State-owned　193,285 pieces

Private　1,174,942 pieces

The number of looms already in operation is:

State-owned　3,871 units

Private　9,117 units

II. How should private manufacturers recover?

From the previous statement, the future textile industry should focus on private enterprises. However, how will private entrepreneurs prepare to undertake this important task? The improvement of technology, the renewal of equipment, and the appropriate management, for my own part, I am really unwilling to repeat old platitudes. However, the truth that contains the unchanging principles of the ages lies within the old platitudes, so how to earnestly promote and enhance this truth cannot be ignored.

Moreover, today's world transportation is becoming more and more convenient, and international relations are becoming closer and closer. It seems that tariff barriers, exchange restrictions, and artificial controls on imports and exports cannot be easily achieved. You can see this clearly from the International Monetary Agreement initiated by the United States. Therefore, how the textile industry will become the center of the production industry, and then become a tool for international trade, entrepreneurs should deeply reflect on themselves, have an awareness, focus on the international market, and adjust the steps of the industry, which are all urgent tasks. If they still take making a fortune for a company or a factory as the basis, and simply wait for the government to allocate enemy and puppet factories as a shortcut, then China's textile industry will never be able to rise.

However, from the perspective of the private sector, we should strive to make progress, and think for the government. If there is anything that can promote it, we should not be stingy and do it. Here, we have to solemnly raise a question, that is, we should urgently rescue the losses of forced purchase of yarn and cloth by the enemy and puppet regimes in order to restore its vitality. The assets of the cotton textile industry are: fixed assets, such as machinery and factory buildings, and current assets, such as raw materials and manufactured products. It relies on raw materials to operate. However, if you go to various cotton textile factories for an inspection, the raw materials and manufactured products they store are less than one-tenth of what they were before the war. Although they are now working hard to start work, the lack of raw materials and the shortage of manufactured products on the market are tragic. When asked, they said that the forced purchase of yarn and cloth by the enemy and puppet regimes in August of the 32nd year of the Republic of China had destroyed more than half of the vitality of the textile industry.

The deep foundation of the private textile industry and its efforts to start work should be valued by us. The development of the textile industry in advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States has always been admired by our people, but we have never heard of it being supported by state-owned enterprises. According to the first phase of economic construction principles set by the Supreme National Defense Council, the operation of my country's economic construction industry must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to implement planned implementation, to develop a planned free economy, and gradually achieve the completion of the Three People's Principles economic system. As for the method of operation, private enterprises should be encouraged as much as possible. It has also been clearly stipulated that except for post offices, telecommunications, arsenals, mints, major railways, and large-scale hydropower plants, only those industries that private forces cannot overcome or that the government considers to be particularly important, such as large-scale oil fields, copper and iron plants, and aviation industries, may be operated by the government alone or jointly with private or foreign capital. Then the textile industry was not originally in the state-owned plan. Was the state-owned China Textile Construction Corporation a transition after the receipt of the enemy and puppet textile factories? According to the company's articles of association, it is stipulated that:

[The company's business term is limited to two years, and it may be extended for one year at a time if necessary]

It is clear that the government does not intend to permanently support my country's textile industry from a state-owned perspective. How can we not rejoice? Fortunately, we won the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. National economy and people's livelihood, hard work. Now is the time for the whole country to renovate and promote, and for officials and people to help each other. For all things that the private sector can reach and the public opinion wants, the government should stand in a fair position to promote its development. It is the government's fault to compete with the people for profit, and it is also something that should be done when there are many things waiting to be managed. It is hoped that the above-mentioned "transitional" period can be shortened as much as possible, and its production mechanism can be distributed to private enterprises in batches, so as to avoid the inconvenience of the co-existence of state-owned and private enterprises. Then can the focus of the textile industry be stabilized?

Anyone who pays attention to the government's actions at the time will not forget the scene of the forced purchase of yarn and cloth on August 9 of the 32nd year. At that time, the deadline was set from August 23 to September 6, and a total of 7,887 application forms were received, and the following were collected:

Cotton yarn 92,081 pieces 895 small packages 1,170 cones 224 pieces

White cloth 1,191,748.8 pieces 1,127,671.59 yards 164 sections 2,112.50 yards 1,000 kg

Processed cloth 4,856,447.74 pieces 6,651,423.97 yards 29,830 sections 120,267.25 yards 5,551.50 kg

In total, it should be 92,103 pieces of yarn and 6,440,880 pieces of cloth. This huge number is all the result of years of hard work by the textile industry and cotton cloth industry in Shanghai. At that time, it was swept away, and the blood and tears of the people are intertwined, and we can easily imagine the magnitude of the damage.

The puppet Chamber of Commerce also tried its best to preserve this yarn and cloth. As of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy and puppet regime surrendered, and the government sent personnel to take over. It was reported that there were still more than 10,000 pieces of yarn and more than 3 million pieces of cloth in stock. This was a commodity that the puppet government forcibly seized from private enterprises through illegal means. In terms of reason, it should still be ascertained the actual number and distributed in proportion to the total loss, so that the vitality of the textile industry can be slightly restored. This is the government's first easy task, without any loss to the national treasury, and entrepreneurs will benefit from it, how is this compared to those who stop factories and stop business waiting for aid from the Allied countries?

If the damage caused by the purchase of yarn and cloth can be compensated in a short period of time, then the vitality will be slightly restored and the foothold will be stable. The government in power will then provide industrial loans and allocate enemy and puppet dyes to help them. Those in the private sector who are rich in entrepreneurial responsibilities will save on use, improve products to revitalize them, and the private textile industry may not be able to recover.

III. How should state-owned and private enterprises work together?

Although state-owned enterprises are a transition, how should they work together with private enterprises during this transition period? This is also a question worthy of discussion. In terms of the current situation, state-owned and private enterprises should first work together in terms of equipment and technology. The state-owned factories received from the enemy and puppet regimes, such as Neiwai, Toyota, Rihua, Tongxing, Dakang, and Shanghai factories in Shanghai, have mostly good equipment. Before the war, about three-quarters of the grey cloth from private dyeing and finishing factories was purchased from them. Now that they have been taken over by the state, the scope of operation is not wide, and the equipment of private factories that have suffered war losses is incomplete. It is appropriate to contact each other, or lease a portion of the idle machinery to private enterprises, so that the useless can be turned into useful, which will not harm the state-owned factories, but will benefit the private factories. As for the technical personnel, they originally came from private factories. Now, due to the lack of manpower in state-owned factories, they have to retain a part of the enemies. How can this be sustained for a long time? Private factories should provide assistance and allow them to be transferred, so that everyone can make the best of their talents and the production industry can be promoted as a whole. Then, when state-owned factories are transferred to private ownership in the future, the people of the country will be able to handle it with ease and each will get what they deserve. Secondly, how state-owned factories will sell their manufactured products in the future should also cooperate with private manufacturers. The types of products should avoid conflicts with private factories as much as possible. In other words, state-owned factories should produce less of what private factories can generally produce, and private industrial and commercial enterprises should also provide assistance to them. If the business becomes related and the products do not infringe, the effectiveness of the arms and fingers will be achieved, and the entire textile industry will be on the right track. Recently, private factories have mostly been in a state of panic, thinking that although state-owned factories have been idle for many days, they have not yet started selling. If the price is too low when they sell in the future, private factories will not be able to withstand the pressure. Although this seems to be private factories overemphasizing their own interests, the raw materials of state-owned factories come from the materials received from the enemy and puppet regimes, or are borrowed from Allied countries. The cost can be suppressed to a very low level, which is something that the well-run private factories can do.

Furthermore, in terms of raw materials, state-owned factories are now superior to private factories. It goes without saying that the original accumulation of dyes and yarn and cloth is in the receiving factories. Even in the import merchants such as De Fu Foreign Firm, the authorities have not clearly announced how much can be distributed to private enterprises. For the sake of the entire textile industry, it should be added to the section, and imported raw materials can be delivered within two or three months. State-owned factories can ask the government to place orders abroad. What is accumulated today will be what is surplus or outdated in the future. If some can be allocated to help private enterprises, then considerable capital can be used to order very few goods for private use. The authorities should pay serious attention to this.

The state-owned factories that have started work have all started work. The authorities should also consider whether the ones that have not started work must still be occupied by the state-owned enterprises. There are now more than 40 small enemy factories, and valuation and bidding are underway. Among them, except for a few factories, most of them are small in scale and not enough for expansion. However, there have been many private entrepreneurs who intend to apply for purchase. From this, it can be seen how urgent the demand for factories that can be used for production is in the private sector. Therefore, state-owned factories should select some that will not start work immediately and lease some to private enterprises. If we are thinking about the entire textile industry, we should not consider this part to be superfluous.

### How to Determine the Exchange Rate

— Liu Dajun

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone had a lot of discussions about the foreign exchange rate, and the focus of the discussion was on the level of the new exchange rate and the date of the revision. During the war, although some people discussed this issue, because there were very few normal foreign exchange transactions at that time, they did not feel an urgent need to revise the exchange rate. The people who discussed it were just planning ahead. Now that international transportation is gradually恢复, China will soon rebuild international trade relations, so the past official foreign exchange price cannot continue to be maintained and must be changed, which is the general consensus. The government has also made a positive statement on this matter, so the reason why the revision has not yet been implemented is that the level of the new exchange rate is still difficult to determine for a while.

Some people think that the timing of the revision is very important, because the current domestic economic situation is still in turmoil, and it is impossible to find an appropriate standard for revision. Furthermore, it can also be said that since the economy has not yet stabilized, even if a new exchange rate is set, it will not last long and will still need to be adjusted continuously. Those who make this statement believe that it is better to let it go for the time being rather than revising it repeatedly. After the domestic economy gradually stabilizes at an appropriate time, the new exchange rate will be set again, so that it can be achieved once and for all. However, a country's domestic economy cannot be separated from its international economic relations. When international economic relations are gradually recovering, the domestic economic situation cannot be stabilized, and the foreign exchange rate itself directly affects the former and indirectly affects the latter. If the government still maintains the original official price, continues the method of settlement, controls a part of the export foreign exchange, and strictly reviews the applications of import merchants and others who need foreign exchange, then my country's international economic relations will still be abnormal. Even if the domestic economy is stable, the situation will definitely not last. Everyone knows that such a wartime foreign exchange policy is a short-term measure, which is enough to cause instability. What's more, the market exchange rate is bound to fluctuate widely under this premise, and it will become a factor that causes general economic fluctuations. I think it is impossible to hope that the domestic economy will stabilize within half a year or a year, or even two or three years. What we can only hope is to reduce the amplitude of economic fluctuations. Therefore, before the end of the war, I had already explained based on this view that the exchange rate must still go through several adjustments after the revision.

Conversely, if a reasonable method is used to adjust the exchange rate, although it cannot stabilize the domestic economy, it can at least weaken its dynamism. After the exchange rate is adjusted in this way, domestic prices can gradually approach foreign prices. As the difference between the two prices decreases, the fluctuation of the exchange rate itself can also be weakened. This is originally the argument for setting the exchange rate according to purchasing power parity. Recently, many people think that domestic prices are unstable, and there is still a big difference between the prices in the recovered areas and the rear areas. Even in each recovered area, the prices are not consistent, so they think that the purchasing power parity theory is not suitable for my country at this time. They probably want to wait until domestic prices return to consistency before adjusting the exchange rate. Although this statement seems to have a reason, in fact, it cannot be divided into two periods. The first period is to adjust domestic prices first, and the second period is to adjust domestic prices and foreign prices again. Moreover, doing so will not help stabilize my country's economy.

My country lacks transportation tools between various regions, and it will take a long time for goods to circulate smoothly. By then, the prices between various regions will gradually become consistent. The so-called "consistency" does not mean that it can be exactly the same, but the price difference between each region only represents the necessary transfer costs. (This cost is not limited to freight, but includes other "transfer costs", which is the Cost of transfer mentioned by Swedish scholar Professor Ohlin in his book "Interregional and International Trade".)

### Proposal for Establishing a Specialized Engineering Management Agency

— Chen Ruxuan

(This article continues from the first page)

Therefore, many countries in Europe and America have established specialized engineering management agencies, such as the Federal Works Agency and Public Building Administration in the United States, and the Ministry of Works and Buildings, Ministry of Works and Planning, and Minister of Reconstruction in the United Kingdom.

In our country, the titles of officials in charge of public works have varied. In the Qin Dynasty, there was "Jiang Zuo," in the Han Dynasty, there was "Jiang Zuo Da Jiang," and from the Sui and Tang Dynasties to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, there was the "Ministry of Works," all of which had specialized management functions. Since the Republic of China, the construction of public works has been divided among various administrative agencies. For example, the Ministry of Transportation manages projects such as railways, highways, telecommunications, and shipbuilding; the Ministry of Military Affairs manages projects such as barracks and military supply warehouses; the Ministry of Economic Affairs manages projects such as power and industrial and mining plant buildings; the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Water Conservancy Commission manage projects such as farmland irrigation; and the municipal government manages projects such as roads, wharves, and sanitation. This system may be adequate when there is no large-scale engineering construction or when only maintenance is required. However, with the vigorous promotion of national construction and large-scale construction plans about to be launched, the current fragmentation of institutions, the dispersion of talent, the varying needs of all parties, and the differences in opinions will inevitably lead to disputes over priorities. It is truly problematic to expect all engineering projects to be carried out efficiently. Take railways alone. The Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation is responsible for the operation and management of existing lines and also for the repair of damaged old lines and the construction of new lines, which is difficult to handle effectively. Furthermore, the construction of large ports in the East, North, and South is of such a grand scale that it cannot be undertaken by a single municipal government or other administrative agency.

Recalling the early days of the War of Resistance, the construction of airfields was the responsibility of the Aviation Commission, which combined engineering and management. However, after the sudden change in Burma, international channels were cut off, and the need for air transport increased dramatically. The expansion of airfields became urgent. Our national leaders, with foresight, established an Engineering Committee under the Military Affairs Commission to handle this project. Because of its specialized responsibilities, concentrated manpower, flexible command, and rapid deployment, the committee was able to accomplish its tasks, even when the projects were extremely large and the deadlines extremely tight, to meet military needs. This recent example serves as a valuable model for future construction.

Therefore, we believe that, as the nation actively engages in construction, to ensure specialized responsibility and concentrated effort, a specialized engineering management agency should be established under the Executive Yuan to oversee national engineering construction. This will ensure unified management, rapid progress, and the ability to deal with foreign affairs and utilize diplomacy without the confusion and conflicts among various departments.

Since this agency is specifically for engineering management, once a project is completed, it should be transferred to other administrative agencies for management and operation according to its nature. This will allow for division of labor and cooperation between engineering construction and administrative management, maximizing the effectiveness of each.

Furthermore, the scope of this specialized engineering management agency can be broadly divided into three categories:

(1) Projects to be handled directly: All engineering construction projects that do not fall under the jurisdiction of central ministries and local governments, such as the opening of ports (the three major ports in the East, South, and North as instructed by Sun Yat-sen), air bases, national defense fortresses, public buildings, and the training of technical personnel.

(2) Projects to be handled on behalf of others: All engineering construction projects that fall under the jurisdiction of central ministries and local governments, such as the expedited repair of railways and highways, the completion of river channels and dams, the installation of electrical power equipment, and the construction of factories and cities. These can be handled on behalf of the relevant agencies as designated by the central government or entrusted by the agencies themselves. Once the projects are completed, they will be transferred to the relevant administrative agencies for handover.

(3) Projects to be handled jointly: Projects funded by foreign countries or jointly funded by Chinese and foreign parties may be handled by the central government at any time due to technical cooperation or any other special circumstances.

### The Shanghai Municipal Government After the Restoration

— Qian Dajun

(Continued from the "Municipal Government" section on page two)

B. Adjusting the Social Economy

Economic measures are closely related to people's livelihoods and are extremely difficult to manage. Although this city is a commercial and industrial center, it suffered eight years of exploitation and devastation by the enemy and puppets. At the beginning of its restoration, the social economy was weakened and in urgent need of adjustment and development. Therefore, we have done our best to provide assistance.

1. Assessing Prices: An evaluation committee was established. If the prices of various industries needed to be increased, they were required to submit a request to the committee for joint evaluation before being approved. This was intended to achieve regulation and stabilization. Trade associations were also notified to report prices weekly to the Municipal Government for verification and adjustment.

2. Regulating Food Supply: The food supply was overseen by a special commissioner from the Ministry of Food, and the Municipal Government also appointed a special commissioner to supervise the rice industry. The rice market was restored, and all restrictions on rice businesses imposed during the enemy and puppet regime were lifted, restoring free trade and procurement. Measures were also drafted to order the industry to purchase in bulk to ensure supply.

3. Centralized Fuel Control: At the beginning of Shanghai's restoration, there was a severe coal shortage. Emergency measures were taken to establish a Temporary Fuel Supervisory Committee, responsible for taking over the existing coal supply and coordinating its distribution. This ensured that public utilities were not interrupted during the restoration period. Later, when the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs was established, this responsibility was transferred to that committee.

4. Adjusting Public Utility Prices: The city's public utilities had suffered long-term damage and were in urgent need of repair and replenishment. Employee compensation needed to be adjusted, and the soaring prices of needed materials had made it impossible to maintain operations. Therefore, the requests of the various companies were accepted. Based on the principles of protecting the burden on citizens and maintaining the companies' expenses, permission was granted to adjust prices on a trial basis.

C. Undertaking Relief Efforts

The people of this city suffered greatly after the destruction of war and the devastation by the enemy and puppets. The government was deeply concerned, and relief efforts were a top priority.

1. Relief for Unemployed Workers: Since the takeover of enemy and puppet factories inevitably resulted in temporary shutdowns, coupled with rising prices and insufficient power, unemployed workers faced extremely difficult living conditions, and labor unrest occurred from time to time. In the past three months, there have been 729 labor disputes, most of which have been resolved through mediation or persuasion. Regarding relief for unemployed workers, a committee has been actively organized in conjunction with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant agencies. However, this relief is only a passive measure. The fundamental solution is to start from the proactive side, that is, to carry out labor welfare programs to alleviate their living difficulties. This work includes investigating the original labor welfare facilities in various factories, inspecting the health and safety facilities in various factories, promoting labor consumer cooperatives, and organizing labor films, all of which are in the design and implementation phase.

2. Relief for the General Public: The first step was to establish a municipal relief center, which first set up refugee and orphan shelters, accommodating more than 1,000 people. There are plans to expand. The second step was to organize winter relief, establishing a Winter Relief Committee, bringing together leaders from the charitable community to work together. The third step was to establish pawnshops and public housing. The first pawnshop has been opened, and the second will soon be established. Four public housing estates have been reorganized, and there are plans to gradually expand. The preliminary design of the construction of public housing has been completed.

D. Rectifying Citywide Transportation

Transportation is most closely related to the welfare of citizens. The city's transportation was originally very developed, but it has declined since the enemy and puppet occupation. Therefore, after taking over, the Municipal Government had to make every effort to rectify it to avoid affecting the lives of citizens:

1. Roads: In Huangpu District (the former concession area), about 340,000 square meters of road surface urgently needed to be repaired, and the ditches needed to be completely cleared. Moreover, the road systems in various districts of the city were extremely disorganized due to the failure to unify administrative power in the past and had to be completely reorganized and revised. In addition, the narrow main roads and traffic congestion also needed to be gradually widened according to plan. The above items have been largely completed based on the preliminary reorganization plan. As for transportation, in addition to the original ones, there are also plans to restore public buses, first restoring operations in the South Shanghai area, and to reorganize small railways, maintaining two round trips per month on the Upper Chuan and Upper South lines. In addition, most of the street lights in various districts were demolished or reduced in brightness in the past, and many have been actively reorganized and restored. Regarding traffic management, such as checking motor vehicles, renewing car licenses, and reorganizing traffic signs, these are also being implemented one by one according to plan. This year, the change to driving on the right side of the road was made after extensive publicity and thorough preparation.

2. Waterways: In addition to the Huangpu and Wusong rivers being the responsibility of the Dredging Bureau, the small rivers related to water conservancy, farmland, and transportation in the four rural areas were almost completely silted up, and bridges, docks, and seawalls were in disrepair and urgently needed to be dredged and repaired. The repair work has been nearly completed according to the preliminary reorganization plan, and the dredging work has been planned and is ready to begin. Reconnaissance of the seawalls is also in the planning stage. As for transportation, one is to restore several ferry lines, and the other is to reorganize the Huangpu and Wusong rivers ferry service. Twenty-five routes have been approved for resumption. In addition, ship registration work has also been implemented.

E. Transforming Social Mores

The city has always been a breeding ground for corruption due to the concessions. Since the enemy and puppets occupied it, the social atmosphere has deteriorated. If it is not corrected forcefully, the future will be unimaginable. The way to correct it can be divided into two types: passive and active.

1. Passive Aspects: The enemy and puppets aimed to destroy the physical and mental strength of our nation in order to eliminate the freedom and independence of our country. Therefore, they implemented a policy of corruption and poisoning in order to achieve their conspiracy. As a result, opium dens were everywhere in the city, gambling was rampant, and prostitutes were everywhere, and countless people were addicted to them. After the Municipal Government took over, it first had to eliminate these three evils. In addition to strictly banning gambling and rewarding people for reporting it secretly in order to eliminate it, a general inspection method for eliminating opium poison has been formulated to eliminate opium poison in the shortest possible time. The prostitution problem is more complicated, and the methods for suppressing it are being studied.

2. Active Aspects: In order to promote the New Life Movement, a New Life Movement Promotion Association has been established to actively carry out various tasks. At present, the main purpose is to cultivate the citizens' vigorous and enterprising spirit. One of the specific methods is to promote social education and promote legitimate entertainment to replace opium smoking and gambling, and to improve the citizens' physical and mental health. For example, the parks are being reorganized and opened for citizens to play, and the libraries are being replenished and restored for citizens to read. A sports committee and sports association have been established to actively promote various sports, increase sports venues, and convert the original gambling venues into public sports venues to facilitate citizens' exercise. Other museums and zoos have also been assigned personnel to prepare, and they should be gradually restored in the short term. In addition, a music center station will be established, a fine arts center station will be planned, and a labor center station will be established to improve the public's ability to appreciate and create music and art.

F. Promoting Citywide Education

Education is the foundation of a country, and it is most closely related to inheriting the past and opening up the future. The city's education has been affected by the enemy and puppets, and it is very heavy to reorganize and promote it. The following items are especially noteworthy:

1. Receiving Schools at All Levels: There are a large number of municipal and private primary and secondary schools in the city. When the enemy and puppets invaded, they arbitrarily changed the system, which was chaotic. After the Municipal Government took over, it restored and took over them separately and worked hard to reorganize them; those that should be closed were identified and the students were assigned to municipal schools; private schools were registered, investigated, and inspected one by one.

2. Planning to Establish a Scientific Experiment Institute: In order to focus on scientific education and remedy the lack of science equipment in private schools, a scientific experiment institute was planned. Two experimental center stations have been established, instructors have been hired, schedules have been arranged, and students from public and private middle schools have been assigned to practice in rotation to increase teaching effectiveness.

3. National Education: After the Municipal Government was established, it began to prepare for the implementation of national education, formulated an implementation plan, and investigated the population distribution in various districts of the city. Next, it divided the city into sixteen districts and prioritized the establishment of sixteen central national schools, which were given special supervision and guidance.

4. Eliminating Illiteracy: There are many illiterate people in the city, and supplementary education needs to be promoted urgently. At present, illiteracy is being investigated by region, and folk schools are being established. In addition to setting up seventeen classes in the experimental folk schools, twenty-one municipal folk schools are being planned, and municipal primary and secondary schools are ordered to run folk schools concurrently.

G. Promoting Citizens' Health

The importance of health is well known and need not be repeated. There are three important tasks:

1. Cleaning Up the City's Garbage: When the Municipal Government took over, there was garbage piled up in various districts, totaling 111,515 tons. After the restoration, manpower and tools were concentrated to clear it all in nine days and nights. The regular cleaning work has not been relaxed at all, and a Cleanliness Movement Week has been held to awaken the attention and assistance of citizens. Although it is not yet ideal, it has made significant progress compared to the beginning of the takeover and is still continuing to work hard.

2. Establishing Municipal Hospitals: After the medical institutions in the city were reorganized, ten municipal hospitals were officially established with more than 900 beds, which is far from enough. Each hospital has free beds to benefit the poor. There are a total of 486 free beds in the city, accounting for half of the total beds. In the future, hospitals will be added and gradually increased as the first stage of promoting the public medical system.

3. Preventing and Controlling Infectious Diseases: Last September, there was a serious outbreak of true cholera in the city. After emergency measures were taken, the epidemic was slightly curbed. Vaccination work has also been carried out. In addition, there is fly and louse control work, which has been done with the assistance of the Allied health authorities, using DDT special medicine to spray in prisons and airports, and is still continuing.

H. Completing Cadastral Reorganization

During the occupation of the city, the land boundaries were disrupted by the enemy and puppets, and the people's property rights were no longer guaranteed. At the beginning of the Municipal Government's restoration, it was determined that the completion of land registration was one of the important administrative guidelines in order to clear up land rights and stabilize people's livelihoods. The progress is briefly described as follows:

1. Land Surveying: There are three items completed in Huangpu District: household land surveying, organizing maps and registers, adding fish scale registers, and handling accumulated survey cases.

2. Land Registration: One is to carry out ownership and transfer registration, which will be opened in the six districts where land surveying has been completed, and those who apply for registration are enthusiastic. The second is to handle land transfer, that is, in areas where land registration has not yet been opened, those who have transferred land rights will be handled according to law, and at the same time, according to the central government's order, the deed tax will be reorganized. The third is to handle perpetual lease land. Except for perpetual lease land held by foreigners, which will continue to be retained before the method of exchanging new land ownership certificates is stipulated, according to the order of the Executive Yuan, Chinese people who hold perpetual lease land should apply for ownership registration. The fourth is to clear up the land rights registration made by the puppet regime, which are invalid. Another land registration will be carried out to protect the legal property rights of Chinese people and foreign businessmen.

3. Land Valuation: In the districts where land registration is being carried out, the land prices will be divided into groups to observe and determine the land price segments, and maps and charts will be drawn. This work is in progress. However, in order to control the declared land prices of people's land registration, the valuation table of 1941 is temporarily used, and the current situation is taken into account to increase it by 200 times as a temporary standard for reviewing declared prices.

I. Promoting Local Autonomy

The central government has decided to implement constitutional government as soon as possible, and the foundation of constitutional government lies in local autonomy. Therefore, this work is imminent. However, this city is the cultural and economic center of the country, and the people's level of knowledge is also the crown of all regions. It is easier to promote local autonomy than in other regions. In order to achieve this task, the current facilities of the Municipal Government are as follows:

1. Organizing the Baojia System: The city's handling of the Baojia system is a pioneering initiative. Therefore, it is decided to adopt a top-down approach, that is, from the city to the districts, and from the districts to the bao. When the district offices and the bao offices are established, various bao compilation and household checking tasks will be started. After the compilation and checking are completed, people's representative bodies at all levels will be established according to law. At present, the district offices have been established, and the candidates for district heads have been announced. They will be able to start working officially in the short term, and the household checking work can also begin.

2. Planning to Establish People's Representative Bodies at All Levels: People's representative bodies at all levels in the city will be gradually established after the Baojia system is compiled. It is expected that citizen publicity and the review of candidates for public office will begin in January of this year, the bao people's congress will be opened in February, the district people's congress will be established in March, and the municipal council will be established in April. Before the municipal council is established, a temporary municipal council will be established first. The list of candidates has been submitted to the central government for approval, and the establishment meeting will be convened as soon as it is announced.

In addition, the organization of the Advisory Committee can be mentioned. Municipal facilities should be widely consulted, gather ideas, and benefit from each other. However, the number of municipal councillors is limited by laws and regulations. In order to meet the needs, the Advisory Committee is organized. Its candidates are not limited to nationalities, so foreign residents in the city can also participate. Not only will they be able to make contributions to municipal construction, but they will also benefit the friendship of the Allied countries.

J. Reorganizing Financial Administration

Reorganizing financial administration aims to eliminate corruption and eliminate embezzlement. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to severely punishing corruption, emphasis must be placed on establishing a good system. There are three types that have been implemented in the past three months:

1. Enforcing the Treasury System: The advantage of the treasury system is that general financial management personnel and tax collection personnel do not directly handle cash, so as to prevent them from having the opportunity to commit fraud. The method is that the city bank sets up treasury collection offices in various tax collection agencies, and dispatches personnel to directly collect money. Citizens pay taxes and directly hand them over to the treasury for verification. The Finance Bureau has been ordered to sign an agency city treasury agreement with the Shanghai City Bank, which has been implemented. After the implementation of this system, the evils of floating collection discounts and the practice of pursuing private gain and corruption will be completely eliminated.

2. Simplifying Collection Procedures: There are many municipal taxes, and they are scattered in various bureaus. Most of them are collected by merchants on behalf of the government. Taxpayers and collectors collude with each other, and many malpractices arise. The way to simplify and refine collection is to organize a tax review committee. Taxpayers report their monthly business operations to the relevant trade association chambers of commerce and collection agencies, and conduct preliminary joint review before submitting it to the review committee to assess the amount of tax payable. If it is found that the report is false, personnel will be sent to conduct spot checks. Since its implementation, merchants and people have found it convenient, and tax revenue has increased.

3. Making Outdoor Work Serious: It is stipulated that outdoor personnel must have an outdoor pass and an outdoor order when they go out on official business. When they arrive at the place of work, they must first hand it over for inspection, otherwise the merchants and people can escort them to the police station for investigation. In addition, the Finance Bureau has a secret reporting box, which is opened by the director himself every day, so that he can diligently seek people's opinions. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective.

The above are just the highlights. In addition, there are items such as handling industrial and commercial registration, organizing public organizations, improving water and electricity supply, and managing housing rentals, which will not be described due to space limitations.

Dajun was ordered to come and be the head of Shanghai. Before leaving, the Chairman repeatedly instructed him to relieve the people of their suffering and seek happiness. After taking office, he gave hundreds of speeches to his subordinates, in which he put forward the term "people-oriented." All municipal facilities should be based on the interests of the people. Those that benefit the people must be done with all their strength, and those that harm the people must be eliminated with all their strength. Seeing that the above items are all related to the welfare of citizens and are all for the benefit of citizens, I am confident that I have not failed the Chairman's instructions and my own promises. However, at the beginning of the city's restoration, there were many difficulties, and all facilities were felt to be unsatisfactory. I hope that social elites and leaders from all walks of life will provide guidance and advice from time to time and work together to make Shanghai's municipal administration have brilliant achievements in the future, which is what Dajun sincerely prays for.

### Overview of the Shanghai City Defense Corps

The more prosperous a city, the more difficult it is to establish public order. This city has a population of over four million, with Chinese and foreigners intermingling. The former concessions were especially a breeding ground for crime. Since the war, people's livelihoods have declined, and as the saying goes, "Hunger and cold breed theft," making local public order increasingly unstable. Recognizing this, the authorities organized the City Defense Corps on November 16th through the City Defense Committee. An overview of the Corps is introduced below.

Work Overview

The Corps, with the important mission of protecting citizens, assisting the military and police, eliminating bandits and dissidents, and ensuring public order, also strives to implement military training and complete the foundation of national education. It was established on November 16th, 1945. The commander of the Corps is General Rong Youlue. He has already begun to organize the constituent district regiments and brigades, recruit corps members and guards, select cadres, prepare for defense training, and plan for equipment and uniforms. Although it has only been a little over a month, it has already taken shape. As for other tasks, they remain to be gradually unfolded.

Organization

The Corps is subordinate to the Defense Committee, with the mayor as the director. Military actions are directed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The Corps headquarters has jurisdiction over eight district regiments: Pudong, Hunan, Husi, Hubei, Hubei, Punan, Hubei, and Wusong, as well as five standing brigades. Each district regiment has jurisdiction over three or two brigades, and each brigade has jurisdiction over three companies, mainly composed of volunteer corps members within the respective areas. They are responsible for defense within their jurisdiction during peacetime, preventing the activities of traitors and bandits. When necessary, they can be mobilized regardless of region to respond to changes in the situation. The standing brigades are composed of standing guards, stationed at necessary locations as the main powerful forces for defense, and also serve as a model for the implementation of training for volunteer corps members.

Quality

The recruitment of corps members and guards and the selection of cadres strive for excellent "quality" rather than massive "quantity," in order to eliminate the dross and retain the essence, forming a well-trained team. Therefore, the general quality is excellent. In addition to a portion of volunteer corps members who were members of the defense corps with good performance before the war, and members of the Shanghai Chinese Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, all are good citizens who volunteered based on a spirit of initiative and passed the selection process. The standing guards are strong men who have passed strict examinations and are excellent in academics, thought, and physique, and their quality is better than ordinary teams.

The voluntary cadres at all levels are capable and experienced people from various regions, with enthusiasm for service, so they are all respected figures. The standing cadres are excellent military officers who have received profound military officer education and have war experience and merits.

After the establishment of the district regiments, due to the citizens' awareness of responsibility, they volunteered to participate enthusiastically. Currently, the number of volunteer corps members registered in each district regiment has reached 11,000. The first batch of standing guards recruited totaled 512. It is planned to carefully select and recruit in stages to reach the fixed quota.

Equipment

The weapons currently available, in addition to rifles, include light and heavy machine guns and various grenade launchers, which can be used for defense and training. However, due to financial constraints, the uniforms of officers and soldiers are still being actively planned. It is hoped that all sectors can provide assistance.

Future Plans

Reorganization

Due to the necessity of the mission, the Corps plans to reorganize the volunteer teams of each district regiment in a meticulous and appropriate manner within a short period of time, and to replenish their equipment to make them sound, as a foundation for defense. The standing brigades will gradually form the prescribed number of troops with the guards recruited successively. In addition to the general infantry companies, it is also planned to establish heavy machine gun squads. If the situation permits, communication units can be added to achieve communication and contact in the jurisdiction.

Defense

In view of the approach of winter, which easily leads to theft cases, the Corps, in order to achieve the "defense" mission, will implement out-defense with a part of the corps members as soon as possible. The time is until the end of February, a total of two months. The daily out-defense time is tentatively set at five hours. If necessary, the time will be extended and the number of out-defense corps members will be increased. The troops responsible for out-defense are divided into alert, patrol, and reserve squads, and closely coordinate with the military and police to prevent bandits and dissidents.

Training

The main purpose of training, in addition to acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to accomplish the mission, is to focus on moral education, stimulate the spirit of perseverance, cultivate strict military discipline and obedience, inspire good habits, exercise strong physique, and eliminate the atmosphere of following old ways, so as to become healthy "national defense people."

Education is divided into corps member (guard) education, unit education, cadre education, and special education. The duration of corps member (guard) education is two months, unit (company and below) education is four months, and the first phase of education is scheduled to be completed from New Year's Day to the end of June.

The main subjects of corps member (guard) and unit education are as follows:

Basic Combat Training - Field Service

Night Education - Shooting Education

Physical Training and Martial Arts - Civic Knowledge

Baojia Knowledge - Air Defense and Anti-Poison and Modern Military Knowledge

Cadre education will be based on the necessity of their duties, using American training methods, and referring to war experience to select rotations for implementation, in order to achieve perfection and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Legal System

The Corps plans to compile various regulations for the Corps and its subordinate teams in the near future, for the purpose of following them in the implementation of various tasks now and in the future. Other organizations concerning corps member sports and recreation, compilation and distribution of reading materials, and various facilities are also being planned.

Rong Youlue is a Major General from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He is currently 40 years old and graduated from the first class of the Central Military Academy and the third class of the Army University Special Class. He has served as battalion commander, chief of staff of the 10th Army, and commander of the 194th Division.

### Handling Enemy Property and Economic Construction

— Wu Chengxi

I. The Vast Enemy Property

Although the people suffered greatly during the eight years of bloody war, we dare to say that, except for the invaluable lives of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the country, which are irretrievable, we have not suffered materially. Not only have we not suffered, but we have also gained an exceptionally vast asset—the assets confiscated from the enemy and puppets. From an individual standpoint, some families were destroyed, some factories were burned, and some wealth was lost. Everyone suffered some losses, but from the standpoint of the entire country, the eight years of resistance were by no means a sacrifice in vain. The gains from the final victory may exceed the sum of the damages suffered by the people.

The vastness of enemy property is related to their vain attempt to annex China and conquer the world, and it is also mutually causative with China's long-term resistance. After the September 18th Incident, they actively developed the Northeast in order to use it as a base for invading China. After the July 7th Incident, the all-out resistance of August 13th followed. After the withdrawal from Wuhan, the situation of long-term resistance became increasingly prominent, so they also used a century-long war to deal with us. In politics, they used puppet organizations to carry out their ambition to enslave China, and in economics, they controlled on the one hand and developed on the other, and plundered thoroughly to implement the policy of using war to support war and using Chinese to control Chinese. During the execution of this policy, our resources were developed, enemy factories were built in the country, warehouses, blockhouses, railways, highways, and agricultural and industrial experimental fields were added, counterfeit currency was rampantly issued, but materials were highly concentrated. Some were even hoarded for several years. They originally wanted to work hard in China for a lifetime, but unexpectedly the Japanese-American war broke out, and they gradually fell from advantage to disadvantage. Gradually, their homeland was invaded, and overseas transportation lines were cut off and blockaded day by day, until the homeland was separated from the mainland. Not long after, the atomic bomb was dropped, and the Japanese Empire completely collapsed. The results of the various development and construction projects carried out by the enemy in China over the past ten years are now completely occupied by us—although many have suffered considerable damage. The materials that the enemy desperately searched for and gathered in these years could not be transported away and had to be returned to their original owners—this is the origin of the vast enemy property.

Here we can look at a few specific numbers.

According to the research conducted by Mr. Yuan Qingyan in the past two years, the scope of Japanese investment in China is very wide. Agriculture, industry, mining, finance, trade and commerce, transportation and other miscellaneous industries are almost all included. Among them, the industrial item includes textile industry, chemical industry, hardware machinery industry, construction industry, food industry, wood furniture industry, clothing supplies industry, ceramics industry and miscellaneous industries, and the departments are also very numerous. If we add up the companies whose headquarters are in China and those whose headquarters are in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, the number of Japanese-invested companies in China is nearly 4,000 (Mr. Yuan's statistics do not include companies with capital below 100,000 yen, but I think there are more) and the capital amount is 80 billion yen. The details can be seen in the table below:

Statistics of Japanese Investment in China (Note)

Headquarters in Japan, Taiwan, Korea Headquarters in China

Industry Number of Companies Capital (Thousands of Yen) Number of Companies Capital (Thousands of Yen)

Agriculture 1 1,000 5 460

Mining 8 1,414,487 18 74,855

Manufacturing Industry 142 869,936 746 533,401

Financial Industry 34 594,060 43 24,070

Trade and Commerce 515 3,229,528 2,105 285,136

Transportation Industry 22 462,905 125 40,486

Investment Industry 6 186,575 18 33,885

Miscellaneous Industry 9 158,900 89 51,745

Total 737 6,917,393 3,149 1,044,040

(Note: This table is excerpted from "Economic Weekly" Volume 1, Issue 1, pages 17-18)

The statistics made by Mr. Yuan above do not include enemy property in the Northeast. If added, the "Total" will definitely be much larger. Regarding the situation in the Northeast, we do not have accurate figures to verify now. However, according to the estimate made by Mr. Huo Shishu, the director of the China Economic Construction Association, two years ago, the Japanese enemy's investment in that area "reached more than 170 billion yuan." We do not know whether this figure is still applicable now, but from the enemy's active spirit in developing the Northeast in recent years, this figure is probably only too small and not too large. (See Mr. Huo's figures in "Economic Construction Quarterly" Volume 1, Issue 4, page 11 for details)

The above is in terms of the national scope. Now let's see what the situation is in Shanghai. According to a survey by a powerful source, as of the end of September 1945, the net asset value of the 2,037 Japanese industries in Shanghai was 19 billion yuan in legal currency. The details are as follows:

From the Shanghai District Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, we have also obtained some scattered information, which is also compiled here for everyone's reference:

(1) Regarding factories—It is said that more than 400 enemy and puppet factories in Shanghai have been taken over. Among them, the textile industry has 1.23 million spindles and yarn spindles.

(2) Shops—560 Japanese shops have been taken over, and the estimated value is very large. The two German merchants, China-Germany Fufu and Bayer, were also taken over, and the total value is said to be more than 200-300 million yuan.

(3) Materials—It is said that more than 900 warehouses of materials have been taken over in Shanghai, and the counting is still in progress. Most of the materials have not been used. Because of the wide variety and large quantity of these materials, they will have a good impact on the future of prices when they are put on the market one after another.

(4) Real estate—It is said that more than 10,000 buildings have been taken over in Shanghai. Those still living in enemy residences have not yet been included.

(5) In addition, the number of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, educational and cultural institutions, farms, banks, gold and silver coins, etc. is even more considerable.

The enemy property in Shanghai is already so considerable. After the enemy property in Tianjin, Pingjin, and the Northeast is all counted, the total number will definitely be so large that it is hard to believe. So, how should we take it over and use it well?

II. Enemy Property Utilization and Our Economic Future

Judging from the experience of the past four months, the work of taking over enemy and puppet property has indeed gone through a very chaotic period. The receiving agencies were not unified, the staff could not be fair and selfless, "receiving is stagnation," warehouses caught fire, materials were lost and damaged, and the complete business system was often fragmented. All these are caused by the victory being too fast, the government's lack of preparation, improper use of people, or simply a lack of talent. Since the establishment of enemy and puppet property disposal in various regions, the above-mentioned bad situations have been greatly improved. Given time, it is believed that the reception and sorting of enemy property can be effectively brought to an end. The question for the future is how to use it.

The confiscation of enemy property is essentially a form of war indemnity. Historically, there are countless examples of victors collecting indemnities from the defeated and thus causing the rich and powerful after the war: Germany after the Franco-Prussian War and Japan after the Sino-Japanese War are two of the most obvious examples in modern times of victors obtaining large amounts of indemnity from the defeated and thus making rapid economic progress in their countries. Why can't China in the future lay a part of the foundation for economic recovery from the vast enemy property?

Regarding how the enemy property should be rationally and effectively used in the future, the government has its own overall policy, which we do not need to plan for. Moreover, the geographical distribution of enemy property is wide and the types are extremely complex, and the specific use is not something that outsiders can plan. Therefore, what we can talk about now is limited to one or two principles of use.

As everyone knows, China is a country with a very backward industry. Therefore, the first policy to be adopted in the future when using enemy property is to transform enemy property into a powerful weapon to quickly develop my country's industrialization. The light and heavy industrial institutions and other various equipment left by the enemy in our country, especially in North China and the Northeast, are considerable. We should properly and completely invest this part of capital into the production process, thereby improving China's productivity, improving people's living standards, accelerating the progress of industrialization, and promoting the high-speed accumulation of national capital. If this can be done, it is believed that the process of China's industrialization can be greatly shortened. In order to make all productive enemy property fully utilized, we believe that the government should mobilize all private capital to participate in the operation as much as possible. Except for those that are closely related to national defense or that private capital is unable to operate for a while, the government should use all enemy property in the form of entrusted operation, joint government-business operation, lease, sale, etc. to use private capital and human resources to seek the most effective use and development of enemy property. Unnecessary government operation and inefficient government operation are not enough to be a lesson.

Second, regarding the materials confiscated from the enemy and puppets, we believe that they should be used separately in two aspects: for various raw materials, those needed by the government should be provided to the government, those needed by general manufacturers should be allocated to various manufacturers at a fair price, and those that can be provided to the foreign market should be used to promote foreign trade. In short, they should not be used indiscriminately, but they should not be hoarded and unused. Regarding various grains and various daily necessities, we believe that they should be put on the market as soon as possible, one to increase the supply of materials and the other to maintain the stable price of materials. There are 900 warehouses in Shanghai, which are worth a lot; there are also 600 billion yuan of goods stored in more than 100 warehouses in Tianjin (see the Dagong Newspaper on December 15). If these materials are used properly, it is believed that they will be very beneficial to industrial production and people's lives in the future.

Third, we should also use enemy property to balance finances, reduce issuance, stabilize currency value, and reduce the burden on the people. The fair sale of materials, the sale of gold and silver coins, the sale of real estate, the disposal of companies and shops, and the lease or sale of unnecessary factories can all obtain a very large amount of funds, the number of which may have to be expressed in units of three "wan" characters. For such a large income, it is urgently needed by the financial authorities who have gone through years of hard war and are now facing the need to rebuild everything, and it is also an important way to solve the deficit finance during the transition period in the future. For many years, the people have suffered from extortion, inflation, and soaring prices. If a way out can be opened up in the disposal of enemy property in the future, so that the government does not increase taxes, does not resort to printing presses, and the annual expenditure is still not worried about having no way, then the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit from both. In fact, if the enemy property is handled properly, the government may be able to get through this year even if it does not levy a single tax or issue a single banknote, because the actual value of enemy property is too great.

Finally, the "puppet" character of the enemy and puppets seems to need to be mentioned again. In recent years, almost all puppets are greedy, and it can also be said that all puppets are rich. In the process of purification, the people's fat and ointment searched by this group of people should be squeezed out as much as possible. The fields and houses they bought in cities and villages, the gold, foreign currency, diamonds, treasures, antiques, calligraphy and paintings they gathered, the stocks they invested in, and the goods they hoarded should all be confiscated, auctioned off, and the income should be put into the national treasury for national use. These things are actually the people's blood and sweat. If the government can make good use of them in the future, then the people's blood and sweat in the past will not have been wasted. It is only paid in advance in the folk, and it is used in arrears in the government.

Enemy property is vast, and the role of enemy property is especially vast. I hope the government will handle it carefully and use it properly. The revival of the national economy in the future will depend on it. 34, 12, 23.

### How to Determine the Exchange Rate

— Liu Dajun

(This article is continued from page four)

But the war has already ended, and we cannot adopt a policy of isolationism, prohibiting international trade for a prolonged period. Since this is not feasible, and international transportation is more abundant than domestic, coastal cities will inevitably receive a large influx of imported goods first. Prices will continue to fall, and these goods will not be easily transported to the rear, causing a significant price difference between the rear and coastal areas. As a result, prices in coastal cities will first adjust to match international prices, while price adjustments in inland areas will lag behind.

The above assumes that the government continues to maintain its previous foreign exchange control policy, where foreign exchange for general importers comes from the black market. The adjustment between international prices and prices in coastal cities is calculated based on the black market exchange rate. According to our research, even calculated based on the pre-Republic black market price of US dollars, the prices of many goods are still much lower abroad than in Shanghai. Therefore, on the one hand, Shanghai prices will fall, and on the other hand, competition among importers to purchase foreign exchange will cause the future black market exchange rate to rise, meaning the black market rate will depreciate. As for prices in the rear, they will inevitably be manipulated by speculators due to the failure to restore normal supply and demand, so they will inevitably differ greatly from coastal prices. Given this situation, it is probably impossible to first adjust domestic prices or wait for domestic economic stability before revising the exchange rate and adjusting international prices.

To take a step back, even if this could be done, it would still be detrimental to our country in the long run. First, delaying the restoration of international trade would prevent our country from obtaining essential materials that we urgently need, which would be harmful to post-war economic recovery. The goods that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) can provide have many limitations in terms of type and use, and the quantity is not sufficient. We cannot rely on this organization to provide all our normal needs. Second, even if prices in various parts of our country were to reach a consensus after a certain period, a significant fluctuation in prices across the country would occur once international trade resumes. The result of delaying the exchange rate adjustment is simply prolonging the period of price fluctuations, dividing one thing into two stages.

Some believe that delaying the revision of the exchange rate allows for observation of market exchange rate trends. If the market exchange rate reaches a certain level, indicating relative stability, the government can adopt this rate as the official rate. To adopt this approach, the government must open up foreign exchange, allowing foreign exchange banks and importers/exporters to freely buy and sell, in order to see the so-called "natural level." However, a sudden opening of foreign exchange will inevitably cause drastic fluctuations in both exchange rates and prices, and our country's balance of international payments will be difficult to achieve a fundamental equilibrium in the short term, making it difficult for the exchange rate to reach a relatively stable level. With such a shortage of domestic materials and such low international prices (with a limited increase compared to pre-war levels), our country's market exchange rate may inevitably decline rapidly, ultimately causing adverse psychological effects.

Since the author advocates revising the exchange rate as soon as possible, what level should be adopted? The most rational exchange rate is naturally the equilibrium exchange rate. However, as mentioned above, it will be difficult for our country's balance of international payments to achieve a fundamental equilibrium in the short term, making it hopeless to establish and maintain an equilibrium exchange rate. Calculating the equilibrium exchange rate uses purchasing power parity as a reference. Although it is not easy to calculate purchasing power parity when domestic prices are fluctuating greatly, it is possible to make an estimate. Fortunately, since the goal is not to seek a long-term equilibrium exchange rate, a slight deviation above or below does not matter. However, it is better for the exchange rate to be slightly undervalued than overvalued, because an overvalued exchange rate will hinder exports and encourage imports. While our country needs foreign materials, it would be unwise to excessively encourage imports. After the war, it is not convenient to strictly control imports and exports, so it is necessary to use an appropriate exchange rate to prevent the import of non-essential goods, while adopting subsidies or tax reductions/exemptions for the goods that are urgently needed to facilitate their import. The so-called non-essential goods do not only refer to luxury goods—luxury goods can be taxed—but should include certain daily necessities that can be produced domestically. Customs cannot impose heavy taxes on such goods, but must use an undervalued exchange rate to protect them. This does not conflict with the proposal to restore international trade as soon as possible, but it merely involves selecting the types of goods.

The other day, a newspaper here published an article by Mr. Yang Shijin, who believes that under the new exchange rate, one US dollar should be equal to 2,200 national currency units. His calculation is based on: the US wholesale price index being approximately 135, the Shanghai index being approximately 90,000, and the pre-war Sino-US exchange rate being 3.3 national currency units per US dollar. According to the current price indices of both sides, the purchasing power parity should be 1 to 2,200. The Shanghai price index he used is from August, calculated based on the price of counterfeit currency. If converted into legal tender at the market conversion rate of 1 to 130-140 at that time, general prices would be 700 times higher than before the war. The index of 90,000 used above is an estimate of the recent price level in Shanghai. We now have the Shanghai price index for October, which is 58,466, and is calculated in legal tender. Since its base period is 1936, this index shows that prices have only risen 585 times. If the purchasing power parity is calculated according to this index, one US dollar should be equal to 1,430 national currency units.

The above-mentioned index was compiled by Jin Cheng Bank and the Tongde Society, continuing the work of the China Economic Research Association. Although a geometric mean of commercial lists is used, the classified indices show that textiles, fuels, etc., are higher than the total index, and metals are more than three times higher, while only the food index is lower than the total index. From this, we can infer that although the items have not been weighted, there must be a large number of food items, so this category has been given a very heavy weight in a subtle way. (Yang Guangsheng also uses this index)

Originally, some people also use the cost of living index as the basis for calculating purchasing power parity. The Shanghai Municipal Government Research Office's November labor cost of living index is 102,190, more than 1000 times higher than before the war (calculated in legal tender), while the salary class index is 111,108, which is more than 1100 times higher than before the war. If the former is used, one US dollar should be equal to 2,495 national currency units, while if the latter is used, it should be 2,716 units. The weights of the cost of living index are based on the budgets of most families, which seems slightly better than the previous wholesale price index. According to general observations, current Shanghai prices should be around 1,000 times higher than before the war.

The government may not adopt such a high exchange rate due to other considerations, but I believe that it is better to err on the high side (that is, the exchange rate can be undervalued) when it is initially revised. Later, if foreign goods are imported, domestic production increases, transportation is convenient, and prices fall, it may be possible to gradually lower the exchange rate. This can produce good psychological effects, preventing capital from fleeing abroad, and allowing capital already abroad to "return," helping to adjust the balance of international payments.

In conclusion, I believe that the domestic economy cannot automatically achieve stability and needs to be urged by a rational foreign exchange policy, so it is advisable to adjust the exchange rate as soon as possible. After one revision, continued adjustments will inevitably be necessary under China's economic conditions, but it is appropriate to gradually lower the exchange rate (that is, increase the rate). As for which of the several purchasing power parities calculated in Shanghai should be adopted, or even if none of them are used at all, it does not matter much. Fortunately, this parity is only a reference, and how to choose under the principle of being undervalued depends on what the government policy emphasizes.
