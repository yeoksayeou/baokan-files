[Central News Agency's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] President Dai Chuanxian specially narrated the main points of the Chairman's life and his thoughts and behaviors as follows to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday: (1) He is extremely filial to his mother, extremely fraternal to his brothers, extremely loyal to others, and extremely trustworthy to friends, all of which have reliable examples to follow. (2) He is strict to his subordinates but lenient inside, and the same is true for his students. Throughout his life, he has treated people and disciplined himself with propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sincere spirit of love. (3) He is a model soldier throughout his life. His virtue of stopping war for martial arts, saving the world, saving people, and saving the country can be seen in his achievements over the past thirty years. (4) He never slacks off and always acts immediately upon knowing, so he uses the philosophy of diligent practice as his educational purpose. (5) In battle, he is never discouraged in defeat, nor is he arrogant in victory. From the Northern Expedition in the 14th year of the Republic of China until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all his words and deeds broadcast to the Japanese people were for this purpose. (6) In his personal life, he devoted himself to the work of self-discipline and returning to propriety. From every drink and every meal to walking, living, sitting, and lying down, he strives to do good. Confucius said that Yanzi did not violate benevolence for three months, which is almost an understatement. The above is what Xian has truly observed and learned, and I respectfully record it as a lesson for the people to follow.

### Chairman Convenes a Banquet for Government Representatives, Instructing on Peace Talks; The Communist Party Still Refuses to Submit the National Assembly List

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] After the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social elites submitted and then withdrew their proposals because they were not accepted by both parties, negotiations almost stalled again. Later, because Chairman Chiang stated that oral suggestions could be put forward for further discussion and a decision made, the mediators were also very willing to continue their efforts. They re-drafted a new oral proposal and asked Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu to discuss it together at 3:00 PM on the 30th, presented the prepared plan and put it to discussion. The discussion ended around 5:00 PM. On the one hand, government representatives Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wang Bijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, Wu Dingchang, Chen Cheng, Yu Youren, Zai Detu, and Zheng Lu were summoned by Chairman Chiang and had lunch at the official residence on Huangpu Road at 12:00 PM. The Chairman inquired about the situation of the talks with the mediators last night. The representatives reported the process and said that the oral proposal put forward by the mediators should be instructed by the Chairman. They left around 2:00 PM. At 5:30 PM, all the government representatives gathered again at Sun Ke's residence, and at 7:00 PM, Sun Ke hosted a banquet for all members of the Democratic League, the Youth Party, and social elites, and held a meeting after the meal, which ended around 11:00 PM. After the meeting, reporters interviewed Lei Zhen and Luo Longji, who said that the crux of the dispute between the two sides still lies in the two points of ceasefire and the National Assembly list. The government's opinion is that the CCP should issue a ceasefire order after submitting the National Assembly list, but the CCP insists that the list can only be submitted according to the CPPCC procedures. This issue has been discussed for several hours tonight, and the mediators' contact with the Communist Party representatives and the Chairman's instructions to the government representatives have also focused on this point. In addition, some issues such as the reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan are only a matter of timing. The government has no different opinion. It is reported that the mediators' oral proposal still includes ceasefire, National Assembly list, and reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan. On the evening of the 30th, Luo Longji visited the Communist Party and asked them to consider the issue of submitting the National Assembly list, but today the Communist Party representatives still insisted on not handing it over when attending the talks. This is indeed a major reef in the current situation, but the mediators still want to continue their efforts and are scheduled to meet again at 10:00 AM on the 31st for discussion. When the reporter left the office of the Democratic League in Yunjiagang, it was already 12:00 midnight, and the night was hazy, like the confusing and uncertain future of the peace talks.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] Ambassador Stuart has recovered from his illness. He hosted a luncheon for Luce on the 30th, and invited Sun Ke to accompany him. In the afternoon, he went to pay respects to the Chairman with Fu Jingbo. The Chairman inquired about the Ambassador's health with great concern. The Ambassador also offered birthday wishes to the Chairman. It is reported that the peace talks were also discussed. He left at 5:00 PM and met with Marshal Ma for talks, returning to the embassy at 6:30 PM. Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party visited Fu Jingbo but did not speak. He then visited again at 7:00 PM and talked for half an hour before leaving.

Among them, about 10 kilometers of roadbed between Songlindian and Gaobeidian are all continuous deep pits on the left and right, or the rails have been moved to both sides of the road, and many sleepers have been burned. The situation in Gaobeidian to Gucheng is unclear because it is under the control of the Communist army.

The Shuishui station water tower has been bombed, and the track maintenance crew house and station building have also been reduced to ashes. The Guhe turnout has also been dismantled, and the station building and track maintenance crew house are all in ruins. The Communist army removed all ten kilometers of rail between Shijiazhuang and Fangshun Bridge. The same is true for the forty kilometers between Wangdu and Zhaixidian. The track maintenance crew houses and station buildings in Wangdu and Qingfengdian have all been razed to the ground. It is estimated that the damaged length accounts for 180 kilometers, accounting for three-fifths of the total length. Currently, the construction train of the Changxindian Engineering Section has progressed to 82 kilometers, and it is expected to reach Gaobeidian. The situation between Gaobeidian and Caohe, which are still within the Communist army's sphere of influence, cannot be statistically determined. As for bridges, the total length is 50,000 meters, and 1,000 meters have been damaged, accounting for a little over 3% of the total length. Track maintenance crews and civilian laborers have been mobilized for urgent repairs. In addition to purchasing materials, the Railway Bureau's existing materials are also being used. There is also a method of collecting materials on the spot with rewards. Those who bring a steel rail can get 5,000 yuan. Larger beams need to be manufactured at the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory, and those under two meters can be matched with old materials from the engineering section. However, the bridge foundations of the Shahe Bridge and Xinjiutang Bridge have also been completely destroyed, and temporary ferries and pontoon bridges are temporarily used instead.

Editorial

### Celebrating Longevity and Serving the Country

Today is the sixtieth birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Republic of China. Compatriots across the country universally celebrate, both near and far, with sincerity. Although Chairman Chiang has great virtue and humility and strictly forbids extravagance, the people in various places, based on their respect for virtue and gratitude for merit, either donate money to build schools or offer birthday congratulations, matters that are extraordinary and feelings that are difficult to suppress. This is truly because the Chairman has dedicated his life to the revolution and has made contributions to the country. Now, after the victory of the Great War, coinciding with the head of state's sixtieth year, those who celebrate the Chairman's longevity are celebrating for the country and for the people. The Chairman has contributed infinitely to the country and the people, and what will the people use to repay the Chairman? Therefore, today's celebration of longevity, the more the Chairman humbly declines, the more the people love and respect him. We can almost say that today's celebration of longevity by the people is a symbol of the people expressing their patriotism.

Speaking of serving the country, that is the Chairman's lifelong aspiration. We remember that the Chairman published the grand article "Serving the Country and Thinking of Relatives" on his fiftieth birthday, which truly moved everyone who read it and inspired them. Now, on his sixtieth birthday, the Chairman telegraphed the day before yesterday and said, "Today, the country is not yet at peace for a long time, and compatriots are suffering deeply," and he expressed his extreme self-deprecation, saying, "I am deeply ashamed for not fulfilling my duties to protect the country and save the people." When we recall that the Chairman, since he went to study abroad at the age of nineteen, vowed to follow the National Father and devote himself to the National Revolution, until today, with his vigorous spirit, leading the struggle, he has served the country for at least forty years in these sixty years, except for his youth, and he still always thinks of "serving the country and saving the people" and worries about "the country not being at peace for a long time and the people suffering." This selfless spirit of serving the country is what every descendant of the Yellow Emperor should cherish and emulate. Today, although our people use all possible means to respectfully celebrate the Chairman's great birthday, it is not even a fraction of the Chairman's spirit of serving the country; and our people must not only celebrate longevity but forget to serve the country. Because serving the country is everyone's duty, and only when everyone truly serves the country can we comfort the Chairman's long-cherished wish and repay the Chairman's merits.

The Chairman's sixty years of life, forty years devoted to the country; and his forty years of history of serving the country, the first half was to obey the leadership of the National Father, loyal to his duties, and the second half was to inherit the will of the National Father and complete the great cause. Today we celebrate the Chairman's longevity and pray for China's fortune. China unfortunately suffered the double humiliation of the last century of the Qing Dynasty, but China is also fortunate to have the National Father in the past and the Chairman in the present as the saviors of the country and the nation! Let us imagine; if China did not have the National Father, how could there have been the overthrow of the imperial system and the creation of the Republic of China? If China did not have the Chairman, how could there have been the success of the Northern Expedition and the victory of the War of Resistance? Without the former, there is no way to inspire the latter; without the latter, there is no way to glorify the former. Today, we respectfully celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, and we should also greatly celebrate for China - celebrating that God blesses China and gives birth to great men.

But we only celebrate longevity verbally, and we only pray for blessings in words, which is not enough, and is not enough to express respect for virtue and gratitude for merit even by a fraction. We must contribute our strength and serve the country according to our ability, to share the Chairman's worries and labor. Only then can we truly celebrate the Chairman's longevity and pray for the country's blessings in the best way. Because the Chairman is after all sixty years old, he has fulfilled his forty-year responsibility to serve the country. He has shouldered the heavy burden of revolution and resistance, and he has carried the footsteps of the National Father for twenty long years. Of course, the Chairman is healthy and vigorous, leading the nation-building, and is admired by all, but the Chairman always hopes that the Republic of China can truly be built up, and that the people can truly become the masters of their own country, so that the country he "protects" can become a "republic" of "long-term peace," and that the people he "saves" can become "citizens" who are without "suffering" and capable of self-governance. The United States has Washington and the country was created, and it has Lincoln and the country was unified. The two great men, Washington and Lincoln, are immortal for all time, and the American people also enjoy infinite happiness. We are fortunate to have the National Father Sun Yat-sen and the country was created, and we also hope to rely on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to unify the country. What the Chairman has been looking forward to day and night is that there will be such a day when he can see the country he has worked hard to save, from political tutelage to constitutional government, from party rule to democracy, and from his own hands, on behalf of the Kuomintang of China, to return the government to the people of the whole country. Twenty years ago, the Chinese people needed the Chairman's leadership. The Chairman did not refuse and resolutely led the people, first the Northern Expedition, which completed the unification, and then the War of Resistance, which guaranteed independence. Now we still look up to the Chairman's leadership, and he will surely lead us to complete the work of peaceful unification and democratic nation-building. However, we guess that the Chairman may think that during the period of political tutelage, he could not but lead the people according to the Three Principles of the People of the Party, but in the period of constitutional government, he expects that the people who believe in the Three Principles of the People will lead the country on the road of construction themselves. We must know that the success of democratic politics can never rely on the power of one person, but relies on the cooperative power of all the people, at least the majority of the people. The Chairman knows the essence of democracy and therefore expects the people to be sincerely. Today, the way for our people to serve the country according to their ability is also the way to repay the Chairman's merits. There is nothing else, as long as everyone does their best and fully cooperates to complete the work of peaceful unification and to establish the political and economic system of the Three Principles of the People, so that the Republic of China truly becomes a modern democratic country of the people, by the people, for the people.

We share the Chairman's worries and labor, but do not increase the Chairman's worries and labor, so that we can truly celebrate the Chairman's longevity. Only in this way, we must work hard according to our ability, learn to be citizens of a democratic country, and everyone contributes their strength to serve the country, so that we can share the Chairman's worries and labor, so that the Chairman can fulfill his long-cherished wish and see a new China that is democratic, unified, and strong, stand firm and shoulder the great responsibility of safeguarding world peace and maintaining human justice.

Congratulations on Chairman Chiang's health and happiness! Pray for the country's peaceful unification!

### Large Number of Economic Traitors in Bengbu; Evidence Found in Secret Chamber; Those Who Evade Justice Will Be Reported

[Our newspaper's Bengbu dispatch] During the period of Bengbu's occupation, many of the traitors who joined the enemy were prominent figures in society in the past. There were many political traitors, but also many economic traitors. The most prominent among those who relied on the power of the enemy to disrupt finance and engage in conspicuous evil was the traitor Chuan Junshi, followed by the traitor Chen Xiping. At the beginning of the victory, the two traitors fled at the same time, and other second- and third-class traitors evaded justice, either staying in Bengbu or traveling between Yanzhou and Xuzhou, and have not yet been sanctioned by the country. Unexpectedly, personnel from a certain agency recently discovered a large secret chamber at the site of the former Anmin Bank on Er Ma Road and seized a large amount of evidence of economic traitors' adherence to the enemy. After the reporter's investigation, it was learned that the important figures in the former Anmin Bank were: Puppet Chairman Fu Cheng, Standing Directors Zhou Wenrui, Li Huilong, Directors Xu Ziping, Dai Nanxun, Chen Xiping, Cheng Bohang, Alternate Directors Zhang Bingqing, Yang Dingwen, and Yu Youfang. Shan Zhimin and Ni Duci (namely Ni Daolang), Zhang Jinjing, representatives of the Huaxing Bank, served as supervisors, and He Youwu served as an alternate supervisor. The shareholders included Liu Shanzhi, Wang Zhongzhang, Zhang Huichuan, etc., all with solid evidence. According to those familiar with the local situation, the puppet Anmin Bank was actually incubated by the puppet Huaxing Bank. Puppet Director Dai Nanxun was a mining tycoon, and Liu Shanzhi was a leather industry magnate. When Bengbu was occupied, Liu opened the Guangxing Leather Factory and the Huachang Military Uniform Factory, specializing in supplying military materials for the enemy. It is reported that part of his property has been confiscated, and there are still many omissions. Wang Zhongzhang was the president of the puppet National Medicine Industry Association and a well-known profiteer who made a fortune from the national crisis. A certain party has prepared to report to the court according to law, and the traitors will be severely sanctioned.

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 30th] There are many pirates along the coast of Zhejiang.

This has caused merchants and fishermen much concern. With the winter fishing season approaching, the fishing boats the provincial government intends to prepare are still being negotiated or repaired and cannot be used immediately. Therefore, the Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau recently sent a letter to the provincial government, requesting the Ministry of the Navy to allocate warships to cooperate with existing fishery protection vessels in jointly preventing banditry to facilitate navigation and benefit fishermen and merchants.

It is heard that the winter defense period is tentatively set for three months, from November 1, 1946, to January 31, 1947, but may be extended if necessary depending on the local security situation to ensure that there is no possibility of remnants of bandits resurfacing in various rural areas after the suppression.

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, This Newspaper] The Yangcheng District Bandit Suppression Command stated that since the launch of the bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng District by the East and West District Commands, all bandit gangs that had been roaming within its jurisdiction have been almost completely eliminated.

### Molotov Suggests to the United Nations General Assembly Universal Disarmament and Prohibition of the Use of Atomic Energy in War

[United Press, New York, 29th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly tonight lasting one hour and eight minutes, first elaborated on the Soviet Union's far-reaching foreign policy and then unexpectedly launched a diplomatic offensive, proposing four resolutions to strengthen world peace. (1) The United Nations General Assembly considers universal disarmament necessary. (2) The first task is to prohibit the production of atomic energy for use in war. (3) The General Assembly recommends to the Security Council that it take practical measures in this regard. (4) The General Assembly requests all governments to support these measures. Molotov's speech was translated into French. Many delegates had already left the room. Molotov requested that debate on the disarmament resolution begin. After British delegate Bevin suggested that the issue be studied by the Joint Committee before further discussion, Molotov agreed. The General Assembly then adjourned until tomorrow.

[United Press, 29th] Molotov, in his speech to the UN General Assembly tonight, used blunt language, first stating that if the veto power enjoyed by the five major powers were strictly limited, the UN organization would inevitably collapse. Molotov then attacked Churchill and Baruch, the representative of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee, before proposing a global disarmament movement, demanding an investigation into the number of troops stationed in non-enemy countries by the United Nations, especially the United States and Britain, and declaring his willingness to provide a detailed report on such Soviet troops. Molotov's speech was delivered to a packed hall, with all listening attentively, and when he proposed a general disarmament plan, he was greeted with warm applause. Molotov claimed that Churchill and many of his British and American friends were engaged in an anti-Soviet movement in the hope of creating an international hegemony. The atomic energy control plan proposed by Baruch was nothing more than self-serving.

Molotov pointed out that the Security Council's resolutions on the Spanish and Iranian cases were major errors, and that there are currently two conflicting political trends in the world: one is peace and cooperation by mutual agreement, and the other is control of other countries. The Soviet Union has always been committed to international cooperation, firmly respects the United Nations organization, and believes that the United Nations Charter must be faithfully implemented without change. Commenting on the recent visit of US warships to the Mediterranean, Molotov said that warships and aircraft sometimes travel to places they have never been before, believing that this is necessary to strengthen their diplomatic means. Atomic bombs have only been dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima and have not been tried elsewhere, but atomic bombs will inevitably be found in other countries, and all illusions will be shattered.

Molotov also criticized the existence of not only atomic diplomacy but also financial diplomacy and pound diplomacy, attempting to manipulate other countries with them. In some schemes, atomic bombs occupy the majority of the relationship, but Marshal Stalin has already said that the secret of atomic bombs cannot be kept forever, and atomic bombs cannot solve everything. It is regrettable that Churchill and his ilk, with their inherent reactionary ideas, still rely on force and control. If we can learn from the lessons of war, we must work together to deal with aggressors, and the United Nations organization must be made to become a place where major powers can unite to deal with any aggression. The unity of major powers in the Security Council has been recognized by the United Nations organization, and this principle cannot be undermined.

[United Press, New York, Lake Success, 29th] United States Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Baruch said today that the United States is prepared to accept Molotov's proposal to abolish atomic bombs and destroy existing stockpiles. At the same time, the US government pointed out that Molotov's proposal for world disarmament is welcome and attractive in principle. However, Baruch said the United States must first know that other countries have banned the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the United States wants to know the details of the Soviet Union's plan before implementing disarmament. Government officials stated: They are willing to leave Molotov's proposal to be answered by the US representative to the United Nations, Austin, but said that the United States has been demanding and working towards disarmament for ten years.

### US Troops Stationed in China with Our Consent, Our Delegation Issues Statement

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The Chinese delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly today supported the United States in opposing Belarus's accusation that the stationing of US Marines in China violated the United Nations Charter. Belarus's accusation was made at the United Nations General Assembly. The Chinese delegation said in a statement: "China completely disagrees with the views of the Belarusian delegation. The whole world knows that the stationing of US troops in China was agreed upon by China, and their mission was to disarm Japanese troops and repatriate Japanese military and civilians in China. As this mission is gradually completed in various parts of China, US troops are also gradually being reduced and withdrawn to their home country, with only a few remaining in China. US troops have never participated in any conflicts between the National Army and the Communist Army. On the contrary, the US representative in China is working hard to promote a peaceful solution to political difficulties, which China must appreciate. These difficulties are caused by the Chinese Communist Party's opposition to the government's policy of unifying the country and its desire to expand its political system by force to control the whole of China."

### National Harmony, Universal Harmony, the Chinese Family System Can Be Learned From, Guo Taiqi Broadcasts Speech in the United States

[Central News Agency, New York, 29th Special Dispatch] Guo Taiqi, the second representative of our delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, recently broadcast to the American people on the Mutual Broadcasting System, which is relayed by more than 350 stations, calling on all countries in the world to adopt the traditional Chinese family concept of unity to develop the spirit of Chinese family harmony. Guo was the second of the special speakers from the five major powers at the United Nations General Assembly. The first speaker was Mrs. Roosevelt of the US delegation. At the beginning of the broadcast, the US Air Force Band played the Chinese national anthem, followed by Guo's speech. He said that the traditional Chinese family concept ideally involves five generations living together. Although there are inevitable frictions, harmony can still be maintained. This family spirit of harmony developed by all countries will definitely guarantee that all nations in the world will move together towards the same goal of the United Nations, which is to promote the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.

### Britain Does Not Support Outer Mongolia's Request

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Regarding the recent letter from Outer Mongolian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Choibalsan to the Secretariat of the Council of Foreign Ministers, requesting to participate in the Far Eastern Commission, the British Foreign Office announced that the British government is unlikely to support this request.

### The Issue of the Veto Power of the Five Major Powers Remains the Focus of Debate at the United Nations General Assembly, the US Delegation Drafts a Restriction Plan

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly entered its second week today, and the focus of discussion remains the veto power issue. Molotov's proposal to reduce armaments in all countries does not reduce the debate among representatives on the veto power. As of today, of the 51 national representatives, 29 have addressed the General Assembly, and 23 of them (including four of the five major powers) have discussed the veto power. As many as 13 small countries have criticized the veto power, and these representatives have requested that the use of the veto power be restricted or completely abolished. As for those who oppose changing the veto power, there are nine countries: Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union, Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Syria.

[United Press, New York, 29th] In order to avoid being seen as ganging up with Britain to deal with the Soviet Union, the United States is drafting a detailed plan to restrict the five major powers from exercising their veto power in the Security Council. The main points are as follows: (1) Expand the existing rules of procedure to prohibit any of the five permanent members from participating in the Security Council's judgment on cases related to that country itself. (2) Allow any of the five countries to voluntarily waive their right to vote without being considered to have exercised the veto power. (3) Fully distinguish between procedural issues (requiring a simple majority vote) and substantive issues (requiring the unanimous agreement of all five permanent members) discussed by the Security Council. If this plan cannot be agreed upon, it will inevitably lead to a long and heated debate in the Security Council.

However, although this plan is still awaiting last-minute revisions, it is heard that it will be informally submitted to the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France here for their opinions before being submitted to the United Nations General Assembly subcommittee for discussion. When US chief representative Austin delivers a speech at the General Assembly tomorrow, he will formally present the above plan. Austin's speech will avoid political issues and will only be limited to matters within the purview of the United Nations.

### The World Food Preparatory Committee, Our Representative Delivers a Speech Suggesting Guaranteeing Sufficient World Grain Reserves

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Chen Qimai, the leader of the Chinese delegation to the World Food Committee Preparatory Committee, said to the representatives today: The current arduous task of the Chinese government and the Chinese people is agricultural revival. Therefore, the Chinese government expresses its "sincere" welcome to the Food and Agriculture Organization's proposal to establish an international organization to guarantee sufficient world grain reserves and maintain stable prices. Chen also said: China attaches great importance to the proposal to create international warehouses.

### The World YWCA Board of Directors to Meet in China Next Year

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] A reporter from the World YWCA Preparatory Committee said that the association's Board of Directors will hold a meeting in China in October next year.

### US President Truman's Proclamation Specifies Armistice and Thanksgiving Days

[United Press, Washington, 29th] President Truman issued a proclamation today, designating November 11 as Armistice Day and November 28 as Thanksgiving Day, and asked the people of the country to renew their efforts to seek lasting peace. The President advocated that Armistice Day should have appropriate ceremonies, and US government offices must fly the national flag uniformly.

### Different Methods of Calculating the Number of Soviet Troops

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] Stalin denied Churchill's claim that the Soviet Union had 100 divisions stationed in Europe in a speech yesterday, saying that the Soviet Union only had 60 divisions stationed in these countries. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail" commented today that Marshal Stalin's so-called 60 divisions may include 50,000 personnel per division, which would amount to a total of 3 million personnel. As for Churchill's estimate of 200 divisions, each division only includes 10,000 personnel, which would amount to a total of only 2 million personnel. This conclusion proves the difficulty of the issue, which is why the official expressed sincerity.

### Churchill Responds to Stalin, Willing to Resolve British-Soviet Suspicions and Make Peace, Hoping to Disclose Troop Numbers to Remove Doubts

[United Press, London, 29th] Former Prime Minister Churchill issued a statement tonight, sternly refuting Marshal Stalin's claim that the Soviet Union only has 60 divisions stationed in Europe, saying that this number "does not include Romania, and certainly does not include the heavy troops concentrated in Leningrad and Odessa." However, two hours later, Churchill deleted this sentence without explaining the reason. Churchill's move was apparently due to not having read the full text of Stalin's speech, as Stalin's reference to 60 divisions stationed abroad actually included Romania. Churchill's statement this time was moderate in tone, which was rare in his previous remarks to the Soviet Union. It is said that I was very pleased to hear Stalin's statement about the Soviet army. The British-Soviet treaty concluded during my tenure as Prime Minister in 1941 stipulated non-interference in each other's internal affairs and social systems. Therefore, I do not know why we cannot become friends, helping each other and improving the overall living standards of the broad masses everywhere. I express my respect for Stalin and wish the Soviet people safety, glory, and happiness. As for my saying that the Soviet Union has 200 divisions stationed in various occupied areas, the British government has not corrected it. We have had our fill of all kinds of suspicions, and there is no better way to dispel suspicions than facts. The United Nations organization and the Security Council should have the opportunity to fully and fairly disclose all troops to dispel doubts.

### The United States Believes Stalin's Remarks Provide a New Factor for Promoting Understanding

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Today, Byrnes met with President Truman for nearly an hour, but it was not explained whether they had discussed Stalin's written speech. At the same time, world leaders, including President Truman, have closely studied Stalin's reply. Tonight, a copy of Stalin's answers to reporters was presented to Truman, and the President read it with great interest. State Department officials said that Stalin's answers to the questions raised by United Press manager Bailey showed that the Soviet Union might in the near future jointly establish economic unification in Germany with Britain and the United States, followed by the establishment of a provisional German government.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] The State Department commented today on Marshal Stalin's remarks yesterday, saying that Stalin's hope for a unified Germany and the establishment of a satisfactory peace treaty was in response to Secretary of State Byrnes. Stalin's renewed attention to borrowing from the United States has caused considerable surprise. The State Department originally thought that the Soviet Union was no longer concerned about its $1 billion loan negotiation a year ago, but now it knows that this is not the case. Byrnes did not directly express his opinion on Stalin's remarks, and did not even criticize Stalin's rebuttal of Byrnes's point that US-Soviet relations are becoming increasingly tense.

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] General MacArthur, Acheson, and Lieutenant General Terevenko have all read Stalin's written remarks with great interest but refused to formally comment on them. Senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters informally expressed the opinion that the resolution of major disagreements between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union could have a good impact on local problems in Asia, including the Korean issue, where US-Soviet relations are most tense.

### Adapting to Modern National Defense Needs, France Improves Military Training System, Training Period Increased to Four Years, the Whole Country Can Become Elite Soldiers

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] A spokesman for the French Army Department told reporters that the future France will be in a state of extremely perfect military preparedness. Although the compulsory military training system is limited by a small budget, the results have been very satisfactory since it was implemented in June. The pre-war system left those accustomed to civilian life unprepared, suddenly having to undergo a year of military training. The new system expands the training period to four years, and is greatly improved based on the lessons learned during the war, and maintains a close interweaving with civilian life, so that if war occurs again in the future, the people can fully help with combat. During World War II, regular troops could not stop the advance of German mechanized units, but guerrilla warfare could exert great effectiveness. If new atomic weapons are used in future wars, guerrilla warfare will have even broader applications. The new German military training system is divided into two phases: the first phase is three years of reserve military training, and all French youth between the ages of seventeen and twenty must be trained locally. In the first two years, the Army Department and the Ministry of Education jointly supervise and emphasize physical training. In the third year, the Army Department supervises independently, so that the training program is completely militarized. An examination is held at the end of the three-year initial training period to assess the results. The fourth year is the active military training period. Youths who have completed initial training are called up according to their grade level, and given physical and psychological tests based on the US Army military training system, and then, according to their results, are divided into classes and sent to military training centers for one year of training. In the first half of the year, basic training in common military science is given, and in the second half of the year, they are assigned to various special parts of the army, such as paratroopers, tanks, artillery, and supply units, for special training. After the training is completed, they are allowed to return to civilian life as reserves. Those with excellent results can enter military academies for further study. Those who are listed in the reserve series will be given refresher training every few years to ensure that they do not forget the military knowledge they have acquired and to instill the latest military knowledge.

### Overseas Chinese in Sumatra Massacred by Indonesians, Many Killed and Wounded as a Result of the Conflict

(2) Lyrics by Yi Junzu: "Congratulations on the sixtieth birthday, listen to a chorus of joyful respect; rejoice that auspicious clouds gather over China, the weather is favorable and the harvest is abundant; nine years of bloody war rely on leadership, the smoke of war in several places has completely dissipated; having experienced hardships, he single-handedly turned the tide, fulfilling the revolutionary mission of national revival; prioritizing democracy and the people, wishing for peaceful unification and a stable foundation for the nation; the implementation of the Great Constitution will pave a smooth road, the four powers will join the ranks and shine brightly; long live China and may it last for ten thousand years, the whole world celebrates."

### Longevity Peking Opera Performance; Exciting Program Today; Tickets Sold at Three Locations

The opening play will be Mei Lanfang and Xiao Changhua's "Su San Qi Jie." Mr. Mei has not performed this play for over ten years because he has not found a suitable clown character to match him. Now that Mr. Xiao Changhua, a senior Peking Opera actor from the Hua Society who is over seventy years old, has actually come south, he will perform his masterpiece "Qi Jie" again. The peony and the green leaves complement each other perfectly. Mr. Mei will not perform for many more years, and Mr. Xiao Changhua is already old, so this play may become a swan song. It is said that Mr. Mei's other masterpieces, such as "Tan Mu," "Cosmic Peak," "Rainbow Pass," "Life and Death Hatred," and "Phoenix Returns Home," will also be performed one after another.

### Liu Gen Vigorously Accuses His Grand-Disciple of Crimes; Jing'an Temple Had a Secret Organization; Ejecting Benevolent Monks; Ousting the Weak; Befriending the Japanese; Monks Dewu and Mijia Accused of Enmity

[Reported by This Newspaper] The case of Jing'an Temple Abbot Dewu and Supervisor Mijia, suspected of being traitors, was heard in the Second Criminal Court of the High Court at 9:30 AM yesterday. Many people attended the hearing, including thirty to forty monks, creating a unique scene with shaven heads filling the courtroom. The accusers, Liu Gen, Yang Xi, and Xie Xiqing, all appeared in court to testify, and the two defendants also argued. The hearing concluded at 12:15 PM. The court ordered that evidence still needs to be investigated, and adjourned for another hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.

Dewu testified: "I am 27 years old, a native of Shanghai. I became a monk at the age of seven. In July of the 30th year of the Republic, I inherited the abbotship because my master Zhiwen passed away. Liu Gen is my grand-master. I was dismissed by Qi Xieyuan and Han Guojun in the 12th year of the Republic. Yang Xi was the supervisor when my master was in charge. Later, because he filed a lawsuit against my master, the local court revoked his title as supervisor. Mijia was originally the abbot of the Baiyi Temple in Ningbo. He came to Shanghai to seek refuge and lived in Jing'an Temple. I invited him to be the supervisor. Xie Xixiang was originally the owner of the Shiguang Bookstore in front of Jing'an Temple. The rented house belonged to the temple property. Because of the construction of the mountain gate and because the contract had expired, I paid him a moving fee of 3 million yuan and did not renew the lease. This accusation may be due to a grudge."

Mijia was then brought to the court. His defense was mostly the same as Dewu's testimony.

Three Accusers Testify to Crimes

The court then questioned the accuser Liu Gen, who was wearing old monk robes. He testified: "I am 62 years old, a local. I entered Jing'an Temple at the age of nine. I was originally the abbot, but I stopped being the abbot in the 12th year of the Republic. When Mijia came in, he drove me out. Dewu is my grand-disciple." The court asked why he accused Mijia. He replied: "Because he is a traitor. Mijia served as the executive director of the puppet Buddhist Association, and also founded the Tongpeng Japanese Language School. He also drove out the old, weak, and young monks in the temple, and took out the Yue Fei, Amitabha, and other bodhisattvas to sell for money. There is also a secret organization in Jing'an Temple, equipped with telephones and alarms. Many Japanese and Japanese women come and go, with great fanfare. Mijia is good to the Japanese and harsh to his own people."

Yang Xi, also wearing old monk robes, testified: "I am 67 years old, from Anhui. I was previously the supervisor of Jing'an Temple. The reason for the accusation is that Dewu, Mijia, and others occupied the temple property and befriended Japanese merchants Fujii Shizui and Kinoshita Bankei, and jointly ran a Japanese language night school. They also used the power of the puppet Buddhist Association to oppress me and drive me out of the country, wanting to put me to death."

Xie Xiqing said: "I originally ran a bookstore. The reason for the accusation is that the defendants and Japanese monks jointly ran the Tongpeng Japanese Language Night School, which was registered with the enemy embassy. The textbooks were transported from Japan and the puppet Manchukuo. They also participated in the Greater East Asia Memorial Service, serving as preparatory committee members and chanting masters. There are photos of them with enemy officers after the event and newspaper records to prove it."

### Tour of the Longevity Hall: A Giant Red Satin Curtain Embroidered with Qilin, Zhou Bronze Tripods, Shang Ritual Vessels, and Jade Ruyi Scepters

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai community's celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday will be held today at the Ningbo Native Association. To commemorate the Chairman's birthday and to express gratitude for his great achievements, the Ningbo Native Association's auditorium will be renamed "Zhongzheng Hall" from today onwards. This "Zhongzheng Hall" will also become a historic venue, where representatives of Shanghai's four million citizens will gather today to offer their birthday wishes. The decorations of the Longevity Hall will undoubtedly attract everyone's attention.

The Longevity Hall, arranged by the Ningbo Native Association, was freshly painted the day before yesterday and fully decorated by yesterday afternoon. A tall red and green archway was erected at the entrance, and a golden banner reading "Shanghai Community's Celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Birthday" was hung in front of the second-floor balcony. Particularly eye-catching were the two large pillars wrapped in red silk on either side of the entrance. Upon entering the hall, one immediately felt enveloped in an atmosphere of joyous red. The walls and pillars were adorned with red and green cloth drapes, featuring national emblem patterns, longevity character patterns, and various other designs. Twenty lanterns of various styles were hung on the walls. Pink, light green, rose red, and light blue silk ribbons were suspended crisscross in the air. Amidst the colors filled with Chinese sentiment, every small decoration contained the meaning of "joy." On the main wall of the Longevity Platform hung a large red satin curtain presented to the Chairman, embroidered with qilin and flowers. On the two curtains on either side were embroidered goldfish. A neon light was placed in front of the curtain, with a red "寿" (longevity) character inside a large peach. Above the Longevity Table hung a crimson silk cloth with four golden characters: "萬壽無疆" (May you live ten thousand years).

The Longevity Table itself was quite interesting! It was entirely in the Ningbo style, magnificent and varied. The first row consisted of four tin implements: a candlestick and two incense stands, backed by a small, colorful neon archway about three feet high. On either side of the rectangular table were seven pairs of longevity candles, a Ningbo custom to wish for a seventieth birthday. The tin candle holders were also of various designs, featuring cranes, deer, harmony, and the five blessings encompassing longevity. Also arranged on the table was a jade ruyi scepter; and four plates of cakes, peaches, candles, and noodles, arranged like large cones. In addition, there were a pair of red congratulatory glass items, silver三星上壽 (Three Stars Bestowing Longevity), 八仙慶壽 (Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity), Zhou tripods, Shang tripods, yi (ritual vessel), he (ewer), and dui (covered bowl) bronze vessels. Six cups of longevity tea were filled with longan, black dates, and lotus seeds. In addition, there was also a pair of colorful flower longevity candles. The nine pairs of longevity candles on the platform today were prepared by the birthday celebration preparatory committee from various sectors. The largest pair of flower-decorated longevity candles weighed more than ten pounds and was donated by Yuan Fengshun Candle Shop.

Since the Ningbo Native Association's auditorium has been renamed "Zhongzheng Hall," the first item on today's birthday celebration program is the unveiling ceremony of "Zhongzheng Hall." The golden plaque was inscribed by Zhang Chuanbao, a seventy-year-old former Qing dynasty licentiate. Before the unveiling, the plaque was covered with a yellow and red silk curtain, and nine red and yellow ribbons were hung, ready for Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and six county elders (Tong Weibin of 鄞县, Qin Runqing of 慈谿, Li Yongshang of 鎮海, Sun He of 奉化, Zhang Jiezhou of 象山, and Zhu Zikui of 定海) to use for the unveiling. Among them, Mr. Tong Weibin is over eighty years old this year.

Last night, the Longevity Hall was brightly lit with lamps and candles during the warm-up celebration. (Photo by China News Agency)

### Cotton Merchants' Inventory: Less Than 100,000 Dan, Carding Industry Inventory Sufficient, Cotton Spinning and Refining Not Fully Reported

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Cotton Merchants' Association was ordered to investigate the cotton inventory of its members and completed the task yesterday. A total of 103 member companies registered with the association. The total registered cotton inventory was 90,987 dan and 11 jin. According to the person in charge of the association speaking to a reporter: this inventory is only a small fraction of what it was before the incident. It is said that the association has a total of 147 member companies. However, in recent months, 10% have applied to withdraw from the association, and the association is currently investigating the reasons for withdrawal. Another 20-30% are not engaged in the cotton business, and their operations are purely at a standstill. Most cotton merchants have weak capital and cannot withstand the oppression of high-interest loans. Furthermore, the purchase of domestic cotton is hindered by difficult transportation, and the price of cotton in the production areas is too high, making it difficult to transport. As for foreign cotton, purchases have stopped since the Central Bank stopped supplying foreign exchange in May of this year. Therefore, the cotton inventory in the hands of members is extremely limited. As domestic cotton enters the market, it is hoped that the government will assist in procurement to maintain textile raw materials and avoid wasting foreign exchange. The association has also recently investigated that in the local cotton carding industry, there are many merchants engaged in the raw cotton trade with considerable scale. Their cotton inventory is no less than that of the cotton merchants. Therefore, to take factual considerations into account, these merchants have been encouraged to join the association as members. It is reported that investigations have been completed, and the merchants intending to join include Longxing, Yuda, Jinshunxing, Xinyixing, Gongyixing, Qiao Xiaomao, Yuanlong, Xu Yongnian, and eight others.

Furthermore, the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District is processing the registration of cotton inventories from member factories. As of yesterday, only half have registered, totaling just over ten companies. It is planned to urge the rest to report within two or three days before submitting a report to Mayor Wu.

Mayor Wu stated that the production of domestic wheat in the provinces near Shanghai could be supplied to the city as much as possible. As for American wheat, 20,000 tons are expected to arrive soon. Before the arrival of American wheat, the flour industry should jointly maintain the status quo, factories should resume operations, and finished products should not increase in price. Then, the issue of price negotiation was discussed and it was decided that the manufacturers' selling price would be 19,700 yuan, plus a commodity tax of 300 yuan, for a total of 20,000 yuan per bag. The flour mills will directly deliver this flour to the Flour Trade Association for distribution to various finished product industries, allowing a transportation fee of 300 yuan and a profit of 200 yuan, for a total of 500 yuan, i.e. a distribution price of 20,500 yuan. Starting November 1st, distribution will be made according to the quantity applied for by each industry, with a daily distribution of 12,000 bags.

### Fuel Committee to Implement Adjusted Coal Prices Starting Tomorrow

The supply of coal in this city is vast. It is under the unified planning and distribution of the Shanghai Fuel Committee. The original prices were divided into three categories. Coal used by public utilities and government agencies adopted a subsidy method, subsidized by the authorities. Therefore, its distribution price was originally twice as low as that of coal used by factories. The bureau has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to adjust the distribution price of the above two types of coal, starting tomorrow, increasing it by one fold according to the original price. The distribution price of coal after adjustment is as follows.

(1) For public utilities, railways, military and public relief transportation, and power plants in other cities, 90,000 yuan per ton (Shanghai Electric Power Company 60,000 yuan per ton, Water Supply Company 65,000 yuan per ton, but water fees and lighterage fees are at their own expense).

### Market Demand Suddenly Increases, Gold Prices Rise by 50,000, Central Bank Supplies Without Limitation

Yesterday, the atmosphere was very vibrant, and demand was unusually strong. The opening price in the morning was around 2.285 million. After the opening, it rose from 2.281 million, and demand exceeded supply. Soon, it broke through the big barrier of 2.3 million and gradually improved. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at a price of 2.3325 million. After that, demand became even more intense. Even with supply, it did not have much impact, and the price rose to over 2.38 million. Therefore, the Central Bank issued an order for unlimited supply, and the price immediately fell. At noon, it struggled within 2.33 million. In the afternoon, people were still eager, and the next day's transactions rose back to over 2.34 million. As a result, it rose 52,000 compared to the previous closing price. Gold jewelry in silver shops rose to 2.48 million. Silver taels did not change. Silver dollars rose slightly. The informal short-term money market was slightly tighter, with informal interest rates standing at around 1.5%.

The price in the informal market was around 4,200 yuan, but it was inconvenient to move. In the end, it only rose slightly.

### Cotton Cloth Extremely Weak, Fine Yarn Continues to Rise by 50,000

[Report from Our Newspaper] The yarn market was extremely mediocre yesterday. The supply of ready-made Gan Branch Yarn was relatively abundant, but sales to customers were still sluggish, resulting in a general drop of 10,000 to 40,000 for each brand below the special Shuangma. However, the Daflying Boat Factory temporarily had no arrivals, and customers from Jiangxi were actively seeking it, which uniquely rose by 20,000. Ready-made 42-count yarn continued to rise by 50,000 with the additional distribution from weaving mills, while 32-count fine yarn turned flat.

The cloth market was even more depressed. The number of transactions was very few, and it was like a market closure. The Fangjian repeatedly opened, but few applicants. The finished products of private factories also piled up in considerable quantities. If the market does not improve, manufacturers will be forced to stop work to tide over the difficulties. Yesterday, Fangjian opened a fine cloth leader, losing 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan, but no one purchased it. This shows a glimpse of the market clearing. The spot price of fine cloth leaders was 15,000 yuan, and the opening price of color ball fine cloth was 79,000 yuan. The price of other cloths did not increase or decrease.

### Businesses Prohibited from Using Company Names, Business Registration Deadline Today, Violators Will Be Penalized

### Hua Stocks Once Improved, But Wavered Again Before Closing

Hua stocks were stimulated by news of settlements on delivery. The opening in the morning already showed a good scene. There was a scramble to buy after the opening, and the trading floor was unusually depleted. The price immediately rose. Retail investors were overly excited, and the price soon rose by nearly 5%. After the high point, it turned into a saw-toothed pattern. Banks slightly reduced their positions, but the market was unusually good. There was strong buying interest from outside the market, and there were many more increases. After 10:30 AM, it gradually became weak. Meiya first fell sharply. Yongs yarn and Xinhuo also took the opportunity to close. In the middle, Guang Bang and others withdrew and then re-entered. Although the price was low, there was a lot of consolidation. Later, it was heard that the Central Bank would supply unlimited amounts of gold, and people panicked again. Yongs yarn immediately scrambled to sell, retreating to within 710 yuan. Near noon, there was more panic, and it retreated into the big barrier of 700 yuan to end the day. Compared to the previous closing price, active stocks such as Yongs yarn, Xinhuo, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing rose slightly, while Meiya fell slightly. Except for Rongfeng Matches, Wuhe, and Jinglun, which fell slightly, all other cold stocks rose. There were even fewer transactions in the afternoon. There was more panic, so the demand slightly exceeded the supply. After consolidation, the situation was stable before closing, but it did not break free from the consolidation. In the end, compared to the previous closing price, active stocks such as Qinxing and Xinhuo each rose by half a percent. Yongs yarn, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang all rose slightly. Among the cold stocks, Gongsi, Jinglun, Wuhe, and Matches fell slightly, Zhongfang Underwear was flat, and the rest all rose slightly. The situation of each stock outside the market was stable.

### Invited by the Encouragement Society, the Huasheng Team Goes to Beijing

Two Matches, Fly Back to Tianjin on the 4th

The Tianjin Huasheng basketball team has completed its entire tour in Shanghai. It was originally planned to take a warship to return north immediately. As the warship has not departed recently, the team remains in Shanghai. It is now known that the team has accepted an invitation from the Nanjing Encouragement Society and is scheduled to take an express train to Beijing at 7:00 PM today, with two matches expected on the 2nd and 3rd of next month, and then take a plane from Beijing back to Tianjin on the 4th.

### Today's Birthday Celebration Football Match: Tung Wah vs. British Navy Showdown, 3:30 PM at Recreation Ground, Ticket Revenue to Benefit Chiang Kai-shek Scholarship

The Municipal Sports Association Football Committee, in celebration of its chairman's 60th birthday, has scheduled a celebratory football match for 3:30 PM today at the Recreation Ground. Tung Wah will face off against the British Navy team, which arrived in Shanghai the day before. Tickets, priced at 2,000 and 5,000 yuan, will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 1:30 PM. The referee will be Chen Jixiang, with He Chunhui and Wu Shouheng as linesmen. The revenue, after deducting necessary expenses, will be donated to the Chiang Kai-shek Scholarship.

Tung Wah's lineup was announced yesterday by team captain Jia Youliang. Zhang Banglun is participating in the Sixth Corps' campaign in Taiwan, and Huang Kehou is injured and unable to play. Liu Xianhan will take over as goalkeeper, and Li Ning has decided to come out of retirement to assist in defense. On the forward line, veterans Dai Linjing and Sun Jinshun will don their jerseys once again. The rest of the team will be the same as when they played against Longjie.

Although Tung Wah will be missing Banglun and Kehou today, the addition of Liu Xianhan in goal should compensate for the loss in defense. The return of veterans Sun Jinshun and Dai will not only prevent any weakening but will also provide a significant boost. Center forward A-zai, supported by inside forwards Sun Jinshun and Han Longhai, and wingers Li Yao and Jia Youliang, represents Tung Wah's ideal forward lineup, promising a strong offensive showing.

The British Navy team consists of elite players from the cruiser "HMS Dauntless" and the destroyer "HMS Comus," boasting formidable strength. The British Navy has always been highly regarded, and their match against Tung Wah promises to be evenly matched, with a captivating performance.

The lineups for both teams today are listed below:

### An Interview with the New President of Great China University, Mr. Yang Gongda

— Jiang Feng

One morning, amidst the autumn wind and rain, the reporter, carrying an umbrella, accompanied Mr. Jiang, the head of the Agricultural Economics Society of Great China University, to visit the new president, Mr. Yang Gongda. Under Mr. Jiang's guidance, we quickly arrived at the gate of President Yang's residence in Bajiaokutou.

After knocking on the door and entering, we found ourselves in an old-fashioned small Western-style house in a church, neatly decorated. Upon entering, President Yang's attendant hurried down from upstairs and invited us to sit down in a simple, undecorated reception room. The attendant informed us that President Yang was not feeling well and was resting in bed, but Mr. Jiang requested to see President Yang and asked the attendant to convey his intentions. The attendant then hurried upstairs again.

We sat quietly in the reception room for a while, staring blankly at the drizzling autumn rain outside the window.

A Kind Elder

After a long while, we heard footsteps on the stairs, and we saw President Yang, a man of imposing stature, slowly descending the stairs. President Yang was wearing a dark blue suit and a pair of thick glasses. My first impression was that he was a kind elder!

Mr. Jiang first requested that the school authorities negotiate with the Ministry of Education to resume enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics. President Yang expressed very sincerely, "Resuming enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics is not only the hope of the students in the Department of Agricultural Economics, but also the hope of all the students in the school, and even more so my hope. Since it is everyone's unanimous hope, from the perspective of the president, from the perspective of the school, and from the perspective of the Department of Agricultural Economics, we should resume enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics and should not allow a department with more than half of the students in the College of Agriculture to suddenly be interrupted. However, since we have already notified the examination areas to suspend enrollment, we must request an expansion of enrollment from the Ministry of Education. We will discuss this with the professors tomorrow and then make a decision. If possible, we can resume enrollment at the same time as the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences."

Because President Yang was suffering from some asthma and we saw that he was not feeling well, the reporter originally intended to leave without disturbing him further. However, President Yang spoke with the sincerity of a parent talking to his children about everyday matters, so we took the opportunity to raise the issue of building a new Great China University.

His Wife Cannot Endure Hardship

"Great China University is a school that was established during wartime and has the shortest history of all the universities in the country." President Yang quickly continued without hesitation, "Moreover, Jinhua is just too poor a place. These are unspeakable difficulties. For example, when inviting professors, the professor himself agrees to come, but his wife may not be able to endure the hardship, so she is afraid to come, and as a result, even the professor does not come. I have already mentioned this at the welcome tea party for the students who stayed at the school that day. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not yet open to traffic in Jinhua, and transportation is inconvenient, so no one is happy to come. Therefore, when I arrived in Shanghai, I managed to borrow money and buy a jeep. In the future, as soon as a professor arrives at Zhuji Station, as long as we are notified by the school, we can immediately send a jeep to pick him up. At the same time, I also hope to buy another large truck to pick up and drop off students and solve the students' transportation difficulties."

Although President Yang's voice was quite low, his enthusiasm for talking was even greater, leaving us with practically no room to interject.

Cooperate Towards New Life

"Therefore, I feel that if we want to run Great China University well in Jinhua, the most important thing is to improve the environment and gradually make it better. On the other hand, our students should also be aware of not being in a state of instability as in the past. We should cooperate to lead Great China University towards a new life."

After about thirty minutes, President Yang was still talking to us at length about school affairs when Dean Zhou of the College of Engineering of Great China University arrived. President Yang simply asked him to go upstairs and sit for a while, then sat down at the table and continued talking to us about many things at the school. However, we felt a little embarrassed, so Mr. Jiang repeated the request to resume enrollment in the Department of Agricultural Economics as a conclusion and hurriedly said goodbye and left.

Braving the rain and heading home, although it was still a misty autumn rain and wind and a little chilly, there was a pleasant and warm feeling in our hearts.

Spring and Autumn

### On "Modern Chinese Western Painting"

— Liu Shi

"Modern," a fashionable title, attached to Chinese Western painting, is really a bit inappropriate, isn't it? Western painting in Europe since the 20th century has already had two important stages. The first stage was Cézanne of Post-Impressionism, and the second stage was Picasso. The reason they are called "modern" is that Cézanne was used as a watershed, overturning all the old art theories of the past and truly creating a brand-new "modern spirit." Chinese Western painting is not like that. Looking at its history, the introduction of Western painting at the earliest was no more than during the Yuan Dynasty when Catholicism was introduced to China. However, at that time, no one studied or promoted it, so strictly speaking, it should be traced back to the Republic of China. In these short thirty years or so, coupled with the impact of political changes and wars, the entire art movement was unable to unfold. The so-called "Western painting" relied on Western goods for its tools, so in this World War, those engaged in research had no way to obtain them. Therefore, in today's post-war era, only a few sparks of Western painting remain. Occasionally, one or two exhibitions are seen, and no one dares to acknowledge their works as "modern" Western paintings, I think.

Western painting in the West has a long and brilliant history, and it has undergone several changes to achieve today's achievements. When our country just began to study and promote it, the canvas in Europe had already been occupied by fierce and huge beast groups, and the Cubists, Futurists, and Dadaists who followed were putting on wonderful programs. However, our few founding pioneers were still faithfully copying the illustrations published in old foreign magazines, until a few students who had cut their queues and returned from studying abroad understood the A.B.C. of Western painting. Only then did they abolish copying and engage in sketching. Soon after, Impressionism was also sold back, and nude sketching appeared on the canvas. Is Impressionism suitable for Chinese tastes? Or do Chinese students only understand Impressionism? Why has the fate of Impressionism lasted until today, the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China? Although there was an organization called the "Storm Society" in Shanghai around the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and modern Western painting was promoted by their flag-waving, it ultimately did not arouse the attention of the general public and became a flash in the pan. Therefore, according to the state of affairs described above, we may as well divide "Chinese Western painting" into several periods. From the beginning of the Republic of China to the tenth year of the Republic of China, it was the cradle period. From the tenth to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, it can be regarded as the pre-Impressionist period. From the fifteenth to the twentieth year, it was the heyday of Impressionism. From the twentieth to the twenty-sixth year, it was the budding period of "modern Chinese Western painting." From the twenty-sixth year to the present day, it can be called the restoration period of Impressionism. Therefore, in the strictest sense, it can be said that modern Chinese Western painting with a modern spirit has not yet been born and is awaiting the efforts of new writers.

### Nine Ruyi Picture

Congratulations to Chairman on His Sixtieth Birthday

### A Verse in Celebration of Chairman's Sixtieth Birthday

— Jiang Suhui

Heaven gave birth to an extraordinary man for the country, proving it with ancient examples; it's not a mysterious saying. The Chinese territory was fragmented and lost for nine years, but now the rivers and mountains are restored to us, carried on both shoulders. Pacifying the masses and vowing to wipe out the shame, he defeated the proud enemy and recovered the Central Plains. All nations look up in awe, and great powers dare not tarnish his reputation. Looking back, there are still worries to be addressed; floods and fires bring great calamities. He does not speak of personal pain or pleasure, people should regret not ceasing war. It is better to reward merit and promote virtue; all peoples cry out with joy. The sacred mountain gives birth to a sage on his sixtieth birthday, comforting his lonely heart after sleepless nights. He embraces all things, with the vastness of the sea; he nurtures young talents like the spring breeze. His righteous principles are widespread, his wise strategies are comparable to those of ancient sages. Who in the world can wield a great pen to praise his achievements in restoring the nation? If the jade tablets with his writings are found, they will shine like the sun in the sky. Separated by mud and ditches, it is fitting that I, an old rustic, offer my humble blessings. May the leader be healthy, the people prosperous, and may he live tens of thousands of years, like the sage emperors Yao!

### Turgenev's Green Words

I believe that for a thinking person, there is no desolate wilderness. At least I do my best not to let myself rust, grow moss, or become a straggler of the times.

I feel that if a person knows that he is poor and says it, his feelings must be special - there must be a kind of pride.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 78

— Ye Jingfeng

Seeing that this fellow's actions were not malicious, perhaps it was just a necessary procedure, I started the car and drove straight in. As I entered the passage, I suddenly had a realization and told myself, "This is the tiger's mouth!" Now that I've charged in, I don't know how I'll get out in the future. Thinking of this, my palms were a little clammy, and I felt a chill in my heart.

Just as I entered the passage, I suddenly heard someone shout loudly, "Slow down!" It was in Chinese. The shout echoed loudly in the tunnel, like thunder. As soon as I heard it, I slowed the car down. When I came out of the passage, I saw a soldier on the left waving his hand and saying in a rough voice, "Where are you going in such a hurry? Are your pants on fire?" He ordered us to turn left; in front of us was a steel mesh wall, and the parking lot was on the left, with walls and fences. I realized that the Japanese guard had told us to stop briefly so that this Northerner could open the fence to let us into the parking lot.

There were dozens of cars of various colors parked in the parking lot, arranged by category. As I parked, my younger brother and I paid close attention to our surroundings. Apart from the Northerner, there wasn't a single ghost in sight. The plaza was large and quiet. After seeing us enter the parking lot with the truck, the Northerner probably thought we were nothing more than low-ranking non-commissioned officers, so he didn't pay much attention to us. He immediately went to sit on a bamboo chair by the wall and began reading a tattered book.

"You've worked hard!" As we sized up our surroundings and walked up to the Northerner, he didn't bother to look up and simply grunted out the words. He probably said the same thing to every service member he encountered.

"You've worked hard too, everyone's working hard!" I lowered my voice. "Excuse me, is Chairman Chiang here? ... I came from the city to report an incident ...!" This was something I had prepared beforehand, and I only dared to ask because I saw that this fellow was easy to deal with. (In Tongzhou, those who work for the puppet government call Yin Ni "Chairman.")

"Alright, alright!" He really didn't want to put down that tattered book. "Go take a break, brothers. Do you think the Commander is up so early? ... He just went to bed!" He didn't take his eyes off the book, and he seemed annoyed that we were disturbing him.

"The Case of Peng Gong ... hee hee!" My younger brother winked at me. People from the north generally like to read stories like The Case of Shi Gong and The Case of Peng Gong, which emphasize chivalry.

"One doesn't grow wiser without experiencing something," I thought to myself. "This saying has now been proven in reality. When I listened to Sister Cui and her mother, I thought of this den of devils as a dragon's pool and tiger's lair, so I planned and prepared carefully before setting out. I was even prepared to risk my life, but who knew that the situation inside was so ordinary? It's clear that everyone needs some adventurous spirit in order not to be deceived by propaganda, to take charge of things practically, and to actually gain some experience." Thinking of this, I found our actions to be rather ridiculous.

As I was thinking this, I also heard my younger brother's hint, and I decided to start here and do some small trading. This fellow told us to go take a break, but we didn't know where to go to take a break. Therefore, we sat down next to him. Here, I took out my magic weapon.

"I rushed here in a hurry and forgot to bring cigarettes. Younger brother, do you have any?" As I spoke, I took out a roll of "military scrip" popular in the city and started counting it. I glanced sideways, and the fellow's eyes were gradually moving; from the book to the "scrip," from the "scrip" to my hand, slowly to my arm, and finally to my face. This was a soft tense situation, and it depended on his expression at this moment.

### Longevity

— Shao Fu

Today is Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday. As long as they love the country and the nation, there is probably no Chinese person who is not happy and excited. Because our Chairman's relationship to the rise and fall of our country and nation is too great. In other words, the fate of the Chinese nation for the past thirty years has been tied to his person.

We sing praises, we pray, and apart from celebrating and commemorating with the way of offering to the school, every Chinese should also seriously examine their own life and behavior to see if they are worthy of the country and nation. If they are not worthy of the country and nation, then they are not worthy to wish the Chairman a long life.

Chairman has worked hard for the country for forty years, and the affairs of the country are still so chaotic. Today, we should especially feel ashamed!

### Life of the Leader

— Jifeng

Northern Expedition * Marriage * Ordeal * War of Resistance

"The survival of the party and the country, the success or failure of the doctrine, the happiness or misfortune of the people, and the honor or disgrace of our comrades, depend on this battle!" On July 9, 1926, at the small school field in Guangzhou, Chairman Chiang read the oath of the Northern Expedition. Mr. Wu Zhihui presented the Chairman with a large birthday character for "Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army." From then on, Chairman Chiang inherited the unfinished legacy of the Founding Father and took on the heavy responsibility of revolution and nation-building - it has been twenty years now!

During the Northern Expedition, a foreign reporter went to visit Chairman Chiang and inquire about the accomplishments of his life. The Chairman only wrote down a few short words on paper: "Born in Zhejiang Province, studied at Baoding Military Academy and a school in Japan, followed Sun Yat-sen during the revolution."

On December 1, 1927, he married Ms. Soong Mei-ling in Shanghai. The wedding took place at the Great China Hotel, with Yu Rizhang as the officiant and Tan Yankai, He Xiangning, and Wang Zhengting as the introducers. At that time, the Chairman was forty years old and the Madame was twenty-five years old. The Chairman also wrote an article titled "Our Today" and published it in the Shen Bao that day, in which he said:

"Today I am marrying Ms. Soong Mei-ling, whom I most respect and love, is the most glorious day of my life, and also the happiest day of my life. ... I firmly believe that after my marriage to Ms. Soong, my revolutionary work will definitely improve. I can be at ease in fulfilling my revolutionary responsibilities, starting from today!"

The National Revolutionary Army entered Beiping, and the Chairman wrote in the "Memorial to the Premier": "I have long been determined to devote myself to the Party and the country until death. I never expected that after surviving hundreds of battles, I would still be able to pay my respects at the Premier's memorial hall. From now on, the rest of my life will be a year of struggle. I will exert all my strength and be loyal. Success or failure is not what I care about!"

On the Lantern Festival of the twenty-third year, the Chairman convened the "New Life Movement Conference" in Nanchang, with 150,000 people attending, accounting for three-quarters of the population of Nanchang. As the Chairman was speaking, a photographer who was listless and wearing dirty clothes wanted to take some photos. The Chairman immediately pointed to the photographer and said to the audience: "This person's appearance and attitude are a complete old life and do not meet the conditions of the new life at all. I hope everyone will pay attention in the future and not be like him!" The photographer was so ashamed that he ran away.

After the Chairman escaped danger in Xi'an, a villager named Liu sent the 4,200 coins he had saved to the Chairman through a newspaper office in Nanjing, and attached a letter saying: "Please, Chairman, buy some longans to eat."

"Since we are a weak country, if we reach the final moment and have to sacrifice the lives of the entire nation in order to seek the survival of the country, then we will not be allowed to compromise halfway!

When the final moment arrives, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end; only with the determination to sacrifice to the end can we win the final victory!" This was a historically significant speech given by the Chairman at Mount Lu after the July 7th Incident. Sure enough, after eight years of hard fighting, the final victory was won! Today, as the whole country congratulates the Chairman on his sixtieth birthday, we respectfully wish the Chairman good health!

### The Statue of Liberty

— Lan Ning

Celebrating its 60th Anniversary in New York

On Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor, USA, stands a strikingly tall statue of a goddess, draped in a classical Greek robe. She holds a book in her left hand and raises a torch in her right, welcoming incoming ships and emitting guiding light in the darkness.

This is the world-renowned Statue of Liberty, not only the largest copper statue in the world but also a symbol of "freedom" in the world today. The day before yesterday (the 28th) was its 60th anniversary.

However, when the French first initiated the idea of building the statue and gifting it to the New World in Paris, they faced various difficulties and spent several years on the project. Funds were raised household by household. In 1865, a number of artists and politicians gathered near Versailles, recognizing that the peoples of France and America had shed blood for a common goal, they wanted to take advantage of the centennial of the American Revolution to build a memorial statue, commemorating the truth of their shared struggle. Therefore, the famous sculptor Bartholdi was sent to the United States to seek inspiration for the design.

As soon as he entered New York Harbor, the impression of "freedom" arose in his mind. This was a vast city, with rivers extending into the distance, beyond sight. The broad harbor was an inner sea crowded with ships. This was where the giant statue should stand. So Bartholdi returned to France with a plan: the French would create the statue, and the Americans would build the pedestal.

The Franco-Prussian War hindered the progress of the plan, but even after France's defeat, donations poured in, aiming for $450,000. Formal work only began in 1881.

Bartholdi decided to cast the statue of the goddess using copper sheets, dividing it into several sections for easy transportation. These copper pieces were assembled on an iron framework, hollow inside, with staircases accessible throughout.

But strangely, the American side was slow to proceed. Raising the $350,000 needed to build the statue's base proved difficult, collected bit by bit. By June 1885, when the completed Statue of Liberty arrived in New York Harbor aboard the French warship Isère, the funds for the granite pedestal were still $100,000 short, and it was already the seventh year of fundraising. As a result, Bartholdi's masterpiece could only be temporarily stored in the basement of an empty warehouse. If not for the support of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the New York World, it might have remained hidden indefinitely.

Pulitzer vigorously promoted the statue in his news reports and editorials, portraying it as a symbol of freedom. Within five months, the newspaper received contributions from 120,000 people across the United States, in amounts ranging from pennies to dollars.

The magnificent and solemn Statue of Liberty, 151 feet tall and weighing 225 tons, was finally unveiled on October 28, 1886. Participants in the ceremony paraded from Broadway towards the harbor. A fleet of ships carried representatives from various countries to observe the event. President Cleveland also attended aboard the warship Dispatch. Brilliant fireworks were displayed at night.

Now, the Statue of Liberty bears a new American imprint. Carved into its cornerstone is a sonnet by Emma Lazarus, "The New Colossus," which, through the voice of the goddess, extends a welcoming invitation to the exiles of the Old World:

Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!

Initially, the torch in the Statue of Liberty's hand did not have light. Years later, the copper was replaced with glass, and lights were placed inside. In 1916, the New York World raised money to replace it with permanent, powerful lights. Mr. Bourlier then refitted the glass lampshade with red amber. After the victory in the European war, the torch was equipped with the brightest mercury lamps, bathing the Statue of Liberty in bright and dazzling colors.

Every year, 800,000 travelers come to admire it and climb inside. The crown on her head is decorated with a circle of small windows, from which visitors can enjoy a panoramic view.

Bartholdi's masterpiece, the result of ten years of painstaking effort, has achieved invaluable success. Today, millions of people who love freedom have come to see it as a symbol of freedom.

### Remembering Mr. Huang Xing

— Hui Ye

"Ten thousand brave soldiers gallop across the land, how can they bear to stand their horses in Youyan? Where do the barbarian slaves linger? In the setting sun, the felt tents are lost, and the beacon fires extinguish the remaining smoke. Recover the golden goblet and return it to the Han descendants, to see again the days of Shun and Yao! The five-colored national flag is most solemn, fluttering with the bright moon, soaring into the white clouds."

This慷慨激昂"Linjiang Xian"臨江仙慷慨激昂, full of righteous indignation, comes from the pen of the revolutionary martyr Mr. Huang Xing. The writing reflects the man, capturing the general's loyalty and uninhibited spirit, vividly on paper.

Those who have read history can eloquently praise his life's deeds. But, do you remember? Today marks the 30th anniversary of Mr. Huang Xing's death!

Thirty years ago today, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, and the revolution had achieved initial success. People were eager to promote a republic and believed that they could finally live and work in peace. But who knew that warlords would rise, vying for territory and power, creating internal strife and years of war? The people were destitute, and the country remained on the brink of division! Mr. Huang Xing, seeing that the revolutionary achievements gained by his comrades' heads and blood were disintegrating, how could he not feel grief and indignation? On October 31st, 1916, in Shanghai, while discussing the current situation with friends, he became increasingly agitated and angry, eventually coughing up blood. That is how Mr. Huang Xing died.

What about today, thirty years later? Japan has been defeated, and the country has achieved victory, eager to promote constitutional government. People were eager to promote a republic and believed that they could finally live and work in peace. But who knew it would turn out this way? The people are destitute, and the country is on the brink of division! The victory achieved by the soldiers' heads and blood is disintegrating. If Mr. Huang Xing were still alive today, he would surely die of anger too!

How can the Chinese people face their martyrs?

### Congratulations to President Chiang on His Sixtieth Birthday

— Cheng Tingxuan

This article was written at the request of the Nanjing Special City Party Department to pay tribute on behalf of the party members. Therefore, the author noted that "Director-General" is used wherever President Chiang's name appears in the article.

Majestic mountains and beautiful waters, spiritual clock Wuling Township; auspicious bow hangs, light is covered with the appearance of Yinghuan. October 31, 1946, is actually the 60th birthday of Chiang Kai-shek, Director-General of the Chinese Kuomintang. Xiang Zheng'er is smooth, and the sound of joy moves the heart. Qingdao Tongwang's sincerity and white pheasant should be the tribute of Yuechang. The Nanjing Special Municipal Party Department respects humility and strives to reduce complexity. Therefore, we meet with comrades and collect signatures. Use to show respect and wish difficult old age. It is polite too.

The Director-General is born holy, and his consciousness comes before others. At the age of弱冠weak crown, he learned from the enemy of thousands of people. Standing for the great ambition of resisting foreigners, he did not betray his teacher; he swore to repay the country's精忠loyalty, and he showed the teaching of his mother.

### Chairman's Personally Drafted and Explained Youth Code

First, "Loyalty and Courage are the Foundation of Patriotism." To love our country and save our country, we must first cultivate a spirit and virtue of loyalty and courage. At the same time, our loyalty and courage must be used to love our country, to save our country, and must be for the public good and not for private gain, for others and not for ourselves. Therefore, the true meaning of loyalty and courage is what the ancients called "serving the country with utmost loyalty," "sacrificing oneself for righteousness," "being selfless in public affairs and forgetting one's family for the sake of the country," and "being brave in public battles and timid in private quarrels."

Second, "Filial Piety and Obedience are the Foundation of Managing the Family." To make our family harmonious, with order and reason from top to bottom, and united as one, creating a peaceful and happy family, we must start with filial piety to our parents. Because we must fulfill our filial duties, then there will be distinction between elders and juniors, and order between young and old. Only then can family matters be handled properly and reasonably, and can be carried forward and promoted.

Third, "Benevolence and Love are the Foundation of Dealing with Others." "Dealing with others" includes both interpersonal relations and handling matters. Our standard for dealing with others is "benevolence and love," which is what the ancients called "benevolent to the people and loving to all things." We must love our compatriots, love our friends, and even love all of humanity and all things in the universe, as it is said, "The people are my compatriots, and all things are my companions," "Heaven and earth are born together with me, and all things are one with me." This is the spirit of benevolence and love. If we treat people, handle affairs, and use things with this great spirit, we will surely be loved and helped by others everywhere, and make the best use of things. In this way, even if we make only a small effort, we can achieve at least ten times the result. All the forces that love us can be transformed into our strength, and can even multiply our strength countless times.

Fourth, "Trustworthiness and Righteousness are the Foundation of Establishing a Career." If we want to achieve something, we must gain the trust and help of others. To gain the trust and help of others, we must first have trustworthiness and righteousness ourselves. In dealing with people, we must first demonstrate our faith and morality in our actions, so that people believe in us. This cannot be achieved by those who are unfaithful, unrighteous, selfish, and cowardly. We must first have loyalty and faith, and then others will believe in us, and we can succeed in our careers.

Fifth, "Peace is the Foundation of Conducting Oneself in the World." "Peace" refers to the relationship between people; "harmony" means loving each other and not having jealousy, suspicion, scolding, fighting, or even killing each other. "Equality" means being fair to each other and not having encroachment, contention, bullying, partiality, or harming others for one's own benefit. We must be fair in order to be loving; we must have peace in order to conduct ourselves in the world. Individuals in society should treat others with peace. All our compatriots should love each other. We should rather suffer losses ourselves than take advantage of others. We must understand that those who uphold justice and maintain peace will surely achieve ultimate success. Those who suffer small losses now will eventually gain advantages; those who take small advantages now will eventually suffer great losses. All our compatriots must understand this principle and live together in peace. Our first step is to realize lasting peace throughout the entire country and create the most peaceful country. The second step is to contribute our Chinese peace to the world and realize universal peace throughout the world. Peace is an inherent virtue of our China, and we always advocate peace. However, in order to maintain the survival of our country and the survival of our nation, we must of course have the ability and determination to defend ourselves. If foreigners want to invade us and oppress us, it is they who are destroying peace and disrupting peace. We must resist and fight for the sake of upholding justice and strive for lasting peace. Therefore, when all peaceful means have been exhausted and peace is hopeless, we can only and must seek ways to achieve independence, self-preservation, and consolidate peace in addition to peaceful means.

Sixth, "Etiquette is the Foundation of Managing Affairs." This means that we must pay attention to etiquette in order to handle things well. Because without etiquette, there will be no order in society and human affairs, nor can there be stability. Human relations will be even more chaotic, and nothing can be done. The ancients said, "Etiquette is reason!" This means that we must be organized, disciplined, and have a normal and reasonable attitude and rules in our conduct and work. We must pay attention to etiquette at all times and in all places in order to be a person and do things. Otherwise, we cannot be a person, let alone handle affairs. Therefore, it is said, "Without knowledge of etiquette, there is no way to stand." "Etiquette is the management of affairs. A gentleman who has a task must have its management; without etiquette, hands and feet will have nowhere to place, eyes and ears will have nothing to add, advances and retreats, bows and concessions will have no control, hunting and military affairs will lose their strategies, and military expeditions and martial arts will lose their systems."

Seventh, "Obedience is the Foundation of Responsibility." If we want to make our country strong, all citizens must be able to take responsibility and work together. How can we take on this responsibility and how can everyone's work be more effective? The most important thing is that in terms of horizontal relationships, we must divide labor and cooperate with each other; in terms of vertical relationships, we must have hierarchical control. The reason why everything in our country cannot be done well and the country has been brought to such a critical state of survival is because people only know how to fight for power and profit, and are unwilling to take responsibility and do their duty. Everyone wants to talk about freedom and equality, and as a result, the country and nation will perish. They do not understand that modern citizens should sacrifice their own freedom and equality in order to seek the freedom and equality of the entire country. In the future, if we want to save the country, everyone must take responsibility, and the fundamental premise of responsibility is that everyone must sacrifice their personal freedom and equality, obey the government, obey the law, and obey their superiors in order to fulfill their duties. The government is the organ of the country, the law is the will of the country, and the superior is the representative of the government. Therefore, our obedience to our superiors is not obedience to an individual, but obedience to the orders they issue in accordance with the laws of the country. In short, our obedience is obedience to the country, obedience to our duties, which is obedience to our own responsibility. Because the country is my own and the duty is also my own, such obedience is also obedience to myself. If I can obey myself, this is called "self-discipline." All those who can practice self-discipline will succeed. Therefore, we obey for the sake of the country, not for the sake of any individual, let alone for the sake of private individuals. Therefore, this kind of obedience is glorious, not shameful. Only in this way can we truly obey, truly take responsibility, and be worthy of being a modern citizen!

Eighth, "Diligence and Frugality are the Foundation of Service." We ourselves are part of society and the country, so serving society and the country is serving ourselves. I am for everyone, and everyone is for me. This is the first principle of self-help and sociability. Only in this way can life have meaning and value. Where should we start serving society and the country? It is to be diligent and frugal. We must be diligent in order to make contributions; we must be frugal in order to have self-control and avoid consumption. In the first aspect, our goal of diligence and frugality must be to serve the people. Therefore, if frugality is for private gain and not for the public good, like those people who "rise at cockcrow and work diligently for profit," this kind of diligence and frugality is of no benefit to the country or the people, and is not true frugality. We must understand that living in modern times, without the entire society, the entire nation, and the entire country, there will be no one person who can be warm when everyone else is hungry and cold, and no one person who can be at peace when everyone else is in distress. Therefore, we must establish the ambition of "worrying before others and enjoying after others" and develop the spirit of labor and service. To establish others is to establish ourselves, and to save others is to save ourselves.

Ninth, "Cleanliness is the Foundation of Cultivating Oneself." "Cultivating oneself" refers to the cultivation of both the inner mind and the body. To cultivate ourselves, we must start with cleanliness. We must be dedicated, pure, and unified inwardly, with a clear mind; outwardly, we must be orderly, solemn, clean, and bright. Extending this to the things around us and the environment in which we live, we must make them so, and then we can be strong and healthy, have noble character, and have clear minds. Most people do not know the importance of cleanliness. Even like the famous scholars of the past, they claimed to be unrestrained and called it elegance to be unclean. We should eradicate and wash away this bad habit and shame. However, what I mean by cleanliness is to be simple and unadorned, which is absolutely different from luxury and beauty.

Tenth, "Helping Others is the Foundation of Happiness." As human beings, we all want to be happy, but if we seek happiness in the wrong way, we will seek pain and create evil. For example, most people now think that leisure and play, gambling, and idleness are happiness. They do not know that these things are not only not happiness, but also waste our energy, destroy our lives, and increase our sins and sufferings. They do not know that the greatest happiness in the human heart is helping others. The ancients said, "The more one does for others, the more one has; the more one gives to others, the more one has." It is also said, "Doing good is the greatest joy." This means that the more we can help others, the more benefits we will have, and the happier we will be. The Boy Scouts have a motto, "Do a good deed every day," which is to help others. For example, rescuing the drowning, fighting fires, helping the elderly, protecting the young, and helping the poor, hungry, sick, and distressed are all good deeds, no matter how small. Doing good can bring true happiness. All compatriots of the Republic of China should seek happiness in this way, love each other, and help each other. As long as we have a little strength, we must do our best to help our compatriots. This is the greatest happiness.

Eleventh, "Knowledge is the Foundation of Benefiting the World." This sentence means, on the one hand, that we must have knowledge and ability in order to benefit the world and save the people. This is what President Sun Yat-sen meant when he said, "The foundation of revolution lies in profound knowledge." On the other hand, it means that the purpose of our studying all knowledge and skills is to benefit the world and save people, not to be aimless and meaningless, not to seek personal comfort and security, and even less to use knowledge and technology to harm others for our own benefit, or to commit evil deeds.

Twelfth, "Perseverance is the Foundation of Success." We all hope that we can succeed in establishing a career. What is the most important condition for success? It is perseverance. Whatever we do, we must continue to work hard and not give up halfway or be fickle. We must have a beginning and an end, and carry through to the end. Especially if we want to succeed in a lifelong endeavor, we must choose a bright and righteous path, work hard to move forward, and never change until death, so as to achieve the last two sentences of President Sun Yat-sen's last will: "With one heart and one mind, carry through to the end."

### Longevity Commemorative Album Now Presented to the Capital by Special Envoy

[Report from this newspaper] Today is Chairman Chiang's sixtieth birthday, and the whole country celebrates and the world rejoices. Although all sectors of Shanghai are enthusiastically holding various celebration programs, they are not enough to repay our hard-working and meritorious Chairman, but only express the respect of the four million citizens for the Chairman.

The Chairman advocates frugality and has repeatedly instructed all parties not to be extravagant. Therefore, all sectors of this city have launched various constructive undertakings, the meaning of which is profound. In addition to donating schools to celebrate his birthday and establishing various scholarships, Shanghai has also prepared a commemorative album to present to the Chairman.

This album is 12.5 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 4 inches thick. It was organized by the design group of the Preparatory Committee, and Dr. Pang Jingzhou made his best efforts. The cover and back cover of the commemorative album are mounted with brocade silk. The cover is inscribed by Wu Jingheng, a veteran of the Kuomintang, "Shanghai Citizens' Congratulatory Commemorative Album for Chairman Chiang's Sixtieth Birthday." The inside is all mounted with white silk paper, with a total of 102 pages. The front is entirely pasted with yellow paper, with each page divided into eight squares, on which are written the names of 802 units of groups and institutions in the city, with the City Council listed first. The back is entirely mounted with 70 Chinese paintings, each two feet wide, all masterpieces by famous Shanghai painters. The order is not specified, only the landscapes are slightly separated, but the first painting is by the famous painter Yao Yuqin, because he is 80 years old this year, the oldest of the painters. This is a painting of orchids, titled "The Fragrance of the King."

In recent days, people have been signing their names at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Many citizens have requested to sign their names, but because it is stipulated that each institution is represented by its responsible person, they have all retreated in disappointment. This commemorative album is scheduled to be presented to the Chairman in the capital today by a special envoy.

### Chiang Chung-cheng Science Scholarship Total Fund of 300 Million Yuan Donated by Youth League Members

[Report from this newspaper] In order to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League decided the other day, through the Central League Headquarters, to establish the Chiang Chung-cheng Science Scholarship and the Chiang Chung-cheng Library to show their respect and congratulations. The science scholarship is expected to have a fund of 300 million yuan, and the library is expected to have a fund of 200 million yuan. The Central League Headquarters designated the Shanghai Branch to be responsible for raising 20 million yuan. According to the person in charge of the trial group speaking to reporters: The fund will be donated entirely by League members and will not be raised from the outside world. The members with occupations are launching a donation drive for the two days' income, and they said that the members are donating enthusiastically and will exceed the expected amount.

### Chiang Kai-shek's Educational Thought

— Compiled by this newspaper's data room

Educational Theory

Those who run education, if they see that education is not effective, there is no second word, that is, will is the most important. If we want to achieve the purpose of learning, there is no other way, that is, to see if the will can be consistent. — April 7, year 14, instruction to students of the third class of the military academy.

Morality, Physique and Science In the future, educational facilities must follow the regulations of the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation policy, and pay special attention to the cultivation of inherent morality, the training of strong physique, and the infusion of modern science. — May 17, year 20, speech at the closing ceremony of the National Assembly.

Being a Person Originally, the highest purpose of education is to enable the educated to be good citizens and good people. If a student does not know how to love the country and does not know the principles of being a person, the effect of education is equal to zero. Therefore, the first key point of our saving the country now is to pay attention to education, and even more to training, to pay attention to making students know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. This is an important point in revitalizing the nation and saving the country. — October 31, year 21, speech at the enlarged memorial week in Changsha Zhongshan Memorial Hall.

Teaching and Nurturing The education in our schools now cannot only be teaching, but also nurturing. We must combine teaching and nurturing. What is called education now is teaching without nurturing, which is not complete education. I think the components of education are one-third teaching and two-thirds nurturing. — Ibid.

These two words "education," most people only know that it is one thing, and the result is either "teaching without nurturing" or "nurturing without teaching." They do not know that these two words "teaching" and "nurturing" are completely two things, and we must pay attention to both of them and do both well in order to be considered "education." What does it mean to be "teaching"? Teaching is to teach our subordinates or students to know the principles of being a person and the methods of succeeding in a career, so that they can succeed as a person. What are the principles of being a person? How can we teach them to succeed as a person? The most important thing in the spirit of being a person is what I said, "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" is a spirit that we teach. We must make the educated understand etiquette, respect morality, pay attention to integrity, and know shame in order to know the principles of being a person and to truly be a person. As for what is called "nurturing"? Nurturing is to raise, and the meaning of raising is to protect and nurture. Specifically, it is to give them the necessities of life and to teach them the basic ways of life, that is, the four major things of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. — September 10, year 22, speech at the Lushan Military Officers' Corps.

Just "nurturing" is not enough, we must have "teaching," and "teaching" must come before "nurturing." The subjects of teaching are propriety, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic; the basic elements of teaching are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. — September 20, year 22, speech to the training class for cooperative personnel in Xingzi County.

Understanding the Times and Understanding Our Country The transmission of knowledge and skills is only a part of the function of education. We must instill in them the spirit of loving the country, loving the nation, and loving our compatriots, charge them with the responsibility of bearing the rise and fall of the nation and completing the national revolution, and teach them to understand the times, understand our country, face the world squarely, and have a long-term vision for the future. — February 20, year 29, telegram encouraging teachers at all levels at the beginning of the semester after the winter vacation.

Three Elements of the Country Education, economy, and military force are the three elements that constitute the vitality of a modern country, and education is the key to them. — October 31, year 29, inaugural anniversary instruction of Chung Cheng University.

Being Loyal to the Country The first step in the purpose of our teaching is naturally to teach them to be a true person in the world. The second step is to become a good citizen of the Republic of China, able to love the country and be loyal to the country. Specifically, it is to make every student have a deep sense of national concept and a deep sense of national consciousness; they will never learn to be foreigners, nor will they ever be foreign slaves or traitors, but will be able to actively sacrifice themselves to love the country and protect the nation. — May 19, year 24, instruction to faculty and students of schools above the secondary level in Kunming.

Benefiting the World The purpose and effect of our learning can be said to be the four words "benefiting the world and pacifying the people," which is what the ancients called "benefiting the world." — Ibid.

Educational Policy

Construction Now the National Revolution has not yet been completely successful, but the period of destruction has passed. If we use destructive means again, like the previous revolution, the result will be failure. Therefore, the first thing we must pay attention to when running education now is construction.

Strictness The only way to save China now is through education, and the only policy of education is the word "strictness." — April 16, year 20, speech at Zhejiang University.

New Academic Style The future of the country will all start from education. The first step is to completely change the academic style and succeed in creating a truly revolutionary new academic style, an academic style that saves the country. — October 10, year 21, instruction to faculty and staff of Wuhan University.

Inherent Culture If we want to build a country, we must first build our own culture; if we want to build China's own culture, we do not need to build it all at once in China. As long as we can truly restore our inherent national culture and use it with the spirit of the new era, it will be enough. — September 20, year 22, speech to the training class for cooperative personnel in Xingzi County.

Education of Action In the future, education in our country must correct all the past accumulated habits of emptiness, impracticality, decadence, and looseness, and create a lively, progressive, strong, united, and action-oriented atmosphere. Only in this way can it be considered education of action, can it enrich the vitality of the country, and achieve the purpose of saving the country through education. — May 19, year 24, instruction to faculty and students of schools above the secondary level in Kunming.

Making the Best Use of People The way to establish a country is nothing more than the four major principles shown by President Sun Yat-sen: "Making the best use of people's talents, making the best use of the land's benefits, making the best use of things, and making the flow of goods smooth." In terms of its fundamentals, it lies in "making the best use of people's talents." If we want to "make the best use of people's talents," the fundamental thing is the perfection of education. — June 9, year 24, instruction to the educational circles summoned in the Chengdu Xingyuan.

Cultivating All Six Arts Ancient education in our country was originally a combination of literature and military affairs, and a combination of skills and virtue. Now, in general, it is believed that literary schools only talk about literature and art, and do not talk about martial arts. This is completely wrong. In the future, school education should still be based on the ancient spirit of combining literature and military affairs and the principle of cultivating all six arts. However, the content of education should be more enriched. — June 17, year 24, purchase during the third enlarged memorial week in Chengdu.

Qualitative Improvement In the future, if we want to develop education, on the one hand, we must try to popularize it in order to increase the quantity; but on the other hand, we must especially strive for qualitative improvement in order to progress. In terms of our current strength and factual needs, we should first seek qualitative improvement in education, and the expansion of quantity is secondary. — May 10, year 25, opening instruction of the Executive Yuan meeting.

Teacher Issues

Do it Yourself First You must first do what you teach others yourself. If you do not care whether you can do it yourself, but only ask others to do it, this is deceiving yourself. — Speech at the Huangpu Military Academy in year 13.

Revolutionize Yourself Those who engage in education must revolutionize themselves every day in order to make the students good. And it is easy to make the students risk fire, and they will risk fire; order them to go to the water, and they will go to the water; only then can good results be obtained. — Speech in Huangpu on May 3, year 15.

Do Not Use Students We must rectify education and save the academic style in the future. The most important thing is that faculty and staff must be clean and self-loving. They must teach students to be people, and not use students as tools. — Speech at the enlarged memorial week in Changsha Zhongshan Memorial Hall on November 7, year 21.

Practical Life The education in our country in recent decades has focused on the transmission of knowledge and skills, but has paid little attention to the rectification of the lives of the educators themselves and the guidance of the actual lives of the educated. The things taught and learned are almost unrelated to practical life, or are completely out of touch. — Speech at the reception of the participants of the Third National Education Conference on March 5, year 28.

Guiding Ideology Teachers should resolutely shoulder the responsibility of guiding students' thoughts, cultivating students' character, managing students' lives, exercising students' physical strength, and perfecting students' personality. — Telegram encouraging teachers at all levels on February 20, year 29.

The Responsibility of the Educational Circles If we in the educational circles have the courage, the spirit, the responsibility, and the duty to reform the declining atmosphere and change the temperament, so that the general social youth can follow the trend and be influenced by us, and work together for the country and the nation, then our Three People's Principles can be fully realized and the cause of nation-building can be greatly successful. — Instruction to the national cadre work conference of the Three People's Principles Youth League on July 2, year 30.

Sacred Cause The education cause is a sacred cause, that is, the cause of sages and virtuous men. Only sages and virtuous men can influence others, so that the generally educated can follow the right path and develop completely, so as to reach the ultimate of the sage's and virtuous men's achievements. Ibid.

Training Issues

The greatest point of personally studying the purpose of education is to hope that the educators themselves will study and manage themselves in order to make progress, and not to rely on the educators to supervise. Otherwise, the result of education will definitely not be good. If the educated do not understand this point, do not study themselves, and do not seek progress, and must be supervised and managed by the educators, then they cannot be independent, cannot be strong, and cannot be autonomous. — Speech in Huangpu on January 13, year 15.

To Influence with Personality To teach people, we must first teach them the principles of being a person, which can also be said to enable them to determine their outlook on life. Only in this way can it be considered education, only in this way can we train healthy young citizens, only in this way can we prevent students from being romantic and indulgent, and from doing things beyond the scope of students. To achieve such effectiveness, we as teachers must be with them from morning to evening, and pay attention to the work of training in an invisible and silent way. Therefore, we teachers must use our own personality to influence students, and we must first use our personality to train students in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort and achieve the effectiveness of saving the country. — Speech to the educational circles in Wuhan at Yihe Village from July 18 to 20, year 21.

Enlightenment and Guidance The most important point is that we must enable every student to know the principles of being a person and the responsibilities of students, and develop their spirit of serving the society and the country and the habit of labor in training and practice. The minds of young people are all flawless white jade, and they are also lively and active. If the educators can follow their pure and good nature and do their best to enlighten and guide them, there is no one who cannot become a healthy and good citizen and serve the society and labor in order to fulfill their duties as citizens. — June 9, year 24, instruction to the educational circles summoned in the Chengdu Xingyuan.

The most urgent and effective thing at present is to engage in the transformation of society and people's hearts through the method of gradual transformation. — July 2, year 24, speech to the gentry in Chengdu.

### The Scenic Beauty of Xikou Described

— From Our Newspaper's Reference Room

Xikou, the birthplace of Chairman Chiang, is a place of scenic beauty. It has the unique charm of a Jiangnan water town, but is also surrounded by mountains, with peaks rising and falling. In the freshness of the South, it also carries a sense of the North's solemnity and grandeur. Naturally, the environment often has a great influence on people. The clear blue sky on the Aegean Sea gave the Greeks a bright philosophical wisdom, while the thick fogs on the British Isles endowed the British with a deep and persevering character. Xikou, with its beautiful scenery, simple folk customs, the gurgling streams beside Qianzhang Rock, and the white snow on the mountain peaks, has naturally nurtured Chairman Chiang from a young age into a character of brightness, wisdom, benevolence, and perseverance.

A Sightseeing Journey

People who go to visit and admire the birthplace of this great man mostly go to Ningbo first, and then take a long-distance bus on the Yin-Feng Highway to Fenghua. The bus speeds forward on a road paved with sand and gravel. After a journey of more than an hour, after passing Jiangkou Bridge, the county seat of Fenghua comes into view. Fenghua is a city with an area of more than 5,000 square li, and currently has a population of two to three hundred thousand people. There are two middle schools here: Fenghua County Middle School and Taiqing Middle School. Fenghua Middle School was founded during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, originally named Fenglu Academy, and was where Chairman Chiang studied in his youth.

From Fenghua City to Xikou Station in the county, the first thing that catches the eye is the solemn and majestic Wuling Gate. Many large trees are planted on both sides of the gate. On hot summer days, in the depths of the shade, the sound of cicadas harmonizes, and travelers feel an unspeakable sense of coolness and tranquility in their hearts. On Wuling Gate are the two large characters "Wuling," personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang. Inside the gate are many modern and magnificent buildings, which are Wuling School and Wuling Hospital.

A Closer View of Jinxi

Wuling School has junior high and elementary schools, and this year a high school has also been added. Currently, there are more than 700 students. Students do not need to pay any fees for their studies. The school also has a hospital, a farm, a forest garden, and even a small-scale cannery. While studying, the students also participate in production work during their spare time. The principal of Wuling School is personally held by Chairman Chiang, and the school affairs are managed by Dean Shi Jiyan. When the school was first recovered after the victory, the school buildings had been messed up and destroyed, but now they have been completely renovated. The newly built school buildings are a combination of Chinese and Western styles, with palace-style roofs and Western-style bodies. Trees are planted all around, creating a quiet and secluded environment.

Near Wuling School, facing Jinxi, there is a pavilion for tourists to rest, called the Octagonal Pavilion. The Octagonal Pavilion is located on a rock, surrounded by flowers and trees. Standing in front of the pavilion, leaning on the railing and looking down, the beautiful scenery of Xikou can be seen. Looking north, there is a long Xikou Main Street. One side of the street is along the stream, and the other side is full of shops, interspersed with some green trees. The shops on Xikou Street are very small, because most of the residents there live by farming. The telecommunications bureau is also there. There is also a police station in the town, but the total number of police chief and police officers is only twelve. The simplicity of Xikou's folk customs makes the police dispensable.

Passing on Loyalty and Filial Piety

In Xikou Town, the Jiang Family Ancestral Hall has the four characters "Passing on Loyalty and Filial Piety" personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang in front of the door. Chairman Chiang's former residence, No. 51 Xikou Town, is a simple old-fashioned house. Walking through the cave gate with white powder walls, inside are several southern-style houses; the middle is the main hall, where the gods are enshrined, and the portrait of Chairman Chiang's mother, Madame Wang, is also hung there, with several marble-inlaid chairs and coffee tables placed on both sides. Folding inside, there is also a row of quiet and simple houses, which is where the great man was born.

Proceeding from here, to the foot of Yulin Mountain, climbing up the steps, you can soon see the tomb of Chiang's mother. On both sides of the stone steps on the hillside, pines and cypresses are lush, shadows cover the ground, and from time to time there comes a burst of faint floral fragrance, coupled with the light singing of birds in the forest. Madame Wang, who taught her son with loyalty and filial piety, is resting here. There is a plaque over the entrance to the tomb, with the two characters "Ci An" [Kind Hermitage] written by Tan Yankai. Behind is a pavilion with a stele, on which is engraved the National Father's [Sun Yat-sen's] eulogy to Chiang's mother. On both sides of the stele pavilion, to the right is Chairman Chiang's bedroom. When Chairman Chiang comes, he often stays here. To the left is the reception room, with some ordinary sofas and tables and chairs. Following the mountain path further up, you will reach the front of Chiang's mother's tomb. There is a stone stele in front of the tomb, with the four large characters "Tomb of Chiang's Mother" handwritten by the National Father.

The Wonders of Miaogao and Xuedou

The most famous scenery of Xikou is Miaogao Terrace and Xuedou Temple. Miaogao is on Siming Mountain. Looking around, there are layers of high mountains, with clouds slowly floating above them. People who come here feel their minds broaden. About three li opposite Miaogao is Xuedou Temple. The Qianzhang Rock Waterfall nearby is a famous scenic spot. Qianzhang Rock faces a cliff and deep abyss. The waterfall rushes down from the rock like a white silk, winding and circling to Shangyin Pool. The surrounding walls are cut off, and only one road can pass through. The mountains are full of lush bamboo forests and have a reputation as a good place to escape the summer heat.

There are many bamboo forests in Xikou. Many families have bamboo gardens and use them as a sideline. Bamboo shoots are available almost all year round. In spring there are bamboo shoots, after the bamboo shoots there are hairy shoots and big shoots, in summer there are whip shoots, and in winter there are winter shoots. In addition to being transported fresh to other places, bamboo shoots are often boiled in salt water, dried in the sun, and made into dried bamboo shoots. Ningbo dried bamboo shoots are a specialty and also a favorite dish of Chairman Chiang.

Xikou has not become rich and prosperous because it is the birthplace of Chairman Chiang, but because it produced such a great man, the people of all China today remember its name with gratitude and respect.

### School Presentation and Longevity Wishes: Shanghai Workers Donate Half a Day's Wages

[Reported by This Newspaper] Representatives of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated trade unions went to the Ningbo Fellow Association yesterday morning to sign the longevity commemorative book and decided to participate in the longevity celebration on the 31st afternoon. They have also decided that workers throughout the city will donate half a day's wages as a school presentation fund. It is said that the Federation of Trade Unions will request that one or two of the presented schools be selected and named Labor Schools.

### The Best Gift: The School Presentation Movement is Spreading Throughout the Country

— From Our Newspaper's Reference Room

This year, on October 31st, we happily celebrate Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday. The Shanghai Municipal Council passed the "Launch a Celebration of the Head of State's 60th Birthday, Establish a Permanent Memorial, to Show Respect for Virtue and Gratitude for Meritorious Service" proposal on September 21st and stipulated four measures: (1) The Council will send a letter to all mass organizations in the city to organize a Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Head of State's 60th Birthday. (2) The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Council will represent the Council in participating in the Preparatory Committee. (3) The Preparatory Committee will refer to the precedent of presenting aircraft to express longevity wishes on the 50th birthday and properly formulate celebration measures to establish a more meaningful permanent memorial. (4) A telegram will be sent to the Provincial and Municipal Councils to proceed consistently.

In late September, more than 100 people from the Shanghai education and journalism circles, including Tang Zengzhi, Sun Dongcheng, Zhong Juemin, and Qian Fugong, suggested a "School Presentation and Longevity Wishes" plan. The main points are as follows: (1) Each province, city, county, and organization across the country should immediately establish a method for people to voluntarily donate funds and organize a "School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Committee" to facilitate the process. (2) People's donations should be entirely voluntary. The donation goal should be that each autonomous region in each province, city, and county should be able to add at least one national school. (3) On Chiang's birthday, each province, city, and county should separately present a list of the amount of donations and the units where national schools can be added directly to Chiang Kai-shek to express congratulations, and also publish it in newspapers to inform the public. (4) These national schools should uniformly be prefixed with the characters "Jieshi" [Chiang Kai-shek's given name] to show permanent commemoration. (5) These national schools should be completed by the end of this year and open simultaneously in early spring next year so that all out-of-school children and all illiterate people across the country can be rescued as soon as possible. (6) Donations other than cash, such as donating houses and land for school buildings and building school buildings, can be included.

Afterward, in order to expand the response to the longevity celebration movement, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education convened a talk session with district heads on October 3rd to discuss the methods of the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement, and exchanged opinions with each other. The results were: (1) Formulate a "Draft of Measures for School Presentation and Longevity Wishes". (2) Organize the "Shanghai All Circles School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement Committee" (later renamed Shanghai All Circles Celebration of Chairman Chiang's 60th Birthday Preparatory Committee).

The Preparatory Committee held its first standing committee meeting in early October, authorizing Director-General Wu Kaixian to draft the Shanghai All Circles School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Measures. The School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Measures drafted by Wu are as follows: (1) All schools built by all circles in this city to celebrate longevity will uniformly be prefixed with the characters "Zhong Zheng" [meaning "Central Correctness," a common name for schools honoring Chiang Kai-shek], with the order determined by the sequence of presentation. (2) All school buildings built in this city to express longevity wishes will be used for the establishment of National Schools [elementary schools]. (3) The school buildings built will be divided into two types: six-grade National Schools and twelve-grade National Schools. (4) The construction cost of a six-grade school building is tentatively set at 10,000,000 yuan, and the construction cost of a twelve-grade school building is tentatively set at 20,000,000 yuan. (5) The base for building school buildings should be based on the principle of using existing public land, unclaimed wasteland, and land presented by the people, and private land may be leased or purchased when necessary. (6) The funds needed for building school buildings will be voluntarily presented by citizens of this city and various organizations and institutions. (7) In addition to being awarded medals or certificates by this committee, the amount of donations from citizens and organizations in this city will also be reported to the higher authorities for commendation in accordance with the Regulations on Rewarding Donations for Educational Purposes. (8) In addition to the rewards given to citizens or organizations in this city who donate to school construction in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, their names or the names of the organizations will be engraved on stone tablets within the designated donated school to commemorate them permanently. (9) These measures have been adopted and implemented by the Shanghai All Circles Celebration of Chairman Chiang's 60th Birthday Preparatory Committee and have been submitted to the Municipal Government for the record.

Since the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement was initiated in this city, it has immediately received widespread response from all over the country. In the capital, citizens' organizations have held meetings and prepared for celebrations. At the municipal conference, it was resolved to launch the "Capital All Circles School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement" to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education. A meeting was held on October 8th, planning to present 60 schools, with an estimated cost of 6 billion yuan.

The Tianjin School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement also began simultaneously. The Tianjin School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Standing Committee was established on October 18th, launching a movement for each citizen to donate 1,000 yuan, and for public educators to donate one day's income. The deadline for collection was set for the 29th, and the number of schools to be presented will be determined based on the amount of funds raised.

In response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement initiated by Shanghai, Mayor Dong of Shenyang specially instructed the Social Affairs and Education Bureaus to formulate specific measures for the Shenyang School Presentation and Longevity Wishes. It is said that it has been decided to present 60 schools.

The Qingdao Municipal Government plans to establish 50 national elementary schools and one science museum within the year to respond to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement. Wang Yaowu, commander of the Second Pacification Headquarters (now succeeded as Chairman of Shandong Province), convened a meeting of the heads of various headquarters on October 6th, resolving to raise 1 billion yuan in Qingdao to establish a Zhong Zheng Middle School to celebrate the Chairman's birthday.

On October 6th, the Hankou School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement Committee was established, and all circles responded enthusiastically. In the Zhongshan District alone, 1.07 million yuan has been donated, and the other districts are proceeding enthusiastically.

The Beiping Municipal Bureau of Education, in order to rescue out-of-school children, had previously worked with the Social Affairs Bureau to formulate a draft plan for the establishment and expansion of national schools, which was approved by the municipal government. Now, in response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes, it is stepping up the implementation of the plan and expanding it.

The education community in Guangzhou has launched a donation drive based on each autonomous region in the city as a unit, for a total of 24 central schools, with an estimated fundraising goal of 200 million yuan.

In Hangzhou, in addition to the construction of Zhong Zheng primary and secondary schools by all circles in Hangzhou, alumni of the Zhejiang Military Academy also launched the establishment of the Hangzhou Zhong Zheng School to respond to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes.

The Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters, in order to celebrate the Chairman's birthday, specially launched a donation drive for all party members to donate one day's income to raise funds to run the most complete national elementary school. Detailed measures have been drafted.

All circles in Anhui have decided to present schools to express longevity wishes, setting up Zhong Zheng elementary schools in Anqing, Bengbu, Wuhu, and Hefei. In the other counties, the existing complete central national schools will be converted into Zhong Zheng elementary schools.

The Shanxi Provincial Youth League branch has also decided to set up a Zhong Zheng elementary school to celebrate Chiang's birthday.

Fujian Province has decided to hold charity donation and school presentation activities in all cities and counties throughout the province as a longevity celebration.

All circles in Ningxia Province responded to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes, voluntarily donating 140 million yuan to build two Zhong Zheng National Schools and establish 100 Zhong Zheng literacy schools for the masses.

The Gansu Province School Presentation and Longevity Wishes Movement decided that each county and city should present a national school and report the amount of the first batch of donation funds to the provincial government before October 18th.

Lu Daoxin, Chen Chuncui, and 22 other members of the Jiangxi Youth League and enthusiastic educators launched a response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes, deciding to establish a middle school in Yichun, named "Jie Fu Middle School," taking the meaning of "repaying with great blessings, boundless longevity." They have already raised 50 million yuan for start-up expenses and plan to raise another 100 million yuan in funds.

Muslims in Xinjiang launched the establishment of an Islamic Zhong Zheng Middle School to respond to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes.

The recovered Mongolian banners in the Northeast and the Mongolian banners in Suiyuan and Rehe, in addition to presenting a banner combining Mongolian and Chinese characters for each banner, will also establish a complete elementary school, named Zhong Zheng Elementary School of a certain banner, to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday.

The Changchun New Life Movement Association widely invited people from all walks of life on October 4th to discuss the response to the School Presentation and Longevity Wishes and agreed on specific measures to actively carry out. Served as the commander of the 5th Regiment of the Shanghai Army. At the same time, overseas Chinese also responded one after another, donating money to present schools.

Looking at the enthusiastic response from the provinces and cities, it can be seen that "School Presentation and Longevity Wishes" is indeed a deeply meaningful move. National construction and revitalization should begin with education. Especially today, when out-of-school children are prevalent throughout the country, increasing the number of schools to improve the people's level of knowledge and cultivate the foundation of the next generation of national construction cadres is naturally the most urgent task and the best gift that the people can present to the Chairman.

### Eulogy for Expelling the Barbarians (with Preface)

Glorious and vast is the Crimson Land, the true home of our Yellow Descendants. The domain of Yu is evenly distributed, the plains of Zhou are lush and fertile. Dwelling in the center of the world, the troubles on the borders have arisen since ancient times. Tracing back to the Xianyun, Quanrong, Xiongnu, Western Regions, Tubo, Huihe, Khitan, Jin, and Yuan, for four thousand years, they have brought disaster to China, disturbed the common people, and encroached upon our territory. However, before long, they were either subdued, defeated, or destroyed, and their lands were incorporated into our territory. Initially, they roamed freely like dogs and sheep, but eventually, the map of our land expanded daily. The nomadic people who lived in yurts were reclassified as registered households. The customs of both southern and northern peoples all adopted the correct calendar. This allowed us to spread our vast territory and numerous people with education and teachings, making the four neighboring peoples into one family and the five ethnic groups into one nation. Even to this day, it continues to grow larger, truly a gift from the Yi-Di barbarians. In between, there were instances of defeat followed by victory, of taking back what was once given away. Although one might say it was the will of Heaven, how could it be without human effort? The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were bright and wise. Shun and Yu received their mandates, consulting the almanac for their reigns. The Shang and Zhou dynasties underwent successions through generations, accumulating virtue and benevolence to possess the world. The Han Dynasty manifested the auspicious signs of the Red Emperor, and the Tang Dynasty recorded the auspicious omen of the Jin River. Even up to the Song and Ming dynasties, they all strived to maintain their rule and feared losing it. They all heeded the will of Heaven above and aligned with the hearts of the people below, listening to the people and receiving the mandate with reverence. Therefore, enlightened kings and wise rulers brought about repeated prosperity and harmony among the nine clans. Foreign peoples were drawn to our culture through multiple translations. Examining past strategies, how could it be said that it was all mere chance? China is a nation of divine descendants, the Central Land is a vessel of great potential. There has never been a case where someone without a foundation of inherited destiny or deeds of merit could usurp the realm through petty tricks like crowing like a rooster or thieving like a dog. If the people of China occupy the position of China, like Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wen of Sui, Cao Cao, and Xiao Liang, they may possess great talent and ambition, but if they do not know how to love the people and cultivate virtue, then it is like a cauldron with broken legs or overturned food, and the great mandate will immediately collapse. How much more so should those who are of different kinds, alien species, island barbarians, and ferocious tribes, who seek to exploit weakness and danger, and covetously steal the divine artifacts, relying on their superior armor and weapons to fulfill their desires of theft and plunder, recklessly initiating war? If they truly wish to emulate the wisdom of the Jin and Yuan dynasties, they must assess their virtue and strength, spread benevolence and practice kindness, respect faith and value righteousness, and win over the hearts of the people. If they could truly do this, then China would be in danger. Summer insects cannot be spoken to of ice, and cicadas do not understand spring and autumn. Foolish barbarians, are there no people among you who are worthy of understanding these things? Instead, you are shallow, reckless, and rash, engaging in slaughter and arson, harboring wild schemes to expand territory, and committing acts of brutal killing and looting. Your ugly virtues and evil nature are exposed to the whole world. Gentlemen, therefore, know their demise is at hand. Their supreme generals and chieftains, mobilizing the forces of the entire nation, exhausting the wealth of several decades, entrusted with the expectations of a small and lowly people, engage in the actions of roving bandits like Chuang and Xian, yet they desire to dominate the multitudes of the nine provinces and receive the blessings of the gods. How could Heaven be so unkind as to use such people! Heaven is depriving them of their souls, which is a blessing for China. Although we are an old nation, our destiny is being renewed. The hearts of the people are not yet united, and our national defense is not yet strengthened. With a country unprepared, facing an enemy that has been lurking for a long time, responding hastily to the enemy, the disparity in strength is significant. At the beginning of the resistance against Japan in 1937, they had advantages while we were deficient, it was inevitable and reasonable. Heaven favors China and earnestly produces

General Chiang, placing himself amidst accumulated weakness, embracing righteousness in times of crisis, treading on thin ice, enduring wind and rain, diligently toiling, tirelessly all day long. The people of the world are sincerely and genuinely convinced, and all love

General Chiang as a patriot. Thereupon, all parties pledge their loyalty, all armies dedicate their lives, and the myriad people are united. Internal troubles are all eliminated. Those who are living destroy their homes to reward the troops, and those who are dead expose their bones without resentment. At this time, the opportunity for victory or defeat is so close, there is no room for error, and the outcome of victory or defeat can be foreseen.

General Chiang outwardly emulates the retreat of Qian You and inwardly drinks the pain of Zai Ju, enduring hardship and shouldering great burdens, not faltering and not shrinking back. He is reorganizing the army and strengthening the military, mobilizing troops and making oaths, carefully considering all matters, divinely planning the nine borders, improving and preparing, attacking and uniting. The second phase of the war has now been three years. Employing wisdom against the arrogant and expanding enemy, deciding victory after defeat, is it not exceedingly difficult? Then, if there were no

General Chiang, there would be no China. Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our robes on the left! Confucius said: "If he is truly benevolent, he is truly benevolent." In the early summer of 1939, he decided on a strategy to counterattack, and since then, he has used stillness to control movement, turning weakness into strength, and progressing from loss to gain, transitioning to the stage of counter-offensive. Consequently, there were the battles of Suizao, Changsha, and Nanning, and northern Guangdong. In the early summer of 1940, the counter-offensive became more vigorous, leading to victories in western Suiyuan, southern Jin, southern Guangxi, southern Guangdong, central Hubei, and northern Hubei. In the current year of 1941, there have been major victories in southern Henan, Yichang, and northern Jiangxi. Looking at the enemy's three battlefields in the north and south, stretching across ten provinces, starting from the desert, Yinshan Mountain, and Hexi areas in the north, crossing Yanmen and Daizhou to the Liaohe and Jieshi, extending along the Five Great Mountains and Four Great Rivers, traversing famous mountains, great rivers, rivers, lakes, and marshes, penetrating deep into Wu and Chu, gazing afar at the Lingbiao region, and reaching the remote borders of Jiaozhi and Zangke, the stench of their actions filled the sky wherever they went, rubble covered the ground, blood flowed like porridge, white bones piled up like mountains, famous cities turned into ruins, and cultural relics were reduced to ashes. The extent of their trampling, the cruelty of their destruction, the horror of their slaughter, and the pervasiveness of their occupation surpassed even Huang Chao and far surpassed the Jin and Yuan dynasties. Our army in the resistance war has inferior weapons and tactics, enduring and persevering, passing through years and seasons. Entering the second phase, military strength is gathering like clouds, elite troops are rising up together, the generals are all famous, and the soldiers are all elite. There are now three million soldiers, eight thousand miles of battle lines, sixty thousand engagements, and seven hundred thousand prisoners annihilated. Like fire and rushes, striking down with absolute certainty, this is truly a rare and great war of expelling the barbarians in the history of China! Since this war, we have transitioned from decline to prosperity, from weakness to strength, from laxity to vigor, and from danger to safety. The hearts of the people are becoming more steadfast, and the morale of the soldiers is becoming more fierce. How can we achieve this? If there were not a single person whose virtue is sufficient to convince people, and whose strength is sufficient to rally the masses, to lead them and guide them, who could achieve this? Not only this, but all administrative affairs are not chaotic or deficient, responding to changes as if they were ordinary, and responding to every move. This allows the generals to have no worries about the rear, and the soldiers to increase their morale. They become accustomed to long battles as if it were their nature, and they are fearless of strong enemies. Even the enemy knows to be astonished and submit. If there were no

General Chiang, there would be no China. Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our robes on the left! Confucius said: "If he is truly benevolent, he is truly benevolent." Yang Qi, a scholar from Dongwu in the region of Qi, was born in peaceful times. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, when Qi was at the height of his strength, he once attended the seat of Li Wenzhong Gong. When discussing matters of the East, Gong Zhuang Rong spoke to Qi, saying: "A great war between China and Japan is inevitable. An early outbreak will result in a smaller disaster, and a late outbreak will result in a larger disaster. Remember my words, you will surely see it when you are old." Although China will certainly not perish, a person of great renown will surely be born into this world to take on this great responsibility, and it is not a matter of today. Unexpectedly, forty-five years later, in his old age, he witnessed the calamity of the southward crossing, displacement and wandering, and the chaos of the four seas. Tracing back to the Sino-Japanese War, at that time

General Chiang had already descended from Mount Song, and auspicious signs were evident in his youth. It can be seen that Heaven's will had already prepared for it, and bestowed a great responsibility upon

General Chiang. Until today, he has suffered in his heart, labored his muscles and bones, to accomplish great deeds. Therefore, the great war is inevitable, and China will certainly not perish, and it all depends on

General Chiang's hands. Wenzhong's words are still in my ears, and the matter is as clear as daylight. Looking at the present, I am filled with emotion, admiration, joy, and cannot contain myself. Therefore, I have collected the words from Jiao's Book of Changes and composed a eulogy for General Chiang's expulsion of the barbarians in advance. The eulogy says:

The dwelling of Fuxi, the southern mountain of Kuaiji, Yu summoned the feudal lords, the country produced benevolent and wise men. Holding jade scepters from ten thousand nations, the mechanism of peace, Heaven bestows a dark jade tablet, the South is greatly peaceful. Praising virtue and singing功, the joy of sweet dew, the illustrious and righteous gentleman, given by Heaven, all directions return to virtue, numerous talents gather, armor and weapons fill the courtyard, military arsenal and government, to announce success, unity is the master, the people receive great blessings, increasing glory and praise, the ancestral homeland relies on virtue, joyful and dancing, birds and beasts are without courtesy, treacherous words strive for strength, chieftain thieves arbitrarily labor, they come to harm our country, false words and empty talk, the family suffers misfortune, a large mouth utters lies, raising tigers and taking in wolves, disrupting our government affairs, burning our golden ramparts, drowning in disaster and misfortune, returning to harm themselves, the remote corner of the sea, the Land of Liao, Heaven's hidden storehouse, just arrived in eastern Liaoning, Rong and Di squatting, losing the opportune moment, the embankment collapses and the pillar breaks, mountains and hills are surrounded, blocking our path, the people lose their homes, dogs bark at their masters, the land preserved by Jizi, the ruins of Guzhu, the land of bees and scorpions, entering our homes, not of our kind, longing for our old ways, barren land and fertile marshes, dissipate without remainder, rats gather to produce monsters, a long tongue like an axe, the Yangtze, Huai, and Yellow Rivers, the gathering place of numerous benefits, speaking of the southern country, facing dangers and obstacles, causing us to be worried and deaf, the six dragons are all angered, Qin is a tiger and wolf, the Great Wall is already established, the carriage overturns and the canopy collapses, a group of tigers enter the town, carving mountains and opening roads, moving to peaceful homes, the calamity of hawks and vultures, unable to rest, bows and crossbows fill the fields, creating evil and committing atrocities, the people complain of sorrow and hardship, merchants are troubled and without success, explaining upside down and hanging, no one is suitable to follow me, the government declines and is extremely corrupt, the foundation is not firm, tigers and wolves collude, discussing together, Yi Qin's trickery, Zhi and Jie dwell together, working at night and hiding during the day, walking by day and moving by month, the River God shouts loudly, the ferry cannot be crossed, the duke holds great worry, Yin loses Yang and hides, climbing nine times and crossing ten times, the Five Mountains and Four Rivers, holding an axe and grasping a spear, four coins do not submit, raising troops to conquer, replenishing migration brings blessings, bows and arrows are stretched, capturing leopards and killing Yue, struck by thunder and lightning, the people of the country rejoice, giant snakes and large loaches, fight in the suburbs of the country, detained in cages and shackles, always wanting to escape, falling into a deep abyss, the people are troubled and bored, treading in mud and dirtying their feet, unable to move, the great powers of Qin and Jin, tread and look at the six directions, Yi Wu and Zheng Qiao, soaring in foreign countries, the letter of the cinnabar book, flapping wings and soaring, leisurely and joyful, returning to the warm room, Mount Song and Mount Tai, solemn and dignified in the center, merit added to the four seas, the head like flying thatch, wearing a hat and hanging clothes, the omen like a flying dragon, a guest at the four gates, the camp chamber and the purple palace, the host overcomes the guest, an auspicious day for military attack, the four barbarians submit, faith and righteousness are greatly enhanced, drums and trumpets remove the thieves, although blocked, it is restored, chasing after the fleeing and pursuing the defeated, encountering happiness and joy, grasping the Big Dipper and operating the pivot, residing peacefully in the North Star, laboring our gentleman, turning the universe around, peaceful and secure as before, literary virtue is on his body, melting weapons and casting plows, accumulating merit and accumulating benevolence, this year receives blessings, blessing our people. Yang Qi Yunshi from Jiangdong respectfully composed (July 7th, 1941, Republic of China)

### Shanghai Citizens' Public Birthday Wishes to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on His Sixtieth Birthday

In 1946, the year following the complete victory of the Eastern Expedition, the citizens of Shanghai respectfully wished

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek a happy sixtieth birthday on October 31st. All the citizens of Shanghai thought of ways to express their wishes, and entrusted the task to the soldier Zhao to write an article. Zhao deliberated for a long time, believing that celebrating the birthday of a person was not an ancient custom, and celebrating the birthday of the head of a nation was even more unprecedented. Why do I say this? The head of state takes the universe as his home and the cosmos as his era, and the passage of sixty years is hardly enough to limit him. Moreover, his actions in establishing models and setting examples involve countless matters every day, each with its own context, and are by no means something that ordinary people can rashly point fingers at or arbitrarily offer blessings. However, the doctrine of Confucius is consistent, and the essence of the Five Emperors is only sixteen characters. We use simple words to infer complex meanings, and gain righteousness from simplicity, specifically speaking, from the

Chairman's standard of the New Life Movement, the four characters of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, extending to the rest. Establishing principles and unifying categories, all plans should be neither excessive nor deficient. Propriety is the opposite of punishment and aims to prevent problems before they occur. Righteousness means prohibiting the people from doing wrong. Integrity means not accepting anything improper. Shame means not doing anything dishonorable. These four virtues are all biased towards the negative, and they are the foundation for all things. Since ancient times, talented people have been self-assertive, fond of grandeur and eager for success, lightly regarding vague matters and neglecting small defects. Consequently, the mistakes that lead to legal punishments in small matters, and the disturbances that lead to chaos in the country in large matters, are countless. Only our

Chairman pays utmost attention to this, and planting the roots of inaction, he plants the fruits of action. Thus, he can destroy and clear away obstacles, achieving the great feat of revolution. Firm and unyielding, he brings a strong enemy to a miserable defeat. May I ask, during the eight years of the war, our military equipment was far inferior to that of the enemy, and in the early stages, the country shrank day by day, by more than a hundred miles. Yet, through hardship and perseverance, and the inability of peace talks to shake his resolve, he ultimately achieved complete victory, creating a central force. In ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, who can compare to him as a leader who stands out from the crowd? Emperor Gaozu of Han established his empire in five years, and his deeds were similar to territorial expansion. Washington led thirteen states to independence without any major battles. These accomplishments pale in comparison. In the past, Zhang Jiucheng said to Emperor Gaozong of Song, "I wish Your Majesty would be steadfast and magnanimous in heart, and not be discouraged by alarm and worry." These two sentences seem like platitudes, but in essence, besides our

Chairman, who else can truly embody them? As a result, Emperor Gaozong, with the fully prosperous situation of the Northern Song Dynasty, brewed a situation of partial peace. Our

Chairman, from our status as a semi-colonial country, has ascended to the ranks of powerful nations. What kind of cause yields what kind of effect? It is as clear as the sun and the moon, and it is by no means accidental. Shanghai is the birthplace of the revolution, and the citizens are close and devoted followers. They deeply understand the righteousness and believe that the greatest way to celebrate is to proclaim the supreme virtue and the essential principles to the world and future generations. Therefore, I, Zhu Mu, bow and speak.

Respectfully written by Zhang Shijian
