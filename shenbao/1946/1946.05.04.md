### Millions of Citizens Infinitely Excited; Chairman and Madame Triumphant Return to the Capital; Inspection of the City and Instructions on Municipal Administration

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, arrived in Nanjing at 11:17 AM on the morning of the 3rd aboard the "Meiling" special plane. Director of the Bureau of Military Affairs Yu Jishi and Chief of the Guards Li Tiehan accompanied them. The plane landed at Ming Palace Airport. The first to arrive to make arrangements were only Zhou Zhirou, Director of the Aviation Committee, and Sun Tonggang, Commander of the Air Force Nanjing District. This was because the National Government had received a telegram from Director Yu of the Bureau of Military Affairs on the morning of the 3rd, saying that it was instructed that heads of various agencies and news reporters need not go to the airport to greet them, so as to avoid wasting time and delaying official business. However, before the Chairman's special plane arrived in Nanjing, Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin, Vice President of the Examination Yuan Zhou Zhongyue, and Minister of Personnel Jia Jingde had all arrived at the airport to greet them. Later, it was heard that special plane No. 273, carrying personnel from the Adjutant's Office, had arrived in Nanjing at 8:05 AM. Believing that the "Meiling" special plane would not arrive until the afternoon, the welcomers returned to the city one after another. When the "Meiling" special plane arrived, only Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin and Minister Chen Cheng, who had returned, were there to greet them. The airport was extremely quiet. It was heard that after the Chairman disembarked, he asked if Chief Secretary Wu Wenguan and Chief Secretary Shao Lizi had arrived in Nanjing, and spoke briefly with He Yingqin, Chen Cheng, and Zhou Zhirou. He then went with his wife by car to rest at the official residence of the Central Military Academy.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, flew from Hankou to Nanjing at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. This was the Chairman's third visit to Nanjing since the victory, and also the formal triumphant return of our beloved leader to the capital from Chongqing. For days, the capital has been preparing for the May 5th Return to Capital Ceremony with extreme excitement. The arrival of the Chairman undoubtedly brought the excitement of the 800,000 citizens, who were eagerly awaiting, to a climax. On the 3rd, the Chairman's plane "Meiling" was piloted by Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Yu Fuen. There were more than 20 people accompanying him. When the Chairman and Madame Chiang disembarked, they smiled happily and repeatedly greeted Director Zhou Zhirou, who was in charge of arrangements. They then drove directly to the official residence to rest. At this time, although there were no welcoming personnel at Ming Palace Airport, as instructed by the Chairman beforehand, citizens gathered in groups around the airport upon hearing the news, and still gave the Chairman a gaze of infinite enthusiasm as his car passed by. At 3:00 PM, the Chairman hosted a tea party at the official residence to entertain former US President Hoover. At 5:00 PM, the Chairman, accompanied by Mayor Ma Shiyi, drove around the city, passing through National Government Road, Taiping Road, Zhongzheng Road, and Zhongshan North Road, directly to Xiaguan. The Chairman gave many instructions on Nanjing's municipal administration, expressed his approval of the city government's plan to establish an industrial zone, and instructed that vacant land on both sides of the roads in the urban area should be requisitioned by the government to build houses to enhance the appearance of the city. It was also reported that Madame Chiang visited Madame Marshall at the invitation of Marshal Marshall at 4:30 PM on the 3rd.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 2nd] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Madame Chiang, inspected the entire city by car at around 8:00 PM on the evening of the 2nd, expressing great importance to the construction of the urban area of Hankou.

### President Truman Issues Statement; Aiding China and Korea's Economic Development; Sending Pauley to China to Investigate Northeast Industry

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] President Truman made a statement at a press conference today, saying: I have sent Mr. Pauley as a private representative to handle the issue of Far East reparations. When Mr. Pauley goes to the Far East in the future, he will investigate the nine eastern provinces of China, Korea, and various resources. The governments of other relevant countries have already been notified of Mr. Pauley's trip. I am confident that Mr. Pauley can enter the nine eastern provinces to conduct investigation work. The President then read a statement, in which he quoted the remarks of Under Secretary of State Acheson, namely that Mr. Pauley will go to the Far East at the end of this week at the request of the government and the State Department. The statement solemnly declared: "The goal of the United States is to support and foster the unity and economic development of China and Korea, while also ensuring that these countries are economically independent of Japan. Mr. Acheson once said: If the long-term peace and economic development plan in East Asia is to be realized, then China must make full use of its natural resources and various industries in the nine eastern provinces, and Korea must be in a position to develop its own resources. These are wise words. Mr. Pauley's trip will conduct various studies and investigations to propose various adjusted and reasonable plans for the industrial, economic, and health development of the nine eastern provinces and Korea, and to use various reparations from Japan to develop the natural resources of these countries. The conclusions made by Mr. Pauley after completing his mission will be based on various accurate facts and consistent opinions. Mr. Pauley's words and actions will be based on the broad perspective of the United States, which is based on the Far East reconstruction plan, to expand the development opportunities for millions of residents in the region. In short, the main purpose of this trip is to obtain various information and propose various opinions to assist the US government and its allies in formulating a plan for the Far East, thereby contributing to the peace and security of the Far East and the world."

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] President Truman hosted reporters and announced the final plan for Pauley to go to Korea and Northeast China for investigation. He also said: Pauley's investigation work will inevitably cause a conflict between the economic interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Northeast Asia. Pauley's mission is extremely important. The White House announced that 20 experts, including industrial chemists, petroleum experts, and others, will jointly assist in the investigation of exactly what materials in the Northeast and Korea have been moved away by the Soviet Union, and how much remains. It is reported that the United States has formally notified the Soviet Union about sending Pauley to Northeast China and Korea for investigation and requested the Soviet Union to cooperate. However, no guarantee has been obtained so far. Unless the Soviet Union guarantees cooperation with the United States, Pauley may not be able to enter the Soviet-occupied areas of Korea or the areas of Northeast China that are still occupied by the Soviet army. Judging from the announced Pauley mission, it seems that economic policies between the US and the Soviet Union have begun to conflict.

### National Assembly Preparatory Committee Resolves; Requesting Government to Set Date for Meeting Soon

[Another telegram] Chen Jingchuan, representative of the Overseas Chinese in Siam to the National Assembly, together with Zheng Wulou, chairman of the Siam Overseas Chinese Relief of the Fatherland Famine Congress, and others, flew to Nanjing from Chongqing on the 3rd. Representative Chen Jingchuan prepared to attend the meeting, while Zheng Wulou came to Nanjing at the invitation of the Ministry of Food to discuss the rice issue.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The Shanxi National Assembly representatives telegraphed the Nanjing National Assembly Representatives Association, requesting that they implore the National Government to still hold the meeting as scheduled according to the previous order. Otherwise, they will mobilize representatives to go to Nanjing to gather on their own to comply with public opinion.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd] The 24 National Assembly representatives remaining in Lanzhou, including Feng Yihan, telegraphed the central government regarding the postponement of the National Assembly, suggesting that the postponement period be determined, no more than one month. If the meeting cannot be convened by the deadline, they will mobilize representatives to gather automatically.

Run nurseries and strengthen infant care work.

### Mei Siping's Treason Case Concluded in Beijing; Capital High Court to Announce Verdict on the 9th; Wife of Traitor Chu Minyi Applies for Retrial on Behalf of Her Husband

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Capital High Court opened the trial of the traitor Mei Siping this morning. The Chaotian Palace was crowded with people. More than 3,000 people were rejected from the square in front of the court because they did not have audience passes. At 9:00 AM, after three chimes of the bell, the bailiffs shouted to open the court. Presiding Judge Zhao Chen, Judges Ge Zhitan and Zheng Liyi, Examining Officer Li Shihang, and Clerk Xu Jun, five people wearing square caps and robes, entered the court one after another and took their seats. The whole place was silent, while the crowd on the square rioted, giving way. Four bailiffs escorted the traitor Mei into the court. Mei was wearing a light gray flannel jacket and yellow leather shoes, and sat silently on the right side of the litigation party's seat waiting for trial. The air in the courtroom suddenly became tense, and everyone wanted to see the once prominent traitor. The audience in the back row climbed up and craned their necks to watch from afar. At that time, the silver light flashed, and the sound of the "camera" rose sharply. The (China Electric) photographer rushed around, and the photographers of various newspapers became active, either squatting or standing upright, showing various wonderful forms, in order to find a suitable angle. Mei was still shameless under the gaze of everyone, turning his neck and looking around, to see how many people were counting his crimes. Mei entered the defendant's bar when his name was called by the presiding judge. After asking his name, age, and place of origin, Mei suddenly protested against the bailiffs for tying him with ropes during the interrogation. He was immediately refuted by the court.

Claiming to be Commanded in Secret Talks of Peace

After the prosecutor read the indictment, the presiding judge asked Mei whether he was a party member, what positions he had held, and what was the process of participating in the peace movement. Mei replied that he was a party member and had served as the director of the political science department of the Central Political University. As for the secret talks on the peace plan with the enemy Yingzuo Zhenzhao in Shanghai from Hong Kong, he claimed that it was under orders. The presiding judge immediately asked him under whose orders, and he replied that it was Wang Jingwei. At that time, he was the vice president and the special envoy stationed in Hong Kong, and went to Shanghai with Gao Zongwu to carry out activities under orders. At this time, the presiding judge sternly quoted what Chairman Chiang said: "We will never give up peace until the last moment, and we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until the last moment." "Once we resist the war, we will never make peace or compromise halfway. Compromise is the destruction of the country and the extinction of the race." Mei remained silent for a long time, and finally said that the national policy looked simple on the surface, but was actually very complicated. People who participate in politics often make mistakes, and they deliberately chose sophistry, mistakenly believing that Wang's "peace movement" was authorized by the central government, and the Japanese also mistakenly believed this, so they were very enthusiastic about the "peace movement." But later, Mei openly admitted that "peace" was his proposal, and stated how he helped the rear anti-Japanese war while serving in the puppet government. His confession was contradictory, which clearly showed that the traitor was boasting and shirking responsibility. The presiding judge also asked about admitting the puppet Manchukuo, opium monopoly, supplying the enemy with military food, etc. Mei always denied them and put all the responsibility on the deceased Wang Jingwei.

Presenting a Self-Defense Statement in Six Points

Finally, the court asked about his property and family. Mei replied that he never owned property and that his family had one wife, five sons, and two daughters. Mei had a book "The Complete Account of the Peace Movement" and a self-written statement of defense submitted to the court for trial. At 11:00 AM, the debate began. Mei defended himself with six points: (1) He and Gao Zongwu went to Japan under Wang's orders; (2) The negotiations with Yingzuo did not produce any results; (3) The chairman appointed the members of the puppet political committee, and everything was dictated by Wang alone. Although he was a member, he could not influence the political situation; (4) He did not do anything against his country during his five years of service in the puppet government; (5) Organizing the puppet government was a delaying tactic, and he believed that the war of resistance would be won under the leadership of Chairman Chiang; (6) The indiscriminate issuance of puppet currency was not within his authority. After Mei's defense, the public defender Liu Xiancai argued that the defendant absorbed materials, preserved power, reduced control, and restored industry in the occupied areas while serving in the puppet government. After the victory, he did not escape and handled the handover to the receiving personnel, requesting the court to make a fair judgment. At 11:45 AM, the debate ended, and the court ordered that the verdict be announced at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th of this month, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

Chu's Daughter Submits Document to High Court on Behalf of Her Mother

[This newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] Today was the last day of the statutory period for applying for a retrial of the death sentence of the traitor Chu Minyi. At about 2:00 PM, when reporters went to the Suzhou High Court for interviews, they met Chu's daughter Meng Yuan. She was wearing a blue shirt and carrying a document to the High Court. When reporters inquired next to her, they learned that it was a submission from her mother Chu Chen Senzhen applying for a retrial on behalf of her husband, and she showed a copy to the reporters. The content of the submission was full of empty words and all kinds of sophistry, with no concrete evidence presented. It stated briefly that the defendant devoted himself to the great cause of the revolution, followed the Premier and "Mr. Wang," and never left for a single day, and listed three reasons: (1) The defendant also advocated war. The original judgment said that the defendant had always advocated uniting with the Japanese bandits, which was unfounded. The claims and remarks made after the establishment of the puppet government were based on his duties and positions. As for the so-called collusion with the Axis powers to recognize the puppet government in the original judgment, it was not due to the defendant's efforts to contact them. (2) The defendant held the title of Foreign Affairs Consultant, but he rarely advised on foreign affairs, let alone domestic affairs. (3) The signing of the Basic Treaty, Alliance Treaty, and Agreement was done by "Mr. Wang" personally, and the defendant did not co-sign. Although the puppet government declared war on Britain and the United States, it did not send a single soldier. Therefore, it requested that the original judgment be overturned and a fairer judgment be made.

### Jinan Group Goes to Gaomi; Convening a Meeting to Mediate the Jiaodong Conflict

[This newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] It is reported that the Communist army around Zhangdian on the Jiaoji Line is frequently mobilizing and harassing from time to time, and claiming that it will attack Zhangdian soon.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 3rd] The Jinan Group flew to Qingdao and then to Gaomi and other places at 12:00 PM on the 3rd to mediate the Jiaodong conflict. The group included government representative Wen Ze, US representative Davis, and Communist representative Kuang Rennong. Upon arrival, they will convene a meeting of the commanders of the troops stationed on both sides to hold an important meeting.

[Another telegram] At 10:00 PM on the night of May 1st, the Communist army raided Mingshui (40 kilometers northeast of Jinan) for the second time. The intention was still to disturb the area. The defending troops were very calm, and the Communist army did not succeed in the end.

[Another telegram] Two hundred and twenty officers and soldiers of the Shandong Garrison Brigade were divided into groups on April 28th and went from the southern suburbs of Jinan to Shilihe via the FenShuiLing to purchase firewood. When they passed through Xingyun Mountain and Mingding Mountain, they were suddenly attacked by 500 Communist soldiers. The unarmed officers and soldiers of the Garrison Brigade suffered heavy casualties, with three officers and 40 soldiers killed or injured. Citizens are now afraid to set foot in the near suburbs of the city.

[United Press, Peiping, 3rd] The Propaganda Department's office in Peiping disclosed today that on April 27th, an American and a Swedish man were attacked by the Communist army on the way from Qingdao to Weixian in a Jeep. The incident occurred in Wenling Town, 23 miles northwest of Gaomi on the Qingji Railway. The two foreigners were non-military and were injured as a result. The Jeep they were traveling in was also damaged. They were rescued by the army and sent to Chishan for medical treatment. Their names and reasons for this trip are still unknown.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] According to refugees who escaped from Leling County, Zhang Ruhui, the secretary of the first district party headquarters in the county, was ordered to go to the east of the city to preside over the struggle, but was assassinated by the people on the way. His eyes were gouged out, and his limbs were cut off, which shows that the general public hates the Communist Party's cruel struggle movement to the bone.

### Nantong Once Tense; Yangtai and Other Places Peaceful

[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Since the Communist army attacked Nantong, rumors have been rife on the streets and alleys here. Some say that weapons were seized in a certain place, and others say that a certain number of Communist troops were found in a certain place. People's opinions vary, and they rush to tell each other in alarm. According to the bureau, except for Nantong, which was once tense recently, there have been no military operations in Yang, Tai, and other places north and south of the Yangtze River. The National Army is strictly deployed around Yangzhen, and warships patrol the river surface even at night, which can guarantee that the Communist army has absolutely no activity. Also, when the Communist army attacked Guanyin Mountain and Xiaohai Town in Nantong on the 27th of last month, it simultaneously sent troops to capture Changle Town and Batou Town, which belong to Haimen County.

### Luo Ruiqing Returns to Peiping

[This newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist Party of the Executive Headquarters, stated to reporters yesterday as the representative of Zhou Enlai: To the best of his knowledge, there is no item in Marshall's proposal that requires the Communist army to withdraw from Changchun. Luo had gone to the Northeast on behalf of Zhou Enlai to inspect, and then went to Chongqing to report to Zhou. He returned north one day before Marshall left Chongqing. Due to weather conditions, the plane landed in Zhangjiakou and did not return to Peiping until one day later.

### Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang; Sells the National Seal and Arrives in the Capital; Wu Guozhen and Shao Lizi Also Arrived

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen, accompanied by Zeng Xubai, Director of the International Propaganda Department, arrived in Beijing aboard China Aviation's No. 92 special plane. After Wu disembarked, he declared to reporters that there was nothing to report today and that he would hold a detailed discussion later. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] National Government Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang, Secretary General of the Political Participation Council Shao Lizi, Party Committee Chief of Chongqing Municipality Fang Zhi, and Director Chen of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Chief Secretary's Office, flew to Beijing from Chongqing on the same plane at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. Chief Secretary Wu also brought the National Seal with him. In addition, Liu Jianqun, acting secretary-general of the Central Corps Department of the Youth League, and Luo Jialun, former supervisor of Xinjiang, and his wife Zhang Weizhen, flew to Beijing on the 3rd.

### Magistrate of Pinglu County Assassinated; Entourage Killed Simultaneously

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Wang Bingsheng, magistrate of Pinglu County, was shot and killed by the Communist army on the way back to Pinglu from Yuanxi. Three members of his entourage were also killed at the same time.

### 100,000 Main Force of the Communist Army Defeated; National Army Enters Benxihu; Du Yuming Returns to Shenyang after Inspection

[This newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] The National Army entered Benxihu on the 2nd. The new mayor, Liu Yifu, has set the 21st as the date of his inauguration. Fierce fighting continues in Sipingjie. Officials have hinted that it may be captured in three or four days and said that peace talks can begin after the National Army returns to Changchun. The previous Northeast War severely damaged spring plowing, as planting in the Northeast generally takes place around Qingming, and at the latest cannot be later than Guyu. Now Guyu has passed, and the summer solstice is approaching. The reporter returned to Peiping from Shenyang today and saw the flowers blooming in the old capital, and my heart was happy beyond words. When the reporter left Shenyang, the trees in the Northeast had just turned green, and the fields still had no green, and it was still winter.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] The most powerful main force of the Communist army, more than 100,000 people, was driven out and scattered by the National Army in Benxi Creek at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. Commander Du Yuming has completed his inspection and returned to Panyang this morning. At 5:00 PM, he hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at the Commander's Office. Deputy Commander Liang Huasheng and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang were present. Commander Du told reporters that the main force of the Communist army in Benxi has been disbanded, and Shenyang can be guaranteed to be safe from now on. Du also said: The most important thing is that the people of Benxi can be liberated. After Du finished speaking, the reporter asked about the takeover of Andong. Du said: It can be carried out after the traffic is restored.

[Another telegram] The Communist army (Liaodong Military Region) Zeng Kelin and Zhang Xueshi used the mountains and ridges of Shenyang, Liaoyang, and Benxi to prevent the National Army from going to Benxi to take over. The Communist army gathered its 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th brigades, as well as an artillery regiment and guards, and repeatedly harassed the troops stationed on the south bank of the Hun River, coerced the people to prevent spring plowing, plundered food, forcibly recruited men, destroyed traffic, and claimed to peek into Shenyang. Our troops taking over Benxi set out on the 28th of last month, and cleared the resistance of the Communist army along the way, entering Benxi at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, and are now restoring order and appeasing the residents.

Zheng Jiemin Talks in Peiping; Communist Army's Capture of Changchun Is Unreasonable

[United Press, Peiping, 3rd] Communist Party officials believe that the scale of the civil war in the Northeast and North China is not only comparable to before the ceasefire agreement was established, but almost equal. General Zheng Jiemin, the government representative of the Executive Headquarters, told reporters that, in his view, "the situation in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious." He said: The Communist army's capture of Changchun is unreasonable, because the government had received it beforehand. But no matter how the situation develops, we must do our best to find some reasonable solution to prevent the situation from worsening further. According to news from both the Chinese Communist Party over the past week, it is believed that at least nine different locations are currently engaged in military activity or fierce fighting: (1) Sipingjie, 70 miles south of Changchun; (2) Benxihu, 42 miles southeast of Jiyang; (3) the railway line from Shanhaiguan to Jinzhou; (4) Communist commando teams of 200 to 2,000 people are constantly destroying the railway between Peiping and Tianjin; (5) the railway line between Peiping and Baoding, where mutual bombardment with artillery, mortars, machine guns, and rifles is a daily occurrence; (6) the railway line between Qingdao and Jinan; (7) the northern Jiangsu area; (8) the "Central China Military Region"; (9) fierce fighting has broken out again in northern Shanxi.

### Zhou Enlai and Others Arrive in Beijing, To Confer with Government and Marshal Ma Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] CCP representatives Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, Lu Dingyi, Liao Chengzhi, Wang Bingnan, and over sixty staff members from the Xinhua News Agency and Xinhua Daily, arrived in Beijing at 6:00 PM and 6:10 PM respectively, aboard two aircraft. Zhou and Deng were aboard Marshal Ma's "Constellation" aircraft. After disembarking, Zhou and Deng went by car to their new residence in Meiyuan New Village for rest. They did not make any statements to the Chinese and foreign reporters present. However, Lu Dingyi made a propagandistic statement, claiming that the Central Plains War had already begun, and the Central Government had ordered eleven armies and twenty-six divisions to attack the Communist forces. He also stated that Mao Zedong intended to release the American reporter and Central News Agency and Central Daily reporters captured in Changchun, but the method was still under study. Furthermore, CCP representative Dong Biwu is currently staying in Chongqing and is scheduled to come to Beijing next Tuesday.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] President Chiang, Special Envoy Marshall, and CCP representative Zhou Enlai have successively arrived in Beijing. However, the Northeast issue, which the world is watching with great interest, whether negotiations can resume in the short term is still something that each party expects. According to our reporter, Marshall and President Chiang will not discuss the Northeast issue in the next two days, as both sides are awaiting the CCP's response as to whether they are willing to withdraw from Changchun. Judging from the CCP's current actions, they may temporarily avoid the difficult Northeast issue and emphasize the so-called seriousness of the Central Plains Military Region, in order to buy time to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of the Northeast situation and its consequences. If so, whether the Northeast negotiations can resume within the next week is still uncertain, because the government is determined to receive Changchun in order to safeguard national sovereignty.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] CCP representative Zhou Enlai avoided giving concrete answers when asked about the "Central Plains Region" war and the Northeast situation, only saying that he would continue negotiations with the government and Marshal Ma after arriving in Beijing. It is also learned that the Youth Party delegation will come to Beijing on the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Council, told this newspaper that although negotiations for peace, unity, and unification are fraught with difficulties, he believes that understanding can eventually be reached, and the national affairs can still be viewed optimistically.

### President Chiang Receives Hoover in Beijing, Discussing China's Food Problem, Hoover Returns to Shanghai the Same Day and Flies to Seoul for Inspection

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] President Truman's personal representative, former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, accompanied by Food Minister Xu Kan, arrived in Beijing by plane from Shanghai at 11:20 AM today. Marshall personally welcomed Hoover at the Dajiaochang Airport at 11:10 AM. More than thirty people, including Vice Minister of Transportation Ling Hongxun, were also present to welcome him. After disembarking, Hoover shook hands with the welcoming party and then went to Marshall's residence on Ninghai Road with Marshall to rest. Minister Xu Kan told reporters at the airport that the UNRRA would ship a large quantity of rice to China.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] After arriving in Beijing, President Chiang met with former U.S. President Hoover and Special Envoy Marshall at the military academy official residence at 3:00 PM this afternoon. President Chiang expressed his gratitude to Mr. Hoover for his long journey to investigate the urgent relief needs of various countries in the Far East, especially his concern for the post-disaster recovery in China's disaster areas, the allocation of food at the present time, and transportation problems. He exchanged views on the urgent food transportation problem. The conversation lasted for more than an hour. Then at 4:20 PM, he personally went to the airport to see Hoover off. Hoover's special plane took off for Shanghai at 4:30 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Former U.S. President Hoover, currently Chairman of the Emergency Relief Committee, and his entourage, Mayper, Copthorne, and Fitzgerald, were hosted at a banquet by Foreign Minister Wang Shijie this afternoon. Marshal Marshall, General McClure, Admiral Cooke, Admiral Murray, Counselor Smysor of the U.S. Embassy, and our military and political leaders Chief of Staff General He Yingqin, Minister Chen Cheng, Minister Xu Kan, Secretary-General Jiang Menglin, Vice Minister Gan Naiguang, and Vice Minister Liu Kai were all invited to attend. In the afternoon, President Chiang and his wife hosted a tea party for Hoover and Marshal Marshall at the official residence. The President expressed his gratitude to Mr. Hoover for his enthusiasm in solving China's food shortage, and recalled that during the Yangtze River flood in China in 1931, Mr. Hoover, during his presidency, had donated a huge sum of money. After the tea party, the President and his wife personally saw Mr. Hoover off to the plane. Mr. Hoover and his party left Beijing for Shanghai at 4:30 PM. He is scheduled to fly to Seoul, Korea tomorrow, and then to Tokyo the day after tomorrow, and then return home. According to Minister of Food Xu Kan, China's food shortage is severe. He requested the United States to ship 200,000 tons of grain to China every month from May to August, and to find ways to help China solve transportation problems, so that the grain can be transported to the areas where the disaster is currently serious after it arrives at the port. In principle, Mr. Hoover has expressed his agreement.

### Relief for China's Severe Disaster, First Solve Transportation Difficulties, Hoover Speaks to Shanghai Residents

[Report from This Newspaper] "Relief Envoy" Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover returned to Shanghai from Beijing at 4:30 PM yesterday. At 6:30 PM, he held a press conference with Chinese and foreign journalists on the eighth floor of the Construction Building, giving a speech for half an hour, accompanied by Lieutenant General Gillon, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army in China, Kaiser, Director of the UNRRA in China, and Connors.

### Heavily Damaged by War, China Needs Food Urgently

First, Mr. Hoover read a written statement. Throughout the meeting, Mr. Hoover kept his head down, looking at the documents in his hand as he spoke, his tone heavy. He said that China's food needs are very large. China has suffered eight years of war damage, agricultural decline, and the pain of droughts and floods. There is currently no sufficient material to accurately calculate the actual tonnage of food needed, but the number must exceed the amount transported to the interior. During the serious period from May to September, various transportation capacities must be utilized as much as possible to distribute 200,000 tons of food to each district every month.

As a result of a long-term lack of organization, the number of starving people cannot be accurately counted, but it is undoubtedly estimated to be in the millions, because the disaster areas are distributed in many provinces. Reports from Chinese and foreign authorities state that the number of starving people in the inland provinces is increasing daily, due to their inability to resist infectious diseases. Entire villages and townships have not yet died out in the vast areas, but if supplies cannot be delivered, this serious situation will inevitably occur within a few weeks.

### Relieving China's Food Shortage, Transportation is the Most Difficult

Mr. Hoover then answered written questions from reporters, saying that the food shortage problem is far more serious than the war disaster, but what is comforting is that this dangerous problem can be solved from September 1st this year, because September is the time of the great harvest, and the world's grain-producing areas can supply food.

The most difficult thing in relieving China's disaster is the "transportation" problem. Without convenient transportation, even with a large supply, it will be of no avail. China has suffered the three most painful disasters in the world: (1) war disaster, (2) drought disaster, (3) flood disaster. It has been devastated in recent years. Thousands of miles of railways have been destroyed, many waterways have been blocked, and transportation tools are lacking. This is also different from Europe. European countries have fewer transportation difficulties, and public health is more advanced, so it is convenient to transport relief supplies, and the mortality rate can be reduced. If China can solve the transportation problem, the dangerous situation can be eliminated. Special Envoy Marshall discussed this point face-to-face with the US government during his return to the United States, and has requested the allocation of a number of aircraft for transporting food in China. Colonel Harrison, Personal Representative of President Truman, is responsible for investigating the food shortage situation in China, and the UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) will be responsible for distributing relief and resolving transportation problems. The objects of relief will absolutely not be distinguished by party affiliation, religion, or other relationships. The people in the communist areas will also be treated equally.

### Inspecting the World's Food Shortage, Mr. Hoover Has Three Tasks

Mr. Hoover reported that the three tasks of this inspection of Europe and Asia are: (1) To investigate the famine situation in various countries and determine which countries need the most food relief. (2) To discuss the use of materials from countries with surplus materials. (3) To return to the country and make a detailed factual report to President Truman. Mr. Hoover said that there are six food experts who came with him, five of whom worked with him on food relief during World War I and have rich experience. When asked about political issues by a reporter, Mr. Hoover stated that he had no other tasks other than food on this trip and did not want to talk about political issues. He was also unwilling to disclose what he discussed with Marshal Marshall in Nanjing, and various criticisms of the relief situation in China were also not within the scope of his mission. Mr. Hoover specifically emphasized: "Difficult problems are always in front, not behind. We should try to build the future."

Mr. Hoover also reported that there are currently about 800 million disaster victims worldwide, including 325 million in Europe, 220 million in the Indian Ocean region, and 300 million in the Pacific region. The investigation of the daily food intake per person is measured in calories, with 2,200 calories, 1,800 calories, or 1,250 calories. The lowest is only 1,000 calories. Comparing the food shortage of World War I with this time, Mr. Hoover said that World War I destroyed less farmland, so it was easier to restore the original state, and supplies could be produced to provide assistance, which is quite different this time.

Mr. Hoover stated that the US authorities are determined to collect as much surplus material as possible to help various countries. The American people themselves are doing their best to reduce and save food to supply to the disaster victims. Canada, Argentina, and Siam all have surplus grain. Although Siam has a considerable amount of rice, it is also limited by transportation difficulties and cannot be transported. They are now trying to repair roads and build bridges to improve transportation.

### Hope for China's Unification to Save Countless Lives

Finally, Mr. Hoover expressed his admiration and gratitude for the cooperative spirit of the relevant authorities in China and the United States, church groups, the Red Cross, and various volunteer service organizations. He then hoped that all the people of China could cooperate and unite in the future to save countless lives.

Mr. Hoover is scheduled to fly to Seoul, Korea this morning to inspect, then go to Japan, and then return to Washington to report to President Truman.

### A General Who Recently Returned to Shanghai Talks About the Northeast Situation Awaiting Clarification, Hoping the Communist Army Will Cooperate Sincerely with the Nation as the Priority, More Than a Thousand Students Join the Army and Have Been Organized into an Independent Battalion

[Report from This Newspaper] I recently visited a senior National Army general who flew to Shanghai from the Northeast a week ago. He said that the areas currently controlled by the National Army in the Northeast can in fact be categorized by Shenyang, Sipingjie, Yingkou, and Fushun. The communist army is transporting to the Northeast by land from northern Jiangsu on foot to Rehe, advancing along the Beining Road in the snow. Because the majority is forced, there are complaints everywhere and there is no fighting spirit. Those who transport by sea are from Qingdao, and they take Japanese motorboats. Their equipment is taken entirely from Japanese prisoners. The public is coerced to act as their vanguard, and they are especially accustomed to using tactics of densely packed formations, in fact sacrificing the public.

The number of National Army soldiers in the Northeast is far fewer than that of the communist army, but with justice on their side, their morale does not flag. In the Battle of Shaling, the National Army, with a ratio of 20 to 1, and with less than two battalions of military strength, resisted six regiments of the Communist Army. As a result, the Communist Army still suffered 20,000 casualties and retreated. Examining this Communist Army offensive, their intention is in fact to cut off the Beining Line, so that the entire Northeast falls into their hands. However, our army discovered their scheme early and accurately seized the railway. Although the Communist Army destroyed it many times, our army was able to repair it in a short period of time, so the Communist Army's initial intention has become a bubble.

The people of the Northeast wholeheartedly support the government. Everywhere the National Army goes, the warmth of the welcome is truly inspiring. Many elders listed their tragic experiences to the National Army soldiers, even to the point of tears, which saddened those who heard it. Many young students in the Northeast joined the army. More than a thousand people are currently gathered in Jinzhou and Beiping, and an independent battalion has been formed among them, listed as a youth army.

Although the number of communist army soldiers is large, they are ultimately a mix. Therefore, positions such as artillerymen are mostly filled by Japanese prisoners. Our army is a hundred-battle-hardened army. If we talk about strength, there is really no problem. If the Communist Army cannot abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and wants to go its own way, then the National Army will naturally only have to forcibly take over. At that time, destroying the old and rotten will be an easy task. However, after Marshall's arrival in Beijing, the KMT-CPC (Nationalist-Communist) issue can certainly find a solution, and we deeply hope for sincere cooperation, with the nation as the priority. China really cannot fight any more. For the past eight years, people have been separated from their families. At present, victory has arrived, but people are still separated from their families. It is extremely heartbreaking. This is what we deeply hope that the Communist Army can thoroughly change and repent.

As for the Communist Army's rumors that there are American advisors in the National Army, the spokesperson absolutely denied it, saying: "At present, there are absolutely no Americans in the Northeast National Army." The spokesperson admitted that the National Army's transportation and supply are still making little progress. The railway is destroyed from time to time, and there is very little control over sea transport. Therefore, the clarification of the situation in the Northeast may still take a considerable amount of time.

Editorial

### Promoting the Spirit of the May Fourth Movement!

Today marks the twenty-seventh anniversary of the student movement that swept the nation from Peiping (Beijing), a manifestation of China's national awakening; this is the momentous May Fourth Movement. In the history of China's national liberation movement, the May Fourth Movement holds epoch-making significance. Many of those who participated in this movement back then have now become the backbone of various sectors of Chinese society. Recalling the vigorous movement that began on this day twenty-seven years ago, now that the War of Resistance has been won, the land has been restored to its glory, and the nation is entering the stage of national construction, reminiscing about the past cannot but evoke a multitude of emotions. After twenty-seven years, although the fervent emotions of that time have changed with the variations of time, it is still necessary for young friends today to commemorate "May Fourth" and continue to carry forward the "May Fourth" spirit.

The so-called "May Fourth Movement" originally had both political and cultural significance in contemporary Chinese history. From a political standpoint, there are also two aspects: external and internal. From the external aspect, it was the earliest and most concrete manifestation of the Chinese national movement, and it was also the beginning of the Chinese youth's movement to uphold national rights. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, national consciousness had already begun to grow among some Chinese people. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan intensified its aggression against us, becoming increasingly fierce. Therefore, China's national movement was almost inseparable from anti-Japanese consciousness. During the First World War, Japan took advantage of the great powers being preoccupied in Western Europe and intensified its aggression against us, proposing the so-called Twenty-One Demands, attempting to turn the entire China into a Japanese dependency. At that time, the rulers disregarded national interests and fawned on Japan in many ways, thus arousing public outrage. Students in Peiping held strikes and demonstrations, destroying the residences of the "traitors" Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, and Zhang Zongxiang, and for a time, all regions responded, affecting the entire country. From its external political significance, the May Fourth Movement was indeed the initial and concrete manifestation of the Chinese national movement. Due to this movement, the Chinese delegates to the Paris Peace Conference finally refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles; also because of this movement, the Washington Naval Conference was eventually convened and Shandong was returned to China. Therefore, the May Fourth Movement was quite successful in its external political significance. China's resistance against Japanese aggression, since the May Fourth Movement, through the May Thirtieth Incident during the Northern Expedition era, the Battle of the Great Wall after the September 18th Incident, the Battle of Shanghai, until today after the July 7th Incident, has only fulfilled its mission with the victorious conclusion of the War of Resistance. From its internal political significance, the May Fourth Movement was a movement to fight for democracy. The Republic of China, established following the Xinhai Revolution, was occupied by warlords and remnants of feudalism, and politics were corrupt, and human rights were not guaranteed. In order to combat the corrupt bureaucracy of the time and promote the spirit of revolution, bureaucrats like Cao Rulin who sought personal gain through treason were attacked. This was essentially continuing the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution and a revolutionary movement to fight for democracy.

As a political movement, the May Fourth Movement externally involved anti-Japanese demonstrations to ensure national survival, and internally involved the struggle for civil rights to seek political reform; its characteristics were nationalism and "democracy"—civil rights or (democracy) ideology. Judging by its nature, the meaning of this movement was somewhat similar to the student movements that appeared in Germany and continental Europe in the 1840s after the Congress of Vienna. At that time, Peiping was the center of higher education in our country. We cannot know whether the rise of this movement directly or indirectly received the influence of the student movements that appeared in continental Europe in the nineteenth century. However, in terms of its development form and significance, the May Fourth Movement was somewhat similar to the student movements that appeared in continental Europe in the nineteenth century. From the perspective of Chinese politics, after the May Fourth Movement, the evolution of Chinese politics turned to a new path, which was the struggle of the masses. Before this, revolutionaries either engaged in assassinations of powerful figures or engaged in inciting the military, often failing to pay attention to the power of mass movements. The May Fourth Movement opened a new path for Chinese politics to win over the masses. Subsequently, the reorganization of the Chinese Nationalist Party and the birth of the Chinese Communist Party were both directly and indirectly influenced by the May Fourth Movement. Because the May Fourth Movement ignited vigorous nationalism, the Chinese National Revolution also gained a new force. By utilizing this new force, the National Revolution actively and smoothly unfolded, eventually overthrowing the warlords and completing unification.

However, the significance of the May Fourth Movement in the political field seems to be less than its significance in the cultural field. Although the May Fourth Movement itself was a political movement, the ideological liberation caused by the rise of this movement played a significant role in the cultural field. In the cultural sphere, the most well-known is, of course, the so-called New Culture Movement and the establishment of vernacular literature. The entry of dialects into texts was "already present in ancient times." After the May Fourth Movement, because of the promotion of new literature and art, the scope of the use of vernacular language in texts was expanded. Today, we use vernacular language to write articles. To those before the May Fourth Movement, especially those classical prose writers, they would probably say that this is an insult to Chinese characters. However, today, except for stubborn conservatives, vernacular literature is the general standard. The constructive role of the May Fourth Movement in the cultural field is probably just this one point. Beyond this, its role in the cultural field can be said to be mostly negative and destructive. Under the cry of "Down with the Confucian Shop," our inherent traditions, the cultural heritage left to us by our ancestors, were often despised. At that time, some people even advocated "non-filial piety" and advocated "public wives." Looking at this now, it is inevitably filled with the exposure of infantile diseases, but at that time, it was earnestly and enthusiastically discussed by "newly-minded" new youths, just like "communism." Starting from the inherent traditions of our country, doubts arose about the records of past Chinese history, especially ancient history. The result of the evolution of the atmosphere of doubt later was the bankruptcy of all traditional values. Since "non-filial piety" can be advocated, infidelity, unchastity, and even illegality can be advocated; at this point, our country's inherent code of conduct lost its regularity, moral standards were no longer praised, and the discipline of society was also crumbling!

After liberating the shackles of our country's inherent ideological traditions, after the May Fourth Movement, Chinese thought was dominated by two foreign ideological trends. Until now, the Chinese intellectual world has not been able to completely liberate itself from these two ideological trends. The first is the so-called empiricism and superficial liberalism; the second is Marxism and its associated aggregate of consciousness. After the May Fourth Movement, Professor Dewey of Columbia University in the United States temporarily seemed to replace Confucius, the "teacher of all ages." Later, Bertrand Russell from England came. After the Confucian shop was overthrown, Dewey and Russell seemed to have become a "sage" and a "vice-sage," respectively. This ideological trend, more than twenty years later, is still talked about with relish today. This is because Chinese scholars, for more than twenty years, have certainly broken free from the shackles of the Confucian shop, but have also added the shackles of the superficialities of Western doctrines. They have not seen the entire picture of Western culture, but adhere to the prejudice of pseudo-knowledge. Those who boast of being progressive have broken through this prejudice, but have added another shackle without realizing that they cannot extricate themselves. This is the shackle of Marxism. From Marx, Engels, Lenin, and even Plekhanov, etc., saying that their thoughts can represent absolute truth and will never change, who can believe it? However, Chinese "literati," "scholars," or "virtuous persons," and "celebrities," because they are fond of fashion, still seem to be savoring Marxism-Leninism with relish. Of course, Marxism-Leninism must be used to discuss politics and economics, and even Marxism-Leninism must be used to discuss history and culture, insisting that a certain era in China is a certain kind of society. Although this is despised by discerning people in the academic and ideological circles, who believe that it is like those who carve a mark on a boat to find a lost sword, it is also enough to see the depth of the remaining poison of the shackle of Marxism-Leninism.

Today, when we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we should be vigilant. For more than twenty years, our intellectual world has not been able to liberate itself from superficial prejudices, which is our shame. The consequences caused by the May Fourth Movement back then were the overthrow of our traditional idols. Destruction was a necessary means of construction, but we cannot have only destruction without construction. Today, the country has won the War of Resistance, and we have completed one of the political goals of the initial May Fourth Movement. In the cultural field, the work of construction should be actively promoted along with the unfolding of the great cause of national construction. We must liberate ourselves from narrow prejudices and establish a culture of the Three Principles of the People that is suitable for China's national conditions. Only in this way can we continue to carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement.

### Tokyo International Tribunal Opens: Japanese War Criminals Submissively Stand Trial; Indictment Reading Unfinished Yesterday, to Resume This Morning; Okawa Has Mental Breakdown in Court, Repeatedly Slaps Tojo's Head

[Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 3rd] The trial of twenty-eight major Japanese war criminals began this morning. The court is located within the Army Ministry, with the nine judges' seats facing the defendants' dock, and the Allied dignitaries' gallery to the left. Around 10:00 AM, General Zhu Shuming, accompanied by General Eichelberger, commander of the Eighth Army, attended the hearing. The Allied and Japanese press seats are set up to the right. Allied personnel and Japanese spectators are all in the court's second floor, and the International Military Tribunal prosecutors' seats are in the center of the courtroom. The trial was scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM, but IItagaki and Kimura, who had just been escorted from Bangkok and arrived at Atsugi Airport, were still waiting to be taken to court for trial, which slightly delayed the start. The court waited for an hour, but they hadn't arrived, leaving two seats vacant in the defendant's dock. Six Japanese war criminals, led by Kido, entered the court one after another and sat quietly in the defendant's dock. Tojo sat in the center of the front row, with Doihara to his right, Hata Shunroku, Hirota, and Minami Jiro, and Hoshino, Kaya, and Kido to his left. The remaining criminals were seated behind Tojo. The Allied prosecutors, led by Chief Prosecutor Keenan, took their seats in the center. At this time, Bailiff Captain Mead announced: "Everyone stand, the judges are entering." Amidst the sound of everyone standing, Chief Judge Webb led the way, and the judges took their seats under the flags of the nine Allied nations in order. Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao sat in the first position below the Chief Judge, and journalists from various Allied countries all witnessed the Chinese judge receiving this honorable seat. They all whispered to each other. The reporter told them that China lost 20 million people during the War of Resistance, so it should occupy a seat in all international honors events. Chief Judge Webb first announced the opening of the court, and Keenan then introduced each prosecutor to each judge. The first one to be introduced was Chinese Prosecutor Xiang Zhexun, saying that he was the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court of the Republic of China. All the people paid close attention to this Chinese prosecutor, especially attracting the attention of the Japanese war criminals. After this, each translator raised their hands under the leadership of Captain Mead and swore an oath, expressing their loyalty. At around 11:15 AM, Chief Judge Webb announced a recess, and the court would reconvene at 2:30 PM in the afternoon.

In his opening remarks, Chief Judge Webb said, "Never in the history of the judgment of criminals has there been one as important as today's. We are a tribunal organized by civilians, selected by the Supreme Courts of each country. On the other hand, the defendants are the leaders of the peak of Japan. The defendants are guilty of three crimes: disrupting world peace, violating the customs of war, and violating humanitarianism. Such heinous crimes can only be tried by organizing an international military tribunal."

At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the court continued. Keenan handed the indictment to the judges, and Webb ordered Captain Mead to read the indictment to each criminal. When the translator recited the section in the indictment about Japanese militarists massacring the Chinese people in Japanese, Okawa Shumei, the perpetrator of the former Mukden Incident and chief advocate of expelling whites from Asia, suddenly laughed loudly. Okawa was sitting behind Tojo. When he heard Tojo's words about disrupting international law and attacking Pearl Harbor, he suddenly slapped Tojo's bald head with his right hand. Tojo only responded with a bitter smile. When the translator read the section that hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and unarmed people were massacred by the Japanese in Nanjing, Okawa slapped Tojo's head a second time, and then muttered prayers, unbuttoned his shirt, and exposed his emaciated chest. At this time, laughter broke out in the courtroom. Bailiff Captain Mead shouted, "Maintain order." Okawa was finally dragged out of the courtroom by military police. By 4:45 PM, the indictment had been read to the forty-seventh article. Chief Judge Webb announced a recess and scheduled the trial to resume at 9:30 AM the next morning. By then, the indictment can be completely read, and the defendants will offer their defenses.

### Various Aspects of War Criminals: Emaciated Bodies Wearing Worn-Out Military Uniforms; Each Person Looks Like a Robber Being Tried After Committing a Crime

[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The world's largest murder case began today. Twenty-six tattered defendants sat in a magnificent courtroom. On their thin faces, they weakly wore a look of anger. This kind of expression was once a symbol of the Japanese who once dominated and were invincible. In the past, this expression was the trademark of the victorious Japanese, but now it is outwardly fierce but inwardly weak.

Feign Calmness

, it is indeed the traditional warlike nature of the island nation. These people sometimes regard themselves as modern samurai, wanting to inherit the good dreams of past conquests. Tojo seemed to want to imitate the Spartan warriors, and Matsuoka Yosuke, although a civil servant who loved comfort, seemed to want to share in the "difficulties of previous money." Marquis Kido was formerly the highest-ranking civil servant of the Empire, wearing a very plain uniform, even when attending Emperor Hirohito. Today, they will be subjected to a trial of life and death. They entered the courtroom with a look of frustration that cannot be concealed by anger. This frustration once tightly gripped countless wartime sufferers under their tyranny. They were wearing worn-out military uniforms, draped over their emaciated bodies due to imprisonment, making them look

Strange and Funny

Like Tojo and others, they will undoubtedly try their best to defend themselves in court to prove the "legitimacy" of their war. Most of the defendants will try to shirk responsibility. As the trial continues, some may become more and more indifferent. Although this morning's brief court session was a routine procedure, it also gives a glimpse into how the true colors of these former rulers will gradually be exposed. In front of these people are those who are judging their past behavior, neatly dressed and well-mannered. Surrounding them are military police in beautiful uniforms. These powerful children defeated their fanciful but actually vulnerable army. In the gallery above the defendants' dock are a few relatives and friends of the defendants and representatives of the Japanese government. Strangely enough, Tojo is

Most Uncomfortable

Among all the defendants. The man who attempted suicide so poorly sat with a sunken face, with a briefcase in front of him, the big one being his "self-defense statement." Tojo also put on his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, just like in his wartime photos. Kido's expression was like a naughty boy arrested for mischief, maintaining this appearance throughout the opening session. On his face with glasses, a look of anger curved. He may be the shortest of all the defendants, barely able to see over the front of the dock. Matsuoka, who was once powerful in the Foreign Ministry, and Minami Jiro, who was once a major figure in the military clique, both had

Gaunt Cheeks

Due to living in prison for a long time, they are not very attractive. Among all the defendants, Matsuoka is probably the only one who can understand English statements. The others must wait for the slow translation procedure. Some other major criminals look like robbers being tried after committing a crime. General Shimada has a scar on the lower left cheek. General Saito sat next to him, staring intently, like a strict follower of precepts, wearing a swollen military uniform. Former Prime Minister Koiso had a pursed mouth and an arrogant attitude. In the defendant's dock in a murder trial, there has never been such a contrast.

### Odds and Ends

The viewing gallery in the court was packed from the earliest moment, with the majority being Japanese, including a son and a daughter of former Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke.

Everyone who came to the venue to observe the proceedings was searched by the American military police, but no contraband was found.

Sir Wright, Chairman of the United Nations War Crimes Commission, also attended the hearing. Mr. Wright was formerly a Judge of the High Court of England, and his visit to Japan this time was at the invitation of MacArthur.

Most of the criminals wore casual clothes, with only Hashimoto Kingoro wearing wooden clogs. The criminals once commanded tens of thousands of people, but now they have no theatrical style. On the first day of the criminals' appearance in court, they were provided with a delicious lunch to quickly recover, with dishes including braised beef slices, beef bottles, mashed potatoes, white pagoda green beans, bread, white pagoda oil, and coffee.

Hasegawa, who once served as Secretary to Foreign Minister Matsuoka, predicted that if Matsuoka's treatment does not change, he will die before the end of the trial.

The defendants remained calm and composed when the indictment was read. Shigemitsu Aoi frequently shook his head, seemingly expressing dissatisfaction. The elderly Matsuoka Yosuke even fell asleep.

### Twenty American Lawyers: Defend Japanese War Criminals

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The War Department announced today that it has selected twenty civilian lawyers to defend Japanese war criminals Tojo and the other twenty-seven, plus four military lawyers, to fly to Tokyo next week.

### Internal Conspirators in Iran: Rais Shoti Arrested

Soviet Troops Withdrawing from Iranian Territory

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The Daily Mail's Tehran correspondent reports that Rais Shoti, a powerful figure behind the scenes in the Iranian Royal Palace, was arrested yesterday morning under the orders of Iranian Prime Minister Sadana. Leftists say Rais Shoti had a conspiracy against the Prime Minister, which is the reason for the disagreement between the Iranian King and the Prime Minister. Political figures attach great importance to Rais Shoti's arrest, believing that it may cause major events.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] Reports from Iran say that Soviet troops are now stepping up their withdrawal in order to meet the promise to complete the withdrawal by May 6 and allow the Security Council to end the issue. This report has been confirmed by diplomatic figures here.

### Shidehara Recommends: Hatoyama to Form Cabinet; Requests MacArthur's Understanding

[Reconstruction Daily News, Tokyo, 3rd] Shidehara entered the palace to meet the Japanese Emperor at 5:00 PM today, recommending Liberal Party leader Hatoyama as the new Prime Minister. At the same time, Shidehara or Yoshida visited MacArthur, requesting understanding on the recommendation of Hatoyama. In addition, the Liberal, Socialist, Cooperative, and Communist parties held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the policy agreement案 between the Liberal and Socialist parties, with only the Communist Party expressing opposition.

### Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: Gloomy Prospects, Agreement on Treaties with Italy and Other Countries Appears Highly Unlikely

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 3rd (Broadcast): The London Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent learned from reliable sources today that the hope for signing a treaty with Italy has become even dimmer. The American and Soviet foreign ministers met separately today with representatives of Yugoslavia and Italy to discuss the border issue between the two countries.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] According to opinions expressed today by leading representatives attending the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, barring unforeseen developments, there is little hope that this conference will reach any agreement on any treaties. Officials from Britain, the United States, and France privately stated that while it is too early to predict that the conference will break down completely, after a week of discussions among the four foreign ministers, it appears that no progress has been made on any contentious issue. It is said that the US Secretary of State's request yesterday to amend the armistice terms for Italy and other countries indicates that the hope for reaching an agreement on treaties in the short term has rapidly faded.

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] When the Foreign Ministers Conference resumes today, it will discuss the important issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border. The Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Kardelj, leading a delegation of twenty-eight, has arrived in Paris. He will represent Yugoslavia in stating its position, and Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi will also speak on behalf of Italy.

[United Press, Paris, 2nd] Dissatisfied with the slow progress of the conference, the four foreign ministers have decided today to indefinitely suspend formal meetings and instead hold informal discussions daily. However, the first informal meeting this afternoon lasted only two and a half hours, and its results were no better than the formal meetings.

Dalmatian Islands: Issue of Affiliation Resolved

[United Press, Paris, 2nd] US Secretary of State Byrnes proposed today at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference that a committee be established in Italy to continue prosecuting war criminals after the treaty is signed. This proposal was blocked by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and did not pass. The four foreign ministers have designated the Adriatic island of Pelagosa to Yugoslavia and Pianosa Island to Italy, and stipulated that neither island may be fortified, and the fishing rights of the people of both countries should be respected. According to British sources, the Foreign Ministers Conference has also designated all the islands along the Dalmatian coast to Yugoslavia, but they must not be militarized. Meanwhile, at the request of France, a Franco-Italian border investigation team has reportedly arrived at the Col de Montgenèvre in the Alps. Also, a dispatch from Vienna reports that the German-speaking people of South Tyrol held demonstrations, protesting the Foreign Ministers Conference's failure to recognize Austria's claim to the area.

Byrnes Issues Warning: No Intention to Aid Defeated Nations

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] US Secretary of State Byrnes today called on the Allied nations to revise the treaty terms for Axis satellite states and warned the Soviet Union that the United States has no intention of allocating funds to aid defeated nations, so the Soviet Union may obtain reparations from the defeated nations. Byrnes issued this warning while the foreign ministers of the US, Soviet Union, Britain, and France were discussing the treaty with Italy. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov said that the Soviet Union must receive 200 million yuan in reparations, with another 100 million yuan going to Yugoslavia and Greece. When the conference reached a complete impasse, Byrnes made this suggestion regarding revising the treaty conditions.

### America's Top Criminals Stage Armed Rebellion in Prison, Most Guards in Danger

[United Press, San Francisco, 2nd] Alcatraz Prison, located on an island in San Francisco Bay, houses America's most notorious murderers and robbers. The inmates suddenly staged an armed rebellion today. Prison official Johnston said that the inmates have machine guns and have locked a group of prison staff in various cells. Police authorities announced that as of 5:12 PM, the situation was still not under control, and firing continued inside the prison. Although prison officials claimed that no casualties had been reported, earlier reports indicated that two people had been injured. Patrol boats have surrounded the island. It is now known that one guard has been killed and five injured. The details of the rebellion are still unknown, but it is known that the lives of most of the guards are in extreme danger. No inmates have been able to escape from the island. Previously, two inmates attempted to escape, but have since disappeared and are presumed to have drowned.

### Arab Higher Committee Rejects Palestine Investigation Report, Drafts Disobedience Plan, Sends Letter to British Prime Minister, Less Than an Ultimatum, Arab League Holds General Strike to Protest

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 3rd] After a five-hour meeting yesterday to study the British-American investigation report on Palestine, the Arab Higher Committee appointed an emergency sub-committee to draft a disobedience plan to mobilize Arab youth and resources to serve the country. The sub-committee will organize public rallies throughout Palestine and raise funds for the Arab National Fund to promote the Arab national movement. The Arab Higher Committee has sent a protest letter to British Prime Minister Attlee and will send an Arab delegation to Aden and neighboring Arab countries to carry out activities.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] The Arab Higher Committee announced today that it has sent a letter to British Prime Minister Attlee, rejecting the recommendations of the Palestine problem investigation team, and said that the Arabs are prepared to defend themselves by all means and fight for national liberation again. This letter is just short of an ultimatum and was handed over to British High Commissioner for Palestine, Cunningham. The Committee has telegraphed to Arab countries calling for joint defense of Palestine, and said that it will study a plan to mobilize Arab youth to continue the struggle until death. Leading Arab figures told United Press reporters that they are currently drafting a memorandum to refute the investigation team's report point by point. The Arabs' overall response to the report has begun to materialize.

[Reuters, Cairo, 3rd] Arab countries will hold a general strike on May 10 to protest the British-American investigation report. Beirut will implement the general strike today, and all industries and businesses are at a standstill. It is reported that Lebanese officials and civilians are quite indignant about this report, and the Iraqi government has also lodged a serious protest with Britain and the United States.

Britain Requests US Military Assistance

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Authoritative sources have learned that because both Arabs and Jews oppose the investigation report, the situation there is deteriorating. Britain will request additional US troops in the next few days to strengthen the existing garrison in Palestine. It is also learned that the British Foreign Secretary has sent a note to US Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, inquiring about what assistance the United States can provide to implement the recommendations in the report.

[United Press, London, 2nd] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that whether Britain will transfer the mandate of Palestine to a United Nations agency will be decided after consultations with the United States.

Arab League Secretary-General Speaks

[United Press, Cairo, 2nd] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam told reporters tonight that the seven countries of the Arab League will certainly take unified action with the Palestinian Arabs, but we have not yet reached the stage of war.

British Military Commander Meets Cunningham

### Fish that Slipped Through the Net: Kita, Terauchi, Prince Kan'in, etc., Will Likely Find it Difficult to Evade Justice in the End

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The military gears and political buffers of Japan's war machine are now being accused as war criminals. Although the scope of the initial indictment only covers the outer layer, United Nations Chief Prosecutor Keenan stated that those not found on the list of defendants are not necessarily free from future liability. This shows that the Far East International Tribunal is proceeding step by step and does not want to involve too many people in the first trial. Judging from the current situation, the scope of this case will apparently extend to the Tanaka Memorial, so the number of people involved can be imagined. The fact that Emperor Hirohito of Japan was not included in the list of 28 defendants has been noted. At the same time, none of the major zaibatsu were included, which may be reserved for future investigation. General Doihara, who instigated the Mukden Incident, has been imprisoned and charged, but another general who committed similar atrocities in China has not been indicted. This person is Kita Seiichi, who is now captured by Soviet forces in Northeast China. The last commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in Southeast Asia, Terauchi Hisaichi, has also not been included. According to recent news, Terauchi is currently held by British forces and is seriously ill. General Okamura Yasutsugu, who led the last invasion war in China in 1944, has also not been mentioned. According to recent news, this person is still in China. Abe Nobuyuki, the prime minister at the beginning of the invasion of China and the last Governor-General of Korea, and Prince Kan'in, the former Chief of the General Staff, have not been included. In addition, Ayukawa Gisuke, the president of the Manchuria Heavy Industries Development Corporation, who used the zaibatsu to develop Manchurian resources to supply the military, is also yet to be indicted. In short, there are countless fish that have slipped through the net this time. However, since Tojo and others have already begun trial, those behind the scenes who were even more brutal will likely find it difficult to escape justice after a little time.

### The Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties in the City Will Be Divided into Three Methods: Evaluated Sale, Public Auction, and Sale Through Company Organization. Original Residents Will Be Notified to Move Out on the Day of the Public Tender Announcement

According to news from the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the Broadway Mansions, towering on the banks of the Suzhou Creek, and the various important enemy and puppet properties received by the Bureau will be sold separately. The sales methods have been approved by the Review Committee and submitted to President Song for approval. The methods are divided into: (1) Evaluated sale, limited to real estate designated by the applicant and approved by the Executive Yuan. First, the Central Trust Bureau will evaluate the price, and after review by the Disposal Bureau, it will be submitted to the Review Committee for approval before being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (2) Public auction, suitable for small and medium-sized real estate. The Central Trust Bureau will be entrusted to publish a tender announcement, and the detailed procedures will be determined separately. (3) Sale through company organization. Larger properties that are not easy to auction, such as apartments and whole lane houses, will first be evaluated by the Central Trust Bureau, reviewed by the Disposal Bureau, submitted to the Review Committee for review, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Then, a company will be organized to solicit shares, and an incentive method will be stipulated whereby subscribing to a certain amount of shares will allow one to rent a certain type of house, so that the shares can be sold out as soon as possible, and the property will be sold. In the future, Broadway Mansions and other places will be sold in this way. As for the sales conditions: (1) The price must be paid in cash. (2) The property certificate must first be transferred to the name of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui districts, with the Central Trust Bureau as the representative. After the transaction is completed, it will be transferred to the purchaser. (3) The sold houses must be vacated in advance and handed over on the day of the transaction. The winning bidder should pay the full bid price within thirty days from the date of signing the pre-contract. For the auctioned enemy and puppet properties, the original residents must be notified to move out on the day of the public tender announcement, providing a forty-day timeframe, which is quite sufficient.

### Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo Host Tea Party to Welcome Wu Tiecheng; Expresses Sincere Joy at Revisiting Old Haunts; Travelled to Capital Last Night to Participate in Ceremony Returning to Capital

Pan Gongzhan, advisor of this newspaper, and Cheng Cangbo, advisor of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, gathered prominent figures from the new open community in this city. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they held a tea party at the YMCA on Xizang Road to welcome Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. Over 70 people attended, including heads of various news agencies and guests. Pan Gongzhan gave a brief welcoming speech, stating, "Secretary-General Wu presided over the Central Party affairs and advised on major government policies during the war. News circles are eager to hear his wisdom on this visit to Shanghai. We are taking this opportunity to ask Mr. Wu to give us valuable instructions. If you have any questions regarding the domestic political situation, feel free to ask. Mr. Wu will be happy to answer." He then invited Secretary-General Wu to speak:

Two Different Impressions of Shanghai on This Visit

Wu rose amidst warm applause and delivered a speech in a solemn tone, saying, "I am a former public servant of Shanghai. After being away for nine years, I am sincerely pleased to see old friends again. The warm feelings are beyond words. This visit to Shanghai has given me two different impressions. First, although Shanghai was occupied for eight years, it did not suffer material destruction. Second, after the victory, the social conditions in the rear areas have completely changed compared to pre-war times. However, the social situation and lives of the citizens in Shanghai remain the same as before the war. One can hardly see any signs of eight years of war. If foreign friends from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration only visit Shanghai, they will mistakenly believe that the impact of the war on China was very small.

Shanghai's Prosperity Depends on Overall Stability and Peace

Shanghai was occupied for eight years, and all pre-war systems and order were destroyed. After the recovery, it was able to recover quickly in a very short period of time. This is due to the enthusiastic assistance and cooperation of the citizens and the press of the whole city. However, if Shanghai wants to fully restore its pre-war prosperity, or even become more prosperous than before, it cannot rely solely on the efforts of the citizens of Shanghai. It must rely on the stability and improvement of the overall situation. I can assure you that the government is determined to make all concessions that are conducive to the realization of peace, unity, unification and democracy. Furthermore, I feel that there are two contradictory concepts in the current political situation: one is the demand for democracy, and the other is the struggle for territory. I believe that the two concepts of democracy and territory cannot coexist. If we want to realize democracy, we must give up the army and territory. Conversely, if we demand democracy on the one hand and engage in armed separatism, attacking cities and seizing land on the other hand, not only will democracy not be realized, but peace, unity, and unification will not be realized either."

Pan Gongzhan Proposes Suggestions Regarding Traitor's Defense

After Wu finished speaking, the whole place applauded warmly. Then, Cheng Zhonghang stood up to introduce Xie Renzhao, the Chief of Secret Police of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, to report on the recent situation in the Central Plains. Finally, Fang Zhizhou, President of the Philippine New China News Agency, and Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Zhonghang, successively raised inquiries and expressed their opinions. Pan said: Recently, in the trials of traitor cases in various courts, the traitors under trial have often defended themselves strongly in court and publicly published "confessions". Some newspapers have spared no space to publish them, giving the traitors the convenience of covering up their crimes, which is inappropriate and needs to be stopped. Wu expressed his agreement and hoped that the press would keep the records of the traitors' strong defense and confessions as brief as possible. Cheng advocated that the press should be responsible for clarifying the truth about the evolution of the current situation, so as to correct public opinion, so that ambitious people cannot use the means of confusing public opinion to achieve their illegal and disruptive purposes. Wu also expressed his approval. The tea party ended at 6:30 PM. Secretary-General Wu came to Shanghai this time purely for a medical examination. He took the night train back to Beijing last night to participate in the grand ceremony of returning the capital to the central region.

### Shortage of Wharf and Warehouse Space; American Shipping Company Notifies Customers to Pick Up Goods at Shipside

[Report from this Newspaper] Recently, international shipping vessels have transported a large number of relief supplies to China. The American President Lines, acting as agent for the U.S. War Shipping Administration, has allocated four ships specifically for Shanghai, Southeast Asia, and Siam to transport rice. The first ship, the Ford Huehermer, arrived in port the day before yesterday. After the cargo is unloaded, it is scheduled to sail to Southeast Asia on the 5th. The other three ships are on their way to Shanghai. It is also reported that the American President Lines has more than 20 ships in Shanghai. Due to the lack of wharf and warehouse space, it is inconvenient to unload goods, which delays the ship schedule. To remedy this, the company has notified customers to pick up goods at shipside. In addition, it is reported that the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Southeast Asia route will be extended to Guangzhou. The new ship Fuzhou has been scheduled to sail. The ship will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this week.

### Rickshaw Driver Cheated and Robbed of Car, Thrown Out by Bandits

[Report from this Newspaper] At approximately 9:00 PM the night before last, several bandits, posing as customers, cheated and stole a car numbered 20294 from the Zhonghua Rongji Car Company on Marlane Road. The rickshaw driver, Chen Guoxiang, was blindfolded midway, and 10,000 yuan in legal tender, $59 in American banknotes, a pocket watch, and a pair of leather shoes were stolen from his pocket. The bandits drove the car themselves to the vicinity of Baoding Road and Youheng Road, where they threw Chen out, and the car sped eastward. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen finally rushed to the police station to report the crime and request an investigation.

### Re-discussion of Methods for Exempting American Soldiers from Feast Tax

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai office of the U.S. Army Headquarters in China, in order to show preferential treatment to American soldiers, previously requested exemption from the feast tax. The Finance Bureau and the U.S. Army Headquarters jointly decided on a method, issuing a type of "exemption certificate" for use by various military personnel. After implementation, it was discovered that there were omissions in the signatures on the certificates, and the usage methods were also subject to further discussion. For example: (1) The food and drink expenses per certificate should not exceed 10,000 yuan, and (2) only one invoice should be attached to each certificate, to show restrictions and facilitate auditing. It is reported that the American military side agreed to the second method, but said that this matter should be noted by the restaurants. As for the limit of 10,000 yuan per certificate, they believe that the amount is too small and plan to request a relaxation, which has not yet been resolved.

### Continued Trial of Yuasa This Afternoon

The Shanghai Military Tribunal of the First Garrison District will retry Japanese war criminal Yuasa Torakichi this afternoon. According to the Shanghai Military Tribunal, there are currently more than 80 war criminal suspects detained in the court. They have all been thoroughly investigated by the prosecutor. However, among them, there are 36 people who were mistakenly detained due to having the same name. It has been confirmed that they are not suspected of being war criminals. Yesterday, they were sent to the Prisoner of War Management Office to be repatriated.

### Xiao Xiefen Comes to Shanghai to Assist in Trying Traitors; Lawyers Demand to Meet with Clients, Otherwise They Will Refuse to Defend the Traitors

[Report from this Newspaper] Since a large number of traitors were escorted to the Shanghai Prison on Ward Road, the work of the Provisional Court of the High Court attached to the prison has become tense. However, the trial staff, including Court President Liu Yugui, Judge Cao Jun, Qiu Huanjin, and Cai Jin, are not enough to share the workload. Therefore, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has sent Court President Xiao to Shanghai to assist in the trial of traitors. The new criminal court on the third floor is being actively arranged.

Since the High Court Provisional Court began hearing traitor cases, defense lawyers have been suffering because they cannot meet with their clients before the trial. Therefore, they recently submitted a document to the High Court, requesting a more flexible method. The reason is that other courts besides Shanghai do not have such regulations. The Criminal Procedure Law also clearly stipulates that defendants and lawyers have the right to meet. The regulations on punishing traitors and dealing with traitors also do not prohibit meetings. Since the court allows traitors the right to hire lawyers to defend them, it should allow lawyers to have the convenience of collecting favorable evidence. Some lawyers said that if this regulation is not abolished, they will refuse to defend the traitors in the future.

### Burden of Addiction; Female Performer Regains Freedom, Famous Doctor Summoned Again

[Report from this Newspaper] Zheng Bingru, a top actress at the Tianchan Stage, was arrested by the police on the evening of the 29th of last month, immediately after finishing her performance, and temporarily detained in the General Bureau detention center because she was addicted to opium and did not register with the police station. It is reported that the actress Zheng was temporarily released on bail yesterday. In addition, the famous doctor Ding Jikun was addicted to drugs and was recently summoned by the police station for detention. Later, because he was running for municipal councilor, he was temporarily bailed out by powerful people. It is now known that the Municipal Police Department summoned him to the bureau again yesterday and sent him to the Municipal Hospital for examination.

### Commemoration Meetings Held Today by All Circles for the May Fourth Movement Festival

### Celebrating the National Government's Return to the Capital; Municipal Museum Opens Today; Displays One-Fifth of Salvaged Cultural Relics

Opening the organizational outline of the Shanghai Municipal Museum, the first article clarifies its mission, stating that it is to promote Chinese culture, advocate scientific research, disseminate modern knowledge, and assist social education with appropriate displays and explanations.

Because of the importance of its mission, the museum began preparations in December last year. After several negotiations, it managed to recover two-thirds of the cultural relics stolen by the enemy and puppets from the previous museum. Most of them have now been sorted out. Due to the limited funds and equipment, one-fifth of the recovered cultural relics have been arranged in the first exhibition room, which is on the third floor of No. 961, North Hengbangqiao, North Sichuan Road. Now, in order to celebrate the return of the National Government to the capital, it will be open for exhibition from today.

At the invitation of Mr. Jiang Dayi, director of the art section of the museum, the reporter had the opportunity to "take a sneak peek" yesterday. Although the first exhibition room is just one large, straight room, the items on display include fossils, stone tools, oracle bones, bronzes, bronze mirrors, ancient coins, pottery, and Tang porcelain.

Fossil Collection

Most of them are various animal fossils excavated in Zhoukoudian (the place where Peking Man fossils were discovered). The patterns on the fish fossils are clearly discernible. In addition, there are fossils of Li's pig, De's water buffalo, and swollen bone deer. The stone tool category has collected many stone knives, stone spears, stone axes, stone chisels, and stone sickles from the Neolithic Age, most of which were unearthed in the southeastern region. The museum has also collected a lot of tortoise shells and cattle bones engraved with the earliest Chinese characters.

Bronze Category

More of them are fine products, dating back to the Yin, Zhou, and Han dynasties. There are cooking utensils such as li, ding, and zeng; washing utensils such as yi, pan, and lian; a pot for timing; musical instruments such as he, duo, and ling; drinking utensils such as gu, jue, and ; weapons such as ge, mao, jian, and ; Among them, the most valuable is a collection of bronzes collected by Wu Dacheng, a Jinshi scholar of the Qing Dynasty, especially the Chengguozhonggui he obtained in Baoji, which he considered the happiest event of his life. There is also a pair of Scythian small bronze deer. Scythia refers to the ancient regions north of the Black Sea and near the Salt Sea or northern and central Asia, and is an important material for studying bronze culture. In addition, the collection of spring coins includes copper shells, Qi knives, cloth, and ordinary copper coins. The collection of bronze mirrors ranges from the Warring States period to the Ming and Qing dynasties, which can be said to be rich.

Burial Pottery Figurines

There is a pair of barbarian figurines. Although they are from the Tang Dynasty, they have high noses, sunken eyes, full beards, foreign hats and clothes, carrying bedding and carrying water bottles, a look of seeking a living in China, which is very interesting. The postures of the dancing girl figurines, dwarf figurines, and prostrate figurines are lifelike, and there are even groups of Ming utensils in the homes of high officials, including a full set of ceremonial guards during the patrol, which can be called a grand sight. In terms of Tang porcelain, there are three types of ordinary utensils, small utensils, and toys made in Qionglai kiln and Liulichang outside the East Gate of Chengdu. They are small and exquisite and can be appreciated!

Mr. Jiang pointed out and explained the treasures one by one. Although the reporter spent more than an hour browsing, he still felt like he was rushing through the flowers. I hope there will be an opportunity to come and appreciate these treasures that are not usually easy to see. At the same time, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will take the opportunity to visit the museum during its opening period to broaden their horizons! (Canglong)

### Wu Nigao (Traitor Wu Songgao) Regrets But It's Too Late; One Wrong Thought Back Then; Heartbroken Even Now; Detailed Account of Colluding with the Enemy

[Report from this Newspaper] When Chen Gongbo, the traitor, was the puppet mayor of Shanghai, his secretary-general, Wu Nigao, was the "red man" of Shanghai. Later, he was promoted to the puppet Minister of Justice and came to Shanghai to inspect the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, full of prestige. But yesterday, he entered the court with his head down in the guise of a prisoner, under the gaze of more than 200 spectators. He was wearing a blue cloth gown, shiny black leather shoes, and black-rimmed glasses. His face was quite ruddy, and his newly shaved hair was already gray. His attitude was very calm. He confessed to all the points of the crime in the indictment filed by Prosecutor Xia, but he flatly denied the phrase "willing to collude with the enemy." He said: "One wrong thought back then still feels extremely painful today. In the year when the Pacific War broke out, I was still in the United States. I was originally preparing to return to the accompanying capital with Minister Guo Taiqi, but Secretary-General Cheng Zhonghang of the Supervisory Yuan strongly invited me to Hong Kong to take over as the editor-in-chief of the Sing Tao Daily. Two months later,

Hong Kong fell and fled to Kowloon

and lived in a hotel with Lin Kanghou and others, and was eventually caught by the Japanese army; he was detained for three months before being sent to Shanghai in three batches. Although there was a home in Shanghai, the economy was tight, and I was a scholar who was useless in everything. I couldn't do business and couldn't go to the mainland. In order to negotiate the real estate forcibly occupied by the enemy, I went to Nanjing once and was surrounded by many friends of the puppet organization. After returning to Shanghai, I got an empty name of "Minister of the Diplomatic Department". In short, I went to Hong Kong for friends at the beginning, and as a result, I encountered this misfortune. I also blame myself for not having the courage to break the bad environment and solve the economic difficulties. Today, to the motherland, to the judges, to the news reporters and compatriots present,

I feel extremely ashamed

and extremely heartbroken. Court President Liu Yugui asked: "Which friends surrounded you when you went to Nanjing?" Wu first hesitated to answer, and after the presiding judge repeatedly questioned him, he finally said: "It was Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and Zhou Fohai." Asked: "What was the situation when you took over the concession?" He replied: "The takeover of the concession was a local event. For example, the Japanese concession in Hankou and the French concession in Tianjin were handed over by the local mayor and consul-general. The situation in Shanghai was slightly different. It was handed over by the representatives of the Bureau of Industry and the puppet mayor Chen Gongbo at that time." Asked: "Was it not the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs that sent you to take over?" Wu Nigao smiled bitterly when he answered. Tao: "No, no, I was sent to inspect the takeover situation." Asked: "What did you do during your tenure as the director of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government?" He replied: "There are two important tasks, namely the unification of organization and the unification of wages." Asked: "What about during your tenure as the secretary-general of the puppet municipal government?" Answer: "After the concession was taken over, the Shanghai municipality still used the original political districts of the concession

Divided into one and eight districts

I became the secretary-general to design how to merge the one and eight districts and implement them." Asked: "How did you become the puppet Minister of Justice later?" He replied: "In January of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Zhou Fohai, the chief of the puppet Shanghai, asked me to take over the Ministry of Justice. Forced by his strong invitation, I agreed. I was only in office for two months, but I had negotiated with the Japanese Embassy and released more than 280 central staff members detained in Zhenjiang and Wuxi at the end of March." Asked: "Did you participate in the revision of new laws during your tenure as the puppet Minister of Justice?" He replied: "No, the special court was directly under the puppet National Government and was not under my jurisdiction. What I used were the laws of the Republic of China." At this point, Prosecutor Xia stood up and declared that Wu Nigao had also served as a member of the Puppet Material Control Review Committee, and had published absurd remarks such as "willing to use the heart of death to seek the realization of co-prosperity" and shouting "Greater East Asia" and "Down with Britain and the United States" during his tenure as the secretary-general of the Puppet Municipal Government. That is, at that time

For the New China Daily

etc. to testify. Wu Nigao read the newspaper, his eyebrows were tightly frowned, and his face was gloomy. He only said softly: "This is just official stereotyped writing!" The defendant's defense lawyer, He Xiaoyuan, was hired by Wu Nigao's sister, and presented several documents in court that were beneficial to the defendant. The presiding judge ordered a retrial at a later date. The defendant requested to talk with his defense lawyer and family members, and he was allowed to meet with them in the judicial police room. Because news reporters gathered around, Wu Nigao spoke in English, saying that his case was only a political issue, not a personality issue. His crimes should be judged by the people, and the judge cannot use the stereotyped speeches that he followed at that time as evidence of his crimes. His nephews and nieces did not speak to him, and Wu Nigao only instructed them to "talk on Sunday" before being escorted back under the urging of the bailiffs.

Check

Wu Nigao, a native of Suzhou, is 48 years old this year and lives at No. 221, Baille Road. He was originally the director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our National Government and was sent to Geneva to be the legal commissioner of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations. In May of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he served as the minister of the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a member of the puppet Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality. In November of the same year, he was transferred to the chief secretary of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipality. In April of the 33rd year, he was promoted to the director of the First District Office of the puppet Shanghai Municipality and also served as the secretary-general of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government. In February of the 34th year, he was promoted to the Minister of the puppet Ministry of Justice until the victory. The prosecutor argued that Wu had been favored by the country for a long time and should have loyally served the country, but he was willing to collude with the enemy, change his loyalty to seek glory, and shamelessly serve the enemy. He was indeed guilty and should be punished according to Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors.

Zheng Xiugao Sentenced to Three Years

In addition, the traitor case of Zheng Xiugao, the chief inspector of the puppet Shanghai West Police Bureau, was sentenced by Court President Liu yesterday afternoon.

### Rice Truck Rush on Yongbin Highway Binyang Prisoners Mass Jailbreak

— Special correspondent Liang Xiaozhong from Guilin on the 25th [Our Own Report]

A most terrifying statistic: "Guangxi's grain reserves can only last until April this year. What happens after April? We dare not even imagine it." For almost half a year, the sky has been perpetually dominated by a cruel sun, scorching the fields of farmers in all directions. The transplanting of rice seedlings has been missed, the planting of corn has been missed, maize, buckwheat... all have been missed. Usually at this time, adults and children would already be biting into tender, sweet corn, but this year they haven't even sown the seeds. Although some places occasionally experience a few fleeting showers to alleviate the distress, they don't even saturate the soil. What good are they? To this day, the entire Guangxi is characterized by one word: "Drought."

Staring Anxiously at Flour Coupons

People have finished gnawing on grass roots and tree bark, and relief flour has finally arrived. Each person gets twelve ounces, but they must first fill out a form, submit it to the distribution office for review, and then it is issued. During the distribution of flour, who knows how many corrupt individuals manipulated the scales, trying to skim off the top, only to be beaten by the starving people. There was also a poignant interlude during the flour distribution: One family in the entire county (a total of five people) received flour coupons, but they were all too weak to get out of bed and go to the village office to collect it. Everyone just stared anxiously at the flour coupons. In the end, it was their daughter-in-law, who had just returned from her mother's house after eating a meal, who picked up the flour coupons and collected the flour. There was also a less serious but still noteworthy incident: the farmers in the south, who are not accustomed to eating flour, received flour in the Guinan area. Many people didn't know what to do with it, so they mixed it with a little water, fried it in a pan, and swallowed it piece by piece. Having something to eat is already joyful enough. Who cares what it tastes like?

Rice Truck Robbery on the Yongbin Highway

Chairman Huang returned from the Second Plenary Session and, after witnessing this tragic scene, was indeed filled with boundless anxiety. He couldn't obtain funds, couldn't borrow money, and, apart from relying solely on the relief distribution office, he was simply at a loss. Fortunately, fellow countrymen are, after all, fellow countrymen, and everyone still harbors boundless fraternal love. Relief movements have been launched in various places, with donations of money, rice, charity performances, and charity matches, raising a total of several million dollars. Speaking of which, it's just a drop in the bucket. But that drop of water is so sweet! On the one hand, there is a strict ban on grain exports (the provincial government once requested permission from the British to import 20,000 bags of Siamese rice from Hong Kong and Guangdong to Guangxi, but it was not granted, while large quantities of grain were being transported out of Wuzhou batch by batch in military vehicles under armed protection). Two merchant trucks, under the name of the Security Command, attempted to transport 4,000 catties of rice for export, but were robbed clean by starving people on the Yongbin Highway. The Suzhou starving people looted rice shops, the Guangxi starving people looted rice trucks, an uncanny coincidence, with ominous signs everywhere. Let me tell you another joke that's not a joke:

Liquor Ban Fails Because Taxes are Important

The liquor ban was urgently issued by the provincial government to various localities. When the ban was not thorough, public opinion scolded, senators scolded, and ordinary people also scolded: Don't waste grain on distilling alcohol! If it could be truly banned, statistics show that the province's food supply could save more than one-tenth. In this way, it can support for at least half a month more. However, unfortunately, the tax bureau urgently "requested instructions" from the Ministry of Finance, because liquor tax is important! Such a large amount of income, how can it be easily abolished? Liquor cannot be banned! Liquor cannot be banned! As a result, the sealed brewing equipment all reappeared, and the descendants of Du Kang were all delighted. Those collecting money were smug, although they also stipulated things like "rice and wheat are not allowed to be used for brewing," which is just a ghost of a regulation to deceive children! Those executing the orders suffered heavy restrictions. What to do?

Selling Body and Soul to Survive

Liquor and sex have always been inseparable, and what is pitiful is that within the word "sex" lies an unknown amount of blood and tears! In the disaster areas, female compatriots, from fourteen-year-old girls to women in their thirties and forties, under the pressure of hunger and for the lives of their parents, children, and themselves, wandered from the countryside to the streets in the thousands, selling their bodies and souls with tears in their eyes. In the Xing'an county area, ten catties of rice can bring "true ecstasy," and ten catties of millet can buy indulgence in lust. Those who can bring rice home to support their families are your wives. Taking the money, taking the rice, they will still thank you profusely, taking it home to save the lives of the old and young. As for virtuous women who throw themselves into the fire pit and fall into brothels, the number is truly unknown. According to statistics from so-called "special checkpoints" (妓女的集中營), many "new goods" join every night, providing those who have sucked their fill of blood to vent their bestial desires and compete for laughter. Ah, how bitter! The so-called "free flying swallows" in hotels and alleys are also everywhere. Guangxi, which has always been known for its simplicity, has suddenly become like this. Isn't it all for survival?

Pitying Robbers for Looting Thin Gruel

There was a news story in the newspaper that was simply unprecedented. It is now transcribed below: "In Changsheng Village, Zhongdu County, Huang Li's house was broken into one night by several robbers who threatened her with guns, ordering her to remain silent. They then crowded into the kitchen, ate their fill of thin gruel, and left with a whoop." The robbers painstakingly schemed, but only managed to steal a meal of thin gruel, which is truly enough to make one pity the robbers. However, this is also enough to make those in the metropolis who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on food and drink while living a decadent life deeply reflect!

Since hunger is like a prairie fire, expanding its domain county by county, the current environment has created a situation where there are thieves everywhere, and every thief is fierce. In the past, during the period of village cleansing, there was still some fear, but now it has simply become blatant, with groups of people shouting and roaming everywhere. There are places where bandits are rampant, even two or three hundred people, setting up light machine guns, guarding the highway entrances, and even robbing seven cars in a row. No one seems to care. Whether in villages or towns, everyone lives in fear. There is also a matter worthy of hidden concern. The border area between Yue (Guangdong) and Gui (Guangxi) has always been a refuge for thieves, and now some "People's Revolutionary Army" have appeared, systematically recruiting troops. This is truly a future trouble.

Prisoner Jailbreak Kills Guards

With so many thieves, catching thieves is particularly diligent. One village cleansing is not enough, so another village cleansing is carried out. As a result, none of the prisons in the province are not "filled with distinguished guests." The inability to quickly conclude cases has given this group of prisoners, a mix of good and bad, a great deal of suffering. The prison, like a fiery cage, is filled with people. Not only is there no place to sleep, but even sitting must be done in shifts. Coupled with the hot weather and the prevalence of epidemics, many people die every day, and without coffins, they are wrapped in rotten mats and thrown out. The prison is not much different from hell. As a result, it led to a province-wide jailbreak riot. Hundreds of prisoners in Binyang County Prison, in the middle of a stormy night, shouted madly, killed the guards with stones, and rushed out the door. Stone bullets flew everywhere, and as a result, the prisoners mostly escaped. The warden himself was imprisoned, and the real bandit returned to the marshes to poison the local area.

200,000 Workers Build Railroad

Amidst the sounds of disaster, there is, after all, one piece of good news: the north-south railway trunk line from Zhanjiang (Guangzhou Bay) through Guixian, Guangxi, to connect with the Qian-Gui Railway and directly to Lanzhou, Gansu, has now begun surveying. It is expected to be completed by the end of next year. The construction of this section of the railway is a massive project, requiring more than 200,000 workers. It is said that it will use the method of work-for-relief to recruit workers for construction, and the famine problem can be considered as solved.

Famine is not limited to grain, and politics also feels an infinite emptiness. Chairman Huang Xuchu, who has been in power for nearly twenty years, is said to be quite tired. Relaxing in the gardens and leisurely in the South Mountains is originally happier than the boundless sea of officialdom, but the people of Guangxi still need a hardworking leader, and everyone will not want him to leave suddenly. Recently, the news that Huang Shaohong has returned to Guangxi to take charge has also spread quite vigorously.

Also, Guangxi University, which has been troubled by enough disturbances, has reorganized its personnel and major affairs since President Chen Jianxi arrived at the school, set a deadline for students to return to school, and formally relocated the school to Guilin. Everything has returned to normal. The children who could not return to Butterfly Mountain in Wuzhou are arriving in Guilin batch by batch to register and prepare for classes and exams. Once the garrison stationed in the Institute of Technology moves out, the school will officially begin classes.

Diphtheria Returns, Many Epidemics

The abnormal weather has made diseases like winged tigers, snatching countless lives. Guilin is currently experiencing recurring fever and diphtheria, and other epidemics are also prevalent everywhere. Thinking of the terrible cholera outbreak last year, everyone is worried again.

Hardships upon hardships, hardships upon hardships, no one pities, and no one helps. The people of Guangxi are just as Turgenev said: "The soul burns in loneliness, and the flame goes out in loneliness." (April 25)

Infants born here can learn the entire school education system without leaving Yubu.

### Huaxiba Academic Paradise

— Zhou Yangquan from Chengdu on the 2nd [Our Own Report]

If anyone wants to ask about the value of Huaxiba, then I can first introduce a popular saying here: "Huaxiba is paradise, Shapingba is a question, and Guluba is hell."

Huaxiba—it is truly an enviable place. She lies virgin-like in the tranquil southeast of Rongcheng, between the old Nanmen and Fuxingmen, and is itself a flat, hill-less dam, with a Jin River tied behind it. How can one describe her beauty and charm?

Eternal Spring

Huaxiba has one characteristic: it is always spring. Even in the severe winter, one can still see verdant evergreen trees. How much more so in the spring air, when trees, flowers, and plants flourish? "When you walk into the place from the noisy city," it will naturally make you exhale a stuffy breath. Seeing the palace-style buildings, appearing and disappearing in the lush trees, with carved beams and painted rafters, majestic and magnificent, mixing the beauty of Chinese and Western architecture, with green grass like carpets and hundreds of flowers blooming, makes you feel that the environment is too beautiful.

Front Dam and Back Dam

Huaxiba is divided into the front dam and the back dam; all the essence is mostly concentrated in the front dam. The back dam is relatively deserted and barren. Entering the front dam from the East Side Gate, the first building is the West China University Library. The library has a vast collection of books, which is the warehouse of spiritual food for thousands of students. Students from the five universities study there all day long, especially during exam periods, when it is even more bustling. The second floor of the library houses a museum, with rich collections of cultural relics and treasures from the West China area, making it one of the leading museums in western China. The Institute of Comparative Culture and the book and film exhibition are even more distinctive. Further ahead is the Hefei College, which is the location of the College of Science and the chapel. The gymnasium accompanies it on the rear side, which is a venue for regular gatherings and events. All large-scale assemblies, lectures, and theatrical performances are held there. Opposite the Hefei College is the West China University Office, which is the brain of West China University and the location of the administrative center. The Wande Gate is the office and classroom of Ginling Women's College, with Minde Building as its center. Yenching University has the College of Science as its center. As for the biology building, the chemistry building, the College of Education, and other buildings, they are mostly shared by the five universities. Cheeloo is located on the north side of Xiaotianzhu Street, and as long as you cross a road, although separated, they are still united. The student commune and the youth center are places where students regularly socialize and interact, but unfortunately, the capacity is too small.

Complete Education

Huaxiba is dominated by West China Union University, and the other four universities, Ginling, Ginling Women's College, Cheeloo, and Yenching, are all guests from afar after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Soon, these guests will all return to their hometowns. Ginling and Ginling Women's College have decided to say goodbye and return in mid-month. Therefore, people who like to worry are worried that the dam will soon be lonely. This is the general situation of university education. As for secondary schools, there are five or six middle schools, including West China Union Middle School, Zherong, Jinzhong, Gaoqi, Jichuan, and the Provincial Leather School. Primary schools include: Diwei, Nantai, Canada, and the Municipal Central School, and other four primary schools. In terms of early childhood education, there are: West China University Nursery, Ginling Women's College Affiliated Nursery, and several kindergartens. As for the advanced academic research institutes, there are: Ginling University Institute of Cultural Studies, Institute of Frontier Problems, Ginling University Agricultural Economics, Horticulture, Economics, and other research institutes. Someone said: An infant born in Huaxiba can receive a complete school education without taking a step. We in our country really need more places like Huaxiba.

Huaxiba is not only a concentration of schools but also a source of some of the best hospitals in the country. Here, there are the West China University New Hospital, Sanatorium, Leprosarium, and the West China University Dental Hospital, with dentistry being the most prestigious in the country.

Morning and Dusk

There are two best times of day in the dam, namely morning and dusk: When the morning sun first rises, the entire dam is immersed in ten thousand golden rays. The singing of orioles can be heard everywhere in the forest, and the morning mist rises from the ground. It is truly harmonious and overflowing with tenderness. As for sunset, couples, walking back and forth in the trees and flowers, singing and chanting happily, or even dancing, they and she are unrestrictedly in nature.

Ten Scenes of Batou

Here, we also need to introduce some of the ten scenes on the dam:

(1) "Playing the Lute to a Cow" - that is the music room of Ginling Women's College. All day long, the sound of the lute is gentle and melodious, but how can the neighboring cows of the dairy farm appreciate it?

(2) "Moonlight over the Bow Bridge" - whenever the sun hangs high in the sky, looking down at the reflection of the moon in the creek from the several curved bridges is so poetic!

(3) "Phantom of the Bell Tower" - that bell tower on the dam is the god of timekeeping for the entire dam. It stands on the dam like a giant, faithfully reporting the time to the people on the dam month after month, day and night.

(4) "Jade Maiden Like a Shuttle" - that is the epitome in front of the new hospital. Seeing the girls wearing clean medical clothes, coming in and out, those are angels descended from heaven!

(5) "Flower Street and Willow Lane" - that is the scene on Xiaonan Road;

(6) "Police on Duty" - that is the loyal photography of "gentlemen" in front of the women's dormitory.

Lakeside of Love

(7) "Lakeside of Love" - whenever the sun sets, couples sitting and talking by the Lake of Love are the most envied.

(8) "Willow Waves by the Creek" - that is the most beautiful scenic line on the dam. The flat playground is surrounded by streams and weeping willows, which will remind people of the Su Causeway and Bai Causeway on the West Lake.

(9) "Department Store" - describes the rich state of the museum's exhibits, which make people feel overwhelmed.

(10) "North and South Poles" - says that in the past, the West China University Library stipulated that men and women should sit separately and not interact with each other, but now, like "Broken Bridge and Remnant Snow", you can no longer see "Broken Bridge", and you can no longer see "Remnant Snow". Similarly, men and women in the library not only do not separate, but even sit tightly together.

Love Murder Story

If you really want to know Huaxiba, there are two more spine-chilling stories that must be told to you: One is that as early as eight or nine years ago, a corpse that had been cut into eight pieces was found in the lake next to the bell tower. He was stabbed to death by his rival in love and thrown into the lake, but was finally discovered by a lotus root picker. The other was five or six years ago, when a concubine of a famous warlord fell in love with a handsome "gentleman". Whenever the night was quiet, she would come to meet the "gentleman" in secret, but the warlord found out about it. As a result, the "gentleman" and the concubine became a pair of dying birds under the warlord's butcher knife. Of course, there are more than just these two scandalous stories on the dam, but these are just the most exciting and popular.

### Nanchang Tidbits

— Jiang Zhaoran from Nanchang on the 20th [Our Own Report]

Chen Benhou, the head of the telecommunications department of the provincial government's construction department, has a limited income. With white rice costing more than 20,000 yuan per picul and other necessities "racing to rise" with white rice, he really couldn't support himself and his wife. Then he received a letter from his parents urging him to send living expenses, which was as urgent as a blazing fire. So, like in a play, department head Chen went crazy, to the point of hitting and scolding people he met. He was sent to the hospital by a friend, but "a mental illness still needs a mental cure," and the hospital couldn't cure his mental illness. Not long before this tragedy occurred, there was a sad history of Liu Chen's death from starvation while eating tree bark and grass roots. The reporter believes that the dead are already gone, and this "madness" must not be allowed to continue!

### Newspapers Suffer Hardships Schools Face Difficulties

There are seven newspaper offices: "Huaguang", "Minguo", "Dazhong", "Xinshang", "Lixing", "Shengbao", and "Zhongguo Xinbao". There are also "Minbao" and "Jiebao" that are being prepared for reprinting. The current sales volume of each newspaper: the most is about 8,000 copies, and the least is about 3,000 copies. According to a survey: a certain newspaper loses nearly two million yuan per month on average, not including the hard work of the newspaper people. The hardship of newspaper offices is evident!

"Compulsory education" originally meant forcing school-age children to attend school and receive education. Here, "compulsory" is used on paying the "desk and chair fee", which is truly absurd.

### Sending Away the Mother-in-Law to Welcome the Living Buddha

Wang Lingji, who succeeded Cao Haolin as the master of Jiangxi, is not only a military and politician but also has a considerable research on Buddhism. He is also a religious believer. If Cao is called "Mother-in-law" then Wang is the "living Buddha." The people of Jiangxi are very fortunate because the "Mother-in-law" left and the "Living Buddha" came. The reporter on behalf of the 30 million Gan people, begs under the care of Chairman Wang, that Jiangxi can quickly achieve a "great human state."

### Securing the Lifeline of Western Zhejiang Residents: Challenging the Tide

— Huzhou Dispatch, April 26th, by Ding Dong

The fertile plains of western Zhejiang are the treasure trove of Zhejiang Province. "Above, there is paradise; below, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." Needless to say, Hangzhou is such a wonderful place. Jiaxing, Jiashan, Chang'an, and Xiashi are all excellent locations in Zhejiang Province. Haining's watermelons are shipped to Shanghai every year, relieving Shanghai residents from the oppressive summer heat. While ice cream is enjoyable, it simply doesn't offer the same refreshing coolness as watermelon. The Hangzhou and Jiaxing regions of western Zhejiang, along the eastern coastline, rely solely on a dike for protection. Five to six million people live here, because it has always been affluent, paying the heaviest grain taxes in Zhejiang Province, and producing fish, rice, silk, and satin to supply people's consumption. But now, this dike, stretching five to six hundred *li* (approx. 250-300km) and protecting five to six million people, is nearing collapse due to both human and natural erosion.

The Importance of Jinshanwei

The starting point of Zhejiang Province's seawall is Jinshanwei, which borders Jiangsu Province. If we aren't forgetful, we'll recall that eight years ago, the enemy landed here, encircling Shanghai's rear. As a result, the Shanghai defenders could only retreat. Some sections of the seawall around Jinshanwei have already collapsed, perhaps due to wartime damage. However, looking at the present and recalling the past, you'll realize that these seawalls are intimately related to us. In peacetime, the seawall is the protection of farmland; in wartime, it is our fortress.

The Seawall Stretches Five to Six Hundred *Li*

The seawall project is extremely arduous, stretching five to six hundred *li*, and includes stone dikes, brushwood dikes, culverts, etc. The stone dike is the most critical part. The surging waves erode the dike's bank, and long strips of bluestone can crack completely. If the craftsmen skimp on materials in the mortar joints between the stones, it's easy for the waves to break through and cause collapse. The brushwood dike is made of a mixture of bamboo and wood, with fir pilings and woven brushwood mats, topped with earth and stone. The rivers of western Zhejiang are numerous and branch out, with culverts guiding the small rivers into the East China Sea. When the tide rises, seawater can flow back into the culverts and into the small rivers. Standing on the seawall, the sea breeze brings a salty taste into your nose and skin. On one side is the blue sea, on the other is the lush green rice paddies, but when the blue seawater rushes into the rice paddies, the rice turns yellow and dies. Beside the rice paddies are the houses and homes of the people of western Zhejiang, their lives and property!

Skimping on Materials: Impending Disaster

This spring, a total of over 1,900 meters of the seawall collapsed, according to official reports. The reporter did not measure it, but compared to the entire five to six hundred *li*, it is only one percent. However, this is a seawall, and there cannot be any gaps. Once there is a gap, seawater will rush in, and everything the farmers have will be ruined. It is said that the spring tide is smaller than the autumn tide, so when autumn arrives and the autumn tide rises sharply, you will realize how serious the disaster is. Those in charge of the seawall project are skimping on materials and not following construction regulations. The earthwork is sloppy, and the stonework is even more careless. One bag of cement is used like it's a cowhide bag (referring to the small amount of cement), and the flour that should be issued is reduced by 20 or 30 percent, or else it's moldy flour. What has already been repaired is done haphazardly, as if only a layer of paste was applied, which will dissolve when soaked in seawater. The parts that have not been repaired are already leaning precariously. With disaster impending, we can no longer ignore this. The seawall that was built in the past, entirely with lime, did not collapse; now, the seawall that uses cement has already collapsed. We must investigate and pursue these malpractices in the project. Be careful: do not sell the flour intended for the seawall in the city to make bread, and do not use the cement intended for the seawall to build private Western-style houses!

Urgent and Critical Project

The seawall is divided into different sections, which has been passed down for thousands of years. Each section's project has its own characteristics. Although the reporter does not want to do specialized research, this long seawall now lacks manpower, financial resources, and materials such as bamboo, wood, cement, and stone. There are only one or two thousand workers. As for materials, they are not even enough to patch up the holes. Needless to say, financial resources are lacking. Even if there are financial resources, we must be wary of someone embezzling them. No one repaired it for eight years, and no one has seriously done it in the eight months after the victory. If it really collapses, you push me, I push you, what will it become? This is today's seawall, the lifeline of five to six million people in western Zhejiang!

### Guangxi University Adjusts Personnel and Actively Moves the School

[Report from Liuzhou Office] Since the new president of National Guangxi University, Chen Jianxiao, took office on March 29, he has been actively rectifying school affairs and adjusting personnel. Recently, Zhang Xianchen was appointed as the Director of General Affairs, and before Director Zhang arrives, it will be temporarily taken over by Hui Qixin. Xie Kang was appointed as the Director of Student Affairs, and Wang Zhenru was appointed as the Dean of the College of Agriculture. The original Director of Academic Affairs Tang Zaozhen, Dean of the College of Law and Commerce Wang Jinli, and Dean of the College of Engineering Zheng Jianxuan will remain in their positions.

### Northeast University to Resume Classes in Shenyang in Autumn; President Zang Qifang Flies to Chongqing for Preparation

[Dahua News Agency, Beiping Air Mail] Northeast University, after the September 18th Incident when the Japanese invaders launched an unprovoked attack, moved from Shenyang to Beiping, Kaifeng, Santai and other places successively, experiencing hardships. Since the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of Shenyang by the National Army, the school is now preparing to move back to its old school site in Shenyang, which it had been separated from for fourteen years. The president of the school, Zang Qifang, flew to Chongqing a few days ago to prepare for the relocation. According to alumni of the school in Beiping: There are currently about 500 students at Northeast University in Santai, only over a hundred of whom are from Northeast China, and the rest are from Sichuan. After the relocation, the Sichuan students can transfer to other schools. The most problematic issue for the relocation is the transportation for the families of various professors, because the railway recovery will take time, so they can only travel from Santai to Chongqing, take a boat east, pass through Shanghai, and directly travel by sea from Yingkou to Shenyang. It is learned that they can start from Santai in early May, and classes will definitely be held in Shenyang at the beginning of the autumn semester.

### Allocation Price Recovers to 1.6 Million; Gold and Banknotes are Settled; Unofficial Discount is Still High, and Monetary Tightness Remains

The (Chinese) National Gold Savings Certificates (NGSC) continued to weaken yesterday. The allocation price of the Central Bank of China (CBC) was further lowered to 1.6 million. However, it still felt sluggish in the middle. The general mentality is that this allocation price is unlikely to fall again, based on past situations, and it rebounded slightly on dips. It was found that the morning opening was still flat. Ordinary head stocks were still extremely tight after the opening, and the atmosphere of panic has not been alleviated at all. It gradually retreated from 1.63 million to below the 1.6 million mark, and then showed a revolving trend. The CBC allocated more than 60 strips to peers and more than 10 strips to silver shops, at a price of 1.6 million. It once dropped to 1.575 million after 10 o'clock. Since then, the monetary situation has gradually stabilized. The allocation price of the Bank of China (BOOC) has not decreased. Investors bought low and covered, and rebounded to around 1.61 million at noon. In the afternoon, the monetary situation was generally loosened after small banks adjusted 400 to 500 million. It continued to be slightly stable. As a result, the closing was not much different from the previous closing. Jewelry was 173,000, silver was 1,700, silver dollars rose slightly, and the unofficial discount was around 20% in the morning, and finally about 16% to 18%.

Someone absorbed US dollars on dips, and some gold sellers also bought it for arbitrage. Arbitrage settled at around 715 yuan. The morning opening was around 2,230 yuan. It fell to around 2,180 yuan in the middle. After entering the market, it gradually improved and showed slight activity, rising to around the morning opening price. The same was true in the afternoon. As a result, the closing was similar to the previous closing. Hong Kong notes were initially affected by the general trend, but later stabilized because exchange rates were tight. The Hong Kong telegraphic transfer rate was 445 yuan, and the Robi rate was 545 yuan, all of which were traded. The listed US exchange rate was still flat, and designated banks still traded at around 2,050 yuan.

### Yarn Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to trend downward. Small and medium-sized yarn and 16-count yarn merchants scrambled to sell, and the price fell by 20,000 to 40,000 again. Fine yarn double strands were particularly sluggish. Only 20-count Gold Double Horse yarn was 20,000 higher than yesterday, because the Hai'e customs will close tomorrow, and the Cantonese gangs had to reluctantly take it in in order to catch the ship out of the port. I, however, think it will be difficult to stabilize its price. At noon, Fangjian continued to post prices as usual. There seemed to be 29 kinds of yarn threads, which seemed to be 20,000 to 140,000 lower than the previous period. The 42-count Blue Phoenix thread depreciated the most by 140,000. However, yarn merchants and manufacturers were not very enthusiastic in purchasing. In addition, there were three kinds of coarse yarn and seven kinds of fine thread that were tendered for purchase. Only Yongxing Yarn Shop bought one kind of 32-count Yanghe double-strand thread, and the price was 1.57 million yuan.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraphic report rose to 16 points. The recent American gold was 27.56, the forward was 27.67, and the Mittlein spot was 28.14. The local cotton trading was stagnant. Manufacturers lowered prices, and goods holders were unwilling to sell, making it difficult for both parties to reach a negotiation.

### Silk is Gradually Stabilizing

After continuous declines, the silk market seemed to have entered the end game yesterday. However, rayon was still 40,000 to 50,000 yuan shorter than the previous day. However, silk factories have already started work, and actual sales will definitely move. Moreover, the allocation price is almost the same as the market price, so it will not tend to fall again in the near future. Yesterday, Guangren rayon from Tianqiao No. 120 opened at 1.52 million yuan in the morning and closed at 1.47 million yuan. Factory and foreign bank goods were not yet open for business. The price of silk for weaving was the same as the previous day, and silk goods were also still not strong. There was not much change throughout the day, but transactions were very deserted.

### The Tea Market is Trending Towards Stability

Shaoxing Zhuji new fried green tea, since its debut a few days ago, has been pushed up by holders' active thinking, so the asking price was finally squeezed and raised compared to the previous day. As for green teas of Baozhong and Zhulan grades, the demand from Tianjin and Suzhou is good, and the people's minds are solidifying, and the bottom plate is stable. The prospects look tight. In addition, for the special-extracted Gongxi tea that is specially sold to Mumbai, India, peers have been frequently favored due to the favorable price. It is said that after absorption, it is planned to wait for export.

### Woolen Fabric Transactions are Quiet

Woolen fabric transactions, both retail and wholesale, have been low recently. Although dark-colored goods are slightly cheaper, no one is interested. For summer goods, most customers have already purchased comfortably. Street buyers adhere to the principle of selling and adding as they go. Generally, local households with good environments have already purchased, cut, and made them. Ordinary salary earners are all too expensive and unable to purchase. Customers from all over the country know that foreign goods will be shipped in soon, so they are unwilling to buy in a hurry. Therefore, transactions are increasingly tired. Peers, in view of the lack of business interest, mostly make lower-end goods and fewer high-end goods. Although interest rates have decreased, they can still be maintained. Therefore, there are those who lend at interest rates to maintain expenses, which has created a situation where woolen fabric transactions have become increasingly worse recently.

### The Coal Market Continues to Soften

The arrival of white coal has increased sharply, but the decline has not improved. Market prices have fallen again. Yesterday, another 3,000 tons of Macbeth coal medium blocks were shipped from Haiphong and are now unloaded in McGan Road Xingzhan warehouse. It is said that the price will be between 250,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan. The supply and demand of Shanghai spot anthracite is still flat, and the market price is also stable. Due to the extremely tight monetary conditions, peers in Pudong warehouse receipts are dumping, and the market continues to soften.

### Large Quantities of Coarse Grains Shipped to Shantou

### Public Bond Market: Major Players Cover Short Positions, Stock Fluctuations Slight

Yesterday, major players in the public bond market covered their short positions, reversing course and instantly changing market sentiment. Tongbing bonds opened in the morning at 5,200 yuan, once breaking through the 5,000 yuan level, reaching around 4,950 yuan. When selling pressure eased slightly, major bond market players took the opportunity to cover short positions. With the activity of two or three major players, the price rebounded to 5,900 yuan at noon, resulting in a recovery of 500 yuan compared to the previous close. Class A and B bonds rose 400 yuan, Class D bonds rose 300 yuan, and Class E bonds rose 50 yuan. The atmosphere of panic in the Chinese stock market dissipated slightly, with considerable resistance at lower prices, but the situation has stabilized. There was mostly a steady process throughout the half-day, with frequent short-distance advances and retreats. At low prices, Yong Yarn was 5,050 yuan, American Asia was 4,150 yuan, and Jingfu was 415 yuan. The market regained stability at noon, with slight fluctuations in the previously popular stocks compared to the previous closing price. Unpopular stocks saw declines. The bearish trend in foreign stocks has also improved. Although there was a lot of trading volume, most stocks saw little gains, except for British United, which rebounded strongly by half a percent.

### Proposals of the Tianjin Delegation to the General Chamber of Commerce

[Tianjin News] Zheng Songxian and two other representatives from Tianjin City attending the National General Chamber of Commerce, carrying five proposals for economic construction, have flown to Beijing. The contents of their proposals are explored below: (1) Request to include Tanggu New Port into the Tianjin City area and to expand Zhangguizhuang Airport to facilitate air transport. (2) Propose that before the General Assembly is established, the country should be divided into regions, with major cities assigning representatives to be responsible for actual communication.

### Coconut Oil Declines, Industrial Oils Remain Sluggish

The outlets for industrial oils and fats in Shanghai are mostly for the manufacture of soaps and candles. Recently, soap sales have decreased, and the stock of rosin is very high. The stock of tallow is also high, and imports are also pouring in. Coconut oil once disappeared completely, with prices reaching 320,000 yuan per dan. Soap factories were mostly unable to use it. Recently, hoarders have been selling at high prices, and the price has fallen to 180,000 yuan per dan, but there are still no buyers.

### Foreign Company Registration Deadline Extended to the End of June

[United States Information Service, Washington, 2nd] The Department of Commerce announced yesterday that the Chinese government, in response to repeated requests from foreign businesses, has extended the deadline for foreign businesses to register in China to the end of June 1946. The original deadline was the end of March, but due to transportation delays between China and foreign countries, it was difficult to obtain the necessary documents by the original deadline. Before the end of June 1946, all foreign businesses operating in China must complete registration procedures in order to be allowed to continue operating. After the end of June, if any foreign business wishes to conduct business in China, it must apply for registration when establishing an office in China, and may only begin operations after approval has been granted.

### Rice Prices Seem to Have Elasticity: Down the Day Before, Up Again Yesterday

Yesterday, the rice market was buoyed by reports of rising prices in the interior, and market sentiment turned firm. The situation in the early market was very tight. However, sales in retail stores were sluggish, and the market softened at noon. As a result, prices rose slightly by 400 to 500 yuan compared to yesterday. Flour was weak in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. However, the first batch of Australian wheat flour has arrived in Shanghai and is being unloaded, and it should be available on the market soon. There are also reports that foreign rice is being negotiated for import, so food prices should not rise excessively for the time being. Soybean digestion was very weak, and prices gradually decreased by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw balanced trading. Sesame seed sales were not good, and prices fell by 2,000 yuan. Broad beans saw little trading and sales. Cottonseed cake remained downstream. The supply of oil continued to arrive, and stores' appetite collapsed, falling another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were neither praised nor disgraced. Wheat bran remained oversupplied and gradually declined, falling another 200 to 300 yuan. Bean cake market transactions were scarce, and factory supply continued, falling by 600 to 700 yuan. According to rice market information, yesterday the city received more than 5,000 dan of white rice and seven other types. The types and amounts of each are as follows: White rice 3,077, Thin rice 833, Early rice 612, Yangxian 17, Dubi 530, Baiyuan 105, Yinyuan 70.

### Taiwan's Gasoline Production: 26,000 Gallons

Taiwan's oil is produced in various parts of Tainan. During the Japanese occupation, there were six companies and refineries, the largest of which were the three factories under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy. They were also the most severely damaged during the war. After our personnel took over, they are actively repairing and resuming operations. The other three factories, Imperial Oil, Japan Oil, and Taiwan Development Chemical, have partially resumed operations after reorganization. The monthly production is only 26,000 gallons of gasoline and 200,000 gallons of alcohol. However, the monthly demand for cars, both public and private, in the province is 850,000 gallons, so there is a strong hope for American gasoline imports.

### US Cotton Estimate: 33.3 Million Bales

[Reuters, Bombay, 3rd] The official fourth estimate of cotton production for 1945-46 is 3,361,000 bales, and the planted area is 15,440,000 acres, a decrease of 5% and 2% respectively compared to last year's revised estimates.

### No Exports of Gallnuts: Uses, Origin, and Price

Before the war, the export volume of gallnuts was comparable to that of rosin. This material is mostly used abroad as a raw material for manufacturing pigments. Therefore, when exported, the whole gallnuts are ground into powder, called "poufen." Currently, due to weak prices abroad, it is only sold domestically. Leather factories in the city use it for direct tanning. Its origin is Hubei, Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, etc., with Sichuan and Laohekou producing the most. The recent price usually fluctuates between 60,000 and 80,000 yuan. Before exports improve, it is only held for domestic sales, and there is no sign of improvement in the short term.

### A Writer with a Clear Conscience

— Jin Chun

Goethe, a great poet and historical novelist of 19th-century England, wrote these words in the year he died:

"I am one of the most prolific writers of the time, but I have several things that comfort me: in all my works, I have never written a sentence that interferes with the beliefs of others; I have never written anything that slanders the claims of others. When I am dying in my sickbed in the future, I will not think of a work from the past that makes me feel ashamed, and I will not feel relieved until I find a way to delete it."

Goethe died on September 22, 1832. This was from a letter he wrote to the historian Lockhart on May 10th of that year.

A writer is called great partly because of his works and partly because of his character. It is not easy for a writer to be great and produce a lot of work, and it is even more difficult to be strict with his writing. A great writer does not necessarily have to cater to readers, but he must be worthy of readers. He should not only be happy when writing, but also have a clear conscience after writing.

Scott is a good example for today's writers.

### Review of "A Concise Course in Social History"

— Ping Fan

By Zheng Chumin, published by Shenghuo Bookstore

The question that this book seeks to answer is "How is society constituted? And how does it change?" In the author's preface, he says: "I have very carefully accepted the correct answer to this question and the method of investigation for this question, and step by step unfolded a faithful description of the process of social construction and the process of social change. In other words, I have strived to stand in the scientific camp before I began to strive for a scientific description of the process of social evolution." This kind of "scientific work" is "really necessary in the domestic publishing world at present" because "the backwardness of Chinese academics is causing the shallow thinking of scholars to be popular. Not only is the understanding of the construction of various methods too difficult, but also the hope that everything and every phenomenon will focus on the overall examination, that is, to make an overall examination of the inevitable dialectical process of things, is already too much beyond the vision and the limits of the living requirements of the scholars."

But I think that (1) the author himself is unscientific in his method of observing social history, (2) his explanation of the constitution of society is mechanical, and (3) his explanation of the process of social evolution is anti-dialectical. I will now briefly explain these three points.

First, from the perspective of historical materialism, all social superstructures and all social evolution processes are based on material and are determined by economic forces. This is correct, and no one can deny it. But we feel that this view is not enough. For example, human life is built on the organic action of many cells. This is true, but the organic activity of many cells is not human life. Human social life is impossible without an economic foundation, but it is also impossible with only an economic foundation. If there are only a few cornerstones without building a building, it will not become a building. If there is only economic power and no other power, it will not become a society. If we want to base ourselves on "overall examination," although we admit that matter is a necessary condition for spirit, we can never use the method of explaining matter to explain spiritual phenomena. The biggest premise of the scientific method is to be based on objective facts. If, in objective facts, matter and spirit have different intrinsic relationships and different natures (although there is a generative relationship and an organic connection of shared fate between the two), then we cannot confuse them. We should find out the characteristics of both sides, and then use the method that matches these "objective facts" to observe it, analyze it, and explain it. If we only rely on subjective beliefs and use the same key to open all kinds of different locks," these doors will never be opened.

Second, speaking of the constitution of society, as the author said, in addition to the economic base, there are also two factors, namely politics and ideology. In fact, he also forgot two factors, one is the educational power that allows communication between individuals, and the other is the social emotion expressed by literature and art. I think that materialist historians have not given equal importance to the emotional aspect of life as they have given to other aspects of life. They believe that human life is completely based on rational judgment. In fact, emotion is an equally important aspect of life. Another point that I think the author has not clearly explained is the relationship between economics, politics, and ideology. They each have their own special missions, which cannot be explained clearly by words such as "production" and "labor." I think that economics is the material basis of social life, politics is the organizational force of social life, and ideology is the planning and control mechanism of social life. The author seems to have insufficient understanding in this regard.

Third, in terms of social evolution, the author believes that the differences between different stages are entirely due to the economic structure, and different superstructures arise from the differences in the economic structure. However, sometimes changes in society occur in the ideological aspect, and then the material aspect of society is changed based on this ideology. There are many such examples. For example, the Soviet revolution first had Marx's historical materialism. The Chinese revolution is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. To this day, there is still the ideal of the Three Principles of the People, but a society that fully realizes the Three Principles of the People has not been fully realized. Speaking of China's social reform, our thinking has been influenced by Western culture, and we are deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, and then we gradually improve, even adopting revolutionary methods. This is what is called "getting the wind first," and what is called "the wise." Also, in each stage, we believe that each has its own different characteristics, and these characteristics cannot be completely encompassed by the two words "materialism."

The content of the whole book is "concise," which is still worthy of the name. A detailed critique will be written later.

### Random Musings on Elementary School National Language and Common Sense Textbook, Volume 1

— Huang Yide

My youngest daughter is continuing her studies in the first grade this year. I pay close attention to my children's homework, asking them to report on what they've learned each day, especially with my first-grade daughter, spending quite a bit of effort on the pronunciation, explanation, and writing of new characters.

The textbook my daughter is using is the first volume of the Elementary School National Language and Common Sense Textbook, a standard textbook approved by the Ministry of Education. Last night, I thoroughly reviewed it from beginning to end and felt that there were many aspects worth discussing. I am now writing down my opinions below, hoping for correction from those more knowledgeable. Because this is the official textbook for elementary school students, we might as well take a more serious look at it.

(I)

The text of the first lesson is: "Come, come, come, come to school."

The text of the third lesson is: "Go, go, go, let's all go play. Playing is really fun."

I believe that the tone of these two lessons does not quite match the actual living situation of children. Children's going to school is passive, while their playing is mostly active. Starting from home to school is clearly "going," and the picture below the text shows three children walking toward school. If a picture could be drawn of a few children standing at the school gate, greeting the students coming to school, it would be more appropriate. Therefore, my idea is that the text of the first lesson should be changed to "Go, go, go, go to school." Furthermore, on page six of the third lesson, there is the sentence "I want to go to school every day," so wouldn't this change connect the tone before and after?

When children are playing, they often like to call out to their companions, so I think the text of the third lesson should be changed to "Come, come, come, let's all come to play, playing is really fun." The tone of "Let's all go play" seems to imply a motive for playing, but not yet participating in the game, but the picture below the text already shows very fun playing, which seems to commit the fault of "the text not matching the picture."

(II)

The text of the fourth lesson is: "There is a national flag on the new book, with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth. The national flag is really beautiful."

The editor uses the two words "new book," one intention being to review these two new characters, which I think is not very appropriate: Children have many opportunities to see the national flag. When children read this lesson, it might be the Victory Commemoration Day on "September 3rd," so there are real, beautiful national flags with a blue sky, white sun, and a wholly red earth everywhere on the streets and in schools. Why put the "national flag" on the "new book"? Moreover, the picture below the text is completely a black and white drawing, without the "blue and red" colors, so how can children read the text and say, "The national flag is really beautiful"?

Therefore, my idea is to have three ways to change the two sentences, "There is a national flag on the new book": In accordance with item five of the "Editorial Guidelines," which says, "The arrangement of teaching materials in this book pays attention to the seasons and environment, so as to facilitate teaching," if this lesson is taught on the Victory Commemoration Day, it is better to change it to "National flags are hung on the streets." Adding the two new characters "street hanging" would not be a big problem.

If this lesson and the fifth lesson are moved to around the tenth lesson, then it can be changed to "On National Day, hang the national flag."

The text of the fifth lesson is: "National flag, national flag, I love you, I respect you, I salute you." The picture below is of raising the national flag. I am very satisfied with the picture and text of the fifth lesson. In order to avoid using too many new characters, and to connect and coordinate with the pictures and text of the fifth lesson, I think it is better to change it to "Raise the national flag in the school," which is most suitable. I wonder what the editor thinks?

(III)

My daughter has now read up to the twelfth lesson. The text is: "Dad feeds the ducklings. The ducklings grow up. He sells the ducks and buys a lamb. Dad [feeds] the lamb. The lamb grows up. He sells the lamb and buys a calf. Dad [feeds] the calf. The calf grows up. He teaches it to learn to plow."

Low-level textbooks should be simple and clear, so that children can read them smoothly, which is the principle. This text violates this principle. My daughter is in the first grade of the elementary school department of the Shenmei Girls' Middle School on North Zhejiang Road, and her grades are relatively good. The school has named her deputy class leader. This time, she even scored an average of over ninety points in the national common sense exam, which can be considered an excellent student, but she not only cannot understand this text clearly but also is not interested in it, saying that "this lesson is tangled like climbing vines."

In fact, whether it is possible to exchange ducks for sheep and sheep for cattle, let's not talk about it. To tell a joke, this dad originally had a pair of oxen for plowing the fields, which would have been fine, otherwise, from ducklings to calves, and then feeding the calves into large oxen, and then having the oxen plow the fields, wouldn't that dad's fields have been barren long ago?

(IV)

On pages twenty-eighth, forty-seventh: "Snowflakes fly, fly all over the sky. Sister says they look like sugar. Brother says they look like salt. Little brother, take a taste. Not sweet, not salty."

On page forty-eighth of the same lesson: "One piece, one piece, another piece. Two pieces, three pieces, four or five pieces. Six pieces, seven pieces, eight or nine pieces. They fly to the water surface and disappear."

In terms of the depth of the text and the interest in reading, I think page forty-seventh and page forty-eighth should exchange places. Although both are talking about snow, page forty-eighth is a riddle about snow. First, teach children to guess the riddle of snow, and then read the text on page forty-seventh about snow, which will be much more interesting for children to read, and also more convenient in the teaching sequence!

(V)

As for other things, such as the forced filler of the seventeenth lesson, and the twentieth lesson not conforming to the "seasons and environment," I will not go into detail.

However, I want to state clearly that I am not nitpicking, because this is a standard reader for children nationwide, and everyone expressing their opinions is hoping that the next edition can be even more perfect.

Writers can be divided into two types: one writes for the sake of writing, and the other writes for the sake of the topic. — Awabone Kahua

Literature is like medicine. Incompetent writers are just like quack doctors: some have knowledge but lack skill; others are merely glib and superficial. — Colton

When a writer talks about their own work, it is just like a loving mother talking about her own children, both being somewhat confused and unclear. — Disraeli

People always like to praise writers of previous generations. This is not because writers are admired after death, but because competition and infighting are so fierce when writers are alive that no one is willing to praise anyone. — Hobbes

The pen of a genius writer is the most powerful. What it achieves often exceeds what the writer intended to write at the time. — Heine
