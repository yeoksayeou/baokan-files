### He Shaozhou Appointed Commander of Yunnan Garrison, Huo Kuizhang Dismissed and Placed Under Supervision, Gu Zhutong Discusses the Handling of the Wen Case

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 25th Dispatch] General Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hosted a reception for reporters at Jinshuo Villa on the 25th, announcing the results of the military trial of the Wen Yiduo assassination case and the measures taken against Garrison Commander Huo Kuizhang, among others. Gu stated: "Since arriving in Kunming, I immediately ordered the Garrison Headquarters, military police, and police to solve the case within a set time. I also consulted with respected elders and people from all walks of life in Kunming to find the real culprit. Through the efforts of the Garrison Headquarters, Military Police Commander Zhang, and Police Commissioner Tang, along with the cooperation of various parties, and after multiple thorough investigations, the perpetrators of the Wen case were finally apprehended. The perpetrators were found to be active-duty soldiers, and according to the law, they should be subject to military trial on the spot. For the sake of seriousness, I specifically ordered the Army Headquarters Military Law Department, the Yunnan Provincial Security Command, and the Kunming-based military police to form a joint military trial court for a public trial, and invited representatives from all walks of life to observe. Mr. Liang Shuming and Mr. Zhou Xinmin from the Democratic League also participated, which shows that there was absolutely no concealment in this case. At the conclusion of the trial, the presiding judge and judges believed that the perpetrators, as active-duty officers, dared to kill with firearms while on duty. Although it was motivated by righteous indignation due to Wen Yiduo's insults and criticisms of the government and disparagement of the military, they ultimately disregarded the law and should be sentenced to the ultimate penalty. I believe this judgment is appropriate and, after submitting it for approval, immediately ordered its execution. Regarding this case, I deeply regret the loss of Professor Wen Yiduo to the academic community. I also feel a sense of sorrow for the perpetrators, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, who violated the law and received the ultimate penalty. In addition to enforcing national laws, I sincerely hope that people across the country will not lightly denigrate the nation, which is being rebuilt with great difficulty, and give due respect to the soldiers who fought bloody battles during the War of Resistance. I especially hope that all my comrades will strictly abide by national laws and military discipline, understand propriety, and uphold righteousness, to complete the great task of national reconstruction with the spirit of the War of Resistance." In response to reporters' questions, Gu stated: "In Kunming, between the 11th and 15th of last month, two assassinations occurred consecutively. The Yunnan Garrison Headquarters should bear the responsibility for local security, and the assassins of Wen Yiduo were all officers of the Garrison Headquarters' special service battalion, making Commander Huo's responsibility even greater. Chairman Chiang was extremely angry about this and ordered the dismissal of Commander Huo, placing him under the supervision of the Army Headquarters. He Shaozhou has been appointed as the Commander of the Yunnan Garrison, Wang Lingyun as the Deputy Commander, and Ma Ying as the Chief of Staff." Gu concluded: "This case could have been announced earlier, but it was intended to be announced together after the Li Gongpu case was solved. The perpetrators of the Li case have not yet been apprehended, and we are strictly ordering the intensification of the search, and we hope to solve the case soon."

### Verdict of the Wen Case Announced: Perpetrators Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan Sentenced to Death

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 25th Dispatch] The verdict of the Wen Yiduo case was recently announced here. The Army Headquarters' Thirty-Fifth Year Legal Review Character Yuan Number, Defendants: Tang Shiliang, male, 28 years old, from Hengyang, Hunan, Captain of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters; Li Wenshan, male, 32 years old, from Huangpi, Hubei, Lieutenant Platoon Leader of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters; Xu Zhankun, at large. The above-named defendants were tried by this headquarters for the crime of murder, and the judgment is as follows:

(Main Text) Tang Shiliang is sentenced to death for joint murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. He is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for attempted escape, to be executed concurrently with the death penalty, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Li Wenshan is sentenced to death for joint murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. One pistol and twenty-seven bullets belonging to Tang Shiliang are confiscated.

(Facts) The defendant Tang Shiliang is the Company Commander of the 3rd Company of the Special Service Battalion of the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, and Li Wenshan is the Platoon Leader of the same company. After the murder of Li Gongpu in Kunming on July 11th of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters strictly ordered its subordinates to investigate the perpetrators. Battalion Commander Tai Fugang convened a battalion affairs meeting, instructing each company to take turns being responsible for the security of the surrounding areas and secretly investigate the situation in the city. On the 15th of the same month, it was the company's turn to be on external duty. The defendants, each carrying a pistol, accompanied by the fugitive defendant Xu Zhankun, went out at approximately 11:00 am that day. They walked near the National Yunnan University and, because the university was holding a memorial service for Li Gongpu, the defendants entered to investigate. The victim, Wen Yiduo, was giving a speech, denouncing the government and insulting the military. Upon hearing the aforementioned speech, the defendants, filled with anger, immediately conceived a murderous intent. At the time, because there were many people in the venue, it was inconvenient to act. After the victim finished speaking and the meeting dispersed, the defendants followed him, eventually reaching a secluded place near Xicangpo, where they jointly opened fire and shot the victim, Wen Yiduo, who fell to the ground and died. His son, Lihe, who was walking with his father, saw his father fall and immediately prostrated himself on his father's body, also being hit by five bullets, but fortunately not fatally. Afterwards, Tang Shiliang and Xu Zhankun fled in fear of punishment. After being discovered by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters, Li Wenshan was detained. Subsequently, Battalion Commander Tai also arrested Tang Shiliang and sent him to the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters to be jointly handed over to this headquarters for interrogation. The defendants Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan both confessed to the aforementioned facts. These confessions matched the time, location, and shooting circumstances described by Wen Lihe, as well as the clothing worn by the defendants. Moreover, Tang Shiliang fled in fear of punishment after the incident and was later arrested by Battalion Commander Tai Fugang in Yiliang. The pistol and bullets used in the murder were also recovered. The evidence is conclusive. After listening to Wen Yiduo's speech, the defendants followed him to several locations and shot and killed Wen Yiduo, and wounded Wen Lihe with a gunshot. They should be held accountable for joint murder and attempted murder. However, the defendants killed Wen Lihe out of a zeal to protect his father and in the process of not being able to differentiate and clearly determine that, and this is a single act that entails multiple crimes, and each should be punished for the most serious crime. The defendants were active-duty officers who dared to kill with firearms in broad daylight in the urban area of Kunming while on duty. This is a disregard for the law and the crime is unforgivable. Each should be given the ultimate penalty. As for Tang Shiliang's escape, he was arrested within only three days, not reaching the legally prescribed time limit, so he should be considered an attempted escape. The pistol and twenty-seven bullets used in the murder are confiscated. The pistol used by Li Wenshan is public property and should be returned to the original agency. Based on the above conclusions, except for Xu Zhankun, whose case will be handled separately after he is apprehended, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Article 93, Paragraph 3, and Article 98 (attempted escape) of the Army and Air Force Criminal Law; Article 271, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, Article 25, Article 26 (murder and attempted murder), Article 28 (joint crime), Article 55 (punishment for the most serious crime), Article 37, Paragraph 1 (deprivation of civil rights), Article 38, Paragraph 1, Item 2 (confiscation of firearms and bullets), and Article 51, Paragraph 2 (concurrent punishment for two crimes); Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Article 8 of the Wartime Navy, Army, and Air Force Summary Trial Regulations; and Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Presiding Judge Zhang Xiaoqian (seal), Judge Yang Zhigou (seal), Judge Zhang Zhengdong (seal), Clerks Liu Heguang (seal), Xiong Shangde (seal), Republic of China, August 15, 35th Year.

The original text is as follows: "I received orders to go to Kunming to handle the Li and Wen assassination cases. I arrived in Kunming on July 27th and hosted a tea party on the 30th at the Yunnan Provincial Government to invite local figures and heads of various agencies, explaining the mission of coming to Kunming and Your Excellency's emphasis and concern for this case. At the same time, I strictly ordered the responsible agencies to intensify the search for the perpetrators.

I immediately forwarded the case to Zhang Xiaoqian, Deputy Director of the Military Law Department of this headquarters, for investigation and handling. This officer conducted court hearings twice on August 12th and 13th, and questioned Wen Lihe, son of Wen Yiduo, and Wen's wife, Gao Xiaozhen, and summoned the local Baojia chiefs, considering that Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan were indeed suspected of the crime. He signed a request to organize a joint military trial court. I appointed Zhang Xiaoqian, Deputy Director of the Military Law Department of this headquarters, as the Presiding Judge, and the Yunnan Provincial Security Command and the Kunming-based 13th Regiment of the Military Police each sent military law officers to form a joint court. The court was opened on August 15th at the Kunming District Court. At the same time, the Military Law Department of this headquarters sent letters to various central and local agencies in Kunming, various levels of public opinion organs, legal entities, and news reporters in Yunnan Province, as well as Mr. Liang Shuming, to attend the trial as observers. The trial concluded on the same day, and the judgment was made in accordance with the law and recorded in the files. As for the suspect Yang Lide, arrested by the Yunnan Provincial Garrison Headquarters on August 19th, it was found that he was unrelated to this case and was ordered to be released on bail. Another suspect, Li Chengye, arrested on July 21st, denied being the perpetrator of the murder of Li Gongpu and was ordered to remain in custody for further interrogation. Furthermore, all military, government, constitution and police agencies in Yunnan were instructed to continue to search for the real perpetrator to ensure the case is solved. I hereby submit two volumes of files and one original judgment of the Wen Yiduo case for your review and compliance."

### Minister Bai Receives Reporters, Hopes to Raise Alertness Regarding the Current Situation, and Discusses the Importance of National Defense Education

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 25th Dispatch] When Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense received reporters at 8:30 pm on the 25th, a reporter asked whether the organization of the Ministry of National Defense had been completed. He replied that it was generally in place, but the organization of the Army Headquarters had not yet been completed. A reporter asked what threat the Communist army's attack on Datong posed. He replied that it was inconvenient to answer this question, but added that the current situation was not about the gain or loss of one city or one place. A reporter also asked about the Communist army's counterattack on Rugao in northern Jiangsu. Bai said: "The situation in northern Jiangsu can be clarified in the short term, but please increase your awareness." It is generally believed that, given the current situation, nothing is more urgent than national defense. After the reception, the reporters were invited to view military education films.

[Central News Agency, Guling, 25th Dispatch] Minister Bai held a tea party with reporters at Guling at 8:00 pm on the 25th and viewed military films. Bai briefly discussed his views on the issue of popularizing national defense education through movies, pointing out that modern national defense is universal and comprehensive, and also scientific and technological. He stated that since the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, he has felt the importance of national defense education in the future, and in order to achieve the goal of universality and depth, many new plans and facilities have been decided for using movies as a teaching tool. The original China Film Studio is also being reorganized into a purely military education film institution. At the same time, our target will not be limited to the troops, because the scope of national defense education is not only the use of a certain type of weapon, but must enable every soldier defending the territory to have all the basic scientific knowledge. We will try our best to use movies to spread this knowledge. We are prepared to make all films of this type available to the people of the country, because only when everyone has sufficient scientific knowledge can the country's prosperity and health be promoted. After Minister Bai concluded his speech on popularizing electric national defense education, reporters wanted to know from Mr. Bai how the current situation would be affected after the Communist Party issued a mobilization order. Bai avoided answering and only said: "Everyone should trust that national defense has absolute certainty of protecting the safety of the people and maintaining local tranquility." Asked what his opinion was on the Communist Party's use of poison gas to create disturbances, he replied, "China did not use poison gas to resist Japanese aggression. Even if the Communist Party uses poison gas to rebel, I dare to guarantee that the government will never use poison gas." Asked whether he had met with Marshal Ma since coming here, he replied that he only met with Marshal Ma in Nanjing, focusing on how to complete the modern national defense system.

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 25th Dispatch] Wang Xuji, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, hosted a banquet for Minister Bai Chongxi at the Guling official residence at 7:30 pm on the 25th.

Regardless of the large number of deaths, the Communist army continues to send reinforcements, totaling more than fifty people. According to reliable reports, one-third of them are Japanese soldiers used by the Communist army, so they can rely on their superior terrain and fortifications to resist stubbornly.

### Military Service System to be Reformed; Nation Divided into Sixty-Four Garrison Districts; Commander-in-Chief Chen Encourages Military Service Personnel to Eliminate Long-Standing Abuses

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] There will be significant reforms to our nation's military service system. It is rumored that the country will be divided into sixty-four garrison districts, with each garrison district (approximately 7.5 million people) governing one hundred and ninety-nine regimental districts (Shanghai will also have one regimental district). The list of commanders will be announced soon, and the selection is extremely cautious, based on the principle of employing younger locals. Conducting military service in one's hometown can fully unleash patriotism and love for one's home, and avoid situations where one cannot face one's elders. Under the new system, the powers of the commander will be greater than in the past, and the matters they handle will be more numerous and important than in the past. All unreasonable conscription abuses of the past will be eliminated under the new system.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng attended training classes for military service personnel on both the 24th and 25th, encouraging them to thoroughly sweep away past abuses in order to build a reasonable and sound military service system. He also said: The victories of the past have not been without luck, and we should be vigilant about the current world situation, refer to the methods of various countries, and enable the military service to have a major reform.

Liang Shuming then reported on the investigation of the Li Wen case in Kunming, explaining: (1) This trip to Kunming was to conduct an independent investigation on behalf of the Democratic League, (2) The investigation content will be released in a systematic report soon, and (3) Requests that the case be transferred to Nanjing to organize a special court for trial. Zhang Dongsun then reported on the "kidnapping" of Sun Zhongyuan in Beiping, expressing doubts about Sun Zhongyuan's departure from the Democratic League. Luo Longji gave a brief report on the beating of Zhang Lan, chairman of the Democratic League, in Chengdu, stating that it is still under investigation. Finally, reporters from various newspapers raised questions, which were answered separately by representatives of the Democratic League. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:

Q: After the State Socialist Party and the Democratic Party fully formed the Democratic Socialist Party, I wonder what the differences are between the basic concepts of the new party and the original State Socialist Party. What is the relationship between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic League?

Sun Baoyi replied: The Democratic Socialist Party's program will be published soon, which can be used to explain. As for the relationship with the Democratic League, it is currently still a member of the Democratic League, but any announcements made by the Democratic League to the outside world must first obtain the consent of our party.

Q: It is rumored that Mr. Zhang Dongsun will continue to engage in education work, taking a passive attitude and unwilling to face real politics. I wonder if there has been any such statement?

Zhang Dongsun replied: I took a one-year leave of absence from Yenching University in Chongqing last year. Recently, Yenching University resumed classes, and I still hope to return to work at the school. This trip to Shanghai was to explain this intention to the leaders of the Democratic League. I cannot take full responsibility for the work of the Democratic League in Beiping. I hope to send someone else to preside over it. As for whether to participate in real political work, I have never considered it, because the reorganization of the government is probably still a long way off. After Mr. Zhang finished speaking, Luo Longji specifically explained that Mr. Zhang Dongsun's education did not break away from the Democratic League.

Q: What is the relationship between the Democratic League as a whole and its constituent members?

Luo Longji replied: Although the Democratic League is a political group, there are no strict constraints between its whole and its constituent members. It cannot be compared with the Nationalist and Communist parties. At the same time, this is an internal matter of the Democratic League and does not need to be explained to the outside world, so there is no need to answer (Mr. Luo's emotions were agitated when answering this question, and he seemed unhappy.)

Q: Liang Shuming has always advocated rural autonomy. I wonder if he continued to work during the Anti-Japanese War? It is rumored that Mr. Liang has taken a passive attitude after the Political Consultative Conference, expressing his unwillingness to participate in real politics. Is this true? From the perspective of the rural governance movement, what criticisms does Mr. Liang have of the work done by the Chinese Communist Party in the countryside?

Liang Shuming replied: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the special circumstances, the work of promoting rural governance could not be continued; (2) After the Political Consultative Conference, I published an article in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao on February 2, "Eight Years of Efforts Declared Over," stating my attitude and unwillingness to participate in real politics; (3) There are indeed great differences between the rural governance movement and the CCP's land policy.

Q: The so-called "Democratic Northeast Provisional Supreme Administrative Organization" was recently established in Harbin. I heard that Zhou Jingwen of the Democratic League also participated in it. Is this representing the Democratic League?

Luo Longji replied: Zhou Jingwen is indeed a member of the Democratic League, but because he is from the Northeast, he is only participating on behalf of himself and cannot be considered to be representing the Democratic League and cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party.

The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM. The Democratic League continued to hold a foreign press conference.

### Anping Town Conference Stalls; New Facts Discovered After Hearing Testimony; American and Communist Representatives Argue Over This

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 25th] The 25th team went to Anping to investigate yesterday afternoon. A new fact was discovered in the testimony of Cao Yuting, a resident of the town, namely that the Communist army had captured two American soldiers during the conflict between the Americans and Communists in Anping. According to the testimony of County Magistrate Ban of Xianghe County on the government side, this was indeed the case. The Communist army has now released the two Americans. This was not only not mentioned in the reports of the Communist witnesses in the past, but also never mentioned in the reports of the American witnesses in the past. Therefore, when Cao Yuting reported this yesterday, Colonel Martin, the American representative, seemed quite surprised, and Huang Yifeng, the Communist representative, also showed a state of unease. The adjournment and breakdown of the meeting afterwards seems to be related to the emergence of this new fact. According to Cao Yuting, shortly after gunshots were heard on the Ping-Lu Highway at noon on July 29, a Jeep and a truck under the surveillance of the Communist army drove from the highway and stopped briefly in front of his house. The driver of the Jeep was two American soldiers. They used broken Chinese to express their willingness to hand over their weapons to the Communist army in exchange for being released, but this request was rejected by the Communist army at the time. As for the driver of the other truck, it was a soldier of the Eighth Route Army. The capture of this truck was also not found in the reports of the American and Communist witnesses. When asked about this, it was already after 6:00 PM. Chairman Martin believed that Cao Yuting's testimony was extremely important. Since it was too late, he temporarily returned to Beiping and will come to Anping to inquire again tomorrow morning. Huang Yifeng, the Communist representative, insisted on completing the inquiry that night, otherwise it would give the government side an opportunity to fabricate evidence. Martin smiled and said, "The Anping incident happened almost a month ago. We were only able to conduct an investigation recently. Those who want to fabricate evidence have already had almost a month of ample time. We don't have to care about this one day." Zhang Shuhang, the government representative, said: "I went to Xianghe in the Communist area to listen to the testimony of witnesses designated by the CCP, and I didn't say anything. Why do you have such an attitude when you come to Anping? You say that the government is fabricating evidence and that it is unreliable. What is your basis? Please answer." Huang never answered this, and the meeting broke down. Another new fact reported by Cao Yuting that day was that on July 29, when the Communist army attacked the American army, they ordered a Hou from Anping to drive his oxcart and another neighbor's oxcart to the Ping-Jin Highway to block the road. Soon after they were placed, a car was intercepted on the highway, and the leg of a Yang surname driver was shot by the Communist army.

### Famous Traitor Female Spy Jin Bihui's Case Is Serious; Hebei High Prosecutor's Office Actively Collects Evidence

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 25th] The traitorous female spy Jin Bihui (also known as Kawashima Yoshiko) was escorted to the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office among the sixth batch of traitors and imprisoned in the First Prison. Cui Tiezhong, Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, recognizing the seriousness of the case, went to the First Prison last week to hold a court investigation. It is learned that the High Prosecutor's Office is actively collecting evidence in this case. According to Mr. Cui, Jin was once known as "Commander Jin" because she led a guerrilla force to fight against our national army. The "cross-dressed beauty" (female spy) in novels and the "Dawn of Manchukuo" in movies are all sketches of Jin. The enemy's Japanese magazines such as "Fujin Koron", "Liang You", and "Da Zhou" all have records of Jin. It has been found that Jin's contacts in Japan were all important figures in the Japanese military, police, and gendarmerie, and she had close contact with enemy Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and his wife. Jin also contributed a "Memorandum of Opinion" to Tojo, and met Wang Jingwei at the home of Touyama Mitsuru, a veteran of the enemy's Japanese invasion of China. Her whereabouts are so secretive and important that they are international. Even British and American magazines have mentioned Jin. A letter from British military attache F.V. Foote can prove that Jin's work as a traitorous spy was famous overseas. Foote's letter contained three main points: (1) He firmly believed that this woman visited the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong in September 1939 and had contact with Colonel Kajioka Niro, the head of the enemy's secret service in Guangzhou, and that the so-called "San Li" at the time was Jin. (2) Jin was the leader of the "White Fan Society," an organization of the enemy's Japanese Asian secret service. (3) Some people said that Jin was a sister of Kawashima Toyonobu, who led the enemy's Japanese southern agency in Burma.

### First Pacification District Holds Meeting to Discuss Counterinsurgency Strategies in Jiangnan; To Be Held in Changzhou Tomorrow Morning

[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 25th] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province and General Li Moan, Commander of the First Pacification District, held a Jiangnan security meeting in Suzhou before. Although they reached a general agreement on the counterinsurgency issue, they could not thoroughly discuss important items such as mobilization steps due to time constraints. Therefore, it was decided to convene the First Pacification District Security Meeting in Changzhou at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month, and ordered all commissioners and county magistrates in the jurisdiction and military commanders to personally attend to jointly discuss the detailed counterinsurgency strategies, including important issues such as mobilization, supplies, and aftermath. The county magistrate of this county has packed his bags and is ready to depart. It is also learned that General Tang Enbo is scheduled to fly from Nanjing to Kuling on the morning of the 26th to visit the Chairman to ask for instructions. If possible, he will rush back to attend.

### General Rooks' Remarks; Denies Military Advisory Group to Move to Shanghai; Dormitories for Group Members' Families Under Construction in Nanjing

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] General Rooks, head of the US Military Advisory Group, denied reports to reporters on the morning of the 25th that the group was about to move to Shanghai for work. He also said: The group has not transferred any personnel to Shanghai recently, and no organization has moved there. It is said that the origin of this rumor is mainly due to the fact that the families of the advisory group personnel who recently came to China from the United States are temporarily staying in Shanghai because the dormitories in Nanjing have not yet been completed. Currently, the personnel dormitories here are under construction and will be completed within three months. At that time, the families of the personnel in Shanghai can move here. In order to convince reporters, he ordered Captain White of the group to accompany them to visit the dormitory construction site in the middle of Xikang Road. The site is located in a well-known residential area of Nanjing, covering an area of approximately three acres, and a huge building that can accommodate 30 families is under construction by a large number of workers. Construction began three months ago and will be completed in another three months. Construction of the other two buildings can begin as soon as they are completed. Captain White, who accompanied the reporters, although a single young man, seemed to be full of envy for the family life of his comrades elsewhere when he accompanied the reporters to visit the site.

Methods for Collecting and Urging Payment of Land Tax in Wujin and Wuxing Counties

[Changzhou Correspondence from Our Newspaper] Land tax is being collected and borrowed to be used as military food. The quota assigned to this county is 20,000 shi, and orders have been issued to expedite the collection and delivery. However, at this time when the new harvest is not yet available, most grain households have no rice to pay. The county government, in view of this, has specially stipulated that grain households without rice to pay can temporarily pay 40,000 yuan per shi. The deadline is the 26th of this month, and the money should be paid to the Land Tax Collection and Loan Committee for purchasing on their behalf, and a receipt will be issued. Any surplus will be returned, and any deficiency must be made up. Special telegrams are sent to each district to be responsible for supervising and urging the payment by the deadline, without delay.

[Huzhou Correspondence from Our Newspaper] The Wuxing County Government received six articles of methods for autonomous organizations to assist in urging payment of land tax, drafted by the Zhejiang Provincial Land and Grain Office on the 22nd: (1) The head of each township and baojia should be responsible for assisting the taxation agencies in jointly urging the payment of land tax owed by each grain household within their jurisdiction. When necessary, the head of each township and baojia may also inspect the grain strings and investigate concealment of grain by grain households. (2) When the new tax is levied each year, the head of each baojia should notify all grain households of the standards for collecting youth tax, and be responsible for distributing land tax notices and guiding grain households to pay the tax. (3) If the head of each baojia finds households that owe taxes and repeatedly urges them without success, they may report to the county government or the county land and grain office to send personnel to urge payment. (4) If the households owing taxes still fail to pay after the county office sends personnel to urge payment, the head of each baojia should investigate the property of the indebted households and submit a list to the county office for legal processing. (5) If the head of each township and baojia intentionally conceals or engages in illegal activities related to the households owing taxes, they will be severely punished after verification. (6) The county office will conduct a thorough investigation of the performance of the head of each township and baojia in assisting in urging the payment of taxes and give appropriate rewards. County Magistrate Wang has already transferred the order to the township and town offices to follow.

At 9:00 am on the 24th, it was resolved to temporarily maintain the status quo and not implement the merger.

Commentary

### How to Break the Political Stalemate?

— Shao Hongbiao

From a year ago until now, the path that Chinese politics has taken is still "dragging"! "Dragging" not only cannot solve the problem, but also makes the problem more complicated and more difficult to solve? The shuttle diplomacy of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart did not bring the KMT-CPC negotiations any closer, and in recent days, the situation has been brewing for a future war between the two sides. The general public is often confused, depressed, and resentful due to the Communist Party's distorted propaganda and the organized instigation of some politicians. As for foreign friends, they often frankly use modern democratic ideals to measure China's problems, thinking that as long as they shout "democracy," the problem can be solved. But what is the result? Not only has the problem not been solved at all, but also extraneous issues have arisen, and wars are spreading everywhere?

When we examine China's political problems, we cannot ignore China's unique national conditions. China is somewhat different from any modern country.

First, China is far from being as developed as countries like Britain and the United States, and democratic politics have not yet fully grown. The highest public opinion institution has not yet been established. Although the current Political Consultative Council can be said to be a representative body of various parties, factions, and non-party members, the members of the Political Consultative Council are not entirely based on popular elections, and their powers are limited to review, suggestions, and consultations, so its democratic component is obviously small. As for the National Assembly, according to law, it is naturally the highest public opinion institution in the country, with the power to decide on important national issues. However, this institution has not yet been established at this time, and its most criticized points are: (1) The National Representatives were elected more than ten years ago, and the country and society have undergone great changes after eight years of war, so whether they can fully represent today's public opinion is questionable. (2) The National Representatives and elections use a single-member district system, that is, in an election district, only one person is elected as a representative based on the majority of votes. In this way, the majority of seats in the assembly will inevitably be occupied by the large party. Therefore, the Communist Party has always opposed the Kuomintang's proposal to convene the National Assembly to solve national problems. The country currently does not have a formal highest public opinion institution, so it naturally feels difficult to solve important national problems.

Second, China's military force is completely controlled by political parties today. The military force of a political party can only be loyal to the political party and be commanded by the political party. Once the political party wants to resist the central government and overthrow the government, its military force will become a tool for resistance and disruption. At this stage, the Kuomintang represents the people of the Republic of China in exercising state power, so the Kuomintang's military force has become the country's military force. And in this War of Resistance, they have indeed fulfilled the duties of a national army by resisting foreign aggression and defending the country. However, the Communist Party's military force still holds its narrow partisan concepts and engages in infighting and contention. During the War of Resistance, they constantly carried out surprise attacks in the rear of the National Army, confiscated the National Army's weapons, expanded their own territory, and weakened the National Army's strength in resisting Japan. These are all facts. But they want to use the opportunity of the War of Resistance to expand their military force in order to contend with the Kuomintang, which obviously goes against the interests of the country and the nation. The Communist Party's lack of a national concept is criticized by the general public. But the Communist Party is precisely using its increasingly powerful military force to prepare to seize power from the Kuomintang. If a proposal to abandon military force is put forward to it, it fundamentally violates its purpose of seizing power, and the Communist Party will ultimately reject it, despite its verbal agreement.

Third, the Republic of China is nominally a unified country, and the National Government is recognized by the world as the legitimate government representing the Republic of China. In a unified country, the command of the army and the highest power should belong to the central government. But in China, the Communist Party in opposition, because it holds military force, has occupied more than 300 counties as a base for political struggle. The CCP's army is not subject to the control and command of the central government. In its occupied areas, it has implemented class struggle and established a Soviet-style "Border Region Government." This force, which continues to expand and takes struggle as its mission, will inevitably continue to undermine peace and damage the country's vitality!

In addition to the above three points, there is also a basic contradiction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party that cannot be reconciled, that is, both have some tendencies towards dictatorship. However, the Kuomintang's "dictatorship" is ultimately to complete political tutelage and return power to the people, so it is only a process of implementing democratic politics. The Communist Party's dictatorship, on the other hand, has a permanent demand for autocracy in its system itself. Now the Communist Party often accuses the Kuomintang of being dictatorial. In fact, in all fairness, the Communist Party is more dictatorial than the Kuomintang. Fair American journalists have also said this. Because the Soviet system of proletarian dictatorship adopted by the Communist Party takes class struggle as a tool for seizing power. Its methods of violence and cruelty, as well as its treacherous and insidious tactics, are rarely seen in the world history of revolution. The success of the Soviet Communist Revolution was achieved by adopting a policy of great terror and great bloodshed, eliminating other classes and purging other political parties, so that it could establish its foundation. But the situation of the Chinese National Revolution is different. The Kuomintang's moral ideology is loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. These are the unique royal way spirits of the Chinese nation. The Kuomintang has always shown compassion and tolerance in its revolutionary process. For example, if warlords abandon military force or express awareness, and believe in the Three People's Principles, the Kuomintang will not punish them, and will often give them positions so that they can work together for the country. If the Communist Party were in the position of the Kuomintang, then other classes and people with different political views would have no room for survival. Moreover, there would be countless great bloodshed and great terror, showing bestial cruelty, sharpness, and ruthlessness, which would damage the vitality of the country and the nation. How is that like the Kuomintang, which can still tolerate the existence of other parties even though it holds power, and still wants to implement party politics and return power to the people? Today, the Communist Party is attempting to seize power by violence, while at the same time using hypocritical propaganda to anesthetize young people and deceive the vulgar. This is just a propaganda technique made by the Communist Party with a distorted heart!

Of course, we cannot deny that the Kuomintang has maintained a one-party dictatorship system from the Northern Expedition to today after the War of Resistance. But this is necessary for removing obstacles and resisting foreign aggression. It is a temporary transitional measure. The ultimate goal of the Kuomintang's revolution and nation-building is to establish a national political state of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is the credibility of the Kuomintang leaders to the people of the whole country. But the Communist Party's dictatorship is different. Now the Communist Party is launching the so-called "three-assets struggle" in its various occupied areas, aiming to eliminate people who are qualified (knowledgeable), prestigious, and have assets, and purely organize the government with the proletariat. It can be seen that the military dictatorship taken by the Communist Party during the period of struggle is also its permanent political system after the struggle. This is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang. Because the Communist Party's struggle aims to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, where the Communist Party wants to recognize the Kuomintang's position and seek permanent cooperation between the two, it is truly "climbing a tree to catch fish." Even though last year's "Double Tenth Meeting Record" had promises of permanent cooperation, it is useless. When the Communist Party's strength is not sufficient, it may temporarily acknowledge cooperation with the Kuomintang as a strategic move. But when its strength is sufficient, it will still eliminate all other parties and complete the Communist Party's autocratic situation. Recently, the CCP has repeatedly provoked well-intentioned mediators, wanting them to know the difficulty and retreat. It can be seen that it has no sincerity in consultation and negotiation at all.

Looking at it from the other side, countless Kuomintang members have shed their blood and lost their lives for revolution and nation-building for half a century. Since they have already obtained state power, they will definitely not easily give up their task of nation-building and hand it over to the Communist Party to implement communism, which at least Kuomintang members believe is not in line with the national conditions. Therefore, the Communist Party's attempt to use inferior military force and the method of "dragging" to drag down the Kuomintang and overthrow the National Government is just a futile illusion.

However, this is indeed a rigid situation. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have tried various reconciliation plans, but they have all failed. Can this dispute be resolved through peaceful negotiations?

Now let's take a look at the precedents of revolution and nation-building in advanced countries. Since the defeat of the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan, countries in the world today can be divided into two major categories in terms of political systems: one is democratic countries, represented by Britain and the United States; the other is totalitarian countries, represented by the Soviet Union. The development of British democratic politics can be said to be an evolutionary history of civil rights and monarchical power. Since the 19th century, British monarchical power has continued to shrink, while civil rights have continued to develop. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, monarchical power was completely overwhelmed by civil rights. At that time, the Liberal and Conservative parties, the former advocated civil rights without opposing the monarchy, and the latter supported monarchical power without opposing parliamentary politics. Therefore, the policies of the two parties had a harmonious color and did not tend to extremes. Therefore, for hundreds of years, the two parties have taken turns in power and have gotten along well. Recently, the Conservative Party and the Labor Party are opposed to each other, and their fundamental positions on parliamentary politics are the same in their belief. The independence of the United States was only the liberation of the colonial people from British resistance. Its political ideals are based on the civil rights thought of the nineteenth century. In its nation-building process, the northern states, due to the development of industry and commerce, wanted to open up markets, and advocated that each state was a local group. The southern states were all agricultural societies and wanted to maintain a separatist situation, and advocated that the central government was only a federation. The two sides did not give in to each other and both held military force, thus causing the so-called "Civil War" - which is what historians call the "Civil War." In the end, the South failed, and the United States became a unified federal country, and the wealth and strength of the United States was based on this. After the Russian Communist Party seized power in the October Revolution, it used harsh means to mercilessly eliminate other classes and parties, and the Soviet government had a solid foundation and completed its communist construction.

What do the examples of the above three countries illustrate? (1) The example of Britain illustrates that if there are two major parties in a country, both without party military forces, and their political views are not very different and there is no fundamental conflict, and the people of that country have a high level of political awareness and correct judgment, then the political problems of that country are easily solved by ordinary means. (2) The example of the United States illustrates that if there are two military forces in a country that are not subordinate to each other and are developing towards the same space, and they have fundamentally different concepts about the structure of the country, then conflict and war will inevitably occur. At that time, if the United States used negotiation, it must first recognize the split situation, then the unified federal state of the United States would have no way to establish it. Only after a war of unification can we talk about peace and democracy. (3) The example of Russia illustrates that a party that has seized power by military force must eliminate the opposition party - at least its military force - in order to ensure its position and realize its doctrine; otherwise, the domestic order cannot be stabilized, the policy cannot be realized, the people's livelihood will become increasingly difficult, and the people's hearts will be lost, and it will be wiped out day by day. This is creating an opportunity for the opposition party to "replace it."

China's current situation, in the situation of military division, is very similar to the United States during the period of brewing the Civil War. The Kuomintang's grasp of political power is very similar to the Soviet Russia after the October Revolution. And with Britain, there are no similar signs in any aspect. Can you ask the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to follow the example of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party in Britain? Can the Communist Party give up its advocacy of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship? Is it possible to turn China into Britain? China's current situation is the situation of the United States during the Civil War, the situation of the warlords dividing local areas; it is also the situation before and after the October Revolution in Soviet Russia, and it is even more the situation where the Communist Party wants to seize power. If the South in the United States did not give up its military force at that time and the North made peace negotiations with it, then there would be only two ways to go: (1) Recognize the split of the country, the two countries confront each other, and each goes its own way. (2) One party unconditionally handed over its military force to the other party - but this is impossible. If the first path was taken at that time, then in addition to maintaining the slave system and free trade policies, did South America have other ambitions for North America? If it is split into two countries, demarcating boundaries may maintain long-term peace, but unification is impossible. The Chinese Communist Party, when it did not have a territory, still had to riot and compete for territory. Now that it has considerable territory and military force, will it be willing to give up its various attempts to seize power before it has realized all its plans for the Chinese Soviet Government? The situation in North and South America in the past was simpler than today's China, and even with President Lincoln's kindness, it still ultimately relied on military force to resolve it. And in China, wanting to always clamor for peaceful consultation and seek a solution, how can it be effective? Again, in the Soviet Union, if the Communist Party could not quickly purge the opposing factions after seizing power in the October Revolution, then his power would not be consolidated, and communism would not be realized. Moreover, after the time is delayed, the people will inevitably feel pain, and the people will gradually feel disappointed and disoriented with the ruling party. Thus, the more a solution to the problem is sought, the more difficult it is to solve. Unfortunately, China's current situation is exactly like this!

China's Kuomintang cannot be like the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia, who can quickly eliminate the reaction and consolidate its power, nor can it follow the example of Lincoln in the United States to end the confrontation between the North and the South with military force, so that the country can enter a unified and stable domain, but only wanders on a fork in the road, which only increases the suffering of the people. This is really puzzling.

We have no prejudice against the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but this stalemate must be broken in order to avoid major problems. The author now solemnly puts forward the following points:

(1) The whole world is disgusted with war. The Chinese people have been liberated in nine deaths and one life, and are already exhausted and can no longer endure war.

(2) The Chinese people cannot be satisfied with the status quo, but they have not despaired, and they are urging the government to seek progress. If the Communist Party wants to overthrow the National Government with inferior military force and a small number of territories, causing long-term chaos and ruining the life of the nation, it is violating the will of the people.

(3) The existence of the Communist Party and the Kuomintang's principle of implementing party politics do not violate each other. We do not advocate that the government take an oppressive attitude towards the Communist Party's political activities, but if the Communist Party's army still divides local areas and undermines unity, we should regard it as a rebellious military force, and the government should quickly impose sanctions and not allow it to spread rampantly.

(4) We believe that suppressing rebellion is one thing, and opening up political power is another. The Communist Party should not use opposition to holding the government as an excuse to cover up its rebellious actions; the Kuomintang should not use the Communist army's division as an excuse to extend the period of implementation of its opening of political power. In other words, the government should suppress the rebellion on one hand and hurry up to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government on the other hand. When a true constitutional government is implemented, the Communist army will lose its excuse for initiating rebellion; and the implementation of constitutional government will be smoother when the rebellious military force is suppressed. Therefore, the two should be carried out in parallel and simultaneously.

In short, China's political problems should be measured by the happiness of the people and the vitality of the country. What the people fear most now is civil war, and they are all praying for the exemption of civil war. But if the rebellious military force attempts to overthrow the government, forcing the government to come out and suppress it, then we can only unanimously support the government and concentrate the strength of the whole country to crush this rebellious offensive. In this way, the war can be ended in the shortest possible time, and the suffering and sacrifice of the people can be reduced to a minimum. (August 22, 1946 in Shanghai)

### Ukraine Files Complaint with the UN Security Council, Accusing Greece of Endangering Peace; Claims Balkan Unrest is Caused by Britain; Another Diplomatic Offensive by the Eastern European Bloc

[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] According to a United Press report from Paris, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky held a reception for reporters on the 24th, announcing that he is filing a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, accusing the Greek government of endangering international peace in the Balkans. It is alleged that the presence of British troops in Greece and the direct interference of British representatives on behalf of the monarchist faction in Greek internal affairs are the main factors contributing to the instability of the Balkan situation. Mr. Manuilsky requested the Security Council to review the entire situation in the Balkans at its next meeting, stating that the danger to peace is due to the policies adopted by the Greek government. Greece is scheduled to hold a public referendum on September 1st, and the presence of foreign troops supporting elements who collaborated with the German invaders inevitably violates the aims and principles of the United Nations Charter. Holding a public referendum under these circumstances would also be contrary to the war aims announced by the United Nations during and after the war, which recognized the right of all countries to freely determine their own destiny and political system. The irresponsible policies adopted by the current Greek government, following those adopted since the opening of the peace conference, have created a situation that poses a serious danger to the security of the Balkans. Countless border incidents have occurred at the border between Greece and Albania, all provoked by Greek armed forces and encouraged by the Greek authorities. Greek troops have opened fire on Albanian border guards and on Albanian farmers engaged in cultivation. These incidents, coupled with the intrusion of Greek armed forces into Albanian territory, are clearly intended to provoke a war against Albania, under the pretext of occupying its southern territory. Ukraine's complaint is in response to the accusation made by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Galadze a week ago at the peace conference, alleging that Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris had proposed that Greece and Yugoslavia divide Albania between them. Mr. Manuilsky continued that the public declarations of the representatives of the current Greek government, and their speeches at the peace conference, insisting that a state of war exists between Greece and Albania, have further heightened tensions in the Balkans. The Greek government's oppression of the minorities in Macedonia, Sedans, and Epirus has caused tens of thousands to take refuge in neighboring countries to avoid being slaughtered. Macedonia and Thrace are both in northern Greece, which Bulgaria desires in order to gain access to the Aegean Sea. Epirus borders Albania, and Greece has made demands for border adjustments. Mr. Manuilsky concluded that the dangerous situation in the Balkans today is facilitated by the presence of British troops in Greece and the interference of British representatives on behalf of the monarchist faction in Greek internal affairs.

### Greek Prime Minister Reveals the Soviet Union's Intention in This Move: Likely to Divert World Attention to Conceal Its Failure at the Peace Conference

According to a report from Agence France-Presse: Upon hearing the news, Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris immediately issued a statement saying: "I am very pleased with the actions of the Ukrainian representative. The real threat to peace and security is Albania, and this should be exposed. However, the Ukrainian representative's request is likely due to the Soviet Union's desire to divert the world's attention away from its failure at the peace conference. The frequent border disputes between Greece and Albania should be blamed on Albania. The rumors of British troops interfering in Greek internal affairs are simply not true. We were elected by the Greek people and will continue to work hard, taking only the national interest as our premise in all measures. External threats will not delay the holding of the public referendum. I believe that the United Nations Security Council will uphold justice and will not lightly believe the allegations made by the representatives of Ukraine and Albania."

### Preemptive Strike Against the United States

According to a Reuters report: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office in Paris said: Ukraine's complaint will not improve the atmosphere of the Paris Peace Conference. Although it is currently impossible to judge who is right and who is wrong, the repeated incursions of Albanians into Greek territory are well-known facts. I believe that Ukraine's move is in response to the United States' intention to file a complaint with the Security Council regarding the shooting down of an American plane by Yugoslavia. It is recalled that the last time the Security Council met, shortly after Britain and the United States raised the issue of Iran, Ukraine also raised the issue of Indonesia with the Security Council. I sincerely do not know what interests Ukraine has in Indonesia and Albania.

### Romania Expresses Welcome for American and Soviet Investment

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Romanian Minister of Transportation and General Secretary of the Communist Party, Mr. Georghiu-Dej, representative to the Paris Peace Conference, stated today that, for the sake of developing Romania's economy, we welcome close cooperation between the capital of the United States and the Soviet Union with Romania. This is our sincere wish, but we do not yet know what the United States' opinion is. Two major Romanian entrepreneurs will soon go to the United States to formally discuss this matter. Many people in our country believe that the United States does not want to help us, but I believe that all difficulties can be overcome.

### U.S. Fleet Touring the Near East, Rumored to Visit Turkey

Turkey Denies Building Airfield

[Reuters, Istanbul, 24th] Turkish newspapers today carried unconfirmed reports that the U.S. fleet, while touring various ports in the Near East, will also visit the port of Smyrna. It is reported that the fleet includes the 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Roosevelt." The Turkish News Agency declared that the Soviet official news agency's claim that Turkey is building an airfield under British supervision is "completely unfounded."

### Maisky Joins Soviet Academy of Sciences

[Reuters, Moscow, 24th] It was announced here today that former Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Ivan Maisky, has been elected as a member of the History and Philosophy Department of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

### Yugoslavia Has Complied with the Ultimatum, U.S.-Yugoslav Relations Trending Toward Relaxation; Yugoslavia Agrees to Compensate for Damage to American Plane

[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] The tense relations between the United States and Yugoslavia have eased as Yugoslavia released the detained American pilots, assisted the American representatives in investigating the truth about the downed American plane, and Marshal Tito gave a verbal guarantee that such incidents would not happen again. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Washington, the State Department announced on the 24th that Yugoslavia's response to the American ultimatum has been delivered directly to Secretary of State Byrnes, who is currently in Paris, but Washington has not yet received it. U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson is sending daily reports to the State Department, and Acting Secretary of State Acheson is consulting with Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris and President Truman in Bermuda via long-distance telephone to seek instructions. The only remaining issue is the matter of compensation for the damage to the American plane. Diplomatic sources believe that, given the current situation, the United States may no longer insist on a formal response to the ultimatum. Regarding the issue of compensation, although the United States has not yet raised it, Yugoslav President Tito told U.S. Ambassador Patterson that this compensation will naturally be paid. However, some individuals do not feel overly optimistic, as they believe that the Yugoslav incident is actually an initial contact between the United States and the Soviet Union, with Yugoslavia merely serving as a figurehead. Meanwhile, according to a United Press report, although the U.S. government has indicated that Yugoslavia has yielded to the American ultimatum, the possibility of filing a complaint with the Security Council regarding the American plane being shot down still exists. A State Department official stated that whether or not to take this action will depend on official proof of the circumstances under which the American plane was shot down, and Yugoslavia's efforts to correct its mistaken behavior. The so-called "mistaken behavior" includes the deaths of five pilots on the second American plane.

### U.S. Establishes Air Defense Force to Protect National Defense; Creates University to Train Talent

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The U.S. Army Air Forces announced today that air defense forces will soon be established throughout the country to assist the regular air force in protecting national defense in the event of emergencies. The new organization is similar to the land defense force, and members will be recruited from volunteers in 48 states, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, including 3,000 pilots, 5,000 junior officers, and 50,000 soldiers, possessing 72 fighter squadrons and 12 light bomber squadrons. Some of the aircraft are equipped with the latest jet engines.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The Army Air Forces has recently established an Air University, including five colleges, to train air force officers to cope with air warfare in the atomic age. According to the announcement of the team, the basic goal of establishing the Air University is to cultivate an air force capable of defeating any powerful enemy attacking the strategic locations of its national economic lifeline. As soon as the Air Force receives notification, it can immediately go to bomb enemy cities flat. To prepare for tomorrow's air war, all Army Air Forces officers must enter the university for about five years of research. General Vandenberg, the second-in-command of the school, said that a powerful air force is the greatest force to suppress war and the greatest guarantee for maintaining world peace.

### Foreign Secretary Bevin Returns Home for Important Tasks

Various Issues Urgently Need to Be Handled

[Reuters, London, 24th] Well-informed sources here believe that Foreign Secretary Bevin's return to London from Paris today is to consult with Prime Minister Attlee at the end of the month on the following issues: (1) The current situation after the refusal of Britain, the United States, and Turkey to consider the Soviet Union's proposal to amend the status of the Black Sea Straits; (2) The crisis in Yugoslavia; (3) The lack of progress at the Paris Peace Conference; (4) The situation in Palestine; (5) The final decision on the issue of Jewish participation in the London Palestine Conference. The aforementioned topics and their relationship to the international situation are also said to be raised for discussion at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday.

[Another Dispatch] The British Cabinet will hold a meeting at the beginning of next week to discuss the situation in Egypt. It is reported that negotiations in Cairo are currently at a standstill. It is said that Bevin has indicated to the Egyptian Ambassador to Britain that if Egypt wants to form an alliance with Britain, it must first give Britain a position that can be fulfilled. If the Egyptian government needs to consider Egyptian public opinion, then Britain also needs to consider its domestic public opinion.

### U.S. Naval Attachés Withdraw from Vladivostok and Other Regions in Soviet Territory; U.S. Request to Establish Additional Consulates Unanswered; Currently Considering Taking Countermeasures Against the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: The U.S. State Department announced that the Soviet Union has requested the withdrawal of the U.S. naval attachés from Vladivostok and Arkhangelsk (a major port on the White Sea). The Department's spokesman said: These naval attachés were stationed in the above two locations under the Lend-Lease Act. Now that the Lend-Lease Act has ended, there is no reason to continue the stationing. It is also learned that the United States has requested the Soviet government to allow the establishment of additional U.S. consulates in Soviet territory, but has not yet received a response.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The dismissal of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Litvinov is seen by American diplomatic circles as a blow by the Soviet Union to British-American cooperation. At the same time, it is even more significant that the Stalin regime has greatly increased its control over the Soviet people and excluded Western countries from exploring the internal situation of the Soviet Union. The United States is directly concerned about this, as the U.S. naval attachés have, at the request of the Soviet government, withdrawn from Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok. The U.S. attaché stationed in Odessa is temporary in nature, as he is responsible for inspecting ships entering and leaving the Allied Forces. As a result of the restrictions on American representatives in Soviet territory, only the attaché stationed in Austria, the embassy in Moscow, and the consulate in Vladivostok remain. To date, the Soviet Union has ignored the United States' request to establish consulates in other cities in the Soviet Union. They do not even want to answer this question. As a result, U.S. authorities are seriously considering issuing deportation orders to some Soviet consulates in the United States, but no decision has yet been made.

### Soviet Union Vigorously Implementing Purges

The news of Litvinov's dismissal arrived at the same time as news of the purge of the Ukrainian Communist Party. It is said that the purge movement is taking place everywhere. The Leningrad literary magazine was sealed off for reflecting Western thought, which is the result of the development of the purge movement. All of this proves that Soviet nationalism is growing stronger, and the Stalin regime's control over the country is tightening. Litvinov was a symbol of opposition to this movement.

### U.S.-Soviet Diplomacy Changes Course; U.S. Shows the Era of Concessions is Over; Soviet Union Believes Collective Security is Outdated

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Well-informed sources here believe that the notes sent by the United States to the Soviet Union and countries within the Soviet sphere of influence last week are a new diplomatic policy of the United States, intended to draw a line for "Soviet expansionism." If this line is crossed, friction with the United States will be inevitable. It is said that this diplomatic action was the result of President Truman's consultation with senior diplomats and military advisors to adjust U.S. policy before leaving Washington for his trip last week. Qualified observers here believe that the main reasons for setting this diplomatic policy are three: namely (1) Soviet diplomacy is looking for "soft spots" in the American diplomatic front. From Poland to Korea in the Soviet world, the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are different. (2) The Soviet Union wants to undermine the strength of the United States in order to seize the United States' leadership in Western Europe and Asia. (3) The Soviet Union is trying to get the United States to withdraw from Europe, first diplomatically and then militarily. The United States has taken this into consideration, so it has changed its diplomatic policy to show that there is no "soft spot" in the U.S. diplomatic policy, and it also shows that the era of concessions in the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences has passed.

[United Press, London, 24th] Diplomatic sources here believe that the dismissal of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Litvinov is part of a reorganization plan for the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most observers, given the recent development of Soviet foreign policy, believe that Litvinov's departure, and his policy of "collective security" and understanding of small countries, have long been outdated. In the future, the Soviet authorities will solve international problems based on the decisions of the three or five major powers, or even bilateral agreements. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs still feels understaffed after the appointments of Gusev and Malik were announced. It is expected that Gusev will be Stalin's expert on Western problems, and Malik will be his expert on Eastern problems. However, there were originally six Deputy Foreign Ministers, but now there are only four. One of the vacancies will be filled by an advisor on Middle Eastern issues.

### Anti-Franco Demonstration Held in Trafalgar Square, London; Socialist Parties from Various Countries to Convene a Congress

[Reuters, London, 25th] The London Trades Council, in response to the resolution of the World Federation of Trade Unions Congress, is scheduled to hold a mass rally of people opposed to the Franco regime in Trafalgar Square in London today. Representatives of socialist parties from various countries will convene a congress on the 27th of this month to discuss the Spanish issue.

### Gillean Arrives in Batavia Today

To Explore the Opinions of Both Indonesian and Dutch Parties

[Reuters, Batavia, 24th] Lord Gillean, British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia, is scheduled to arrive here from Singapore on Monday. It is reported that the purpose of this trip is to explore the opinions of both the Indonesian and Dutch parties on future negotiations. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir stated in June when he made a counter-proposal that future negotiations must be held in neutral territory and chaired by a neutral person. He proposed three Englishmen as chairmen and recognized the consular office in Batavia as neutral territory. Later, due to the reorganization of the Dutch government and the kidnapping of some Indonesian leaders, negotiations were suspended. A Dutch spokesman said today that when negotiations resume, they may be based on the proposal made by Dutch Deputy Governor-General Van Mook in May and the Indonesian counter-proposal. The contents of these two documents have not yet been announced. It is reported that the distance between the two sides is still quite far.

[Reuters, London, 24th] Well-informed sources here believe that the arrival of British Special Commissioner for South Asia Gillean in Batavia is because Britain wants to know the future of resolving the current dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, as Britain still has a large number of troops stationed in the Dutch East Indies. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain has no intention of sending senior diplomats to participate in mediation.

### Representatives from Various Countries Leave Paris One After Another; Peace Conference Enters a State of Semi-Slumber; Secretariat Busy Sorting Out Amendments to the Treaty; Talk of a Temporary Recess is Rife

[Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] According to a Reuters report: British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew back to London from Paris on the 24th to report to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet on the development of the Peace Conference and the progress of the Dominion representatives' meeting. Before leaving, he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes for about an hour. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and Canadian Prime Minister King are also scheduled to depart for their respective countries on the 24th and 25th. The Political and Territorial Committee of the Hungarian Treaty resolved on the 24th to include the memorandum submitted by Hungary, which requested recognition of its contribution to the Allied forces, in the record. The Political and Territorial Committee of the Romanian Treaty also met for two and a half hours to discuss the amendments proposed by Australia. The Economic Committee of the Italian Treaty also met on the night of the 24th, but did not enter into specific discussions. Agence France-Presse said that representatives from various countries have proposed as many as 250 amendments to the draft treaties, of which 192 are important. This is enough to affect the progress of the Peace Conference. The amendments proposed by the Yugoslav representative nearly require all the clauses of the draft treaties to be amended. The second is the Australian representative, who proposed a total of 52 amendments. Writing the amendments requires a large amount of paper, and cars have been sent to Calais and Geneva to transport them. The Peace Conference Secretariat has borrowed three printing presses from the United Nations, which will soon be transported by plane. It is expected that various amendments will be distributed to representatives of various countries by Monday afternoon. The Russian and French translations have been completed, but the English translation has not yet been completed. According to a Reuters report: It is rumored here that the Paris Peace Conference may be recessed for two weeks, or will begin in early September. Although the delegations said they did not know about this, the Secretariat is already taking measures. Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange returned to Oslo from Paris on the 24th. It is said that the Paris Peace Conference may be postponed to November, but before that date, there may be some definite decisions.

### Quo Tai-Chi Broadcasts Speech in Paris

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th Special Dispatch] Quo Tai-Chi, the representative of China attending the Paris Peace Conference, said in a radio speech to the country on the night of the 23rd that China is extremely concerned about all colonial issues, and the Paris Peace Conference is expected to make a clear announcement on the general principles related to the entire colonial issue. Although the Paris Peace Conference is mainly to solve European problems, it can also set an example for the future peace conference with Japan. Therefore, we are closely watching everything that the Paris Peace Conference is doing, hoping to use the experience of the Paris Peace Conference as a reference for future peace work with Japan. Regarding the establishment of peace, he said: Peace is indeed difficult to obtain. Since war is a long-term matter, it will also take a considerable amount of time to establish peace. Therefore, we must also treat the struggle for peace with patience and determination, just as we have shown in the long war.

### Churchill in Switzerland, Very Strict Security

[Reuters, Bussierre, Switzerland, 24th] Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, along with their daughter Mary and daughter-in-law Diana Sandys, arrived here for vacation, residing in the Aux Chiots Villa. The authorities have assigned two police officers to regularly look out and guard from the top of tall trees near the villa. Detectives are densely distributed around the villa, and small boats are patrolling Lake Geneva to prevent unwelcome guests from intruding. Vehicles passing on nearby roads are also subject to strict inspection.

### United Nations Organization General Assembly to be Held in Long Island in September; Spaak Remains Chairman; Deputy Secretary-General Flies to Paris to Oppose Further Postponement

[United Press, New York, 24th] United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Sobolev flew to Paris today to present a memorandum of protest to the five major foreign ministers regarding the further postponement of the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations General Assembly was originally scheduled to convene on September 3rd, but it was later changed to September 23rd at the former site of the New York World's Fair. Recently, it was rumored that at least some of the five major leaders currently in Paris, in view of the slow progress of the Paris Peace Conference, advocate further postponement of the meeting.

[Additional Dispatch] According to a United Nations spokesperson, the United Nations General Assembly, starting on September 23rd and lasting for seven weeks at the former site of the World's Fair in New York's Long Island, is estimated to hold 300 to 400 meetings. It is expected that representatives from various countries will engage in fierce debates on issues such as the agenda and the abolition of atomic warfare. It is projected that there will be 35 plenary sessions and 15 to 20 meetings of the Steering Committee. The six main committees and thirty subcommittees will meet at Lake Success in Long Island, averaging ten meetings each. The General Assembly Secretariat will recommend that all meetings be fully open to the press, radio, and the general public. Belgian representative Spaak, who served as chairman of the General Assembly in London, will once again serve as chairman of the New York General Assembly. The chairman of the General Assembly, the seven vice-chairmen, and the chairmen of the six main committees will form the Steering Committee. The seven vice-chairmen are the chief representatives of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Union of South Africa, and Venezuela. The six main committees are as follows: (1) "Political and Security Committee": will study the voting rights of new member states, the Security Council's agenda and reports, issues concerning the limitation of veto power, and the questions of Spain and atomic warfare. The last meeting was stalled by these issues, so this committee bears a particularly heavy responsibility this time. (2) "Economic and Financial Committee": will review the reports of the Economic and Social Council and proposals from member states. (3) "Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Affairs Committee": will review reports related to refugees and displaced persons. (4) "Trusteeship Committee": will discuss trusteeship agreements. (5) "Administrative and Budgetary Committee": will study the budgets for 1946 and 1947 and the organization of the Secretariat. (6) "Legal Committee": will draft procedural rules, review the transfer of assets from the League of Nations to the United Nations, and the legal issues of organizing the United Nations headquarters.

### Marshal Tito, the Yugoslav President Who Participated in the Soviet Revolutionary War, Originally Named Broz, Came from a Peasant Family; Once Trafficked People to Spain, Aiding the Civil War

[United Press, New York, 24th] Marshal Tito rose during the war, transforming from a communist underground worker into the leader of the Yugoslav government, and a reward was once offered for his head. Fifty-four years ago, he was born into a peasant family in the village of Kumrovec, originally named Broz. Tito is a pseudonym he used to avoid the attention of the anti-communist government under the former King Alexander. Currently, he is known in Yugoslavia as "Comrade Tito." After leaving the countryside, Tito became a metallurgical worker and served as the head of the metallurgical workers' union. At the age of twenty-two, World War I broke out, and he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army, as Yugoslavia was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1915, he fled to the Soviet Union and participated in the Red Army's revolutionary war. After the success of the Soviet revolution, he returned to Yugoslavia as a radical agitator. In 1928, he was sentenced to six years in prison and remained under police surveillance after his release. He then returned to Zagreb and engaged in underground activities. When World War II broke out, he served as the Secretary-General of the Yugoslav Communist Party. During the Spanish Civil War, Tito was a major trafficker, privately transporting people to Spain to fight against Franco. These individuals, upon returning from Spain, became cadres in his Yugoslav commando unit. When the German army entered Yugoslavia in 1941, Tito was in Zagreb. His commando unit's first anti-German action occurred when the German army invaded the Soviet Union. The commando unit included both guerilla fighters and political operatives, with each unit having a political commissar and instructor. Well-trained propagandists were spread throughout the country, working for him. Tito claimed to have crushed seven "movements to overthrow Tito." By November of last year, Tito had become the leader of the National Liberation Government, and the new Yugoslav government replaced Peter II's government. Tito served as chairman, prime minister, defense minister, and commander-in-chief of the national army. He has visited the Soviet Union several times, holding talks in the Kremlin. His most recent visit to the Soviet Union coincided with the trial of the anti-communist leader Mihailović in Yugoslavia, who was eventually executed. Tito's office and private residence are located in the "White House" called Iheritov, which is heavily guarded. He has an only son named Žarko, aged twenty-one, who serves as an infantry lieutenant in the army.

### Atomic Artworks Exhibited in Paris

"New Realism"

[Agence France-Presse, Paris Dispatch] The atomic age seems to have given rise to a new school of painting. The art exhibition recently held here at the Galerie des Beaux-Arts displays works that claim to break away from all external reality and the constraints of painting. These artists proclaim "New Realism," and their paintings are bizarre in shape. The audience sees only spirals and curves, a collection of imaginative artistic fire. They use strange patterns to paint distorted human figures. In another corner of the exhibition hall are sculptures of bizarre shapes. These artworks are difficult to understand, but many people still admire this school of painting. Most professional critics believe that this type of art deserves further study, and it is expected that these strange and unusual works will become fashionable for a time.

### Italian Scientist Invents Atomic Bomb Defense Method

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 25th] According to the newspaper "Messaggero," Dr. Achina, a scientist from Imola, claims to have invented a method to transfer atomic energy from a distance and to neutralize the radiation of atomic bombs. Dr. Achina has used this design to attempt to eliminate the radiation from the recent two atomic bomb explosions at Bikini Atoll. It is said that this experiment was quite successful.

### Viceroy Wavell's Broadcast Speech Urges Muslim League to Join the Government; Cabinet Minister Aman Khan Wounded in Assassination Attempt

[Combined News Report] The interim government of India was established on the 24th, but the Muslim League has not cooperated and refuses to participate. According to a German news agency dispatch from New Delhi, five hours after announcing the establishment of the interim government, Indian Governor-General Wavell delivered a broadcast speech to the people of India, appealing to all political parties in India to work together for the benefit of the country. He said: "We have repeatedly invited the Muslim League to jointly form the interim government of India, and even now, this door is not yet closed. I hereby restate that the number of members is set at fourteen, of which six will be nominated by the Congress Party, three will be representatives of minority parties, and the remaining five can be nominated to me by the Muslim League. If I agree, and with the approval of the British King, these five can immediately join the interim government. The Muslim League need not worry about not being able to intervene in important issues, because a coalition government can only exist if both major parties are satisfied. Important departments will be jointly responsible by both sides. I firmly believe that the Muslim League will reconsider its policy and decide to participate in the government with sincerity. We must be patient. The recent disturbances in Calcutta serve as a wake-up call. It must be understood that激烈言行,無論對於個人社會,以及國家均無利益可言(intense words and deeds are not beneficial to individuals, society, or the country). As for the administration of the provinces, within the scope of provincial autonomy, the provincial governments have extensive powers and are not interfered with by the central government. The new government will have no power or intention to infringe upon the scope of provincial administration. The Minister of the Army in the new government will be an Indian. This change has been endorsed by the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army and myself. However, the constitutional position of the army is not affected, and the army should abide by its oath and remain loyal to the British King, and I remain responsible to the King and Parliament. Although the current situation is difficult to be optimistic about, I firmly believe that there is still an opportunity for an agreement between the two major parties, and a majority of people from both parties will support such an agreement. If the Muslim League can participate, the interim government can be reorganized tomorrow, and all its administrative facilities should take national interests as the premise, and party interests or religious interests are not to be considered. I firmly believe that the Muslim League will reconsider its decision not to participate in the government, because this plan to organize the interim government is sufficient to protect the interests of Indian Muslims and determine their future."

After the Governor-General's broadcast speech, according to a Reuters dispatch from Munsar, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah stated on the night of the 24th that he needed to study Governor-General Wavell's broadcast speech in detail before he could express his opinion. According to a New Delhi wire, Governor-General Wavell and Congress Party leader Nehru may hold talks with Muslim League leader Jinnah in the near future, and senior Muslim League officials have expressed their welcome to this.

While the two sides were seeking rapprochement, an unfortunate incident suddenly occurred. According to a Reuters dispatch from Simla, Aman Khan, a member of the interim government, was attacked on the night of the 24th while walking home after a stroll, suffering seven knife wounds, but is now out of danger. The two assailants escaped and are being sought. Aman Khan is a Muslim, but not a member of the Muslim League.

### UNRRA Director Arrives in Minsk

[United Press, London, 25th] Moscow Radio reported today that UNRRA Director La Guardia has arrived in Minsk, Soviet Union.

### Puyi in Tokyo Living Comfortably and Leisurely

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 25th] Puyi, who played the role of the main character in the puppet show directed by Japanese warlords and is now recounting his ten-year emperor dream at the Tokyo International Tribunal, is currently living in a two-story Western-style house in the Allied forces dormitory as a witness. It is simple and chic, this is the "imperial residence" where the puppet emperor is staying in Tokyo. When he has time, he reads English newspapers in front of the eaves, where cicadas chirp. Although he has been testifying in court for days, he does not appear tired. Since arriving in Tokyo, he has been living in this residence with Soviet Colonel Alekishunte and five other Soviet officials, spending his leisure time in peace. He gets up every morning at 7:00, does some light exercises, has breakfast with Colonel Alekishunte and others at 8:00, has dinner at 7:00 every night, and before going to bed at 11:00, he either reads or plays Western chess, enjoying the summer evenings. In the reception room of the residence, the flesh-colored curtains and various decorations complement each other, creating a Chinese atmosphere. Among the decorations are valuable items such as Chinese ceramics. The Soviet military's preferential treatment of Puyi can be seen from this. Today, the reporter visited Puyi in his reception room. He held a Soviet-made cigarette, smoking leisurely, and told the reporter: "This time, I came to Japan to testify and live a leisurely life with my close friends. I also went to the city to visit. Unlike my previous 'visit' to Tokyo, which was very restricted, I feel comfortable both physically and mentally."

### Post-War Commercial Depression in the Far East; American Shipping Industry Opens New Routes to Seek New Markets in Malaya and the East Indies

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Due to the post-war commercial depression in China and Japan, the American Pacific shipping industry is now opening up new commercial markets in Malaya and the East Indies. American shipping companies, which previously mostly operated on routes to China, Japan, the Philippines, and even India, are now seeking rights to expand their scope from the East Indies through Malaya to the Bay of Bengal, in order to transport rubber products, tin, coconuts, and other products from that region. Before the war, only three American shipping companies operated on the East Indies route. Currently, six other companies are seeking to join the route.

### Wife and Son of Martyr Zhang Yongchun Die Tragically on Route Bisson; U.S. Army Doctor's Car Mounts Sidewalk Causing a Series of Accidents; Driver Attempts to Flee and is Arrested

Madam Cheng Dingjun, the wife of the late Shanghai Municipal Party Committee member Zhang Yongchun, is currently the principal of a municipal primary school. At 7:20 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 24th), she was returning to school after purchasing textbooks from a bookstore, accompanied by her second son, Zhang Pingxun (17 years old), when suddenly a U.S. Army hospital car, Shanghai Kuo 41194, driven by a Russian named George Chobuts, speeding out of control, mounted the sidewalk where Madam Zhang and her son were walking. Madam Zhang and her son could not avoid it. Zhang Pingxun, 17, was killed instantly next to the roadside bamboo fence. Madam Zhang was also thrown more than ten feet away, suffering serious injuries. The driver of the military car, seeing that he had caused an accident, attempted to escape, but a tree planted by the roadside was also knocked down, blocking his path. Passersby noticed and reported it to the police officer on duty at the time, number 201, who took the Russian driver to the police station. Under questioning, it was revealed that before causing the accident in front of number 51 on Route Bisson, the military car had similarly mounted the sidewalk at the intersection of Route Xujiahui and Route Halaraste, number 160, smashing a large hole in the stone wall of number 160. The driver fled in panic, but unexpectedly caused this major accident on Route Bisson. Therefore, there is no doubt that the driver should bear absolute responsibility for the occurrence of such unfortunate events. After being seriously injured, Madam Zhang was immediately sent to the U.S. Army Hospital on Route Haig for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective. She was then transferred to Guangci Hospital, where she died of her injuries at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. After Madam Zhang was seriously injured, she was unable to speak and provide details to notify her family. Later, an address was found in her briefcase, revealing that she was the wife of the martyr Zhang Yongchun. Martyr Zhang was a former member of the Municipal Party Committee. In 1943, he was arrested by the enemy, tortured with poisonous means, and forced to confess. Zhang remained loyal and died for his cause. Martyr Zhang left behind five children, the youngest of whom is now only three years old. Zhang's family was in dire straits, and the family's expenses were supported by Madam Zhang's hard work. Now, unfortunately, Madam Zhang and her beloved son have also suffered misfortune, and the lives of the remaining four children are a cause for concern. It is learned that the bodies of Madam Cheng and her son are scheduled to be placed in coffins at the Yianping Road Funeral Parlor on the afternoon of the 26th.

### Enlisting Domestic Technicians to Establish Post-War Industry and Commerce; Shanghai Branch of China Production Promotion Association Established

[Our Report] The Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Hall yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Representatives from various circles, including Zhang Wei, Zhu Ping, Xi Yushu, Luo Qinghua, Xu Jiguang, and others, from 41 units, as well as more than a hundred members, attended. The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Mao Qingxiang, stating that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, insightful people in the industrial and commercial sectors, in view of the stability and turmoil of the economy in the rear during the war, as well as the development and stagnation of production, which are the main factors determining the outcome of modern warfare, invited government leaders, social dignitaries, and authorities from various fields to jointly establish the China Wartime Production Promotion Association in Hankou in the spring of 1938. Due to sudden changes in the environment, the association headquarters was moved to Chongqing. Over the past eight years, members have worked hard and made the greatest contribution and responsibility to the War of Resistance. When the war improved and victory was in sight, in order to cooperate with the government's national construction plan, the general assembly passed a resolution to report the cancellation of the word "wartime," intending to continue to forge ahead after the victory in accordance with the original purpose, so that it would become a national and permanent industrial and commercial social organization. Shanghai is the economic hub and industrial and commercial center of the country, so it is especially necessary to establish a branch. At a time when society has not stabilized, labor and capital have not been coordinated, imports and exports cannot be balanced, and factory takeovers have not been well done, industry and commerce are on the verge of collapse. The future work of this association is very arduous. This association should fully absorb domestic technical experts and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about production as members, and try to invest a large amount of floating capital in domestic production, promote the standardization of production, and the capital cooperation movement, in order to establish new post-war production enterprises, strengthen China's own industry and commerce, and hope that the industrial and commercial circles will pay attention to scientific research in order to improve China's backward industry and commerce. Then, Mao Shengdong reported on the preparations, stating that the preparations began on the 27th of last month and have lasted only four weeks. The first week was spent handling form registration and other procedures. Currently, more than 220 units have participated, and the association's address is currently applying to the municipal government for allocation and is temporarily located at 37 Route Mahou. After the report, Xu Lunqing, Hu Boxiang, Pan Shihao, and others gave speeches in succession. An honorary salute telegram to the chairman was temporarily passed. Finally, honorary directors, including Wu Guozhen and 47 others, 24 directors, 7 supervisors, and 26 consultants were elected.

### Gold Imports Must Be Verified with Passports

With the appropriate supply from the Central Bank, the price of gold is becoming more stable. Jianghai Customs recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, issuing Announcement No. 71, stipulating that all capital imports must be verified with passports issued by the Ministry before being released. Strict restrictions are also imposed on passengers carrying gold jewelry into the country. This is another important measure taken by the government to strengthen gold control. The Jianghai Customs announcement is recorded as follows: "Having received an order from the Ministry of Finance, henceforth, all gold imports must be verified with passports issued by the Ministry before being released. Passengers carrying gold jewelry into the country shall be inspected and released in accordance with the following regulations: (a) Gold jewelry refers to objects that have the shape of ornaments and are made entirely or partially of gold. (b) The gold jewelry is indeed intended for the passenger's current personal wear or for personal use. (c) The total amount of pure gold contained in the gold jewelry must not exceed 37.7994 grams. If the amount exceeds this, all gold or gold jewelry carried should be detained and reported to the Ministry for verification. This is hereby announced for compliance."

### Journalist Association Standing Committee Directors Welcome American Radio Writer

During the meeting, they exchanged views on journalistic affairs. Norman Corwin visited China Electric yesterday.

The standing committee directors of the Shanghai Journalists Association, Feng Youzhen, Chen Xunlian, Zhan Wenhun, Ma Shuli, Yuan Yeyu, and others, hosted a banquet last night at the New Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road to welcome the American radio writer Norman Corwin. During the banquet, they exchanged many views on journalistic work. They discussed how reporters sent to foreign countries for news coverage often lack a thorough understanding of the national conditions and political situations of those countries, leading to misunderstandings during news gathering and potentially inaccurate reports being published, causing adverse effects. Mr. Corwin expressed great concern about this issue, advocating that when news organizations in various countries send reporters to work abroad, they should establish an examination body to conduct appropriate examinations for the assigned reporters. The examination subjects should include the history, geography, language, writing system, political situation, customs, and diplomatic relations with the reporter's home country. Only after passing this examination should they be permitted to be sent abroad, which would prevent the aforementioned situations from occurring.

Furthermore, after hosting reporters on the morning of the 24th, Norman Corwin, the first recipient of the "One World" award and an American radio writer, drove to the general management office of the Central Film Studio on Haig Road at 3 PM, visiting the studio's director, Luo Xuelian. Mr. Luo immediately introduced him to the studio's directing committee members, Zhang Junxiang, Wu Yonggang, Chen Liting, and others for discussions. As the film "Distant Love" was being filmed on the lawn of the general management office, he was accompanied by the director of the Second Studio, Xu Suling, and others to observe the filming process for a considerable time. Mr. Corwin expressed great admiration for the content of the film. After the visit, he invited the film's actors Zhao Dan, Tai Yi, and Wu Yin to the director's office for an impromptu radio recording. He left at 6 PM, expressing to reporters that he was deeply impressed by the achievements of Chinese cinema amidst hardship and the diligent spirit of Mr. Luo, greatly admiring them.

### Wan Molin's Wounds Have Not Healed; He Eagerly Awaits Permission for Bail for Medical Treatment

Wan Molin was suddenly detained by the Garrison Headquarters due to the grain loan case. It is said that during the Anti-Japanese War, Wan was ordered to work underground in Shanghai, contacting special central personnel. He was arrested twice by the enemy and puppets, suffering various tortures, sacrificing himself, and remaining unyielding. His creative contributions were significant, as deeply known by Jiang Bocheng, Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaozhu, and others. To this day, his wounds are still festering, requiring daily medical treatment. Wan is known to be loyal. His involvement in the grain loan case, leading to his implication, is perhaps due to being deceived by others. People in society deeply regret this. It is said that influential figures in society earnestly hope that the authorities, before the case is adjudicated, will consider his past merits and grant him bail for medical treatment to show compassion.

### Typhoon Changes Direction, Now Hitting the Sea of Japan; Shanghai-Nanjing Area Can Be Spared

### The Zoo is Desolate; Due to Man-Made Disasters and Natural Calamities, Birds and Animals are Scattered; Alligators are Killed; Many Peacocks Die Young

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Zoo was once extremely prosperous under the management of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. The zoo was systematic in the feeding environment, hygiene, death replacement, and the collection of new species. However, after the Japanese invasion of the concessions, it was completely destroyed. The managers were mostly incompetent, some even slaughtering and eating the animals they were supposed to be feeding, resulting in the zoo having few animals left after several years. Tigers, leopards, and birds had all disappeared. After the victory, the total number of animals in Shanghai's parks was extremely small. When the zoo was taken over, the few animals from various parks were gathered in the zoo at Zhongshan Park. Three alligators, a pair of golden pheasants, and a mouflon were added. The personnel in charge of the zoo currently find the low level of tourist behavior the most difficult to handle. Although there are signs in the park prohibiting teasing the animals, and a park patrol is assigned to monitor, tourists still disregard the rules and ignore warnings. This is especially true of soldiers. Two of the alligators in the park were killed by soldiers using large stones. Furthermore, the animal shelters are old and dilapidated, exposed to the sun and rain, making the animals susceptible to death. This spring, the zoo hatched five peacocks, but unfortunately, they were met with continuous rainy days. Although they were placed indoors, they could not escape the wind and rain and died one after another. Also, another mouflon broke through the fence at night and escaped through the broken part of the fence. After it was discovered, more than ten people were sent to search for it, spending three or four days, but without success. In addition, ten monkeys, dogs, elk, deer, and other animals taken over are still alive and well. Currently, the most urgent task for the zoo is the repair of the buildings. It is said that an application has been submitted to the municipal government for funding.

### Elimination of Opium in the City Can Be Completed in One Year

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to severely eliminate opium, it had already decided to set the end of April this year as the deadline for the registration of opium addicts in the city and to limit them to automatic abstinence within two months. At that time, there were more than 300 arrests of those who failed to register and were caught, and movie stars Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen also spent time behind bars as a result. As of the end of April this year, a total of 6,060 opium addicts were registered with the bureau. According to the principle of abstinence within two months, they should have reformed themselves by the end of June.

It is learned that the police bureau inspected 355 people last month. Starting this month, the work will be further strengthened. According to the authorities, the elimination of opium in the city can be completed by the end of October next year.

### Lovers Attempt Double Suicide; Man Jumps from Building; Woman Takes Poison

[Reported by this newspaper] At 2:15 AM yesterday, at Room 504 of the Asia Hotel at No. 135 Zhongzheng East Road, two young men and women suddenly committed suicide. The man, Liang Jin (31 years old, from Shandong), was formerly a waiter at the Gonghechang Shenzhuang at No. 212 Guangdong Road and is currently unemployed. Liang and the woman, Yang Lanfen (25 years old, from the same hometown), had known each other since childhood. After growing up, Liang came to Shanghai to work, while Yang was married to someone by her parents' arrangement. A few years ago, Yang's mother's family moved to Shanghai (No. 4 Hongyunfang, Lane 94, Ninghai West Road), and Lanfen also came to Shanghai with her husband because it was not easy to rent a house, temporarily residing at her mother's place. A month ago, Liang and Lanfen unexpectedly encountered each other somewhere, overwhelmed with joy and pouring out their hearts to each other, revealing their long-standing affection. As a result, they frequently visited each other, their love flourishing. At that time, Yang's husband was suffering from a chronic illness and had returned to his hometown for treatment a year ago. Therefore, the two of them often secretly rented rooms and had intimate conversations. However, this clandestine affair was not a long-term solution. After several discussions, they borrowed a room at the Asia Hotel the night before and committed double suicide. Liang, taking advantage of the late and quiet night, jumped from the fifth floor, dying on the spot. The woman swallowed Amyrone cream in advance and was also poisoned. After being discovered by the waiter, the Huangpu Sub-bureau was notified, and personnel were dispatched to send her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that she is out of danger.

### Jewish Swindler Exposed

[Reported by this newspaper] Jiang Lutang, 42 years old, from Zhejiang, general manager of Hua Ying Enterprise Company at No. 40 Hong Kong Road, ordered 1,000 rolls of American oil felt from Lianying Company at No. 102 Central Building on February 14, with a payment of US$5,502.27. At that time, it was agreed that the goods would be delivered by the end of April, but after a delay of six months, no goods had arrived in Shanghai. Last month, Jiang negotiated with the company's manager, a Jewish man named Quinsburg, and the result was an agreement to refund the payment, signing an August 22 date ticket for a beneficial bank, equivalent to 20.85 million legal tender. At that time, the deputy manager, Braun Locke, also wrote a guarantee stating that the ticket would not be dishonored on the due date. However, when the ticket was presented for collection, it was dishonored due to insufficient funds. The plaintiff reported the situation to the Huangpu Police Bureau, who detained Quinsburg for interrogation. He admitted to issuing the check indiscriminately. It is reported that he will be transferred to the District Attorney's Office this morning for investigation.

### Forging Official Documents to Extort; Imbibing Wine to Celebrate; Surrendering Upon Arrest

[Reported by this newspaper] Shi Zhaolang, 22 years old, from Chongming, opened a Shi Wanxing Gluten Noodle Shop at No. 71 Fuxing East Road (i.e., Heping Road) in the Old Fourth Gate and also served as a volunteer policeman. On July 15, a man named Tang Hongping (27 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 2, Lane 263, Fuxing Middle Road) came to Shi with a document in the name of Lin Zhengdao, saying, "I was sent by the Garrison Headquarters, and someone has secretly reported that you are suspected of being a Communist sympathizer." Shi was greatly frightened and pleaded with him. Tang immediately extorted 2 million yuan as a reward. After several negotiations, it was reduced to 500,000 yuan, with payment agreed to be made on the 6th of this month. At that time, Shi only gave 200,000 yuan, with the remainder agreed to be paid on the 25th. Tang then gave this document to Shi, instructing him to handle it carefully. After Shi obtained the document, he examined it carefully for a long time and began to notice loopholes, determining that it was a forgery. By yesterday morning, knowing that Tang would definitely come to collect the money, he deliberately prepared a banquet to wait. At noon, Tang did arrive, and Shi welcomed him and treated him like a guest of honor, while secretly ordering people to report to the Penglai Police Sub-bureau. Yao Qihong, Chief of the sub-bureau, ordered Yao Yuanlong, head of the second section, Liang Shaochang, policeman, Wang Dianxiang, and Shan Zhendong to disguise themselves and rush to the scene. As the wine reached the third round, when they raised their cups to drink heartily, they immediately seized him, took him to the bureau for interrogation, and learned that he had a handgun and handcuffs in his residence. The police then went to his home to search, and as a result, they found a pair of handcuffs and another forged document, also in the name of Lin Zhengdao. The document contained the words "Presented to Chen, Commander-in-Chief of the Political Department of the 48th Army." After interrogation, Tang confessed that he had attempted to blackmail Cai Zhihong, owner of Cai Hongji Hardware Store at No. 2 Yifengli, Niuzhuang Road, by accusing him of aiding the enemy during the puppet regime in order to extort money, but because he had sought Cai Zhihong twice without success, and Cai had also moved elsewhere, he did not achieve his goal.

### The Public Concession Hospital After Takeover: Improving Facilities to Meet Growing Service Demands

By chance, I visited the Public Concession Hospital, which the Health Bureau took over in recent years. The hospital was founded in 1864, funded by foreign officials and civilians at the time. The original location was a rented building on the Bund outside the former French Concession. It was not until twelve years later that a new hospital building was constructed on the current site – west of the Baidu Bridge on Suzhou Creek – and its scale gradually established. Traditionally, the hospital's affairs were entirely handled by the board of directors. Last September, the Municipal Health Bureau appointed Dr. Zhu Yanggao to take over the hospital and, based on the existing system, drafted measures for the integration of the old and new boards. The board consisted of eleven members: two British expatriates in Shanghai, two American expatriates in Shanghai, four medical experts, and three respected local figures, including one Chinese and one foreign custodian director each. Later, Mayor Wu, after careful study of the hospital's organizational structure, believed that the previously drafted board organization methods were still not perfect and should be revised. This is currently being planned, and the new board of directors of the hospital may be formally established in the near future.

Under the persistent and diligent efforts of Dr. Zhu Yanggao – the current hospital director – the hospital, which was once in a precarious state, is now on a path of prosperity. In the past, the Public Concession Hospital only provided convenience to foreigners. If Chinese citizens wanted to enter, they could only stay in first-class wards and had to adhere to British and American lifestyles. Now, of course, only illness is considered, regardless of nationality, and Chinese and foreigners are treated equally. Previously, there were only 200 beds and only the director and one resident physician. Now, the number of beds has been expanded to 300, and physicians in all departments have been fully hired. No treatment requires the assistance of outside doctors. In addition, storerooms filled with sundries have been cleaned up, more than ten outpatient departments have been opened, empty houses next to the hospital and the residences of workers have been reorganized, and a separate infectious disease hospital has been opened. All of this has developed within a short period! In the past, the hospital's total expenditure required subsidies from the old Public Works Department of 30 to 40 percent. Today, with the expanded scope of services, the hospital can be completely self-sufficient financially. Even during the most difficult period of takeover and reorganization, it only borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Health Bureau, but this was quickly repaid. The rest relied on private mediation and expansion of business to compensate for costs, never relying on government subsidies.

To be mindful of the difficult living conditions of public officials, they first established measures to provide preferential treatment to public officials. In addition to semi-obligatory physical examinations (with all necessary tests, costing only 4,000 yuan), hospitalization, outpatient services, and treatment costs are all discounted. At the same time, ordinary citizens are given special preference, with one hundred beds in each department designated for ordinary citizens, costing 5,000 yuan per day. There is also a completely free quota for the extremely poor. In addition, at the beginning of the victory, when Allied soldiers were involved in traffic accidents, the authorities specifically asked the hospital to assist in treating the injured, and the number of people treated and healed reached several hundred. The fees charged were exceptionally low. The hospital also specially established an emergency department, providing services day and night, due to the dense population in the urban area and the frequent occurrence of injuries or emergencies. Furthermore, to cultivate a new generation of talent, outstanding medical school students are specially selected to intern at the hospital. All of this represents new contributions since the takeover.

The hospital director warmly welcomed me and accompanied me on a tour of the entire hospital, starting from the top floor, not even missing the kitchen and bathroom. Although I am an outsider, after detailed explanations, I was also fascinated by the highest realms reached by modern science and gained a lot of knowledge. For example, the row of operating rooms, including one equipped for urethral surgery, is said to be the most advanced and unique in Shanghai. In addition, the newly painted hospital buildings, the neatness and cleanliness, the diligence of the staff, the solemn atmosphere, and the orderliness are all things that even an outsider can appreciate.

Director Zhu has no sense of complacency regarding such achievements. He is planning and determined to greatly expand the hospital in order to achieve the same level of a complete hospital as those in Europe and America. At the same time, they also expressed that if the hospital's finances become more stable in the future, they also hope to reduce the general fee standards; although they are already lower than the Hong En Hospital of similar scale.

### Believe It or Not: The Bank of China's Grand Vault, Magnificent in Scale, Unmatched in the World: Layers of Steel Plates Unafraid of Artillery Fire, Intricate Mechanisms Impassable to a Drop of Water

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Believe it or not, the vault with the most boxes and the largest scale in the world is located in the basement of the Bank of China Building on the Bund. In this vault, the total number of boxes, large and small, including five vaults, is 11,193. It is said that the largest bank vault in the United States only has more than 8,000 boxes.

The reporter, guided by Mr. Cai Yimin, the director of the bank's custody department, toured the inside and outside of this giant vault. First, we took the elevator directly to the basement. Opening the door, we entered a small square glass room. This is the first room for customers entering the vault. The three glass walls are all one and a half inches thick and made of bulletproof glass. They are fitted together with thick steel channels. People inside and outside can only see each other and cannot transmit sound. In the middle of the glass wall, there is a very small steel trough and a pure steel speaking tube. When customers enter, they must first show their credentials at the trough and speak into the tube. After approval, they enter the first door.

The second door is the most complex and largest vault door. This door, including the frame, weighs 45 tons. It is entirely made of non-melting steel. However, the two door pivots are each covered with more than ten layers of steel ball bearings, so the door's rotation is exceptionally flexible. A single person can move it with very little effort.

The door's exterior is round, with a thickness of about two feet. The door's perimeter is fitted with 24 bolts. By simply turning the dial in front of the door, these 24 bolts extend together, resembling a gear, inserted into the slots of the door frame. This locks the door.

Speaking of the door's opening and closing, there are two extremely complex combination dials. In addition, there are four small clocks. These are usually calibrated with the time. The door can only be opened after the combination dials are aligned and the small clocks reach the calibrated time. For example, the Bank of China vault's usual business hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. They calibrate the four small clocks according to this time in advance. Therefore, even if the combination dials are aligned, one must wait until 9:00 AM to open the door. This precise door-opening design (1) prevents people who know the combination from opening the door and entering at midnight or after business hours; (2) prevents bandits from coercing bank employees to open the door at midnight.

The door's surface layer is filled with gas. If someone tries to secretly drill through the door, the gas will come out when they just drill through the first layer, causing the person drilling to faint for more than ten hours, but not fatally. Water cannot enter this door when it is closed normally. However, there is a fail-safe mechanism: the door slot is filled with a layer of [gap], which automatically expands upon contact with water, immediately [sealing] any possible gaps in the door.

After passing through this complex vault door, and then through a simpler steel gate, one finally enters the vault room. There are five sizes of safe deposit boxes, densely arranged in neat rows. The smallest boxes are on the upper layers, and the boxes become larger closer to the bottom layers. Between the rows, there are corridors covered with oiled felt. The vault's lighting uses specially designed fluorescent tubes. They are inlaid in a row along the upper edge of each section, and the light is extremely soft and pleasant.

The outer wall of each box is made of half-inch thick pure steel plate. Opening a box requires passing through three locks. The box has two keyholes. To open the box, the customer's key and the vault's master key must be inserted at the same time. After opening the box and taking out the contents, there is another lock, which the customer opens themselves.

In addition to the five sizes of safe deposit boxes, there are also five vaults the size of ordinary elevator shafts, intended for storing large quantities of items. If the items are too large, the customer can seal the original items and hand them over to the vault for storage as is, and the vault will issue a receipt. These originally sealed items are stored in a "vault within a vault."

Originally, the vault itself, except for the ceiling and floor, is sealed with dense layers of steel plates. The surrounding walls are two feet thick. The inner and outer layers are extremely thick steel plates. The inner layer's structure is entirely made of reinforced concrete, steel mesh, steel plates, and other composite materials. Outside this layer of walls, separated by a corridor about four feet wide, is the bank's outermost wall. The inner wall of this layer is covered with thick and thin electric wires. Patrol officers patrol this narrow corridor day and night. The so-called "vault within a vault" is a small vault with two-foot-thick walls constructed within this vault.

The vault room has the latest airflow and temperature equipment. The vault's temperature is maintained at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, with air conditioning in hot weather and heating in snowy weather. The entry and exit of airflow have specific routes. Therefore, although the vault is firmly located in a steel-walled underground cellar, the air is no different from the outside, but the temperature is much more comfortable. This airflow and temperature equipment will definitely not cause the stored items to corrode or become moldy. The reporter could not help but wonder if the airflow inlet would become a major loophole in the vault. But no! The airflow inlet also has a dedicated control room, which also has that complex door that must be opened with a combination. Air can circulate, but one cannot cross the line using this.

The raw materials for this vault came from the York Safe and Lock Company in the United States. It is said that there is also a similar vault with the same design, but smaller in scale, in a bank in Manila, Philippines. During the scorched-earth battle in the Philippines, this bank's building was completely destroyed, but this vault remained intact. In addition, the Bank of China's Hongkou branch also has a small vault with the same design. During the enemy occupation, the Japanese spent much effort trying to open it, but ultimately failed. Therefore, the items stored in the vault before the war remained untouched after the victory. This is a miracle in the history of safe deposit boxes. If you want to enjoy this miracle, simply apply for the smallest safe deposit box from the Bank of China's trust department. This is a permanent [solution] for the valuable property that the general public can afford.

### The Municipal Education Loan Committee Mobilizes Students Citywide to Promote Domestic Product Discount Coupons: Target Set at 3 Billion

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee, the Student Union, the Scholarship Joint Association, and the Love National Products Movement Committee are organizing a domestic products market starting September 1st to raise education loans to rescue young people who have dropped out of school. The event will last five days and is scheduled to end on [date]. The site is located inside the Ba Xian Qiao Franco-Chinese Middle School and will consist of five departments: (1) Domestic Products Department: Various manufacturers will set up booths to sell goods and [aid] scholarships. (2) Charity Sale Department: Students will collect goods and donate all proceeds from the charity sale to the loan fund. (3) Service Department: Responsible by Tongde [University], specializing in checking the body of guests, etc., and the service fees collected will also be used for scholarships. (4) Entertainment Department: Contracted by external parties, charging rental fees. (5) Exhibition Department: Displaying the manufacturing process of goods, students' academic achievements, etc. All transactions within the market will use discount coupons, and the proceeds from the sale of goods, after the manufacturers recover their costs, will be donated to the loan fund. It is estimated that after all 3 billion yuan worth of goods are sold, the income will be close to 1 billion yuan. The discount coupons are divided into five denominations: 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000 yuan. They will be distributed to various school recruitment teams starting today to promote sales widely.

[Another Report] The Education Loan Committee convened a meeting of domestic product manufacturers yesterday (the 25th) morning. Attendees included Chen Ruhui, Hu Boxiang, Shen Mengshi, Jiang Zhonghe, etc. It was agreed that participating manufacturers should deliver goods before the 28th of this month for arrangement, and Shen Mengshi was elected as the general manager of the market on the spot. As of now, the manufacturers registered to participate include Lixing Thermos Factory, Family Industrial Cooperative, Jingfu Shirt and Socks Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, China Chemical Industrial Cooperative, Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Kailin Food Factory, and 18 other companies. According to Chen Ruhui, Chairman of the Loan Committee, in addition to the domestic products market, a charity sale market will also be set up inside Aurora University. This charity sale market will be entirely supplied and managed by students themselves. The discount coupons distributed so far have reached more than 1 billion yuan, but are still far from the target of 3 billion. In order to encourage students to promote sales, it is specifically stipulated that those who sell more than 500,000 yuan are guaranteed 50% of their tuition fees, and those who sell more than 1 million yuan can get all their tuition fees, meaning that students receiving relief should also rise up to help, not just enjoy the benefits. It is also learned that the Loan Committee has now mobilized students citywide to carry out a large-scale campaign. The discount coupons for the domestic products market set up for the loan fund were already being promoted by 40 small teams in major entertainment venues at 5 PM yesterday. Each person is equipped with a badge for identification. Each team member is responsible for selling 1 million yuan worth of discount coupons, it is said.

### Mobile Library Vehicles: Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Set Them Up to Replace Street-Corner Comic Book Stalls

The National Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, considering the prevalence of comic book stalls on the streets and in the alleys of the city, although repeated attention has been paid to the improvement of the comic books and strict measures have been taken to ban content containing supernatural, obscene, or thieving elements, inevitably there are still unregistered and unapproved books or old books published during the enemy occupation period mixed in, which has a great impact on the thinking of women and children. Recently, it has specifically requested the police to assist in inspection and prohibition. In addition, the National Education Department plans to set up mobile library vehicles, so that both passive and active methods are used simultaneously. The mobile library vehicle is a pioneering initiative in our country. The vehicle is filled with interesting books and illustrations, and employees will push them to the streets and alleys to provide free reading for children and women. However, the detailed specific methods are still under consideration. At the same time, due to the excessive cost, it may first trial run 10 to 20 mobile vehicles, and expand the program if the results are good.

Another report: Ying Yongyu, executive director of the Shanghai Children's Library, sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday, requesting the ban of [harmful] illustrations and [suggesting] the addition of mobile library [vehicles], which would rotate daily on various roads, providing free reading for citizens to supplement the lack of spiritual food.

### Shanghai Student Association Issues Declaration Protesting Tuition Hikes

The Shanghai Student Association, to protest tuition increases, issued a declaration yesterday (the 25th). The content is as follows: Fellow students, as the start of the semester approaches, we were suddenly hit with the news of rising tuition fees, which sends shivers down our spines. Education profiteers, disregarding the government's national policy, the education authorities' orders, the burden on parents, and the students' studies, have decided to drastically increase tuition, threatening us and forcing many students to drop out. If we students do not resist and protest this rash action ourselves, the consequences will be even more unimaginable. In order to save the current education crisis and seek the welfare of all students, we dare to propose the following solutions, hoping that people in the education sector will adopt them. First, we urge the school authorities to calculate tuition fees based on the ratio of commodity prices, and not to increase tuition fees arbitrarily and groundlessly based solely on subjective assumptions. We hope they will consider the financial burden on students' parents and the difficulty of paying tuition fees at once, and adjust tuition fees reasonably under the principle of open school finances and balanced budgets each semester, and formulate installment payment methods to reduce the burden on parents. Second, we demand that each school set up at least 20% of tuition-free places to solve the problem of school dropout for poor students. Third, we demand that the government and education authorities impose effective sanctions on schools that unreasonably raise tuition fees, and at the same time, according to the actual situation, provide subsidies and rewards to schools that are well-managed, in order to guide the education sector to strive for progress and eradicate the spread of the vulgar commercialism. Fourth, we urge all sectors to effectively assist the educational loan movement and donate large sums of money to help truly poor students continue their studies and avoid being threatened by rising tuition fees. Fellow students! For our own studies and for the studies of our brothers and sisters in the future, we should resolutely oppose the bureaucratic practices of the education sector and overthrow the vulgar commercialism that treats schools as markets and students as commodities. However, these are only passive measures. We should actively seek our own welfare and reduce the chance of dropping out of school. Now, our student association is cooperating with the Educational Loan Association to promote the student loan movement, hoping to solve our own problem of dropping out of school with our own strength. However, the success of the work still requires the joint efforts of all students. Those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. On the one hand, we must oppose tuition increases, and on the other hand, we must make advance arrangements for poor students to overcome the difficulties of rising tuition together! We firmly advocate: (1) Oppose unreasonable increases in huge tuition fees! (2) Oppose one-time payment! (3) Demand that schools make their finances public, improve teachers' salaries, save expenses as much as possible, reduce the burden on parents, and oppose private school principals manipulating finances for personal gain! (4) Demand that schools set up more tuition-free places! (5) Demand that the government allocate special funds to develop education and increase opportunities for compatriots to study! (6) Demand that the government effectively assist and promote the educational loan movement!

### Senior Singles Tennis: Tao Guanqiu and Carson Qualify for Finals; Carson and Wang Wage Grueling 26-Game Second Set; Championship Decider This Thursday

[Our Reporter] In senior men's singles lawn tennis, Tao Guanqiu and Carson have qualified for the finals. Yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 PM, the semi-finals were held at Jiaozhou Park.

Tao-Xie Contest

The tennis court in Jiaozhou Park was well-arranged, and there were over a thousand spectators, a rare sight for tennis matches in a long time. However, the lawn was not perfect. In the first match between Tao and Xie, Xie's hitting style was acceptable, but his unforced errors piled up, and his backhand was unreliable, making him no match for Tao Guanqiu. The first two sets had no competition at all. In the third set, when Xie was behind 0-4, he won four consecutive games from the fifth game, actually tying the score at 4-4. Tao finally won with a score of 6-4.

Unprecedented Grinding Match

The Carson-Wang Wenzheng match started at 5:00 PM. Wang Wenzheng was no match for Carson, but he also worked particularly hard yesterday. Carson won the first and third sets with a score of 6-4, and the second set was a grueling 26 games before a winner was decided, which was unexpected. The entire match lasted about two and a half hours, which shows the intensity of the competition. Carson's deep shots, short shots, net play, and overhead smashes were all excellent, and his backhand was flawless. Wang Wenzheng was indeed inferior. In the first set, Carson took the lead with 5-2, Wang chased to 5-4, and Carson won another game. In the second set, Carson again took the lead with 5-4, but the next serve was lost, and then the score was 5-5, and it was difficult to distinguish between them. Both sides were exhausted until Wang Wenzheng's serve was broken in the 25th game, and Carson won 14-12. In the third set, the situation was set, and Carson won again with 6-4 after 4-4.

Thursday's Final

Carson will compete with Tao Guanqiu at Jiaoyuan this Thursday (the 29th) afternoon to win the men's senior singles title. This afternoon, the two women's singles semi-finals that were originally scheduled will still be held at Jiaoyuan.

Civil Affairs Briefing

### Strictly Punish Corrupt Officials, Simplify Administrative Procedures, Municipal Government Orders All Affiliated Agencies to Comply

The municipal government recently relayed the instructions of the Executive Yuan and submitted them to the National Government, suggesting that effective measures be taken quickly to thoroughly 　 renew politics, a case suggested by the Fourth Session of the Second National Political Council. The Secretary of the Supreme National Defense Committee should send it to the civil affairs office of the municipal government to forward it, and should immediately order the separate implementation. Items 3 and 7 of the original proposal are copied and distributed for compliance. The following is an exploration of items 3 and 7 of the program: (3) Strictly punish corrupt officials and Baojia personnel at all levels of government, (7) Truly simplify administrative procedures and strengthen administrative efficiency. After receiving the order, the municipal government issued an order to all its affiliated agencies yesterday to comply.

### Issuance of National Identity Cards -- Provisional Measures Amendment Highlights --

The provisional measures for issuing national identity cards by the municipal government of this city were previously approved and implemented by the 22nd municipal meeting. There are many inconsistencies between these measures and the newly promulgated detailed rules for the implementation of household registration. The civil affairs office has amended them in accordance with the new law. The amendment highlights include: (1) A printing fee of 100 yuan will be charged for each national identity card. (2) If a national identity card is lost, it must be declared invalid in the newspaper before applying for a replacement. (3) The validity of the identity card extends to all regions. If citizens carry identity cards transferred from other counties and cities, this city will no longer reissue them. If citizens move out, the identity card does not need to be returned, and the same applies to moving within the city. It is heard that this amendment draft has been approved by the 44th municipal meeting and will be promulgated and implemented soon. As for the collection of printing fees for identity cards, it is heard that the regulations will be implemented from October 1.

### Financial Bureau Employees' Mutual Aid and Relief Measures, Municipal Government Orders Referral for Handling

Due to rising prices and increasing pressure on life, the municipal financial bureau's staff's salaries and incomes are more meager than those of any profession. If they become ill or unfortunately die, the medical treatment and aftercare costs are quite high and difficult to arrange for a while. Therefore, based on the principle of mutual assistance, 11 articles of the mutual aid and relief measures for employees have been drafted. All relief funds will be deducted at 1/1000 of the salary that each employee in the bureau should receive each month, stored to generate interest, and an organized committee will be responsible for safekeeping. If there are any applications for relief, they will be allocated at any time and reported to the municipal government for record. Yesterday, the municipal government copied and distributed the original measures and ordered all affiliated agencies to refer to them for handling.

### Shantytowns of Six Bao in the Fourteenth District Call for a Delay in Demolishing Thatched Houses

The thatched houses of Six Bao in the Fourteenth District along the railway have repeatedly requested the Railway Bureau to delay their demolition. On the 5th of this month, the police department of the bureau issued a notice again, saying that the thatched houses within the boundary must be automatically demolished within one month, and those who violate the order will be forcibly executed. After reading this notice, the residents of the Bao were panicked. The locals understood that the Railway Bureau had not delimited the road boundary in advance, and there were no clear boundaries to follow. Once forcibly demolished, hundreds of families would be forced to wander the streets and have nowhere to live. The Bao chief in charge submitted a special report to the district office yesterday and forwarded it to the municipal government for a quick letter to the Railway Bureau to slow down the demolition. At the same time, a proposal was drafted and sent to the council for assistance in handling the matter in order to alleviate the suffering of the people.

### Second District Rechecks Household Registration

The Second District Office of this city held a joint police and Bao meeting with the Laoza Police Bureau at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 23rd). Attendees included District Chief Li Ruchun, Branch Chief Song Anmin, relevant section chiefs and section chiefs, and all Bao cadres. The meeting discussed household registration recheck matters and adjourned at 5:00 PM. It is also heard that the district bureau will start a joint police and Bao household registration recheck from today. It is expected that after this recheck, the most accurate number of households in the district will be obtained.

### Fifteenth District Promotes Public Education

Shen Tingzu, the Bao chief of the 42nd Bao in the 15th District, Gao Xingliang, the deputy Bao chief, and local enthusiasts such as Wang Xitang, etc., in order to help out-of-school children in the Bao and promote national education, initiated the opening of a Bao National School. A meeting of the heads of the various Jia was held at the Bao office a few days ago, and Huang, the director of the cultural section of the district office, gave guidance to organize a preparatory committee to be responsible for raising funds. At the same time, special solicitations are made to major merchants and other households in the Bao. In recent days, preparations have been actively underway, and it has been decided to attend school on time in early September. In addition, the district people's representatives of the district held their first congress on the 18th of this month. It is learned that the chairman of the council, Mr. Yu Bingwen, is waiting to promote the cases decided one by one. Therefore, on the 24th and 25th of this month, preparatory meetings of the finance, mediation, health, and education committees were convened successively to discuss the implementation of matters together.

### Household Registration Regulations, Questions and Answers (Continued)

(38) Question: When registering for the first time, applicants often use nicknames, which do not match the names on their qualification certificates. How should they apply for correction?

Answer: The qualification certificate should be used to request that the nickname on the household registration book be changed.

(39) Question: For a certain business household, half of the registered residents are natives and half are temporary residents. Should they be registered separately at the time of registration, and should the parent column of the household registration book and the temporary registration book be filled in?

Answer: When a certain business household has both native and temporary residents, they should be registered separately, and the person with the status of parent should be filled in the parent column of the registration book.

(40) Question: Articles 8 and 9 of the Household Registration Law stipulate that for temple households and relief agency households, the years of residence of the resident religious believers and the fostered persons without or with unclear native places are inconsistent. If no native or temporary registration is set, what should be used as a basis?

Answer: Article 8 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that the monks and other religious believers of temples are different. The time of residence should be based on the nationality of their supervisors to apply for registration. Article 9 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that the fostered persons without or with unclear native places in relief agencies should be compiled into one household if they have not lived for three years and apply for temporary registration. Those who have lived for more than three years should apply for native registration separately.

(41) Question: How should the transfer of religious believers from temple households be handled?

Answer: Registration of establishment and cancellation can be done directly.

(42) Question: The latter part of Article 5 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that "one person shall not have two temporary registrations at the same time." Does this stipulation mean that if a person already has a temporary registration in another county, even if he has lived in this county for six months, he cannot set up a temporary registration again without going through the transfer registration procedure? Or if a person has lived in this county for six months, he must set up a temporary registration, and the temporary registration must be cancelled if he already has a temporary registration in other counties and cities?

Answer: According to Articles 41 and 44 of the Household Registration Law, the chief of household registration in the original temporary registration place and the new temporary registration place should be asked to apply for cancellation and transfer registrations respectively.

### Vegetables and Local Produce: North and South Markets Established, Daily Turnover Approximately 70 Million Yuan, Procurement from Outside the City Besides Vegetable Vendors

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Vegetable and Local Produce Sales Joint Venture Market, South Shanghai District Market, held its inaugural meeting yesterday at 2 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Eighty-four members attended and mutually elected Shen Qichao as the temporary chairman. After the customary formalities, the chairman delivered a speech and reported on the preparations, stating that the formation of the market had been fraught with difficulties. Fortunately, with the efforts of colleagues and the assistance and guidance of the municipal authorities and the Social Affairs Bureau, preparations were successfully completed. The vegetable and local produce industry in the city has faced operational difficulties since the dissolution of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Market. Before the war, businesses had their own sites, buildings, docks, and other facilities, most of which were destroyed during the war. During the enemy puppet regime, they were forced to concentrate operations in the "Central Market." After the victory, the "Central Market" was taken over by the Agricultural Products Market. After the Agricultural Products Market was dissolved, the industry suddenly lost a large, centralized operating area, and operations could not be developed.

Market Establishment Process

Subsequently, the industry in various districts jointly petitioned the city government for relief. On June 24th of this year, the city government responded, expressing sympathy for the request and approving the provisional organization of a joint venture market. On July 5th, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the filing. Now, the South District Market has been successfully established. In the future, the development of operations will rely on the cooperation of all vendors. Efforts will be made to stabilize vegetable and local produce prices while safeguarding the costs of farmers and the legitimate profits of vendors. Subsequently, Wu Hanbang, the supervisor stationed at the market by the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech. Finally, thirty-one articles of association were passed, and directors and supervisors were elected. According to the result, Qi Sipin, Shen Qichao, Qi Pinpu, Dong Xiaocheng, Tang Yongchang, Wu Baocheng, Zhang Shouren, Sheng Rongjin, Yan Muyun, Tang Muxiang, and Ma Wenbiao were elected as directors, while Zhang Xiaofang, Wang Yueting, and Bu Ruqiao were elected as supervisors. Jiang Wenhuan and Lu Wenbao were elected as alternate directors, and Gong Pinmei was elected as an alternate supervisor. The meeting then adjourned. Immediately afterwards, the first meeting of the directors and supervisors was held, and Qi Sipin was elected as chairman, with Shen Qichao, Dong Xiaocheng, Zhang Shouren, and Ma Wenbiao as managing directors. Shen Qichao was appointed as the market manager, and Ma Wenbiao as the deputy manager.

To Operate in Three Districts

The North Shanghai District Market was established as early as July 20th. The chairman is Jin Weiyu, the market manager is Pan Yijun, and the deputy manager is Shen Wenbin. Currently, under the structure of the Shanghai Vegetable and Local Produce Industry Sales Joint Venture Market, the established district markets are the South Shanghai and North Shanghai districts. The West District is still being organized. The South District currently has ninety-five members. The area includes Dongjiadu, Huangjia Wharf, Dama Wharf, the Sixteenth Settlement, and the Huangpu Bund Road area. The market address is 60 Limalu, Nanshi. The North District has one hundred and twenty members. The area includes Lao Zha, Touba, Xin Zha, and Caojiadu, etc. The market address is 21 Xizang North Road. Any member merchant of the Shanghai Vegetable and Local Produce Industry Guild, certified by the respective industry guild, may join as a joint venture merchant.

Membership is Not Mandatory

However, membership is not compulsory. The operating principle of the merchants is to purchase local products from outside the city, such as Suzhou and Wuxi, to supplement the insufficiency of vegetables produced in the four suburban areas of Shanghai. Therefore, merchants often provide loans to farmers in various rural areas when seeds are planted to supplement seeds, raw materials, and various equipment. After the crops are ripe, they are handed over to the merchants for sale. This is the main business of the merchants.

According to several leading figures at the meeting, vegetables and local produce are different from other goods in nature. (1) They are easily perishable and cannot be stockpiled. (2) Repeated handling and transportation are labor-intensive and result in a lot of damage. Therefore, the market price at the vegetable markets must be slightly higher than that of the market. The price of ordinary vegetables depends on the amount of supply. For example, recently, due to the hot and dry weather, the amount of vegetables has decreased, which is a common occurrence from May to September every year. Therefore, the market price of general vegetables is inevitably more expensive. However, once vegetable production returns to normal, prices will fall. Regarding commissions, merchants in the city take 3% from the vendors and 3% from the stallholders. It is said that this commission rate is lower than in other places. Currently, the daily turnover of the North and South District Markets is approximately 70 million yuan. It has not been heard that vegetable vendors from the four suburban areas of Shanghai have been forcibly detained along the way to weigh their goods. If this happens, the market will appeal to the relevant authorities to effectively stop it. As for the market location problems in the North and South Districts, it is now possible to find ways to solve them one by one. Regarding the sheds, the Agricultural Products Market Clearance Office has requested the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly assess the prices, and the merchants will raise funds to purchase them. Regarding the market sites, as most of them are owned by private landlords, the merchants will separately enter into contracts with them to decide whether to lease or purchase them.

### Domestic Paint: Maintaining Original Prices

After the exchange rate adjustment, which caused price fluctuations, the Sailboat brand paint produced by Wanli Paint Factory, in support of national policy, maintained its original price and jointly issued a public notice with other paint companies to lead the way. Dong Risen, the person in charge of the factory, is one of the standing directors of the Paint Industry Guild. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the blind price increase of domestic tung oil.

### Commodity Prices After Exchange Rate Adjustment: Comparison of Price Changes of Major Commodities in a Week

Since the exchange rate adjustment last Monday, the market has fluctuated sharply. In addition to imported goods, native products and daily necessities that are generally considered unrelated to foreign exchange have also risen one after another. Although some goods have not increased in price on the surface due to various reasons, the black market has risen sharply, which has become an open fact. Some goods have increased sharply and then decreased slightly, while others have initially remained stable and then gradually increased. The following table lists the highest and lowest prices of major commodities on Saturday of the previous week (before the exchange rate was adjusted), Saturday of last week, and during last week (after the exchange rate had been adjusted) for reference. (Unit: Yuan)

Tea Sales to the US Mostly Old Tea, No Agreement Yet on Barter Trade with the Soviet Union

China tea industry insiders are not optimistic about the export situation of Chinese tea after the exchange rate adjustment. According to industry insiders, the US and the Soviet Union, the main markets for Chinese tea exports, are still disputing the price and quality of Chinese tea. Regarding barter trade with the Soviet Union, the China Trust Bureau has held discussions with the Soviet commercial delegation in Shanghai. The Soviet Union then sent an expert to Shanghai to be responsible for tea. The proposed price is based on the New York Chinese tea market price. The China Trust Bureau believes that the New York tea market is the price of old tea. If you want to buy new tea this year, the cost of origin must be added. The Soviet side has not agreed to this so far, which has led to the delay in tea sales to the Soviet Union. If the deadlock cannot be broken, there is little hope for Chinese tea sales to the Soviet Union this year. As for the United States, the price limit for tea is USD 0.57 for the highest grade of black tea, which is only 1,900 yuan in legal tender, and USD 0.485 for the highest grade of green tea, which is 1,620 yuan in legal tender. The current export price of new tea is at least 2,400 yuan per catty, a difference of as much as 50%. Therefore, tea merchants have not yet considered the export of new tea. Currently, Chinese tea sold to the United States is all old tea.

### Exchange of Goods Between Within and Outside the Customs Gradual Smoothing, Provisional Measures for Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces

[Report from this newspaper, Pan Yang, 25th] Since the announcement and implementation on the 16th of the regulations for the exchange of goods within and outside the customs and commercial and industrial remittances, the number of applications for goods transportation registration has been considerable, but due to recent military transportation relations, it has not yet started. In terms of commercial and industrial remittances, negotiations are underway with the Bank of China on procedures. It will start after the agreement is reached. According to the report of the Central Bank Jian Guan Branch, the exchange of goods within and outside the customs from May to July shows that imports are more than exports. After the lifting of the grain transportation ban, the main import goods were grain, followed by soybean cake, hardware, aluminum products, hemp paper, with a total value of over 34.8 billion yuan in national currency. Exports include foreign goods, cigarettes, sugar, saccharin, flour, cloth, tea, matches, etc., with a total value of over 12.43 billion yuan in national currency. It is estimated that the foreign goods smuggled out of the customs exceed this number by two times. In stores in Shenyang, Changchun, and other places, there are already American goods such as glass raincoats and handbags. As for American cigarettes, they have long been filled with the streets and alleys of various cities. After the restoration of the Northeast, the goods and odds and ends sold by the Japanese have now become a thing of the past. As for local industrial products, they are still insignificant.

The Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, in order to facilitate commercial transportation and open up remittances, has specially formulated the Provisional Implementation Measures for Commercial and Industrial Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces, the original text is as follows:

Article 1. These Measures are formulated in accordance with the Provisional Measures for the Management of Remittances in the Nine Northeastern Provinces promulgated by the Ministry of Finance.

Article 2. All legitimate industrialists and businessmen who comply with the Provisional Measures for the Regulation of Commercial Goods Import and Export may apply for remittances.

Article 3. Commercial and industrial remittances between the Nine Northeastern Provinces and the customs are handled by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau designated by the Central Bank.

Article 4. Industrialists and businessmen who remit money from the Nine Northeastern Provinces to the customs should apply to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau. However, for industrial remittances of more than 1 million circulation coupons or commercial remittances of more than 500,000 circulation coupons, the remitting bank must apply to the Northeast Branch of the Joint Treasury on behalf of the applicant. After verification, a remittance notice will be issued before the exchange can be settled.

Article 5. Legitimate industrialists and businessmen who remit money from various places in the customs to the Nine Northeastern Provinces should first apply to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, or the Central Trust Bureau in the local area, and only after verification can the remittance be accepted.

Article 6. The exchange rate between the Nine Northeastern Provinces and the mainland is announced by the Central Bank.

Article 7. Staff members of the industrial and commercial sectors inside and outside the customs who remit money for family expenses shall handle it according to the standards approved by the Northeast Branch of the Joint Treasury.

Article 8. For the import of foreign bills or cash with a total value of more than 50,000 circulation coupons, the local Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, or Central Trust Bureau should be applied to on their behalf.

Article 9. The banks and bureaus designated by the Central Bank to handle commercial and industrial remittances shall list the remittance situation and figures at any time and report them to the Economic Committee for review.

Article 10. These Measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Sugar Rationing Still Required in Britain, the United States, and Canada

[United Press, Munderley, 24th] Sir Locke, Director of the Sugar Bureau of the British Ministry of Food, reported that although the world sugar situation is gradually improving, the sugar rationing in Britain, the United States, and Canada may have to be extended to 1947.

### Reviving Embroidery and Lace Trade: Advice from American Businessmen: Low Labor Costs and New Styles are Needed

[Report from this newspaper] At the annual meeting of the China Export Commodity Exhibition held on the 24th, Everett, Honorary Secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, was invited to speak on the topic of "China's Handmade Embroidery and Lace Trade." The speech stated that high labor costs, lack of creativity, and domestic instability will cause China to lose its leading position in the export of embroidery and lace. This industry originated in Europe and flourished in France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, reaching its artistic peak in the Renaissance. The largest customer for these folk industrial products has always been the United States, almost entirely relying on foreign markets. During the First World War, the European market was destroyed by the war. With the help of church people stationed in China, the embroidery and lace industry began to develop, covering Guangzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Wuxi, Changshu, Shaoxing, Weihaiwei, Zhifu, and Peiping. The quality of Zhifu products soon reached the same level as in Europe, but the price was lower. Therefore, the United States and the world, even after the outbreak of the war in China, still relied on the import of Chinese textiles, until the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was terminated. During World War II, the United States mostly imported from Matla and Powderico. With low labor costs and new styles, the neat and beautiful machine-made products have almost replaced China. If China wants to recover its lost position, it must completely exempt import raw materials from taxation, reduce the parcel postage at the time of export, and create new styles. Everett concluded: "If wages do not rise, the adjustment of the exchange rate may slightly improve this situation."

### Minsheng Loan Successful, Totaling 3 Billion Yuan, New Ships to be Purchased

Minsheng Company has suffered huge losses in recent years. The company's directors have advocated for closure. After General Manager Lu Zuofu spent several months traveling between Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, explaining the difficulties to the government and powerful parties and asking for ways to maintain the company, he won the sympathy and support of all parties. The company's request for a government loan has been approved by the Executive Yuan, totaling 300 million yuan. The necessary loan procedures are being handled. Therefore, the company will maintain its current status and plans to expand its business. Lu Zuofu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the afternoon of the 24th to handle important matters and will go to the United States next month to purchase new ships and various equipment. Before going to the United States, Lu Zuofu will return to Chongqing to report to the company's board of directors.

### Decline in Sino-Japanese Trade, American Shipping Companies Seek to Change Direction

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Due to the decline in trade between China and Japan after the war, American Pacific shipping companies are now shifting their development focus to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, as the cargo business in that region seems more promising. In the past, American Pacific shipping lines were concentrated in Japan, China, the Philippines, or India, but now they plan to expand to the region of the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and even the Bay of Bengal.

### Britain Plans to Reduce Taxes and Subsidies to Encourage the Use of Oil Instead of Coal

[Reuters, London, 24th] The Chancellor of the Exchequer recently announced that he is prepared to recommend a reduction of one penny per gallon in the import tax on diesel in next year's budget bill. Before implementation, the government will temporarily subsidize diesel consumers with one pound sterling per ton. He said that the purpose of this measure is to reduce the cost of factories currently using oil as fuel and to encourage more use of fuel oil and save coal.

### Calculated in Legal Tender, Americans are All Millionaires

[United Press, New York, 24th] The Commercial Daily pointed out today that, calculated in Chinese legal tender, almost all Americans are millionaires. According to the 1945 statistics, the average annual income of the American people was USD 1,150. If calculated at the current exchange rate, it would be equivalent to 3,852,000 yuan in Chinese legal tender.

### Commodity Tax of 45%, Cosmetics Industry Overwhelmed, Smuggled Goods Dumping, Small and Medium-sized Factories Already Bankrupt

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Hu Boxiang, chairman of the Cosmetics Industry Guild, to inquire about the impact of the exchange rate adjustment on the general national goods industry. He said that the government's determination to adjust the exchange rate will undoubtedly benefit the domestic industry a lot. He also said that the best phenomenon these days is the stability of gold prices. The increase is extremely small compared to before the exchange rate adjustment, which is commendable. However, it is hoped that the prices of food and other major industrial raw materials will not rise, so that industrial production costs can remain unchanged. Speaking of the current situation of the cosmetics industry, it has been threatened by the devaluation and dumping of foreign smuggled goods in recent months. Several small and medium-sized factories have closed down. Large factories also feel it is difficult to maintain. It is hoped that the exchange rate adjustment will remedy this unfavorable situation. In the commodity tax regulations recently issued by the central government, the tax rate for cosmetics is as high as 45%. Mr. Hu specially pointed out that most of the cosmetics produced by national goods factories are daily necessities such as soap. Over-taxation is not only unrealistic but will also destroy the development of the industry. Therefore, the board of directors convened a meeting a few days ago and submitted a request through the Industry Association to the authorities for exemption. It is reported that the products of the cosmetics industry and most of the national goods factories are usually sold mainly to the vast rural areas. Therefore, the restoration and cultivation of rural purchasing power is an urgent matter. At the same time, it is hoped that the situation will be stabilized soon and transportation will be restored as soon as possible, so that the products of national goods factories can be sold well in the mainland. As for the Nanyang market, it is still unable to export in large quantities due to the high domestic price level. Even if there is, it is mostly sporadic and experimental transactions.

### China's Economy in Transition

— Ping

During the Anti-Japanese War, tax revenues sharply decreased while expenditures frequently increased. Financial maintenance depended entirely on currency issuance. Although the exact figures were not publicly announced, financial authorities were well aware of the situation. Therefore, immediately after the victory, the focus shifted to tightening the money supply, adopting the following measures: (1) overvaluing the legal tender exchange rate to reduce currency issuance; (2) selling enemy and puppet regime assets at high prices to recover more currency; (3) allocating and selling gold to capture domestic idle capital; (4) using state monopolies of certain enterprises to increase government revenue. However, military operations had not ceased, and downsizing had not been completed, preventing the achievement of the expected results. Instead, prices and wages mutually influenced each other, and imported goods under foreign management sold well domestically. This, combined with the proportionate stimulus, made it impossible to export domestic products, creating the current precarious economic situation.

This is not to say that tightening the money supply is inappropriate; currency should not have been inflated in the first place. However, merely tightening the money supply only results in a shift of wealth between the government and the people, without benefiting the national economy. Nor is it to say that tightening the money supply is ineffective; after all, it did prevent a collapse similar to the German Mark and Russian Ruble. However, relying solely on tightening the money supply can only stabilize currency value temporarily and is difficult to sustain. Now that the government and the people have been competing for profits for years, the trip of representatives of industry and commerce to Beijing to petition, and the request for exporting Chinese cotton yarn, indicate that both the government and the people feel the need for a change in course. Therefore, there may be signs of a positive turn in our country's economic future.

How can the economy thrive alone when military and political affairs are not yet settled? However, given the alarming trade deficit and the decline of industry and commerce, we will soon see frequent bankruptcies and increasing unemployment. Therefore, we can no longer wait for the pacification of military and political affairs but must implement economic remedies immediately. In principle, we must prioritize the effectiveness of the economy and base it on the national economy. We must also reform the "revenue-only" doctrine of finance and replace it with thrift in expenditure. For the people's wealth leads to the country's wealth, and thrift enables balance. For now, let us not discuss long-term strategies. If we can only implement measures that are easy to put into action, we may be able to avert the impending collapse.

The American cotton obtained from the US loan, if used for textile rehabilitation and to meet domestic fabric shortages, will only alleviate unemployment temporarily and slightly relieve the accumulated hardships of the past eight years. However, US loans are not always available, and they are sufficient for emergencies but not a solution to poverty. Once the products are entirely absorbed by consumers, both foreign exchange and US cotton will be unsustainable, and this reviving textile industry will return to decline. If the products, or easily obtainable replicas such as knitwear, are exported, then when the foreign market is favorable to us, in addition to recovering the original amount of foreign exchange to purchase US cotton for continuous production, the surplus materials can both alleviate domestic shortages and be exchanged for other important raw materials to revitalize other industries. If the foreign market is unfavorable to us, then at a small cost, we can maintain the livelihood of a large number of domestic laborers and save government relief expenditures, while still maintaining the source of US cotton and foreign exchange.

For example, as reported, the Liuhe Yongli Company cannot produce fertilizer due to a lack of coal and coke. Fertilizer is an indispensable raw material for mountain crops. It is regrettable that the company cannot contribute to the country amidst the cries of food shortages. If the government can exchange coal for fertilizer and distribute it to mountain residents, the increase in production will reduce government relief expenditures and save foreign exchange on imported rice. If there is more to spare, exporting it to Southeast Asia can also allow domestically unnecessary coal to earn valuable foreign exchange or essential raw materials, stimulating other domestic industries. Because its cyclical production and distribution are mutually beneficial, prices can be suppressed, the cost of living can be lowered, and the costs of other agricultural and industrial products can be drastically reduced, facilitating exports.

Revolution is certainly not ease and comfort, and democracy certainly does not mean selfishness. Even in advanced democracies like Britain and the United States, they are still engaged in price management and resource allocation. Management and allocation do not harm democracy and are certainly not comparable to monopoly and exclusive control. The US cotton obtained by the government through loans can be evenly distributed to state-owned and private factories according to production capacity, exchanging cotton for yarn, and yarn for cloth or other knitted goods. In addition to the necessary wages, legitimate profits should also be provided. However, all products cannot be supplied to domestic consumers first but should be centrally collected by the government and exported through special permits. This is to avoid private profiteering and self-competition in foreign markets. As for other agricultural and industrial products, why can't they be done in a similar way?

### Taiwan Sugar, Sweet for the Industry, Bitter for the People - Taiwan Airmail Report, 17th - Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

Taiwan, hailed as the "Sugar Kingdom," is now facing economic anxieties among its people due to the high price of sugar, an unprecedented and dreamlike situation. In the past half-century, they had never encountered anything like this. They can vividly recall the low prices of sugar not long ago:

Before August last year: Highest price per catty (斤, approx. 1.1 lbs): 6 jiao (角, 1/10 of a yuan)

After August last year: Highest price per catty: 10 yuan

November last year: Highest price per catty: 1.5 yuan

End of June this year: Highest price per catty: 20 yuan (rising by 1-2 yuan daily starting in July)

July 16th this year: Highest price per catty: 50 yuan (equivalent to 1,500 legal tender)

Breaking through the 40-yuan mark within ten days, it is shocking to eat such expensive sugar in a sugar-producing region. The dream of the Sugar Kingdom has been shattered.

Annual Sugar Consumption in Taiwan

Taiwanese people have never felt sugar consumption to be a burden. With a population of six million requiring 40,000 tons of sugar annually, the average annual consumption per person is 7 kilograms. Looking at other parts of the world shows that consumption in Taiwan is not high:

Australia: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 54 kg

United States: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 50 kg

United Kingdom: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 46 kg

Switzerland: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 42 kg

Canada: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 41 kg

Japan: Average annual sugar consumption per person: 12 kg

China (Mainland): Average annual sugar consumption per person: 2 kg (Note)

Taiwanese sugar consumption is far less than that of the Japanese, while total sugar production once reached 1.46 million metric tons (one metric ton equals 2,000 kilograms). This massive number now threatens the sugar-producing region, which is worth studying!

[Note] According to a survey by the Sichuan Sugarcane Experimental Field, domestic annual production is 412,900 metric tons, and the average imported sugar volume is 688,000 metric tons, totaling 1,100,900 metric tons. This figure is used as the total annual consumption for the country.

Sugar Reserves After Retrocession

According to people in the sugar industry, the sugar reserves in Taiwan are also substantial. The total sugar reserves last year were estimated at 840,000 metric tons, of which about 330,000 metric tons were destroyed in bombing, leaving 520,000 metric tons. However, this number continued to decrease. When the Taiwan Advance Command Post was established before the Japanese surrender, the sugar reserves only had 300,000 metric tons left. After a month of supervisory period, it decreased to 240,000 metric tons, and at the time of takeover, only 150,000 metric tons were left.

Of these 150,000 metric tons of sugar, the government transported 20,000 metric tons to Shanghai to exchange for fertilizers and other materials. Smuggling accounted for about half of it. That means there are currently at least 50,000 metric tons left. This year's estimated production is about 86,000 metric tons, which should theoretically be enough for the province to consume for more than three years, so the price should not be so high. But in reality, it is the opposite.

Why is the Price of Sugar Soaring?

The main reasons for the soaring price of sugar in Taiwan are roughly:

(1) The increase in the special tax on sugar consumption. This is internal. The price adjustment on March 1st was twice that of the Japanese era, and the adjustment on June 21st increased it by another two times. In the past, the tax on 100 catties of white sugar was 17 cents and 5 li, which was increased twice to 70 cents. An additional tax is levied on amounts over 2,000 catties, and merchants collect business tax.

(2) Large-scale smuggling along the northwestern coast. This is a side effect of the government's measures to ban the smuggling of sugar out of the country last year. Merchants cannot plan on the new grains of the first season, so they turn to the attractive sugar, risking everything to transport it to Japan and inland.

(3) The prohibition of free sale of sugar within the province makes it impossible to maintain a balance between production and sales. The prices in the production areas of Tainan, Taichung, and Chiayi are 20% lower than in Taipei. But it should be noted that the markets in the production areas are full of brown sugar, while white sugar is like a sheltered maiden, not easy to buy. The sugar in the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung is also moldy because of delayed loading and transportation.

These three reasons are directly determined by the stimulation of the authorities' sugar policy. Indirectly, the fact that it cannot increase production affects the psychology of the people.

How Much Can Taiwan Sugar Increase Production?

In the beginning of the Japanese rule over Taiwan, the annual output of sugar was only 80,000 to 90,000 catties of raw sugar. In order to achieve the colonial economic exploitation, the Japanese rulers used political power to monopolize the Taiwan sugar industry. The Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Tengshan, and Suzuki financial groups invested in development, inducing farmers to grow sugarcane and improving sugarcane cultivation methods. They also subsidized and protected new sugar factories, which consolidated the foundation of the sugar manufacturing industry. The highest production volume reached 1.46 million metric tons (according to statistics from 1938 to 1939). But what about now? The estimated production for the first half of this year is only 86,000 metric tons, only 1/17 of the previous output.

In 1941, eight sugar companies were merged into four: Taiwan, Nisshin, Meiji, and Ensuiko Sugar Refining Co. Ltd., which had 42 new-style sugar factories. If all of them started operating for 24 hours, they could crush 61,850 metric tons of raw sugarcane. Assuming the average sugar content of sugarcane is 13%, the total sugar production per day would be at least 8,000 metric tons. These four major companies owned 121,858 hectares of sugarcane fields, with a land investment of 118,470,000 Taiwan dollars. They also had 56,210 metric tons of self-operated farms and laid 2,493 kilometers of private railways, with a total investment of 499,833,000 Taiwan dollars.

Of the 42 sugar factories taken over after retrocession, 25 were destroyed by bombing, leaving only 17 in operation. Even those in operation need to be repaired, and whether the destroyed ones can be rebuilt in a short period is a question. The total area planted with sugarcane is 91,425 chia (甲, a unit of area, approx. 2.39 acres). According to the distribution of propagation methods, the newly planted area is 81,690 chia, and the stubble cultivation area is 9,735 chia. There is no way to talk about increasing production.

Difficulties Lie Ahead of Increasing Production

The following issues are crucial to Taiwan sugar's inability to increase production:

A. How to increase production in factories that are already in operation, and how to quickly restore factories that cannot be started?

B. For the 90,000+ chia of sugarcane fields, each chia requires 0.5 tons of ammonium sulfate (chemical fertilizer), totaling 45,000 tons. In the past, all of it was supplied by Japan. Now the Relief Administration has allocated 3,000 tons, which is not even enough for the second crop of rice in the entire province. Only 125 pounds per chia can be distributed to the rice fields around Tainan, and there is even less hope for the sugarcane fields!

C. The Agricultural and Forestry Department recently convened a discussion meeting on sugarcane business, which resolved to increase sugarcane planting, fertilization, and sugar production. At the time, there were major disputes, and it almost became impossible to continue the discussion. As a result, they agreed to change to a sugar-sharing system, with a ratio of 4.8 to 5.2, that is, of the actual sugarcane yield, 52% goes to the factory, and 48% goes to the sugarcane farmers as the sugarcane price! With refined white sugar as the sugar-sharing standard, farmers should get 1/20th of the sugar in kind for their own use, and the remaining sugar is converted into cash. Another council will be formed to determine the price between December and April. This method makes sugarcane farmers hesitate and wait and see, and they will all switch to planting rice and miscellaneous grains. The Japanese used coercive measures and small favors to deal with sugarcane farmers, and this method is not feasible now!

D. Taiwan does not have any refined sugar factories; they are all in Japan. This is one of the main methods used by the Japanese rulers to make Taiwan a complete colony, like manufacturing fertilizers. They take the raw materials or semi-finished products from the colony and make high-quality products for their own enjoyment, leaving only the new-style sugar factories that produce raw sugar (secondary white sugar) in Taiwan. This issue does not seem to have been taken into consideration yet, but it is a difficult one.

Repeating the Italian Story?

The current management agency of Taiwan sugar is Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which is still under preparation. However, it will inherit the takeover after the retrocession and be jointly operated by the Resource Committee and the Provincial Government. It is unlikely that it will be replaced by bureaucratic capital, and it will still only exploit sugarcane farmers. However, people have strong concerns about the Sinicization of various enterprises in Taiwan.

The reporter encountered several sugar industry technicians who either lamented that the company authorities could not reuse the original technicians or said that a group of "literary technicians" had come. They did not treat the work of restoration as work. How can they talk about loyalty and devotion to public service? They frankly said: To measure and estimate the efficiency of the current progress of Taiwan's restoration, talking about increasing production will take at least three to five years. This pessimistic tone reminded the reporter of John Hersey's "A Bell for Adano." He told the story of how the Italian people worked hard to plant and harvest sugarcane, but under fascist rule, the government forced them to buy it. They could not enjoy it and could only manage to buy a little at Christmas every year, which was regarded as a precious luxury. Is Taiwan going to replay the story of Italy? It is not necessary to worry unnecessarily, but it is very likely to continue to rise, rising to the point where even the sugarcane farmers who work hard to plant it will not be able to enjoy it.

Can you be truthful? I firmly believe that the government, experts, and sugarcane farmers will cooperate to overcome this difficulty and save the crisis of the "Sugar Kingdom" because sugar is not only a special product of Taiwan but also China's treasure!

### Tragic Roof Collapse at Tianjin's Dongtian Ballroom - "Amazing Program" Turns Into This Scene

— Tianjin Airmail Report, 14th - Special Correspondent Li Shaolin

In the central district of Tianjin City, around 1 PM on the 13th, a tragic building collapse occurred at a dance hall, killing and injuring many people. The incident took place at the Dongtian Dance Restaurant on Changchun Road in the First District. The entire roof of the dance floor collapsed, crushing the Yipinxian and Pei Wenzhai businesses below.

A Thunderous Collapse

Around 1:35 PM, the staff of Yipinxian below the Dongtian Dance Restaurant suddenly heard rustling sounds from the roof and felt the walls trembling. Sensing something was wrong, they rushed out, shouting that the building was about to collapse. Before they could finish speaking, with a thunderous crash, the roof completely collapsed. The cement dance floor crashed through the four floors and fell into Yipinxian. The neighboring Pei Wenzhai was also partially crushed. Immediately, smoke filled the air, and people ran in all directions. Many people escaped from Yipinxian and Pei Wenzhai, covered in mud. Zhu Shaoxiang, an employee of Yipinxian, was unable to escape and was trapped on the second floor. Wang Liansheng, the accountant, was crushed by a large piece of cement on the ground floor. Upon hearing the news, the police station immediately dispatched officers and firefighters to the rescue, and requested assistance from the American military engineering team. Three cranes arrived to assist with the dismantling. Firefighters first rescued Zhu Shaoxiang from the second floor. Wang Liansheng was pulled out from the rubble by the American soldiers. Both were covered in blood, flesh, and mud, and were immediately sent to the Municipal Sixth Hospital for treatment. When the roof collapsed, a rickshaw had just parked in front of Yipinxian. The driver heard the warning and fled, suffering only minor injuries, but the rickshaw was completely smashed. At the same time, another pedestrian, Jiang Baohua, was passing by the scene and was unable to dodge, and was immediately struck down, suffering severe head injuries. He was immediately sent to [omitted], but his life is in great danger.

A Terrible Disaster Caused

The Dongtian Dance Restaurant was originally operating on the third floor of the building. They had arbitrarily opened doors in the main support walls, causing the building to lose its structural integrity. After entering the summer, they converted the ordinary flat roof on the fourth floor into a dance floor. After reorganization, they added a cement dance floor, and just opened for business three days ago. The cause of the disaster was the excessive weight. Furthermore, the area had been flooded in 1939 and suffered a major fire in 1944, so it was already unstable. The manager of Dongtian, Wang Yaozu, fled after the incident. The shareholder, Wu Futing, has been summoned by the police station. In Tianjin this summer, the dance craze has begun, and rooftop garden dance floors are becoming popular. Many operators are profit-driven and their constructions are unreasonable. This disaster may serve as a wake-up call to the operators. It is said that the police station had once ordered the dance hall to close because it lacked an emergency exit. The dance hall then closed its door in the wall and obtained a business license.

Inspection by the Director of the Bureau of Public Works

The Director of the Tianjin Bureau of Public Works, Yan Ziheng, and the Deputy Director, Liang Jinxuan, arrived at the scene to inspect after hearing the news. Director Yan said: When the purpose of a building is changed, it must first be reported to the Bureau of Public Works, and the Bureau of Public Works will send someone to inspect it. After deeming it suitable, a permit will be issued, and then the use can be changed. However, the Dongtian Dance Hall did not report to the Bureau of Public Works when it changed the platform to a dance floor, and it did not report to the Bureau of Public Works when it added the cement dance floor. This makes people wonder if all public places should be inspected before they are reported. At the same time, the issuance of business licenses by the police and social bureaus reflects the lack of communication between the bureaus. Director Yan also said that ordinary buildings have a load-bearing capacity of no more than 40 pounds per square foot, while dance floors need to have a load-bearing capacity of 100 to 120 pounds per square foot. The collapse of the Dongtian Dance Hall was inevitable. If an inspection could have been carried out in advance, this disaster could have been avoided.

Amazing Program Performed

In addition to the people who escaped at the time and were rescued afterward, it has been confirmed that two more people were buried under the rubble: Liu Shude, a colleague of Yipinxian, and Wang Shuxun, who was delivering goods from Liangyou Biscuit Company to Yipinxian. They were found by firefighters late at night.

Fortunately, the incident occurred at 1:30 PM, before the tea dance began. If this disaster had occurred during the tea dance or the evening, when the red-clad men and green-clad women were in full swing, the casualties would have been unimaginable. The reporter observed on the street that the newly painted vermilion door of the Dongtian Dance Restaurant was still intact. Next to the door was a poster that read "Special performance by Hou Baolin and Guo Qiru every night at 10 PM." Who knew that the "amazing program" would be performed in this way!

### World Population and Food - Translated by Sibei from "American" Magazine

Some believe that world order and disorder are directly related to the size of the population. Although the Second World War killed millions, the total population continues to increase. If the current fertility rate is maintained, the population will increase by 200 million in the next ten years. By the end of this century, the world's population will increase by at least 500 million, and if unchecked, it may increase by 1 billion.

However, countries around the world are encouraging childbirth. Britain is questioning mothers with too few children. Mothers who have a second child receive a government bonus. The French government has established a committee to plan for the increase of 1.2 million babies in ten years.

At Russia's current fertility rate, the population could double in forty years. They still use medals and bonuses to encourage prolific mothers, while unmarried men are heavily taxed.

Axis countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan already had overpopulation before World War I. Because of overpopulation, competition for survival became more intense, and people were more likely to submit to the ruling class that could provide them with bread. The ambitious figures of the Axis powers simultaneously encouraged childbirth to create cannon fodder to open up new territories.

The United States only began to feel the pressure of population in this century. In the past, because of ongoing development, land was unlimited, and a large population was not a concern.

Now, in many parts of the world, there is a feeling of overpopulation and insufficient food. Malthus felt the pain of overpopulation a century ago. The turmoil in Asia is also due to this. Africa, South America, and Australia are rapidly depleting their resources, and the increase in population is so rapid that the welfare of the general public is affected.

The United States itself feels slightly overpopulated, but its two dependencies, the Philippines and Puerto Rico, although with high mortality rates, see their populations double every thirty years. The United States must provide relief to avoid famine. We now have a new responsibility to turn Japan into a democratic nation. We sent 75 million Japanese back to their homes. Now, Japan has thirteen times more people per square mile of arable land than the United States, and one million new people are added each year. Simply redistributing the land will not solve the problem.

Scientific methods can increase food supply, but increased food supply may lead to even greater population growth. Therefore, the only way to solve the food shortage is to control childbirth.

Wherever resources and trade are concentrated, the standard of living is bound to be very low. This is because these resources are shared by many people. Moreover, in culturally backward regions, population growth is particularly rapid – such as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. These areas do not need to increase their fertility rates; as long as they adopt Western medical and sanitary methods to reduce mortality rates and increase the life expectancy of ordinary people, the population surplus will be alarming!

If India reduces its mortality rate to the same level as the United States, while maintaining its current fertility rate, it would need five Earths to support it in a hundred years.

Many people still firmly believe that there is a direct relationship between numbers and strength. More people mean victory. If the security of the United States depended on population size, it would have been defeated at the beginning of the war. Both World Wars were won by the United States turning defeat into victory. It is clear that in modern warfare, manpower is not very important. In future atomic warfare, manpower will be even less important. Human intelligence and wisdom are the most effective forces for competing for survival and achieving world peace.

A country must have a surplus of goods beyond daily life to win today. The reason why the United States was able to defeat the Axis powers was due to its staggering amount of material resources. Stalin said at the Tehran Conference, "There would be no victory without American supplies."

I once said that the United States also feels slightly overpopulated. Professor Whelpton said: "From the perspective of the economic welfare received by each individual, the population of the United States is excessive, but its degree of excess is not as serious as that of most countries."

From an economic point of view, the United States would be better off with only 100 million people than with the current 140 million, but the US government estimates that our population will increase by as many as 40 million people. Therefore, in the next fifty years, our fertility rate should decrease by one-third.

After considering the depletion of American resources (the former Secretary of the Interior has published in American magazines) and the depletion of land due to careless farming methods, one can feel the horror of population growth.

The thin topsoil of farmland, usually less than a foot thick, is the key to our survival. If one inch is removed, it will take at least three hundred years to recover, but some farmland will lose an inch after a single heavy rain. The chairman of the American Soil Conservation Committee once announced: "We lose land equivalent to two hundred forty-acre farms every day due to wind and rain… In fact, the United States no longer has good farmland."

Even more serious than the erosion of farmland is the erosion of the people. Our population increase is entirely due to the higher fertility rate of those with the lowest education, the least success, and the lowest intelligence.

Many studies illustrate this frightening phenomenon. According to statistics from the Census Bureau, mothers in the United States who have received seven years or less of education have an average of 3 and 2/3 children, but mothers of the same age who have a secondary school or college education have an average of 1 and 2/3 children.

Another survey of school children in four American cities showed that the children with the lowest intelligence came from families with an average of six children, while the children with the highest intelligence came from families with an average of two and a half children.

If this situation continues for seventy years, the descendants of our least intelligent and least successful families will outnumber the descendants of our most intelligent and most successful families by sixteen times. (Abridged from "American" magazine)

### Hunan Province Strengthens Highway Network

— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli, Changsha Air Dispatch, 10th

Social security and smooth transportation can promote reconstruction. Although Hunan's social order has experienced several small disturbances in Changsha, it is generally stable. In terms of transportation, the full operation of the Yuehan Railway has given people a great sense of excitement.

Yuehan Railway Revenue Insufficient to Cover Expenses

The Yuehan Railway is 1,500 kilometers long, connecting north and south and running through three provinces. The entire line was occupied in the 33rd year [of the Republic, 1944], and after the recovery, active construction and repair were carried out. According to the report of Director Du Tieyuan of the Railway Bureau: the damage to the line was the worst of all railways in the country. Of the 119 major bridges, 102 were damaged; of the 600 small bridges, 160 were damaged; 5 tunnels were completely destroyed; all steel beams were destroyed and removed; and important subgrade earthwork was completely excavated. The repair budget was initially set at 37 billion at the beginning of this year, but due to rising prices, all equipment had to be simplified, with the primary goal of opening the line. Therefore, the current so-called opening is still only considered a preliminary opening, and the standard for formal opening is still very far away. For example, the bridge piers are all temporary wooden bridges, and the station granaries, platforms, and coal and water equipment are all temporary in nature. Tunnels that could not be completed were bypassed with temporary bridges, and these wooden temporary bridges are at risk of being washed away by floods. Currently, two special express trains run in each direction per week, and one freight train runs daily. Based on the length of the line and the expected volume of transportation, it is estimated that 376 locomotives, 390 passenger cars, and 3,543 freight cars are needed. However, only 80 locomotives of all sizes have been repaired from the remaining ones (short 296), 1,411 freight cars (short 2,131), and 84 passenger cars (short 342). Distributing these vehicles across the entire 1,000-kilometer line makes it difficult to expect sufficient train services. The current monthly revenue for the entire line is about 1 billion or more, but expenses require 4 billion yuan, and it still relies on government subsidies. This shows one aspect of the railway's difficult situation.

Yijiawan Train Accident - Station Vandalized

The engineering aspects are all temporary in nature. Since the opening of the line, several accidents have occurred. The most serious was the train overturning at Yijiawan. On the 7th, a Wuhan-Changsha freight train was traveling from Changsha to Yijiawan Station. As it entered the second track, due to rain, the subgrade soil became loose, the sleepers sank, and the rails could not support the weight, causing the locomotive to derail and two carriages to overturn. The train did not have passenger tickets, but many people crowded onto the locomotive. After the locomotive derailed, it crashed directly into the subgrade, killing seven passengers immediately and seriously injuring eleven. One of the injured died after being transported back to Changsha. A few soldiers on the train, not knowing the truth, questioned the stationmaster and vandalized the Yijiawan Station, causing considerable damage. According to sources within the Railway Bureau: the bureau is limited by materials and funding, so the project cannot proceed according to the planned schedule, and the safety of train operation is a major concern. The line is open, but the inability to immediately strengthen the equipment is regrettable.

Work-Relief Road Construction Plan - Implemented Step by Step

After social stability, transportation recovery, and disaster relief improvement, the government has shifted its focus to construction projects. The provincial government has formulated a work-relief road construction plan to strengthen the province's highway network, planning to repair 913 kilometers of highways damaged during the war and build 3,060 kilometers of new highways, requiring a total of 72.1 billion yuan in construction funds, which can accommodate 721,500 disaster victims. This plan is being implemented step by step. When the plan is completed, cars will be able to reach all counties in Hunan Province. This is part of Chairman Wang's large-scale work-relief plan.

In addition, in order to study the constitution, realize constitutional government, and promote cultural and economic development, the provincial government has established three committees: Constitutional Research, Cultural Development, and Economic Development. They have been approved by the provincial government meeting and will soon be established. The reconstruction of southern Hunan may be achieved through concrete plans developed by these three committees.

(1) Deep Lymph Node Shadows

Wu Renhou asks: I had an X-ray examination the other day, which revealed deep shadows in the lymph nodes of my lungs. Please tell me: (1) What is the cause of the deep shadows in the lymph nodes? (2) How to treat them? (3) Can taking more cod liver oil cure it?

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] (1) Deep lymph node shadows are related to weak lungs; (2) You can take various vitamin pills and blood-tonifying tonics, or you can also inject glucose calcium and vitamin C; (3) Eating more cod liver oil capsules in winter is also good.

(2) Asthma and Palpitations

Yan Xiufang asks: I am 22 years old, female. I suffered from asthma last winter and recovered after treatment, but now it has recurred with palpitations, lower back pain, asthma, and weakness, but my appetite has not decreased. Please tell me (1) Is it bronchitis? (2) What are the methods of treatment?

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] Based on the various conditions described in the letter, I am afraid it is asthma caused by heart disease. You need to have your heart examined and diagnosed with X-rays. If it is asthma caused by heart disease, you need to use cardiotonics, diuretics, and large doses of vitamin B.

(3) Leg and Knee Pain

Chen Yucheng asks: In the 29th year of the Republic [1940], I suffered from typhoid fever and developed white spots on my body. The doctor mistakenly thought they were sores and ordered me to apply ointment after bathing, so the toxins were not completely cleared. My legs and knees are slightly weak, and the inner side of my tibia, five or six inches from the knee, is slightly hot, numb, and painful to the touch. The pain is particularly severe in rainy weather and after eating spicy foods. I don't know what kind of disease it is. There is suspicion of syphilis. Please advise on treatment methods.

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] It is best to have a detailed blood test and examination first. You can go to the free department of the municipal hospital for a consultation. If it is related to syphilis, you need to use anti-syphilitic agents. If it is rheumatic arthritis, you need to use ibuprofen.

(4) Excessive Sweating of Hands and Feet

Shen Qingsheng asks: In the summer, I sweat excessively from my hands and feet. It is very inconvenient when I am working at my desk or interacting with people. My feet are dirty and unbearable due to excessive sweating, and they have a strange odor, which is a hindrance to hygiene. Is there any way to prevent this? Please answer in the newspaper.

[Reply from Dr. Gu Yuqi] Excessive sweating of the hands and feet is due to excessive neurotic secretion. Take nerve-tonifying and blood-tonifying tonics, and wash your hands and feet more often. You can wipe them with diluted liquor.

### The Eyes of the Northeast - Inside Story of Xiaofengman Power Station - Jilin Air Dispatch, 15th

When the national army was stationed in Jilin, what the 40 million people of the Northeast were most concerned about was not the safety of Jilin City, but the safety of the "Xiaofengman Power Station." "Xiaofengman" is more than forty miles southwest of Jilin, in the Western Mountains. It cuts off the Songhua River and builds a dam to create an artificial waterfall for power generation. The length and weight of its dam are not only the first in the Far East, but also rank among the top in the world. The power generation capacity is second only to the United States and the Soviet Union and ranks third in the world. If it is damaged, the major cities of the Northeast will be plunged into darkness. The impact on public security, industry, and life is imaginable.

The east bank of the Songhua River is the factory area of the power station, and the west bank is the management area and residential area. Surrounded by mountains and the river flowing horizontally, the scenery is exceptionally beautiful. The east and west banks are connected by a steel bridge, which has now been destroyed.

From one or two miles away from "Xiaofengman," you can hear the rumbling sound. You can see ten artificial waterfalls cascading down the dam. The water depth on the dam is as deep as 40 meters, while the water depth below the dam is only one zhang (about 3.3 meters). The water waves above and below are very calm, but after passing through the dam holes, they pour down like thousands of horses galloping, with fierce water勢 and splashing water flowers, which is extremely spectacular.

The dam is a gravity dam with a volume of 2 million cubic meters. The total length of the dam is 1200 meters, divided into 6000 sections from the left bank to the right bank. Each section is 18 cubic meters wide and 90 meters high. The total amount of concrete is 1,920,000 cubic meters. The reservoir area is 550 square kilometers, 170 kilometers long, and the storage capacity is 11 billion cubic meters. Construction started in the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938] and started generating electricity on February 26th of the 33rd year [1944], mobilizing 20,000 people to work day and night. The original budget was 150 million yuan in puppet currency, but the final cost reached 250 million yuan. The power station can supply power to Changchun, Harbin, Fushun, and Jilin. The Songchang power transmission line to Changchun is 113 kilometers long. The Songbin line to Harbin is 265 kilometers long. The line to Fushun is 360 kilometers long. The former two lines are 154 JK, and the latter is 220 KU·22. The high voltage of the power transmission line is not only the first in China, but also rare in East Asia. In the past, the power generation was 190,000 kilowatts. If thermal power generation is used, 4,500 tons of coal are needed per day.

On August 20th of last year, the Soviet army had 20-30 paratroopers land at "Xiaofengman". Infantry also arrived in four or five days. On September 20th, they began to dismantle the machinery. There were 2,000 Soviet troops and 2,000 Japanese prisoners of war dismantling day and night. The dismantling personnel left on November 3rd. The total amount of dismantling included two completed units made in Switzerland, two units 50% completed made in Germany, and two units 20% completed made in Germany. Three KU transformers made in Japan, three 154 KU OCB made in Japan (Hitachi!), two 22DKU made in Japan (Hitachi!), five 138U units, dismantled switchboards, two cranes for civil engineering, one train of oil, and countless other spare parts. "Xiaofengman" plays a decisive role in power generation and has many main functions. For example, in terms of transportation, the water above the dam is 40 meters deep, allowing warships of 45,000 tons to pass. In terms of transporting wood, wood from "Dafengman" upstream can be transported here by the river, and then loaded onto trains and transported to various places. In addition, it regulates water conservancy and facilitates fishery. At present, it only generates electricity, and other functions have not yet been fully utilized.

### Seven Ways to Handle Strikes

— Written by Eric Johnston, Translated by Bao Huamao

The author is the former president of the American Chamber of Commerce. He has accumulated four years of experience in consulting with labor and management during wartime. In conclusion, he states that for the sake of industrial peace in the United States, new laws are needed. Labor disputes in our country are also inevitable, so this is translated as a reference.

All of America fears more strikes. We have far too many strikes. The material losses are enormous and shocking. Even worse, people harbor malice and suspicion. The country needs industrial harmony more than anything else.

To want permanent industrial peace is simply wishful thinking, because the relationship between labor and management is a human relationship, and human relationships are often fraught with friction and contention.

We do not want to extinguish all strikes, as only totalitarian countries would do so. However, democratic countries also hope that labor and management will improve their skills and systems and get along together.

All industrial wars will lead to the need for labor laws. People often shout loudly, "Pass laws!" This is so easy and convenient to shout. We say that this law allows labor and management to go their own way, but too much compulsion is also not good. We cannot legislate "Human Nature." That is an ironclad fact.

Industrial peace cannot be achieved by legislation alone, but some legislation is necessary. I advocate that legislation should establish fair rules, and those who violate these rules should be punished. We need these rules to protect labor and also to protect capital.

Let me state my position. The right to strike is a fundamental right of Americans. This must always be so, but the strikes and the reasons for strikes can be reduced.

Many people think that a strike is just a strike. In fact, strikes can be divided into seven categories. Let us describe them separately and discuss how to deal with them.

(1) Organizational Strikes: This is when a union strike picket forces other workers to join the union and forces the factory owner to sign a contract with the union.

This kind of strike is not worth protecting. It deprives workers of the right to choose whether or not to join the union. This is a reactionary strike. The Wagner Act provides an election mechanism for workers to vote on whether they want to join the union. The ballot box—America's sacred tradition—replaces the strike picket line.

Solution: The Wagner Act can be amended. Irresponsible unions should be punished. The law is eleven years old. Based on past experience, we can know its advantages and disadvantages. Amend it to suit the current situation.

(2) Jurisdictional Strikes. This is a strike caused by disputes between unions over which union the members belong to.

Solution: Workers should organize a committee on union jurisdiction issues to arbitrate the matter. When the committee cannot decide, the government should intervene. The Central Labor Bureau should be authorized to allow workers to decide which union they are subject to. The government should strengthen the Central Labor Bureau to punish violating unions and their leaders.

(3) Sympathy Strikes: Workers here strike out of sympathy for workers on strike elsewhere. The jargon of sympathy strikes is absurd. This is not only an unreasonable strike, but it is also not even worthy of sympathy.

Solution: This type of strike should not be protected by law. For the benefit of the workers themselves, workers should abolish this type of strike. Workers do not need to strike out of "sympathy" for workers elsewhere.

(4) Political Strikes: A strike caused by workers opposing a certain government policy. In fact, workers can use petitions, meetings, and public opinion methods to achieve political demands, just like citizens. They should not use economic weapons for political demands. Solution: The solution is the same as for (3). This type of strike should not be protected by law.

(5) Public Utility Strikes: This type of strike directly affects the public interest. Public utilities, whether publicly or privately owned, should be accountable to the government. Even their interest rates, profits, and types of services should be subject to government approval.

Solution: Legislation should establish an arbitration mechanism to handle this type of dispute. The Railway Arbitration Act can be used as a blueprint.

(6) Language Interpretation Strikes: This is a strike caused by misunderstandings in the translation of the language in the contract or by different interpretations of a certain word or term in the contract by foremen and workers.

Solution: Labor and management should agree to first stop the labor unrest, and then arbitrate the interpretation of the contract. It is best to have competent, knowledgeable, and permanent arbitrators responsible for handling this, and their salaries should be provided by labor and management.

(7) Contract Strikes: This is a strike due to workers' demands for improved wages, working hours, and factory equipment. This is easy to understand and the most difficult to resolve. Most strikes fall into this category. Recent strikes in the automotive, steel, coal, and electrical industries also fall into this category.

Solution: Before the strike, keep them negotiating. Keep this bargaining going until both parties sign a contract. That means negotiating while the workers continue working.

To complete this kind of negotiation, other unions should organize an industrial mediation jury, with representatives from labor and management participating, followed by government mediation.

In Switzerland, strikers are required to notify the government of mediation seven days in advance, stating the reasons for the intended strike in the notification. Violators of this provision are subject to a fine. Of course, the original intention is to hope that labor and management will reach an agreement before the strike. This system has achieved great success and is worthy of American learning.

### Production Construction and Promoting National Goods

— By He Ren

After victory, the cry for production construction has spread throughout the country, which is indeed a very good phenomenon.

However, in my humble opinion, production construction is certainly important, but promoting national goods so that people generally have a "love for national goods" mentality should not be ignored.

Because we know that production construction is indeed an important prerequisite for building a new China, but on the one hand, while chanting production construction and engaging in production construction, on the other hand, a large amount of foreign goods continues to flow in, and the people welcome foreign goods and despise domestic products, then, will not production construction be futile? Therefore, production construction and promoting national goods must go hand in hand, and must be closely linked. The production sector actively engages in production construction, and social groups and educational institutions engage in the promotion of national goods. We must cultivate a general mentality of "taking pride in using national goods," and then production construction can achieve its goals and be successful.

At present, foreign goods in general are already being imported in a steady stream. We are absolutely not resisting foreign goods, but we are in extreme need of promoting national goods. We hope that the Ministry of Education, starting from the next semester, will print course materials on loving national goods into primary and secondary school textbooks. School teachers should lead by example and use national goods. Parents in general should also encourage their children to love and use national goods. The leaders of government agencies and social groups should also include the purchase of national goods in their service performance evaluations. If the whole country can unanimously and actively promote national goods, the future of the production sector will be bright, and the goals of construction will be achieved step by step.

Before the War of Resistance, the movement to promote national goods had considerable achievements. However, after eight years of trampling by the enemy and puppets, domestic materials were scarce, and the people's lives were in misery every day. Once victory came and maritime transport was smooth, they could not help but be overjoyed at the sight of novel foreign goods and rushed to buy them, which of course cannot be harshly criticized. However, we must look to the future and observe from the perspective of the entire national economy. Promoting national goods is currently a matter of urgency. Because only by promoting national goods can we preserve the weak Chinese national industry; and only by promoting national goods can we prevent the work of production construction from being disconnected midway, or even collapsing midway!

### Introduction to Business Management

— By Xu Baiyi

C. Manufacturing Speed

The time spent in the manufacturing process is well worth considering. If it takes a little longer for each movement, then the time spent in a month or a year adds up considerably. This does not mean that speed is the only goal, and everything can be made crudely. In fact, the goal is to produce perfect products in the shortest possible time.

To know how much time it takes to make a product, the best way is to conduct experiments. Experiments should be conducted in the early stages of the start of a manufacturing plant. There are several ways to determine the standard for manufacturing speed:

A. At the beginning of the work, record a time, let the work proceed, and when it is completed, record another time, and you can know the time required to manufacture a product.

B. Many products require several steps to be combined to make a product. If it takes a total of three days from start to finish, then at the end of the three days, you can check the number of products made, and you can know how many can be produced per day. If you work eight hours a day, you can also know how many can be produced per hour on average.

With this standard, there are the following three uses:

A. A standard can be set for how many products can be produced per day. If production decreases on a certain day, the cause can be immediately investigated and corrected.

B. It can make it easy to implement production plans. For example, if you plan to produce products worth so many tens of thousands of dollars, you can calculate how many units there are in total and how many days it will take. Sometimes when a batch of orders comes from the outside, you can also calculate how many days it will take to deliver the goods.

C. Costs can be calculated. After the time required for production, costs can be calculated.

A manufacturing plant engaged in production must never be casual and without standards, so the manufacturing speed must be studied.

Female Workers and Child Labor

In many factories, in addition to male workers, there are many female workers and child workers. The reasons for employing female workers and child workers are nothing more than the following:

A. There are no male workers equal to the need: If a factory cannot completely use male workers, then female workers are used instead.

B. Female workers' wages are lower: Female workers' wages are often lower than male workers' wages, because female workers often do not need to bear the cost of family expenses. Male workers often have the burden of family expenses. As for child labor, the price is even lower than that of female workers. In some places, child workers can do the job, so employing child workers can reduce manufacturing costs a little.

C. Female workers are more obedient: Compared to male workers, female workers are relatively more obedient.

However, this cannot be the biggest reason for employing female workers, but it is only one of the advantages of female workers.

Spring and Autumn

### Fang Jikan Over the Past Twenty Years

— Zheng Wuchang

My friend Fang Jikan, whose given name is Yan, and another name is Yu Zhuan, is from Yongjia. He is proficient in epigraphy and calligraphy and excels at seal carving. He came to Shanghai in the spring of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926). Wu Changshuo, Zeng Nongran, Chu Tihang, and other elders praised him and asked him to carve seals, noting that every character was historically grounded. He studied with Zhao Shuru. Shuru once said: "The only one who can discuss seal carving with me is Jikan." Jikan once carved a jade seal for his teacher. Once, they went to the Xiling Seal Society. Gao Yehou, Ding Fuzhi, Wang Fuchang, and other elders were present. Fuzhi took out Shuru's jade seal and showed it to Fuchang, jokingly saying: "I obtained this seal and named Shuru because of it." Fuchang stroked and examined it, thinking that only the hand of a Han person could achieve this. Fuzhi replied: "There is a Han person sitting here now." Only then did he know that it was made by Jikan, and he sighed in amazement. The whole room roared with laughter. He served as the director of the printing department of the Xiling Seal Society. Later, he served as a professor at the Shanghai Art College and the Xinhua Art College for four or five years. Many of his students became famous. Jing Yiyuan of Shangyu introduced him as a close friend, and they lived together in the Han Zhi You She, discussing literature and painting every day. The Shanghai Court knew that he was skilled in calligraphy and proficient in appraisal, and hired him as an appraiser. Fearing that the appraisal would be inappropriate and cause trouble, he firmly declined. In the winter of the twenty-third year (1934), he went to the capital, and Yiyuan invited him to live with him. Jikan was hospitable and generous, pawning his clothes for wine without the slightest hesitation. Yiyuan knew that he was poor and once gave him gold. Jikan said: "Yiyuan is honest, this is clean money, and it can be accepted." Famous officials and dignitaries of the time considered it an honor to have one of his seals, and his name was very famous. In the autumn of the following year, he traveled with Yiyuan to the scenic spots of Mount Hua and Mount Wutai. On the way back to D梁, he searched for ancient relics. In the spring of the twenty-fifth year (1936), he went to Beiping and stayed at Dafeng Hall, discussing seal carving and calligraphy with Daqian every day. All the seals used by Daqian were made by him. At that time, famous figures in the former capital, such as Chen Sanyuan and Chuan Yuanshu, were friends with him and gave him poems. The Ministry of Education held the Second National Art Exhibition in Nanjing and hired him as a member of the review committee. After coming south, he had the opportunity to work with Fang Junbi, Xie Zhiliu, and others in Yandang, staying for a short time. Later, at the invitation of Ma Shuping, he took a position in the Palace Museum, editing and researching the famous works of past masters. At that time, Chairman Lin of the National Government also knew of his abilities and planned to hire him as a secretary. Daqian jokingly called him Fang Waiting Edict. However, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred the day after Jikan arrived at the museum, and he was trapped for several months before he could escape and return home, closing his door and not going out. After that, the chaos of the bandits deepened, and the puppet government was established, and he was once invited to preside over the seal bureau. Jikan said: "The head can be cut off, but the matter cannot be done," and burned his books. Wang Jisi wrote about it, which appeared in the Zhejiang Daily. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Yongjia was bombed three times and fell three times. Jikan took care of the old and young and wandered around, experiencing hardship. His mother was sick and in danger, and he personally served her medicine, washing her and taking care of her for six days and nights without taking off his clothes, and the disease was cured because of it. When the bandits arrived, he moved elsewhere. Li Yifei of Ruian lived in his house, and he was finally able to settle down a little. When the bandits were in Yongjia, they asked him to carve seals, but he did not get them and hated him; and the local bullies also added insults from time to time. At that time, Jikan's suffering was truly unspeakable. However, he never carved a seal for the enemy and puppets, and people admired him even more for it. After the victory of the national celebration of the surrender of the bandits, Jikan made a seal and wrote a poem to commemorate it: "The flags of all nations are spread in the blue sky, and today I am happy to see the nine states united. From now on, there will be no more swords and halberds in the world, and I will also sing aloud and strike the soil, old man." Jikan initially learned from Rangzhi; then he followed the Qin and Han dynasties. He once copied ancient seals, obtaining tens of thousands of characters, called Er Yin Wen Zong, but it was not published due to the chaos. Changshi Liangchang Youqian once edited it with him; later, due to some things, it did not work out. Shuru saw that his editing was meticulous and profound, and helped him with his manuscript, making it a great success. Yun Guyu Yin Hui is also written by him. Jikan does not need to think when carving a seal, and he can make it immediately without violating the ancient system. The seal is based on Da Li; the calligraphy is based on Shi Chen. At first, he was famous for his paintings of antiques; recently, he has written landscapes and pine, plum, chrysanthemum, and rock, which are also ancient and full of strange energy. Scholars who are engaged in seal carving and study fine characters all respect Jikan; scholars who are good at calligraphy and painting and study seals all ask Jikan for help. People all love and pity him; and Jikan is happy and tireless, and the more he struggles, the more he is encouraged. Since he came to Shanghai from last autumn, he has carved no less than a thousand seals. One day, he passed by my Wangping Building, and a guest greeted him and said: "This gentleman is full of epigraphic aura, is he not Fang Guangsheng?" How can it be accidental that people know that he is Mr. Fang at a glance?

### A Corner of the Cemetery

— Chen Ying

The sky is blue almost to transparency, and a few scattered white clouds are moving slowly, gathering and dispersing like light smoke, and misty like a thin fog. The pale round moon lies alone at one end, pouring its cold light softly onto the earth.

The wilderness spreads out in all directions, but is cut off by a dark mountain range. The desolate grass sways with the wind, then raises its head, always doing that monotonous action. The mountain trees are as dark as ink, and sway their fat bodies rustling.

The distant villages are all asleep, and the time has come for the corner of the cemetery in this wilderness to wake up.

In fact, to say that this is a cemetery is just a mound of earth here and a mound of earth there; this is the collection by kind-hearted people in the village of corpses that are lying scattered and uncared for.

Old Man Wen, who was sleeping in the southeast corner, first turned over and sat up, rubbing his sleepy eyes. He looked around.

"Children, the moon has risen to the top of our heads, it's time to get up!" This is a weak voice, but it is loud enough to resound through the silent night.

There was a commotion, and Wang Youxin, Liu Fuzi, Zhou Da Niang and Chen Laoda all sat up, leaving only Dong Er and a girl with braids still sleeping soundly.

Chen Laoda leaned lazily against the earth mound, muttering to himself: "Um, get up, get up... Isn't getting up the same as sleeping? Still no news at all."

Everyone sat there blankly, their eyes looking forward without a target. All that could be heard was an occasional sigh or two.

Old Man Wen lit his early morning pipe and said, "It's been a full six months since Dong Er came and told us that we had won the victory. We wake up and go to sleep like this every day, getting farther and farther away from the world." He took a deep puff of smoke and exhaled a cloud of white mist, "If we could have some news to know that everyone at home is safe and sound, and that everyone has eaten white rice, then that would be reassuring!"

These words raised all of Chen Laoda's worries; "In peaceful years, it should be time to transplant rice seedlings, who knows what kind of unlucky days we are living now!"

Zhou Da Niang could not help but wipe the corners of her eyes with her clothes.

Wang Youxin jumped up: "That's not how it is, Chen Laoda! Our squad leader used to tell us that it's nothing for a real man to suffer a little. Everyone is fighting for the War of Resistance. The suffering is not for nothing, you see, we have won now, and our China has also come to the day to turn over and stand up!"

The sermon-like firm tone made everyone silent.

Two old ducks could not find their way home, and flew around in the air, flapping their wings. They squawked a few times and then flew past.

Liu Fuzi hummed his song that he never left his mouth: "My home is on the Songhua River in Northeast China, where there are mountains and plains of soybeans and sorghum..."

Chen Laoda got annoyed: "Are you going to finish or not? Always this unlucky song! Who doesn't know that your home is on the Songhua River? Who doesn't have a home? Over the years, some have died. Some have escaped, and a good family has been torn apart. Old Man Wen, why did you starve to death on the side of the road? Zhou Da Niang, why were you driven out of your hometown? Liu Fuzi, Wang Youxin, you also talk about why you were forced onto the battlefield..."

Wang Youxin didn't like to hear this: "Okay! Why mention the past? Have you heard, now the War of Resistance has been won, the Japanese devils have rolled away, and our parents and the people no longer have to eat sorghum leaves, and no longer have to be slaves. There are good days ahead! The suffering was not for nothing, do you understand?"

"I'm really afraid of suffering," Old Man Wen said slowly. "May the good days come soon!"

"Of course they will come! They will definitely come!" Wang Youxin was always faithful to his beliefs, patted his chest and assured everyone.

The moonlight was even more uniform, and all that could be heard was the rustling of the dark shadows of the trees on the mountain. Dong Er slept soundly, the girl was mumbling in her mouth, only "Mommy, Mommy" could be heard. Still not awake.

Liu Fuzi looked around, and suddenly found a new partner sleeping not far from his left hand. Everyone was surprised and delighted, and shook him awake! "Hey, friend, what news is there outside, how did you get here?"

The new partner sat up with a grunt: "How did I come? The stray bullet sent me here!"

Liu Fuzi spat at him: "Stop talking nonsense, the devils have long gone, who invited you to eat stray bullets?"

The newcomer also felt strange, why the sound of artillery fire was so noisy, but he could not hear anything here. So he described in detail to everyone what he knew.

The wind was a little cool, and the moon did not know where it had gone. The clouds were really unpredictable, dark and heavy as if they were about to fall to the ground. Everything in the wilderness was holding its breath and listening attentively to the narrative that was sometimes sad and sometimes resentful. When the provoked emotions burned to a height, they only seemed numb. The red light of Old Man Wen's dry pipe flashed, reflecting the expressions of those nearby who were frowning.

The speaker ended his report with the words "People's lives are worthless these days, and the people are doomed to be unlucky"! No one dared to believe his words, but no one dared not to believe his words. Used to being played with by fate, no one could place their trust in their own wishes anymore.

Chen Laoda said: "When will the day of standing up come?"

Liu Fuzi was full of grievances: "What exactly are we suffering for?"

Zhou Da Niang kept wiping the corners of her eyes.

Old Man Wen shook his head and sighed: "God really has no eyes!"

In Youxin buried his head in his hands, his faith was shattered, and everything seemed empty

Pain engulfed every heart.

Gradually, the cemetery went to sleep again, but nightmares relentlessly haunted even the dead.

The earth was whispering, conveying news to each other, the surface was still so peaceful and comfortable.

### Mountain Dwelling Leisure

— Jiang Xingyu

In the late autumn of 1944, I moved from South Hot Springs to North Hot Springs. Autumn is the prelude to the fog season, and the entire red basin is immersed in a milky, hazy atmosphere. The small boats from Beibei to the hot springs are densely packed on the Jialing River like a swarm of ants. Our boat raised its small white sail, letting the moist autumn wind blow it, slowly ascending along the soft sandy shore. The undulating peaks welcomed me with lush greenery, and the river reflecting the undulating peaks was a bright, radiant blue, so blue that I felt its loveliness deep within my heart. The boat entered D渡口, and the low sky suddenly seemed much higher. The first thing that attracted my gaze was the glazed tile ridges of the Hot Springs Temple, and the tall red walls with gnarled ancient cypresses formed a classic landscape painting.

I needed to quietly recuperate in this quiet mountain country for some time. I settled down in a villa on the mountainside. The house was surrounded by sparse bamboo fences. Although the wisteria flowers had already withered, the withered vines still tightly embraced the fence. Occasionally, two or three sparrows exchanged short conversations on the eaves, which only served to accentuate the lonely atmosphere.

Looking out from the window, there was a desolate bamboo forest, rarely trodden by people throughout the year, appearing desolate and gloomy. The ground was covered with a thin layer of moss, allowing newts and beetles to stroll comfortably. When they stepped on a corner of fallen leaves, a slight rustling sound would be emitted. At the end of the bamboo forest lay an abandoned highway, now only walked by people going to the market, only by village children herding cattle and sheep. Further away were the endless rolling hills of tea brown, stretching into the distance.

Stepping out of the fence gate, there was a flat dam with tender grass, which I later often used for playing badminton or as a sunbathing area.

Life was leisurely. Every morning when I took a walk nearby, I would occasionally pick some bouquets of flowers and put them in a vase, nurturing them with water. All morning, I would lie on a deck chair. The light in the house was relatively dim, so the deck chair was placed on the veranda. To make my body comfortable, I often wore pajamas. When the fog was too heavy or the wind picked up, I was afraid of catching a cold, so I preferred to cover myself with a towel blanket. Beside the deck chair was a small table for tea cups and books. Among the books, Omar Khayyam's "Rubaiyat" was indispensable, although I had already read it so many times that I could recite it. My love for Longjing tea and "Rubaiyat" almost bordered on a mental disorder.

Lying down and looking up at the sky gave me the feeling of being at sea. Wasn't that gray sky just like the waters of the English Channel, shrouded in white mist all year round?

On rainy days, the newspaper deliverer and the postman didn't come up the mountain. It seemed as if I was completely isolated from the world. Only the gurgling eavesdrops played a monotonous harp, like a singer with no audience. It was not uncommon for it to rain for one or two weeks in a row. I still hadn't finished the calligraphy book that the Chinese Calligraphy Research Association had asked me to write. I planned to use the rainy days to read the rubbings I had collected since entering Sichuan. The melancholy mood of the "Orchid Pavilion Preface" prevented me from finding peace, so I could only stand up and smoke a pipe or two, vainly trying to dilute the infected melancholy with the smoke rings.

I had long forgotten the habit of using a clock, and I was too lazy to turn the calendar on my desk. It was covered in dust, covered by the remains of bottled flowers. The seasons were still changing silently. It wasn't until I walked through the valley one time and saw a few small wintersweet flowers blooming that I realized it was already the end of the year.

The North Hot Springs Park in winter was not noisy. One or two withered lotus leaves floated in the Lotus Pond, gently trembling with the cold shimmering water. Now, those tourists from the city had long returned to the city. Even the craftsmen who repaired the flowers were resting at home. Only I, carrying a wisteria cane, walked alone on this stone-paved road in the whistling mountain wind at the end of the year.

My cane had long become part of my body. In these rugged mountains, I couldn't leave it for a minute. I didn't enjoy taking a mountain sedan chair. I didn't want those porters who were thinner and more haggard than me to carry me up a steep slope. Their heavy panting and pained expressions magically made me feel unspeakably heartbroken.

Midway between the Hot Springs Temple and the Jinyun Temple, a small lake was surrounded by mountains. I made my first pilgrimage there on a slightly snowy morning. The still lake water was so deep green, and the tall cedar trees on the lake shore were so white and clean. A row of blue railings lined the long dike, as if the other side of the long dike was the heaven we sought. Light snow still fell, as if afraid of being noticed, while the bell of the Zongjue Temple fell sparsely with the snowflakes. In this unity, my humble life was inspired, and my ignorant soul was enlightened. I wished to transform into every drop of lake water, I wished to transform into every branch and leaf of the cedar trees, I wished to spend my future years in the sound of bells.

During the long winter nights, the stove fire was my closest friend. The glow of the stove fire painted a layer of crimson on my face, which had too many wrinkles from wind and frost. The crackling of a lump of coal, the shooting of a spark, was a noteworthy event of the entire winter night. I never failed to appreciate the warmth of the stove fire. I would sit by the stove until every lump of coal had been completely burned and turned into dead ashes that had exhausted their heat, and only then would I reluctantly go to sleep.

Covered with a thick quilt, I often had dreams, which was a hardship I couldn't escape. Whether the dream was joyful or sorrowful, I couldn't avoid the feeling of emptiness when I woke up. Those natural objects and images quickly disappeared, leaving only an endless darkness, and shadows that were faintly visible in the darkness. Dreams are empty and impossible to grasp. The life of a person is nothing more than a long dream! Nothing more than a series of trivial dreams!

Spring lingered in the mountains, and I was already familiar with every path and every remote place. I discovered that the pile of rocks behind the mountain was densely covered with tombs. Wild roses were blooming luxuriantly, and their fragrance was so strong that I could hardly breathe. Was this nature's pity for those spirits sleeping in the mountains, and deliberately arranged so simply and beautifully? Were the little yellow butterflies dancing gracefully the transformations of the dead? There was not a single tombstone or paper money hanging in the cemetery. Perhaps those buried here were all travelers drifting in a foreign land. In fact, tombstones and paper money are also futile, merely a way for those who live on to seek a very limited self-consolation.

There were some painting opportunities, so visitors came to ask about me, but I didn't welcome them enthusiastically. Although their creations were still quite tame and could be used as material for my writing, these visits ultimately left me feeling extremely exhausted. If the other party didn't ask a question, I wouldn't say a word, listening attentively to their boring monologue, and only humming softly from my nose when it came to an end.

My neighbors, on the other hand, were very kind and friendly. After I had several interactions with them, I was deeply moved by their sincerity and enthusiasm. They devoted themselves to art with the piety of religious converts. Their cultivation was so profound, and their techniques were so skilled. They concentrated their energy and brains on the palette, on the tips of the brushes, and on the canvas. In this spring, when all life was overflowing with vitality and beginning to stir, they painted in the mountains from morning to dusk as if hypnotized. On rainy days and at night, I worked as a model several times, which was also a novel life experience, but as time went on, the expression on my face inevitably became rigid, and the muscles all over my body seemed to gradually tighten. I was most afraid of naughty children deliberately trying to make me laugh. I believe that it is not easy to train an excellent model.

Early summer in the mountain country is not like in Jiangnan. Drinking a cup of clear Longjing tea makes me sweat profusely. The narrowness and crowding of the North Hot Springs swimming pool made me lose interest. I always went to the lakes halfway up the mountain. White sheets were hung in the cedar forest, and a towel blanket was spread on the ground. When I was tired from swimming, I would lie down for a while, listen to the cicadas singing in the dense shade, and eat half a can of canned fruit. Sometimes farmers also came to bathe. Here, everything was like what Qu Yuan wished for, returning to nature. People took off their clothes, revealing their original bodies. Here, there was no division between rich and poor, no boundary between classes, only a comparison between health and weakness. Here, everything was fair.

I often attended the dance performances of Yucai School. "Youth Dance" invariably made every audience cheer wildly. The dance lyrically expressed the life of the Xinjiang Hui people and told the youth's lament of this generation of prairie girls. The aesthetic feeling that "Youth Dance" gave me was the highest degree of aesthetic feeling that dance art could give me.

When the watermelons of Dongshanping grew big and sweet, the owner of the Xuepu Farm invited me to do tasting work for him. I was treated like a machine, trying different varieties of watermelons with different degrees of ripeness one by one, almost numbing my sense of taste. I envied the life of the farm technicians. At night, they slept in thatched sheds and took turns patrolling with steel forks, defending against thieves and wild boars that stole watermelons. They could tell what kind of animal it was by hearing a slight howl, and they could judge the time by looking at the position of the stars.

The Baiwuting Pavilion on the cliff, with wind blowing from all sides, was most suitable for escaping the summer heat. I always played bridge in the pavilion at night. I think bridge is a most gentlemanly entertainment, but it also requires cooperation and tacit understanding. My partner is fixed.

My life in the mountains was very comfortable, although I was almost always sick afterwards. After I returned to Jiangnan this spring, I was constantly reminiscing about the mountains and rivers there. Now, the wisteria on the bamboo fence must be blooming with luxuriant flowers.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng 14

"Who knew that when I landed, I was a boy, that's me." He turned his head and smiled at me with a mouthful of teeth, "Mom liked it, but Grandpa pulled a long face and scolded me for being a stinky brat and saying I was useless. Mom knew it was all lies: Grandpa really worked hard. From the moment I landed until I was three weeks old, he gave me medicinal water to wash with, from the top of my head to the bottom of my heart, kneading my muscles and bones, rolling medicine bags, everything, he was busy non-stop. Later, he let Mom do it herself, but the old man was still not at ease and had to watch from the side."

"No wonder you're so strong." I looked closely at his arms and legs. Although I couldn't see his muscles bulging, they were round and tight, like a tightly inflated car tire, so tight that they shone. "It's nothing"; he also looked at his own little arms, "Just not afraid of cold, not afraid of heat—when you hit me, no matter what you use, I'm not afraid of pain."

"Did your grandfather teach you martial arts all alone?"

"No, Grandpa only taught qigong, and there were several other masters."

"Did you avenge the revenge?"

"Can't avenge it... His whole family is dead, only a few women and children are left, and they haven't practiced martial arts. Grandpa won't let me go, and my uncle doesn't approve either—our family moved to the village long ago—Uncle taught me to ride horses and use guns. He said that fighting the devils would be revenge."

At this time, the sun was not very high, and we had probably walked more than ten miles. We were just thinking of finding a place to rest before continuing, but we couldn't see a suitable place.

"Is there a tea shed ahead?" We had been walking along small hills and field ridges, and we couldn't see a single person. We had no choice but to ask my little guide, who had run along all the small paths.

"Do you want to have a snack?" He raised the small cloth bag again. "There are steamed buns and cakes inside."

"I don't want to eat, I just want to rest for a while before continuing." Seeing that he had already opened the bag, I knew that he wanted to eat, so I told him to eat while walking.

"I'm not hungry either," although he said that, he had already swallowed twice, "It's not easy to sit here. After passing this small mound, I remember there seems to be a small village." He pointed to a small mound lying in front of us; he was used to calling it a village, but it was probably just a small hamlet.

After walking for about another half an hour, we were almost at the top of the small hill. We were just planning to look around from the top of the hill when, unexpectedly, we suddenly heard a shout in a very rough, gravelly voice with a Japanese accent. Looking up, we saw two Japanese soldiers running onto the hilltop, pointing their guns at us.

This sudden turn of events naturally startled us. We had no choice but to stop and stand there in a daze. Just as I was about to say a few words to them, one soldier gestured for us to retreat, while the other soldier scolded his companion for being a fool, saying that they should capture us and at least search us. Maybe they would find some luck.

Little Tiger, on the other hand, had a completely indifferent expression and just looked at me; a hint of a smile appeared in his big round eyes.

"Brothers, we have orders to do official business," I said politely to the two guys, walking towards them.

"What official business, whose orders?" The one who wanted to try his luck asked, putting away his ferocious look just now.

"I say official business, of course it's official business. Is your officer here?" I had already walked up to them, and Little Tiger was following beside me.

"The officer is right over there," he became polite, probably thinking that I was a fellow countryman, perhaps my Japanese accent and the tone of a high-ranking officer had subdued them.

I followed the tip of the money-grubber's gun and looked towards the foot of the mountain to the north, and I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy, not because I was afraid, but because I was surprised at how quickly they had arrived. Because looking at the layout of this area, from a military point of view, almost the entire Beiping was surrounded by Japanese troops.

### The World

— Shaofu

The first person to receive the "Wendell Willkie One World Flight Award," American broadcaster Norman Corwin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and spoke at length about his ideal of one world at a press conference.

He said: The definition of "diplomacy" in Webster's Dictionary is "to obtain advantages by skill without incurring ill will or war"; he said: The new definition should be changed to "to establish a country's reputation by skill."

Willkie was a man with lofty ideals. He was visionary, but unfortunately he lost the election in 1941, and even more unfortunately, he died shortly after visiting China and returning to the United States. (Many people say that China seems to be a magic cave, whoever touches it gets bad luck. Willkie came and died after returning, Wallace came and didn't even get elected as vice president, Hurley, Wedemeyer, Chennault, none of them escaped some bad luck. Even Marshall and Stuart Leighton, who are still worrying, are also caught in the trap).

The idea of one world has actually been around for a long time. Confucius, whom we commemorate tomorrow, was its creator. Isn't the Datong chapter of the Book of Rites very concrete and clear? And Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People also inherit this philosophical system. Today, the Christian spirit of the West and the Confucian spirit of the East can be said to be the same ideological system.

Why do human beings engage in intrigue and slaughter, whether it is to gain benefits or gain reputation, cannot be a reason for fighting each other. The real skill that mankind seeks should be to seek abundant food, clothing, and a prosperous life for everyone; the creed that he worships should be "It is better for one's family to have enough than for oneself to have enough." This is the simple truth that Wallace once said, "Everyone in the world should be able to enjoy a few quarts of milk every day."

Looking at reality, we will be shocked by the tension and intensity of the so-called survival competition of human activities. After suffering from neurasthenia, how many people think of their own stupidity and absurdity in the middle of the night!

Shanghai Dynamics

### Selling Belts to Brew Coffee

— Lan Ka

After the Foreign Exchange Relaxation

The day after the foreign exchange was relaxed, Mayor Wu convened a meeting of various trade associations: to stabilize prices. He asked the four major companies and department stores not to raise prices. The greatest help he gave was to ban peddlers. He said: "...Now, most of the peddlers in Shanghai sell foreign goods, and some have capital of more than tens of millions of yuan. This deformed state has damaged department stores, and the government has also suffered losses because they evade taxes... Therefore, the municipal government has ordered that all peddlers selling foreign goods, except for small food stalls, be banned, and must be eradicated before the end of August..."

Indeed, after the victory, foreign goods poured in, and business became deformed; this kind of itinerant peddling that is about to be banned is one example. And the food peddlers who are not in the ban will increase and grow vigorously!

Don't you see, as the sun sets, how many coffee stalls with coarse cloth awnings are setting up seats for you by the side of the street!

If you go out a little later, it's even more flavorful—white tablecloths, white chair covers, reflected even whiter under the bright electric lights; glass drinking utensils are neatly arranged on the table, and Hills Bros coffee, Sullivan's bread, and Chrysanthemum brand milk are neatly arranged in the middle. The price is very cheap. Unlike coffee shops where a cup of coffee costs one dollar, it only costs you hundreds of yuan, and you can also add some milk. Looking at it from a distance, you might think you are in the South, thinking that you have arrived in the Philippines. It must be in Malaya or Java; but in reality, this is the democratization of coffee and toast. This allows a small civil servant to have the ability to taste fine coffee and fulfill his wish for White Pagoda Toast!

Those who sell glass belts must be resentful of the foreign exchange relaxation that broke their rice bowl; those who brew coffee and mix milk must be celebrating that their business is still not in the ban. Truly, this change in foreign exchange has caused so many "some laugh and some weep" situations. However, a person's talent is best shown in times of difficulty, so I believe that the person who sells glass belts is thinking faster than me, and he will quickly liquidate his stock and prepare to raise funds for a coffee stall to maintain his livelihood.

The dumping of coffee is about to embark on the fate of competition, which is not a small blessing for the palates of us civilians; I thank the foreign exchange relaxation!

Eating Paint

### Wheat Flour

— Common Scientific Knowledge

Not long ago, a small news item appeared in the newspaper stating that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau conducted spot checks on food and found that a certain well-known soy sauce brand was nothing more than a mixture of "coloring" and salt water. We know that "coloring" is actually a coloring agent brewed from soybean dregs, grain husks, and the like, without any nutritional value. If manufactured using scientific methods, "coloring" can be odorless and, when diluted with water, will have the same color as soy sauce, but will taste like plain water.

Here, the writer does not want to specifically criticize such unscrupulous merchants; consumers should also bear some responsibility.

There is a foreign proverb that says, "Ninety-nine cents for a bottle," meaning that the consumer spends ninety-nine cents of every dollar on the bottle's label, decoration, and advertising, while the actual product inside the bottle is only worth one cent. This is a very common consumer mentality, and most consumers are willing to waste money in this way.

If an honest merchant were to cook sweet potatoes until soft, add red food coloring and sugar vinegar, etc., and honestly call it "Sweet Potato Sauce," no one would pay attention to it in the market. A cunning manufacturer, using the same ingredients, would process them, seal them in glass bottles, and stick on a three-color, finely printed label with two or three bright red tomatoes prominently displayed, and then could justifiably call it Tomato Sauce. There are many, many examples like this. In the last decade or two, due to the significant progress of organic chemistry, many non-toxic pigments that can be ingested have been invented one after another, which has undoubtedly fueled this kind of deception and trickery.

Of course, foreign countries also have their "bugs." Here, I can give an extreme example.

There is a very famous canned food factory in the United States that produces grape juice, which, according to what it says on the can, tastes no different from fresh grape juice when mixed with eight parts water. I poked a hole in the can, and the liquid that poured out was just like purple ink, clearly dyed with the organic pigment "Methyl Violet." I used a very simple chemical method to prove that my guess was correct, and that this purple pigment was exactly the same as the pigment used in our "copying pencils," purple carbon paper, and purple printing ink. Not only am I eating pigment, but later I thought about it and realized it was quite ridiculous: fresh purple grapes only have purple skin, and the juice inside is not purple at all. The squeezed grape juice should be colorless, so how could it be as dark as purple printing ink? Thinking about this, my appetite was cut in half!

There are many more ridiculous things. As we all know, saccharin is often used in sweets instead of white sugar. Saccharin is also an organic compound, a small white crystalline granule with a bitter taste, but when diluted in a large amount of water, it has a strong sweet taste. Many people believe that it is harmful to eat, but in fact, science has long proven that saccharin only "travels" through the stomach once and is neither beneficial nor harmful to humans. The intestines and stomach do not absorb it, so it will inevitably be excreted "intact" sooner or later. This is not nonsense: if needed, a chemist could use a not-so-difficult procedure to find the saccharin you ate yesterday in your excrement, and then have it travel through your mouth and stomach countless times! Each time it would still be just as "sweet"!…

Eating pigment, eating sugar that isn't absorbed by the body—for these absurd eating habits, it seems we can only offer this "self-deprecating" explanation: eating is a pleasure, including for the tongue and the eyes. The saying "the eyes eat ice cream" has a basis. How much money is wasted on "food" that cannot be eaten!

### Schools Going to the Countryside: Not a High-Pitched Tune

— Fang Shan

To improve the current education in Shanghai, I would like to boldly contribute a method here: move a large number of Shanghai schools to the rural areas on the outskirts of Shanghai.

The reason is very simple and will surely be agreed upon.

First, let's talk about the negative reasons. Shanghai, a crowded city, a decadent city, cannot be said to be the best educational environment. Because of the population density, Shanghai has become a land where every inch is worth its weight in gold. Even if the school's leader is truly a cultivated, idealistic, pure-willed, and passionate educator who is determined to dedicate their life to the education of the next generation, even such schools and educators would still have no way to obtain ideal school buildings. This is why most schools in Shanghai have become "alley schools" and "road schools." In such school buildings, students' breathing must struggle with dirty and stuffy air, their eyesight must fight with dim or insufficient light, and their hearing must resist the noise of streetcars and hawkers. In fact, many students cannot escape the fate of becoming victims of tuberculosis, nearsightedness, or hysteria. As for the widespread existence of decadence, it is rare for children and young people, who are particularly susceptible to imitation and perception, to avoid the consequences of being contaminated after being exposed to it.

Now let's discuss the positive reasons. The rural areas on the outskirts of Shanghai have vast spaces, fresh air, beautiful natural scenery, and simple folk customs. All of these indicate the excellence of the environment, which is an ideal place to cultivate character, strengthen physical fitness, and study knowledge.

Based on the above two reasons, I dare to loudly call on educators: stop circling within the streets of Shanghai. We want to go to the suburbs of Shanghai to develop educational gardens; at the same time, I dare to loudly call on the parents of students: Mencius's mother choosing a neighborhood is a wise measure, and we must send our children to study in the suburbs of Shanghai.

For educators, this is a touchstone of creativity; for parents of students, it is a measure of discernment. However, the discernment of parents of students must be inspired by the creativity of educators. Therefore, the creativity of educators should be the driving force behind the "schools going to the countryside" movement.

In the admission advertisements of many schools in Shanghai, I found the advertisement of the newly established East China Vocational School. I heard that all the equipment of the school was inherited from the former East China United Middle School. The school was founded by Mr. Zhao Chuanjia, Chen Tianyu, and others. The school is located in the countryside of Zhenru in the western suburbs of Shanghai and has a self-built school building, which can be regarded as the pioneer of the recent school going to the countryside movement in Shanghai.

Here, I wish the school going to the countryside movement great success!

### Regarding the Embezzlement Case at the Railway Bureau

— Chong Zheng

Two opinions: (1) Yu Xiangyan should step forward; (2) I hope to hear the sequel!

The "legal protagonist" of the railway bureau embezzlement case is, of course, Chief Zhang Hongtu, but Chief Zhang pushed the suspicion of embezzlement onto his wife, Yu Xiangyan. However, Yu is as untraceable as the Yellow Crane, making it impossible to arrest her. Before Yu can be brought to justice, this embezzlement case that has attracted national attention cannot be fully revealed for the time being.

I think that although Yu Xiangyan is the wife of a chief, she cannot use her power in the railway bureau to greatly develop her career. What does she rely on to carry out this huge embezzlement case? It is inevitable to be suspicious.

If I were Yu Xiangyan, regardless of whether I was wronged or not, I would definitely step forward; if Mr. Zhang's confession is true, then one person should be responsible for their own actions, not implicating others or their husband. My conscience would not allow it, and the law would not allow you to be at large; if Chief Zhang has falsely accused you, or even escaped to help him relieve his troubles and act as a puppet, then not only will your reputation be ruined, but the entire women's world will be tarnished!

In the women's world, after thousands of years of enduring the feudal era, even today, when women's rights are being promoted, the remaining poison cannot be completely eliminated, and obstacles cannot be completely removed; if we are given the title of not having a share in being an official but being the protagonist of embezzlement, it is really unwilling—(Jin Jing)

I often feel that things always start with a bang but end with a whimper. For example, during the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, everyone's emotions were so high, especially the eight hundred heroic soldiers of the isolated army who defended the Sihang Warehouse, and everyone praised him at the time, but now his orphans are crying for food, and no one cares.

The embezzlement case of more than 100 million yuan in the two railway bureaus, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, has been going on for more than a month, but now there is no follow-up. I remember that when it first happened, everyone was angry and indignant and unanimously believed that it should be dealt with severely. And our authorities will definitely not ignore it.

Although the trial of the case now has its fixed legal procedures, we should not overstep our authority to interfere, but we always hope that in the intentional or unintentional delay, the big things will be reduced to small things, and the small things will be reduced to nothing. I hope not to disappoint the 3.5 million citizens!

I remember that after the embezzlement case in the two railway bureaus, a 100 million yuan embezzlement case also occurred in the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and it is still without a follow-up. Is this just a coincidence? Here, we just hope for a quick and serious resolution!

### Man of the Hour: Marshal Tito

— Gui Ting

—The Dictator of Yugoslavia (Part 1)

Amid the worsening relations between South America, Tito, the dictator of Yugoslavia, has become an international figure attracting worldwide attention. Only by knowing his origins and background can we understand why Yugoslavia would brazenly provoke this enormous wave. Major Temple H. Fielding of the U.S. Army, who was stationed in Yugoslavia with the U.S. military mission during the war and stayed for several months, had close contacts with Tito and his subordinates. The following is his report on everything about Tito:

Tito is the Marshal of Yugoslavia, the Supreme Commander of the National Liberation Army, and the Secretary-General of the Communist Party. He is one of the most dynamic figures in the Balkans. In terms of appearance, he is very seductive in every word and smile. He fully demonstrates the attractiveness of his personality in his interactions with people.

He looks just like a college professor. He is short and fat, with full muscles. He is fifty-three years old this year. He speaks gently and has a scholarly demeanor. With a pair of green eyes and messy hair, from an American point of view, he often needs a haircut.

From the photos published in the newspapers, Tito seems to be a very serious person. But in reality, he smiles more often than he frowns. He likes to chat and is very humorous. Once, when Fielding was dining with him, he fell because the chair wasn't sitting properly. Tito actually burst out laughing. He looked just like Mickey Mouse!

Tito's uniform is quite neat, but not too exaggerated. On the left chest hangs the partisan medal that Tito awarded to himself, and on the right chest hangs the Soviet Suvorov silver star medal. He is always accompanied by a group of guards and a female translator, Olga Ninchitch Humo. Tito's second wife, Herta, is a Slovak peasant woman and does not live with him in the camp.

Tito has a strange temper, which is his cold attitude towards English. He himself understands four or five foreign languages, but his English is also very poor. His speeches are not very good, his tone is peaceful, and he often uses nasal sounds. But his personal seductiveness covers up these shortcomings. So, as soon as he opens his mouth, the audience is hysterically persuaded by him.

Speaking of his background and pre-war activities, the following is a brief summary: Tito was born in Croatia. His father was a blacksmith, and his mother was a peasant woman, both of whom were illiterate. In 1914, Tito was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army. But he surrendered to the Russian army at the front. Later, because he opposed fighting for the Tsar, he was exiled to Siberia. After the Bolshevik Party came to power, he was released in 1917. He then joined the Communist Party. He was tempered in the whirlpool of the Great Revolution for three years. From 1920 to 1923, he was left at a secret training school in Moscow. There, foreign communists were rigorously trained to overthrow their capitalist governments. At the age of twenty-eight, he had become a staunch and disciplined Communist Party member and was then sent back to Croatia. At that time, he served as the leader of the metalworkers' union and carried out large-scale activities. As a result, he was arrested and imprisoned. He was not released until five years later. After this experience, his attitude became stronger, and he felt that his enemies must be mercilessly eliminated. Since then, he has engaged in underground work and become an active Communist Party cadre.

Important Communist Party Figure

For the next thirteen years, Tito seemed to be completely unknown. Some reports said that he had served as a cadre of the Third International and was the highest representative of Stalin sent to the Balkans. But later, this report was denied. Observers familiar with the situation believe that this denial is correct because the Soviet military intelligence agency is a completely independent spy organization and keeps secrets so that even the Third International does not know much about its activities. Of course, Tito is an important Communist Party cadre. He is unknown in the orthodox faction, and he has also spied for the Soviet Union. He admitted that he had secretly returned to the Soviet Union several times between 1929 and 1939.

Hitler attacked Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. Hundreds of resistance groups rose up to resist. But Tito and the Communist Party members did not participate in the resistance with guns. Two months later, after Germany attacked the Soviet Union on the same day, their guerrillas began to fight. Tito later explained that this delay was for technical convenience, and he also argued that his men were fully organized by then.
