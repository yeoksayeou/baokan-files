### Du Yuming Flew to Shenyang Yesterday; National Army Positions in Changchun Shrinking, Situation Very Critical

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Military news: Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming has now arrived in Shenyang. Air transport to Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan has been strengthened. Furthermore, Northeast Security Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liang Huasheng has already crossed Sipingjie and is personally leading 2,000 elite troops from the New First Army, advancing towards Gongzhuling. It is reported that Gongzhuling is approximately 50 kilometers from Changchun, and 20,000 Communist troops are holding it. A major battle is expected there.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 17th] General Du Yuming has recovered his health, but he should not overexert himself. However, as Northeast military affairs urgently require handling, he has taken leave from sick leave and flown [there] on the 18th. On the 17th, Mr. Du held a reception for reporters in Peiping, answering various questions. He stated that the National Army is currently advancing north from Sipingjie to carry out the takeover work, but is encountering Communist troops obstructing them everywhere. It is reported that the Communist troops have a large force stationed in Gongzhuling, north of Sipingjie, preparing for a decisive battle. This location is defended by the elite Communist troops commanded by Lin Biao, and it is expected that the National Army will encounter stubborn obstruction there. Currently, Communist troops have attacked Changchun, and the situation there is very urgent. After arriving in Shenyang, the first step is to rapidly commence the takeover work under the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty integrity. He also stated that the Communist military strength in the Northeast, according to incomplete reports, is 350,000 to 360,000 regular troops and 150,000 to 160,000 irregular troops. The Communist troops possess various light and heavy weapons, originally belonging to the Japanese army. The Japanese army had a large number of weapons in the Northeast, all of which fell into the hands of the Communist troops. Taking the Shenyang Arsenal as an example, it alone has 150,000 to 160,000 rifles. The Northeast Executive Headquarters hopes to proceed smoothly, but to maintain sovereignty and territorial integrity, the takeover should be carried out first, followed by mediation. After the takeover, all political problems will not be difficult to resolve.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 18th] Military news: (1) On the 17th and 18th, the Communist troops' attacks on Changchun intensified. Our defending troops, with heavy casualties, retreated to the city center, the Datong Square, the Central Bank, the police station, and several buildings of the electricity company. Officers and soldiers alike are determined to continue resisting. (2) On the 18th, the Communist troops even shelled the Central Bank and the electricity company, and used incendiary bombs, causing fires in many places. (3) The Communist troops outnumber us by three to one and have four or five medium-sized tanks. The drivers, artillerymen, and gunners are all officers from a certain [foreign] party, and their artillery and tanks must have been supplied by a certain [foreign] party. (4) The Communist leaders are Zhou Baozhong, Cao Lihui, Zhang Qinghe, and others. (5) On the 16th, a Soviet aircraft flew at low altitude over the Changchun city area. (6) The railways and highways in the area between Sipingjie and Gongzhuling are all being actively destroyed by the Communist troops.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 18th] After several days of fierce fighting, the isolated army in Changchun's outer perimeter strongholds are gradually shrinking. They are now only holding the Central Bank and the Post Office as strongholds. Contact with the outside world was still made via radio on the morning of the 18th. According to authoritative sources, the final fate of this isolated army will be decided on the evening of the 18th and the morning of the 19th.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 18th] A telegram from the besieged Changchun states: After twelve hours of intense fighting, most of Changchun has fallen into the hands of the Communist troops after the National Army fiercely bombed the Communist troops.

### Marshall Arrived in Chongqing Yesterday from Peiping; Negotiations with Both Sides to Begin Today

[United Press, Chongqing, 18th] Special Envoy Marshall and his party departed from Peiping by plane at 10:30 this morning and arrived at the capital's airport at 2:40 this afternoon. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Zhou Enlai, and other important members of the Nationalists and Communists were present to greet him. Mr. Marshall then received reporters for a short time. Mr. Marshall stated: He will immediately devote himself to solving the Northeast and China problems. The hope for peace in China has been strengthened. Until he has spoken with all parties, he naturally cannot make any statements about the overall situation. His trip to China from the United States was safe, but Washington was extremely busy, more so than at any time since the beginning of the war. After arriving here, Mr. Marshall did not wish to explain the results of his trip to Washington, nor did he wish to elaborate on China's developments before speaking with representatives from various parties. He only stated: He will immediately consult on the overall situation in China, paying particular attention to the large-scale civil war in the Northeast. It is expected that Mr. Marshall will rest for one night and begin a series of meetings with officials from the American Embassy and leaders from the National Government and the Communists tomorrow. When asked how long he will stay on this return trip to China, Mr. Marshall said: "I do not yet know, it will depend on the situation." After disembarking from the plane, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall were taken by Madame Chiang Kai-shek in the same car to a private residence in the suburbs for a short rest, before returning to their former residence in Yiyuan. Journalists gathered outside the gate to wait. Mr. Marshall spoke briefly, and smiled as he entered, saying: "I hope the meetings don't start tonight." Mr. Marshall's primary task is to renegotiate the ceasefire order and end the fierce fighting in the Northeast. His secondary task is to get the Nationalist and Communist leaders to reach an agreement on government reorganization and troop consolidation. Political observers here expect the Nationalists and Communists to quickly reach a ceasefire agreement, as all parties know that the National Government and the Communists are eagerly awaiting Mr. Marshall's arrival to find a suitable agreement to "save face." Reliable military sources say that although the civil war situation in the Northeast is serious, it is not impossible to resolve peacefully as long as both sides are sincere in their efforts.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th] General Marshall flew from Peiping to Chongqing by plane at 10:30 this morning, accompanied by Mrs. Marshall and Lieutenant General Gillem. After arriving here from Tokyo last night, Mr. Marshall immediately listened to reports from Minister Robertson, General Gillem, and Brigadier General Beall, the head of the Executive Group of the Mediation Executive Headquarters, on the developments in China during Mr. Marshall's absence. Mr. Marshall paid particular attention to the Northeast situation.

### Jiang Tingfu Returns to China from the United States; Our Request for Food Aid Was Not Successful

[United Press, San Francisco, 17th] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Chinese Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and 30 staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, are scheduled to fly to Shanghai tomorrow aboard a Pan American World Airways "Constellation" aircraft. Among them are transportation and public health experts, surgical dentists, X-ray technicians, veterinarians, housing experts, accountants, industrial architects, and radio experts. According to Jiang Tingfu's statement to the press today: I came to the United States to request a steady supply of food on behalf of China, but I must admit that the mission I was entrusted with has failed. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has reduced the quantity requested by China, and the Anglo-American-Canadian Joint Food Committee has reduced it again. Our request for 500,000 tons of fertilizer resulted in only 10,000 tons. The United Kingdom is also unwilling to provide China with surplus rice from Siam due to political and economic reasons. India is also suffering from famine. India is China's neighbor, and we do not want to take from others by force. What we are asking for is fair consideration, and we hope that Mr. Hoover, Chairman of the American Emergency Food Committee, or other international delegations, will go to China and India for on-site investigation and decide on the allocation. I cannot help but shudder at the sight of Americans wasting good food. I fully agree with President Truman's statement that half of China's 450 million people are undernourished. Hunan, which was originally a rice-producing area, now has 16 million people who are about to starve to death. Those who say that Europe's daily ration is maintained at 1,500 calories are unaware that China's daily ration averages only 850 calories. If Europe's ration were reduced to the current standard in the Far East, there would be no famine in the Far East. At the same time, if the United States can reduce to the European standard, no one here will go hungry at any time. If the United States were to give up eating rice until the end of December, no one would suffer from hunger.

### He Yingqin Discusses Sending Away Japanese Captives and Residents: Remaining 600,000 to be Sent Away by the End of June; Assuring Efforts to Relieve the Besieged National Army in Changchun

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 18th] At 3 PM today, Commander-in-Chief He reported at a press conference: (1) The General Headquarters of the Army is responsible for using twelve ports to send away Japanese captives and residents. Qingdao, Lianyungang, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Haikou, Keelung, Kaohsiung, and other ports can be completed by the end of this month. Only Shanghai and Tanggu ports need to wait until the Japanese captives and residents from Shanxi and the central Yangtze River area are transported before they can be completed. Currently, 3,000 Japanese residents and captives can be transported out of Shanxi by train every day. As of the 18th of this month, the General Headquarters of the Army has transported away 805,551 Japanese captives and 809,932 Japanese residents. There are more than 609,000 remaining Japanese captives and residents. Thanks to the joint efforts of China and the United States, it is expected to be completed by the end of June. (2) There were originally 65,363 Koreans in China (excluding the Northeast). Now 12,000 people have been sent back, and the rest can be sent away within this month. Koreans can bring 250 pounds of luggage on board. (3) Taiwanese compatriots have been clearly ordered to restore their Chinese nationality. However, Taiwanese who served in the Japanese army should still be concentrated. Those who have served as enemy spies or have engaged in abusive behavior must be dealt with according to the law. (4) The Executive Yuan's meeting has decided on five measures for the disposal of Korean and Taiwanese people's property, and the measures have been announced. (5) Regarding the requisition of Japanese technicians. The United Nations originally decided that all Japanese in all theaters of war should be sent back to their countries, so they should be immediately concentrated and start the repatriation. As for the military agencies, there are no regulations for retaining or employing Japanese captives at all. Those who were previously requisitioned were for the nature of conscripted labor and should be sent back. (6) The U.S. has decided to start the repatriation of Japanese captives and residents in Northeast China on April 25. The port used will be Huludao. As for the number of Japanese captives and residents in Northeast China, it is impossible to count because the Northeast has not been completely taken over. It is estimated to be about 1.33 million people. (7) Regarding war criminals, a War Criminals Handling Committee has been established in Chongqing. The organization of military tribunals has been drafted, and the Military Affairs Commission has ordered the establishment of military tribunals in various places to exclusively handle war criminal affairs. Those that have been established include Nanjing, Wuxi, Taiwan, Xuzhou, Jinan, Quzhou, Taiyuan, Beiping, Hankou, Jinzhou, Guangzhou, and other eleven locations. Twenty-five people have been arrested in Nanjing. The more important ones include Sakai Takashi, Naida Takatoki (commander of the Japanese 70th Division), Nakajima Shinichi (head of the Japanese Kyoto-Shanghai Special Affairs Agency), and Hoboji Tokuji (Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander). According to reports from various places, the total number of arrested people is 970.

Regarding the Situation in Changchun

[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 18th] Today, Commander-in-Chief He answered the following questions from reporters. (1) Question: The thousands of isolated troops defending Changchun are on the verge of extinction in order to safeguard national sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people. The people of the country are now extremely concerned about the safety of these loyal and brave soldiers. Since the government does not advocate reinforcements by paratroopers or other methods, what measures will be taken to save these people from their misfortune? Answer: It is reported that the New First Army, which is rushing to aid Changchun, has arrived near Gongzhuling. The Communist army is now guarding Gongzhuling, using various methods to block the National Army, as reported in the news. However, the government is extremely anxious about the safety of the military and civilians and receiving personnel in Changchun, and will definitely take appropriate measures to relieve this precarious situation. (2) Question: What is the current situation of the coal mines in Lincheng and Zaozhuang on the Jinpu Railway, the situation of the Communist army near Anyang on the Pinghan Railway, and the date of opening of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway? Answer: It was agreed to jointly manage the Zaozhuang coal mine, but it has not been resolved because the Communist army has not yet withdrawn. Although the railway near Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway has been repaired, it has not been connected. This phenomenon exists on both the Longhai and Pinghan Railways. This is because the Communist army still lacks sincerity in restoring transportation. (3) Question: Does the name "Self-Renewal Army" still exist? Answer: After the puppet troops surrendered, they were initially renamed "Self-Renewal Army." Later, they were disbanded by the General Headquarters of the Army. This name no longer exists. Only a very small number of "Self-Renewal Army" with better qualities are temporarily given the name of a column for the sake of temporarily maintaining local security in remote areas.

### The Security Council Discusses Two Major Issues: Reaching a Critical Juncture Yesterday; Poland Proposed Severing Relations with Spain at the Meeting the Day Before; It is Reported that Britain Advised Franco to Resign Immediately

[Report from Our Agency] Broadcast from San Francisco, 18th: The Security Council will discuss two doubly important issues at its meeting today. In addition to continuing the discussion of the Spanish issue, the Iranian case will once again cause fierce debate. Regarding the Spanish issue, British Representative Cadogan will state his position today. As for the Iranian case, the expert committee will submit a report. Today's meeting is the most critical juncture since the Security Council began its work.

[Dispatch from the U.S. News Agency, New York, 17th] After the Security Council reconvened this afternoon, Polish Representative Lange immediately filed a complaint against the Franco regime, accusing the regime of seriously threatening world peace and security. Lange also delivered a lengthy speech, presenting documents urging the United Nations to immediately sever relations with Spain. It stated roughly that Franco seized power with the military assistance of the Axis powers, which was not the will of the Spanish people at all. Therefore, the Franco regime is an enemy of the United Nations. Franco even assisted the Axis powers in combat with explosives and other materials. This was not an ordinary commercial exchange, but contained political functions, which was assisting the Axis powers in fighting against the United Nations. Since Franco supplied various bases for the Axis powers to use and also assisted Japan in attacking Pearl Harbor, all of this can be regarded as an unofficial ally of the Axis powers. Therefore, the Franco regime is not only an internal affair of Spain. French Representative Bonnet immediately agreed with the Polish proposal. It is said that the continued existence of the current situation in Spain will "threaten world peace." The Spanish debate lasted for more than three hours before adjourning in the evening. Bonnet stated that France is ready to take further action and impose economic sanctions on Spain. The Mexican representative also followed the French representative and expressed his support for the Polish motion. Dutch Representative Kleffens and U.S. Representative Stettinius opposed interfering in Spain's internal affairs, but both representatives criticized the Franco regime. Stettinius said that this issue must be resolved by the Spanish people themselves.

[United Press, New York, 17th] The Security Council held its 34th meeting tonight. Egyptian Representative Yaffee succeeded Guo Taiqi as chairman, delivered a speech at the opening, and expressed his warm gratitude to Guo. Yaffee declared after the meeting that the principles involved in the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish issue were even more important than the facts. This principle is whether the United Nations organization can intervene in any country because its domestic situation is sufficient to evolve and endanger international peace.

[Associated Press, London, 18th] Well-informed sources here believe that Britain has made an informal proposal to the Spanish government, requesting that the country's dictator, Franco, should resign immediately. The British Foreign Office no longer conceals its policy towards Spain, the main purpose of which is to overthrow Franco without causing Spain to fall into the hands of communism.

[Reuters, New York, 18th] Before the Security Council adjourned yesterday, Soviet Representative Gromyko suggested that the meeting be held as usual on Easter Friday. The Brazilian representative was the first to stand up in anger to object, and the representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands also quickly expressed their opposition. As a result, it was decided that after convening a meeting today, the meeting would be postponed until after the holidays.

### Iran Suddenly Implements News and Telegraph Censorship: The United States Has Sent Urgent Telegrams to Inquire

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Iran suddenly implemented strict news and telegraph censorship today. Upon receiving the report, the U.S. State Department immediately sent an urgent telegram to inquire in order to determine whether Iran's move was at the instigation of the Soviet Union and what measures the United States could use to make Iran lift the censorship. The State Department is also studying in detail the possibility of filing a formal protest. Iran's control of telegrams sent abroad this time is the same as the method used by the Soviet Union in March, called "blind censorship." Censors delete telegrams without notifying the reporter who sent the telegram. (According to Reuters, Tehran: The Iranian government has solemnly denied censoring news and telegrams.)

### Prime Minister of Iranian Azerbaijan Declares Willingness to Fight

[Report from Our Agency] Broadcast from London, 18th: The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan delivered a speech, stating roughly: "They are unwilling to see bloodshed again, but if the Iranian central government is willing to fight, we will definitely rise up and deal with them. Our farmers have obtained fertile land with their blood and flesh and will never give it up easily. Azerbaijan is the Azerbaijan of the people of Azerbaijan and will be ruled by the people of Azerbaijan."

### Due to the Presidential Election Law Issue, the Three Major Parties in France Have a Rupture

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] When the National Constituent Assembly met today, the three major parties had a major rupture over the issue of the presidential election law. The Charter Subcommittee of the General Assembly had submitted a draft stipulating that the President of France should be elected by a two-thirds majority of the National Constituent Assembly, and voting must be public. If a two-thirds majority cannot be obtained in three consecutive votes, the election should be postponed, or in accordance with the same principle, it should be stipulated that it be elected by a five-thirds majority to replace the two-thirds majority. The term of office of the elected president is seven years, and he can only be re-elected once. At today's meeting, the People's Republican Movement Party proposed an amendment, advocating that the president must be elected by a joint meeting of the National Constituent Assembly and the Federal Executive Yuan, and must obtain an absolute majority. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party expressed their opposition. After being put to a vote, the amendment was rejected by 289 votes to 264 votes.

### The Control Committee for Japan Discusses the Secretary-General Issue: The Soviet Union Proposes that It Should be Held in Rotation by the Four Countries; Today's Meeting Will Formulate the Rules of Procedure

[Report from Our Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Allied Control Committee for Japan held its second meeting yesterday morning. Participants included General Zhu Shiming, MacArthur's representative Marquette, Soviet representative Derevyanko, British representative Bower, and their staff. The meeting discussed the procedure for electing a secretary-general. The Soviet representative proposed that it should be selected from the representatives of the four countries and held in rotation, rather than being appointed by MacArthur. The current secretary-general, Fellers, was appointed by MacArthur.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] When the Allied Control Committee for Japan meets tomorrow, China, the Soviet Union, and Britain will formulate strict rules of procedure so that the committee can control all its witnesses and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents such as Brigadier General Whitney's "illegal delay" of three hours yesterday.

### Japanese Scientific Researchers Invent "Atomic Energy Food": A Compound of Fish Bones, Orange Peels, and Potato Peels, After Tasting It, It "Tastes Very Delicious"

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] "Atomic Energy Food," which is sufficient to save millions of starving Japanese people, has now been invented here. At a time when there is a heated debate over the military control of atomic energy, Enomoto, a researcher at the Japanese Institute of Scientific Research, has been able to use atomic energy constructively. This sensational move seems to be a satirical contrast. Enomoto's invention originated from the bombing of Hiroshima. He believes that the sun is the largest known source of atomic energy, and sunlight constantly shines on the ground and the oceans, which occupy most of the ground. Therefore, the ocean must be the largest storage place for atomic energy. His research is to invent edible atomic energy from seawater. In addition, because fish have drunk seawater, he also plans to use fish to manufacture it. He mixes fish bones with orange peels and potato peels to make it equivalent to vitamins. After Enomoto tasted these mixtures, he exclaimed, "It's delicious!" The manufacture of atomic energy food does not require rare and expensive raw materials, because fish bones are cheap and readily available. However, Enomoto is still humbly claiming that he is not satisfied with this invention. He is still continuing to improve it and wants to increase the heat it contains from 800 calories to 1,000 calories per unit.

### Local Correspondence

Jiaxing

Explaining Various Points in Handling Enemy Property

Because representatives of various party, government, legal, and civilian groups in Jiaxing organized a committee to take over 166 houses built by the puppets on Beidajie Street, Director Yu of the Jiaxing Branch of the Enemy Property Handling Bureau specifically issued an explanation on the 17th on various points in handling enemy property: (1) If the property originally belonged to the people of our country, allied countries, or friendly countries, and it is confirmed by concrete evidence that it was forcibly taken over by the Japanese side, it should be returned to the original owner, but the original owner should prepare a substantial guarantee before being able to receive it back. (2) If the property originally belonged to the Chinese and was jointly operated with the Japanese puppets, its sovereignty will be taken over by the central government. If the Handling Bureau confirms by concrete evidence and the Review Committee approves that the aforementioned property was jointly operated with the Japanese puppets and was of a forced nature, it may be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and handling. (3) If the property originally belonged to Japanese residents or was purchased with funds from Japanese residents, the property will belong to the central government. (4) The debts of enemy puppet property should be paid off separately within the organization of the assets. Debts owed to the Japanese puppets should be repaid to the central government. It was also stated that with regard to the houses built by the puppets in the Beidajie area, legitimate reasons can be put forward to apply to the Handling Bureau for review and handling. If the various legal groups organize a committee to take over, it would be a division of national power.

County Chief Zhang answered them one by one. The main points of the interpellation were: (1) The county government is still employing personnel who participated in puppet organizations and should be replaced immediately. (2) The government's procedures for receiving enemy and puppet property are too vague and the handling is too slow. (3) The security team has insufficient funds and should plan ahead. It cannot condone the illegal behavior of the township and pao chiefs who harass the people. (4) The personnel collecting house donations are acting illegally and extorting money from the people. This must be prohibited. (5) During the enemy and puppet era, there was a treacherous person who colluded with the Japanese to establish the Dali Mountain Mine in Jinghu. The county government did not announce it to the people. Is it currently operating or closed? (6) Why was Da Xin Company sometimes sealed and sometimes unsealed?

Editorial

### How to Stipulate Wages?

Recently, the general public has been concerned about the lack of a path forward for Chinese industry. One reason is that the foreign exchange rate makes the price of imported foreign goods much cheaper than domestic goods, which inevitably hits Chinese factories hard. However, the main reason is the tumultuous labor unrest. Not only are business leaders discussing this issue, but many foreign manufacturers are preparing to move from Shanghai to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, or even Japan, and some are eager to follow suit. Even ordinary people who are usually unrelated to factories are hesitant to invest in industry upon seeing the surging labor unrest. This is truly a misfortune for Chinese industry and for Chinese society as a whole. The reason for this is that the lax labor discipline and low work efficiency make factory managers deeply feel that industrial order cannot be maintained. Therefore, they speculate that Chinese industrial products will not be able to compete with foreign goods in the market, which greatly reduces their interest in investing in industry. In addition, the chaotic and demanding issue of wage increases is also a major headache for the business community.

Let us put aside the general issue of labor discipline for the time being and discuss this seemingly complex but actually simple wage issue. Regarding the wage issue, there have been many proposals recently. One is to stipulate a maximum wage, one is to stipulate a minimum wage, one is to hope for unified wages, and one is to advocate for adjusting base salaries. Opinions are divided and no consensus has been reached, making the wage issue even more complicated. In fact, after peeling back the layers, none of the proposals are truly pertinent. Let's analyze them as follows:

The purpose of stipulating a maximum wage is to prevent workers from making unrestrained demands, thereby stabilizing costs and stabilizing industry so that it can compete with foreign goods. In short, it is intended to protect the legitimate interests of capital. The purpose of stipulating a minimum wage is to prevent capital from excessively exploiting workers, thereby protecting the deserved interests of labor and maintaining their appropriate standard of living. At first glance, these two goals seem completely opposite, but today they are occurring simultaneously, indicating that there must be other underlying reasons. The reason, in short, is that prices are too high. Because prices are too high, workers have difficulty making a living and must demand a minimum standard of living. However, the industry is also facing high prices and high costs, leading to reduced domestic sales and difficulty exporting. It cannot compete with cheap foreign goods, which endangers its foundation for survival. Therefore, it must urgently appeal to workers for understanding and demand that wage increase requests have a maximum limit. Both sides feel that they have valid reasons and justifications.

Because both sides' theories are based on facts and are rooted in the same reality, from a theoretical perspective, there is no shortcut to satisfying both sides' desires other than mutual concessions and assistance in order to jointly overcome the difficulties and tide over the crisis. If we rely solely on laws, whether stipulating a maximum wage or a minimum wage, we believe it will be of no help in the current situation. Therefore, to resolve the wage issue in labor-capital disputes, we must fundamentally start with stabilizing prices.

It must be understood that this wage, whether it is the maximum or minimum, must be based on relatively stable prices. With prices fluctuating so much now, if the price increases continue indefinitely, then what is considered the maximum or minimum today will lose its original meaning in a month or two, and will need to be readjusted to fit the maximum or minimum limit. If this limit cannot be determined one day, then the maximum and minimum wages will also be impossible to determine. In other words, fundamentally, under today's price conditions, we have no way to obtain fixed maximum or minimum wages.

Therefore, some people advocate for the universal application of cost-of-living indexes, taking base salaries as the basis for the maximum and minimum wages instead of fixed wage amounts. If this method can achieve the result of unified wages, it can avoid the above difficulties. However, the following problems will arise:

(1) Is this base salary regional or national?

(3) What procedures should be used to establish this base salary?

If it is national, then civil servants already have a base salary and there is no need to establish a new one. Then why can't the multipliers in different regions be unified? And why not use the cost-of-living index as a standard for monthly increases and decreases? If public institutions cannot implement this, but private businesses are forced to apply it universally to achieve uniformity, is it reasonable?

Regional base salaries are naturally simpler. But within the same region, we have already seen that many public institutions do not use uniform standards. Even those generally considered to have the best treatment, such as the China Textile Corporation, are reportedly still demanding increases. So, what kind of wage standard is considered the maximum or minimum?

Moreover, whether it is a base salary or a wage, if a number must be stipulated and obeyed, it must go through legislative procedures to take effect. The minimum wage laws enacted in industrially advanced countries are first passed by parliament and then promulgated and implemented by the government. This is a very obvious example. Our Legislative Yuan has not yet enacted a minimum wage law, let alone a maximum wage law. Therefore, there is currently no basis for a national wage law. If individual laws are enacted by local governments, should the local councils bear this responsibility? If the local government only uses orders to stipulate, is it legal? Based on the above theory, we have some doubts about the point of unified wages from a legislative perspective. As for the facts, if we force "equal pay for equal work within the same industry, and even equal pay for different industries," as some people hope, it is like forcing big shoes on small feet or pricing them the same, which is probably too close to idealism. Recently in this city, there have been many examples proving that forcing the same treatment within the same industry will inevitably encounter very serious difficulties, and in fact, it is ultimately unworkable. If we want to go a step further and insist on equal pay for different industries, it seems easy to imagine the result! In this precarious situation for industry and commerce, we always feel that the first thing we should focus on is stability, and the first thing we need to achieve is stability. Only from stability can we hope to survive and progress. Those who have already experienced labor unrest should urgently seek solutions; those who have not yet experienced labor unrest should not be further provoked or incited. The so-called unified wage, if it must be achieved, is nothing more than adding more fuel and oil to this raging labor unrest! This is definitely not a way to quell labor unrest.

As for adjusting the base salary, we believe there are two viewpoints. One is to raise the standard of living, and the other is to restore the pre-war standard. If it belongs to the former, that is another issue. We must first ask whether the standard of living of the general public can be immediately improved under the current production situation, with work efficiency so low and foreign goods being dumped more and more severely. Anyone with discernment can see the answer. If it belongs to the latter, then the word "adjust" is not very accurate at all. Because to restore the pre-war life, whether it is reasonable to make this request at this time, even if it is considered necessary, it is only necessary to multiply the pre-war wage by the cost-of-living index, without having to spend much effort on another adjustment. Once another adjustment is made, it has the effect of deliberately raising or lowering it, which has lost the original meaning of restoring the pre-war standard. Therefore, in this sense, we believe that it is only necessary to determine the base salary, without having to adjust the base salary. The base salary is a fact, a basis, a foundation, not an ideal, let alone a fabrication. Just take out the books and receipts and review them together, without any need for disputes. If there are disputes, other books and receipts must still be used to corroborate them, and subjective opinions are still not applicable. Recently popular methods of adjusting the base salary, estimating the base salary, or adding 2.5 times the pre-war base salary and then increasing or decreasing it according to the cost-of-living index are all superfluous and only sow new seeds of trouble and disputes in order to perfunctorily compromise and seek temporary peace!

In short, whether it is a base salary or a cost-of-living index, these are tools for solving the wage issue, not fundamental solutions. The fundamental solution still lies in the emotions and understanding of both labor and capital. Therefore, Director Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau once advocated promoting factory conferences in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law, which we believe is a way to solve the labor unrest. However, an indispensable condition must also be attached, which is that both labor and capital must sincerely participate in the conference for the development of the factory, and must not have different dreams while sharing the same bed in the conference, and especially must not deprive the factory of its management powers because of this conference. This is no longer within the scope of the wage issue and will not be discussed in detail today.

### After the Promulgation of the Habeas Corpus Law, the Court Implements the First Case: Wang Jilu and Wang Jishu Detained for More Than Five Months; the District Court Specifically Seeks Habeas Corpus from the Arresting Agency

[Our Newspaper] In order to ensure the personal freedom of the people and strictly prohibit the illegal arrest of criminals, the National Government promulgated the Habeas Corpus Law. The Ministry of Justice instructed courts in various regions to accept the people's requests for habeas corpus, which came into effect on March 15th of this year. The law stipulates that the arrest of criminals must be carried out by an agency with judicial power, and a warrant must be presented. Non-judicial agencies must transfer arrested criminals to judicial agencies for trial within 24 hours. Otherwise, the families of the arrested criminals may petition the court for habeas corpus. The court may issue a habeas corpus writ to the arresting agency, ordering it to promptly deliver the criminals without refusal. The Municipal District Court recently issued Habeas Corpus Writ No. 1, ordering a certain military agency to release Wang Jilu and Wang Jishu, two brothers. The two were accused of hiding enemy property and had been detained by the military agency for more than five months. This is the first case implemented by the Shanghai District Court after the promulgation of the Habeas Corpus Law.

At about 1:00 PM, when it sailed to Shidongkou, seven nautical miles away from Wusong, the waves were very strong and water entered through the door, with four feet of water inside the cabin. The boiler was hit by cold water, and there was a risk of explosion. The shipowner ordered the furnace to be extinguished, and the ship was sailed to the shore and anchored. He also hung up a rescue flag and sounded the whistle for help. Some of the passengers assisted the crew in their work. After 8:00 PM, the wind and waves subsided slightly, and the ship gradually escaped the danger. At 4:20 AM yesterday morning, it entered the port, and at about 6:00 AM, it arrived outside the Fourth Road and could not be moored. The loss of some of the passengers and cargo is now being processed in water.

Yu Shaoyuan confessed that before the war, he was the chief secretary of the Jiangsu Finance Department. After the war broke out, he came to Shanghai to take refuge. Later, he was discovered by "76" and detained. He was forced to take a pseudo-official position. Yu Zifan was also detained, and it was threatened that the entire family would be arrested if he did not obey. Unable to do so, he became the Director of the National Treasury of the Pseudo-Ministry of Finance, a simplified position, and later became the Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, and also served as a supervisor of the bank. Before the victory, he surrendered to the Songjiang Office of the Central Bureau of Statistics, and agreed to plan for a counter-offensive when the Allied forces landed in Shanghai. He also submitted certificates and employee cards. The other defendant, Yu Zifan, confessed to serving as the Director of the Deposit Section of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank and the Director of the Wuhu Office of the bank. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate and set the sentence for 2:30 PM on the 25th. There were three other investigation cases, including:

### The Crisis of the Domestic Leather Industry Hopes That the Government Will Take Effective Measures

According to a magnate of the domestic leather (used for shoe soles, etc.) manufacturing industry, before the war, China's leather market was controlled by pseudo-domestic goods manufacturers. Imported goods were difficult to compete with because of their high value. However, at present, the US government stipulates that leather and leather-making raw materials are not allowed to be exported, but the orders for finished leather and leather shoes from various foreign firms in this city are quite large. What's more, some American leather is privately transported to Shanghai by smuggling methods. As a result, domestic leather sales are greatly stagnant. On the other hand, due to the lack of major raw materials, the production and sales of the industry are both seriously threatened. Therefore, it is hoped that the temporary committee for the import design of the Ministry of Finance will suggest that the government stop supplying this foreign exchange, prohibit imports, or increase tariffs. At the same time, it is also hoped that the government will negotiate with the United Kingdom and the United States to allow the continued shipment of chemical raw materials for leather making to China, and effectively stop the smuggling of finished leather into China, so as to change the 20 to 30 years of hard work in China's leather manufacturing industry from being destroyed.

### The Public Works Bureau Hosts the Press to Inspect the Dredging Project; The Dredging of Zhaojia River Will Be Completed Before the End of July

[Our Newspaper] Deputy Director Wang Shengshan of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, accompanied by representatives of the United Nations and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, as well as more than 30 reporters from various newspapers, went to various places to inspect the dredging work. First, they went to the Heping Road in front of the No. 2 Public Funeral Home on Changping Road in the Fourth Engineering District to inspect the work. They are currently processing the segmented mud dredging. The No. 14 Heping Road on Dunxin Road is also being dredged in the same way. The Fahua River is the general confluence of drainage from No. 3 to No. 14 Heping Road in western Shanghai. The path on one side of the river is narrow, while the other side is covered with houses and small shops, which enter the river. The widest part of the river is 14 meters, and the narrowest part is less than 1 meter. The flood control road is 12 feet high, and the silt has reached 11 feet, which has a great impact on drainage. Yesterday, representatives of the residents along the river also told reporters and others about the difficulties of demolishing houses, and requested the bureau to change the plan. Then they went to Xujiahui to inspect the Zhaojia River, which is more than 2,900 meters long. More than 400 people are working, using pumps to pump water and dredge mud. The project is huge. The completed sections can already be used for boats, and the water color is also clear. There are a total of 15 Heping Rivers in the Fourth District, with a length of 14 kilometers. 8 kilometers have been dredged. The dredging of Heping Rivers in the Third and Fourth Districts will be completed before the end of July.

### The "Air Hostesses" Active on China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Planes

‚Äî Our Reporter, Mai Tian

Inside the airplane, having a young, beautiful, and capable woman to attend to passengers, explaining the scenery along the way, etc., is still a very novel thing in China. We can't find a suitable name to call them yet, so let's temporarily call them "air hostesses."

The selection criteria for "air hostesses" are very strict: possessing both talent and beauty, and having conduct, demeanor, and work ethic that are sure to satisfy people, goes without saying. Just looking at their uniforms, one can call them "extremely beautiful." A brown woolen "jacket" and short skirt, paired with a brown leather belt, brown mid-heeled leather shoes, and a "jacket" without a collar. The right lapel is fastened to the left lapel with two gold buttons, and a silver airplane is embroidered below the right shoulder, with the CNAC logo embroidered beside the left sleeve. Such attire looks much more beautiful than the uniforms of American female soldiers.

The director responsible for the training class is Ji Lai. He adopts American methods to train the Chinese ladies. Applicants must undergo physical examinations, intelligence tests, and be able to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. The coursework after admission is also quite laborious. The training period is set at two months, during which they must study aviation history, the history, organization, and routes of CNAC, Chinese geography, customs and immigration regulations, learn first aid, service regulations, and become familiar with the aircraft's equipment structure and application methods. They will also be taken to the repair shop and various departments of Longhua Airport for on-site instruction.

A total of forty ladies are planned to be recruited this time. The first batch of trained personnel will serve on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Nine are trained well, and they have already flown six times. Afterwards, they will have to fly eighty to one hundred hours per month. The first qualified "air hostess" is Miss He Beidai, who has already started demonstrating her work on the plane to Chongqing last Tuesday.

Another very important condition for "air hostesses" is that they must be unmarried ladies under the age of twenty-six. After the age of twenty-six, they can no longer fly and must be transferred to a ground position.

"Air hostesses" will not only become active in the air, bringing passengers a lot of convenience, but also develop a new career for China. (The picture shows Miss He at work)

### Instigating Labor Unrest and Disturbing Elements, Authorities Determined to Punish Severely

According to a senior officer of a certain military organization in this city responsible for maintaining public order, the frequent labor unrest in this city is indeed caused by high prices and the difficult lives of workers. However, it is also not uncommon for disturbing elements to attempt to manipulate the situation and disrupt social order. It is reported that Song Runde, Lu Zhifang, Zhu Yaozhong, and others, workers of the Hu'an Woolen Mill in Shanghai, repeatedly caused trouble during the labor unrest at the factory last month. Now that they see their plans have not been realized, they have absconded and are hiding. It is hoped that they can quickly repent, and they will be exempted from legal action. In the future, those who instigate labor unrest and disrupt social order will be severely punished.

### Trans-Pacific Southern Route Air Service to Resume Next Month

[Reported by this Newspaper] According to a wireless telegraph from the New York edition received by the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" yesterday, Pan American Airlines will resume its pre-war trans-Pacific southern route air service on May 15th. However, Mr. Yingte, the company's representative in China, has not yet received formal notification. Currently, all relevant parties in this city hope that the company will utilize the northern route previously flown by the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (UNRRA)-chartered Constellation aircraft when resuming the route. It is estimated that the northern route is 2,900 miles shorter than the southern route. Recently, the volume of airmail to the United States has piled up in the city, and delivery is slow. The resumption of the trans-Pacific air service should be able to alleviate this difficulty.

### Rice Prices Rise Despite Government Rice Loan Program; Procurement Procedures Worth Considering

[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the rice loan program was approved by the authorities, the source of rice has gradually become smoother, and market prices should gradually stabilize. Unexpectedly, it soared by three to four thousand yuan the day before yesterday, and rose by another one to two thousand yuan yesterday morning, which was quite unexpected by the general public. According to industry insiders, this is because each producing area believes it can hoard the goods for high prices, resulting in price hikes, which in turn affects the market price in this port. However, some people also say that some merchants are scrambling to purchase them near the river in this port. Seventeen merchants have been approved to apply for rice loans. It is reported that the collateral is limited to title deeds and bank guarantees, which are not easy for most merchants to borrow. They are currently petitioning for a change. In addition, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association is still requesting the authorities to provide unrestricted loans in order to achieve universal benefits and expand sources.

The rice market opened again with a rise of one to two thousand yuan yesterday morning. At noon, due to indigestion, it fell by more than a thousand yuan. Compared with yesterday, it was slightly higher by three to five hundred yuan. Flour from the Shanghai-Songjiang group was still acceptable, and the price continued to rise by one to two hundred yuan. Soybeans also increased by three to five hundred yuan. Soybean cakes were strong in the morning and slack in the afternoon, and the price was flat. Raw peanuts were stable, sesame was firm, bran was strong, corn was firm, and red sorghum was sluggish and remained downstream. Oil prices remained sluggish due to continuous arrivals, and fell again by a thousand yuan. Grain prices will temporarily depend on the rise and fall of producing areas.

According to news from the grain administration authorities, the recent fluctuations in rice prices in the city are purely speculation by speculators. Currently, there is a large stock of rice in Shanghai, and foreign rice will soon be imported in a steady stream, so there should be no shortage of food. In the future, if it is discovered that illegal grain merchants are inciting the market, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law after investigation, and the police authorities have been consulted to assist in monitoring. According to rice industry news, a large amount of rice will be transported to this area this week, approximately 20,000 shi or more. Part of this rice is purchased by rice merchants, and part is purchased by the grain administration authorities.

### American Dollar Buying Sentiment Still Strong, Gold Prices Calm

The red market was stable yesterday. Holders still closed their positions at high prices. American dollars were firm, and there was a lot of arbitrage in the gold market. The market was also relatively tight due to the tight situation, so demand and supply were balanced, and the process was mostly sideways. The morning opening was stable, and after opening, it once strengthened, hovering around 1.56 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged. However, the high price could not be sustained for long, and more and more stocks were successively launched, gradually declining. In the morning, it fell back to 1.53 million. In the early afternoon, it was slightly sluggish, falling back to 1.52 million. In the end, it was still flat, and the result was a slight increase of 10,000 compared with the previous close. Silver jewelry was 168,000, silver ingot was 1,600, and silver dollar was 1,050 yuan for sale. The implicit interest rate on silver was even higher. The daily interest rate among industry members was only 12 to 14%, and the long-term interest rate was 15 to 16%.

Foreign exchange banks still had inflows of US dollars. Industry members did not have much stock and it was not easy to collect. From the initial 2,050 yuan in the morning, it gradually rose to 2,100 yuan. Afterwards, the gold market was slightly sluggish, and the upward momentum was blocked. At noon, it was around 2,080 yuan, and the arbitrage spread was reduced to 740 yuan per ten taels. The afternoon situation remained stable, and the result was a continued increase of 30 yuan compared with the previous close. Hong Kong bills were slightly stable, and the result was that old bills rose by 3 yuan and new bills rose by 5 yuan. The exchange rate between designated banks and the US dollar was 2,020 yuan, and the selling price rose slightly to 2,060 yuan. There were more settlements for yarn and flower, and Hong Kong electricity Robbie was still stable.

### Government Bonds Listless on the Black Market, Chinese Stocks Continue to Decline Slightly; Foreign Stocks Closed for Spring Holiday

After the police intervened the day before yesterday, government bonds were slightly more restrained yesterday and there was not much activity. Only the Unified B bonds had some guerrilla-style black market transfers, with market prices around 5,500 yuan. Miscellaneous brands were silent. Chinese stocks continued to decline slightly, and they were always under selling pressure after the morning opening. However, the process was extremely mediocre. The lowest prices in the morning were 4,800 yuan for Yongsha, 4,000 yuan for Meiya, and 408 yuan for Jingfu. The noon closing was slightly stable. Although the second-hottest Xinguang and Qinxing were sluggish in the middle, the situation was reversed at noon, and the results were pulled up. As a result, the three hottest Yongsha, Meiya, and Jingfu saw slight declines compared with the previous close. Xinguang and Qinxing rose and fell only slightly. Sino-French, New Asia, and Underwear were stable. The rest all fell. The veteran stocks were flat. In the afternoon, Yongsha rose slightly to 4,900 yuan, Meiya to 4,120 yuan, and Jingfu to above 420 yuan. Transactions were limited. Due to the Western Qingming Festival, foreign stocks still followed the old practice and seemed to be closed for three days for spring. There were no formal public transactions on the market yesterday. Due to some transfers by holders, the prices quoted in the off-site black market fell slightly compared with the previous close.

### Yarn Market Firm, Spot Cotton Transactions Quite Active

The yarn market was very stable yesterday. High-grade 20-count yarns, such as Shuangma brand, made little progress due to the sluggish appetite of the Cantonese group. Small 20-count yarns were quite popular among customers from Jing and Wu, so the price increased by 10,000. Overall, the spot supply of 20-count yarns from various factories is still insufficient, so the market is quite firm and does not seem to be easy to fall sharply for a while. The Textile Construction Company opened sales of 30 kinds of cotton cloth yesterday, including 17 kinds of American and Mexican cloth. As usual, cotton yarn will be sold today.

New York American cotton futures fell by 7 to 16 points yesterday, with the near-term at US$27.44 and the long-term at US$27.55. The spot price of middling was US$28.03. The spot market conditions in this port were still flat, but transactions turned better again. The reason is that the yarn mills taken over by the Textile Construction Company from Japanese merchants urgently need raw materials, so they suddenly made a huge purchase of 2,600 to 2,700 bales of middling, Pengjiapo, and Brazilian cotton. In addition, private yarn mills and industry members are all watching and have not taken action.

### China Textile American Cotton Shipped to Tianjin

The Taikoo Company's Hanyang wheel loaded more than 7,000 pieces of American cotton in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and exported them to Tanggu. It is said that the cotton belongs to the China Textile Company and was reported by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### Sugar Prices Mixed at Auction

Yesterday was another auction for sugar, with mixed price increases and decreases. Three thousand bags of China sand white were priced at 44,000 yuan, up 1,000 yuan, and were sold completely. Four and a half military white, hemp bag package, was priced at 78,000 yuan, Guang package was priced at 76,000 yuan, and three and a half car white was priced at 58,000 yuan, all with transactions, but not sold completely. One thousand bags of raw sand were still priced at 42,000 yuan. The mid-sand plate was 44,750 yuan to 45,000 yuan in the morning, and 46,000 yuan in the afternoon. Another 46,700 yuan was sold in the North City. The numbered plate opened at 43,000 yuan for green sugar, and 40,000 yuan for oil package without tax bill.

### Aged Tea Still Shows No Improvement

Transactions of aged red silk tea still have no improvement, especially Qimen tea. High-grade goods lack a suitable owner, and medium-grade goods have dropped to 80,000 yuan, but the sluggishness is still strong. As for the new Longjing tea, customers are reluctant to sell easily, and the market price has not fallen.

### American Caustic Soda Orders Can Only Be Shipped in August

Yesterday, the price of caustic soda fell slightly due to some retail sales. The monthly brand was 360,000 per barrel, and the American goods were 290,000 yuan per barrel. Other Vaseline was 700 yuan per pound, white wax was 215,000 yuan, pure alkali was 55,000 yuan per bag, baking soda was 45,000 yuan per bag, white oil was 500 yuan per pound, and triangular glycerin was 295,000 yuan. Three thousand barrels of American caustic soda have been transferred from Manila, but that place has restricted exports, and all exports must be licensed. According to a telegram received by a certain foreign firm yesterday from the New York National Chemical Plant, direct shipment from the United States will not be possible until August of this year.

### New York Cotton Market Open as Usual During Spring Break

[Reuters, New York, 18th] The markets in London, the United States, and Canada will be closed on April 19th. The London market will continue to be closed on Saturday, April 20th.

### Mosquito Nets Cannot Be Exported Due to High Prices

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Regarding the difficulties of the import and export industries, according to Wang Shiyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Import and Export Trade Association, export taxes are currently paid in accordance with the export tariff published in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934]. The tax standards are two levels of 5% and 7.5%, and another city surcharge is paid. All of them are calculated according to the average wholesale market price at the time of export, in accordance with the prescribed tax system. Export goods that have hope in overseas markets, such as pig bristles, tung oil, raw and cooked hides, eggs, soybeans, and kernels, must be taxed. These items were exempted from tax during the war due to exchange settlement reasons. Now that the government has abolished the official exchange rate, the tax exemption provisions for the original exchange settlement items have been declared invalid. In the two months after the opening of the foreign exchange market, due to the skyrocketing prices, the cost of production, purchase, and transportation of export goods, converted at the current exchange rate, has mostly been above the market price in foreign countries. Tung oil is about 10% higher, casings are about 30% higher, cow and sheep hides are one times higher, silkworm silk is 10% higher, and the price of tea and eggs is also only higher and not lower. Exporters are unable to operate exports. If the government does not take measures to encourage them, the export business will face the danger of complete stagnation.

### Ministry of Education to Cease Receiving and Sending Official Documents in Chongqing from May 1st; Some Staff to Remain in the Provisional Capital to Assist with Educational Recovery

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua recently came to Nanjing and has been busy with official duties for days. When this reporter visited him, he informed us of the recovery situation of the Ministry of Education, the main points of which are as follows: At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War's victory, the Ministry of Education did not move entirely to Nanjing. In order to facilitate the contact of educational affairs in the adjacent provinces and cities, official documents from Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi and the two cities of Jing (Nanjing) and Shanghai were directly handled by the Ministry in Nanjing. The rest were handled in Chongqing. Now that the Ministry of Education has made preparations to move entirely to Nanjing, it has been decided that from May 1st, all official documents from all provinces and cities across the country should be submitted to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing for handling, and Chongqing will not issue separate documents externally. However, due to transportation issues, whether the documents and archives can be transported to Nanjing as scheduled is still a problem. Some staff will remain in the provisional capital to assist the schools and educational institutions in relocating and recovering. Although the transportation industry has given special assistance to the education sector by providing one-third of the seats on ships and planes, there are many people returning to the capital, and the number of ship and plane seats is limited, so it is feared that the schools and educational institutions will have to wait until autumn and winter to be completely moved away.

### Minister of Education, Minister Zhu, Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai This Morning

### Educational Representative to the National Assembly, Jiang Jianbai, Returns Home

Having been ordered to be stationed in Burma and India during the war, he recently investigated education in the United States.

[United China News Agency Dispatch] Mr. Jiang Jianbai, an educational representative to the National Assembly, returned from the United States to attend the Assembly after receiving a telegram. He arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday. Before the War of Resistance, Mr. Jiang assisted Mr. Pan Gongzhan in Shanghai, presiding over educational administration, and achieved notable political accomplishments. After the outbreak of the war, he was appointed by the Ministry of Education as a special commissioner stationed in Shanghai. Under the strong pressure of the enemy and puppets, he maintained the lifeline of education, a feat of great merit. In the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], the enemy and puppets tightened their control, forcing him to go to Chongqing. He was ordered to go to the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou to inspect education and culture, and to dedicate himself to the supervision and promotion of wartime education and culture in those provinces. He convened educational conferences in various provinces, laying the foundation for wartime education.

Stationed in Burma

In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he was again ordered by the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to serve as an educational commissioner stationed in Burma. In addition to supervising overseas Chinese education, he also engaged in the organization and liaison work of overseas Chinese. In the winter of that year, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, initiating the Pacific War, and then invaded Burma. Mr. Jiang, amidst the raging flames of war, launched and organized the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief Association with Mr. Zeng Yangfu, Mr. Wang Junsheng, and others. On the one hand, they provided relief to overseas Chinese during wartime, and on the other hand, they organized and trained overseas Chinese to assist in the war effort. Later, he guided and organized the Burma Anti-Japanese Association, in which overseas Chinese and the highest administrative authorities in Burma participated, greatly contributing to the advancement of the war effort. Later, the Japanese army raided Mandalay, and Mr. Jiang was surrounded. He personally braved the arrows and led Burmese dignitaries to return to Chongqing after many twists and turns, barely escaping with his life. He received commendation and consolation from the central government.

Stationed in India

After returning to China from Burma, in the summer of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], he was again ordered to be stationed in India as a special commissioner, and also as a representative of the Ministry of Education in India, guiding Indian education and culture, and handling matters related to Sino-Indian cultural communication. He devoted much effort to the rectification of local overseas Chinese education and the improvement of school facilities. He also personally founded the Overseas Chinese Indian Middle School, the first overseas Chinese middle school in India, thereby deeply winning the love of the overseas Chinese.

Stationed in the United States

After two years stationed in India, in the summer of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he was transferred to the United States to inspect overseas Chinese education in the United States and to investigate American education. During his two years in the United States, he traveled to all the major cities and rural areas of the United States, conducting precise and in-depth investigations into the past facilities and future trends of American education. He devoted much effort to Sino-American cultural cooperation. He obtained the assistance of the Chicago Board of Education, which allocated more than 30 acres of land worth 800,000 US dollars in an area where overseas Chinese were concentrated, to build sports fields and various houses as a center for overseas Chinese education, culture, and health activities, which was a pioneering initiative by Americans to assist overseas Chinese. In addition, he made many contributions to publicizing the achievements of the motherland's war of resistance and promoting American aid to China. He gave more than a hundred public speeches, and devoted himself to the supervision of overseas Chinese education and the strengthening of overseas Chinese feelings.

Returning Home

During his spare time, Mr. Jiang also studied education administration and vocational education at the Teachers College of Columbia University, so that his 30 years of practical experience in education could be integrated with the latest educational theories, and his research results were very rich. As the opening of the National Assembly was approaching, he received a telegram to return home quickly and will attend the Assembly as an educational representative. The reporter visited Mr. Jiang at his residence yesterday. He said that he will stay in Shanghai for a week and then go to Nanjing to report to the National Assembly and report to the Ministry of Education.

### Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament Opens: Dahua Defeats Haiying Team, Donghua Forfeits to Encas

The inaugural Mayor's Cup Basketball Tournament for the men's group opened at the City Gymnasium at 6:45 pm yesterday, with enthusiastic atmosphere. There were two preliminary matches yesterday. In the first match, Dahua played against Haiying. Dahua's Yang Yuanlong and Zhang Shaoqing made contributions, leading by four points to zero. Haiying was unwilling to be outdone, creating a seesaw situation, and the battle was tense. At the end of the first half, Dahua led by only 26 to 23. After the break, Haiying was able to support itself at first, but after 25 to 31, Dahua broke free, and Yang Yuanlong scored repeatedly. In the end, Dahua eliminated Haiying with 59 to 42, achieving a successful start.

### A Visit to Chengzhong

---

Tangshan Road in Shanghai, which has been silent for eight years, now has the sound of bells ringing on time again, because Chengzhong Middle School, founded by Mr. Ye Chengzhong, has reopened.

Chengzhong had already been famous in society in the past, with a glorious history, but after the baptism of the "August 13th" artillery fire, a large number of books, instruments, and other educational equipment were completely destroyed by the enemy. Principal Wu Cuilun borrowed the school building of Xinhuan Middle School on Chongqing Road to hold classes temporarily. After five months, it moved to the Tongyi Building on Beijing Road; the scale was roughly formed, and the number of students increased sharply. Principal Wu also died of overwork in the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. In the winter of that year, the enemy was rampant, the isolated island fell, and Wang Zhengong Guangsheng was appointed by the board of directors to succeed Chengzhong, firmly holding his position and standing out from the crowd. The faculty and staff worked hard, persevered, and always showed the spirit of Chengzhong.

The rivers and mountains were restored, and the sun and moon were bright again. In the old school on Tangshan Road, only ruined walls and broken walls, thorns and weeds were seen everywhere. After planning and fundraising by Principal Wang and the directors, they worked hard to carry out the project, and finally repaired 38 houses within a month, so that the middle school department could resume classes first. The reporter went to visit the other day and happened to be there after class in the afternoon. Upon entering the school gate, I saw many young people, carrying hoes and baskets, leveling the playground with sweat on their faces, very diligent. Shimei Hall in the northeast corner of the yard was scarred and badly dilapidated. Behind it, Huaide Hall had only an incomplete facade left. On the front of the school gate, the bronze statue of Mr. Ye Chengzhong still stood majestically. Behind the statue, the clock donated by this newspaper, engraved with "Time is Gold," was only a broken cement pillar. Mengmo Hall was being repaired, and the library was already open. Many students were studying on their own, and the atmosphere of reading was very strong. Even the students scattered around were lively and polite, without the frivolous habits of Shanghai youth in general. Chengtang on the east side was originally a gymnasium, but two beams had been broken. The toilet at the very back was very neat and clean, but in front of the kitchen on the east side was still a desolate scene!

The day before yesterday was the 45th anniversary of the founding of Chengzhong. However, the school site, which covers a vast area of 40 to 50 acres, had only a few buildings left after eight years of long-term destruction! The Wuxun School in Tangyi has been restored with the efforts and assistance of the Shandong Provincial Government. The Shanghai authorities will surely be able to appreciate the state's intention to encourage the establishment of schools and actively provide assistance. But the alumni of Chengzhong should work harder to bring glory to their alma mater and apply Chengzhong's past spirit of perseverance to the restoration and construction of the alma mater!

### Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese

‚Äî April 12th Shipping News, Our Taipei Correspondent, Evening

The reporter has been in Taiwan Province for a full month, with footprints all over Taipei, Taichung, and other places. What has been contacted is not only mainland and local intellectuals, gentry, youth, and merchants, but people from all walks of life. During this time, what is hidden in everyone's heart and uttered from their mouths is the same argument. This argument is based on the reality of the backwardness or even regression during the transitional period of pretense.

Generally speaking, there is a great gap between the people of Taiwan and the people of the mainland. Bluntly speaking, it is antipathy. What is expressed on paper is a kind of Taiwanese-style writing close to scolding and satire. What is expressed in action is primitive and crude behavior. The reason for using "Taiwanese-style" is that they all use Japanese-style writing that is similar to but not fully understandable, and the methods of the invading protector, to express their inner pleas and curses. They have stirred up waves of antipathy among the people of Taiwan, but on the other hand, we see their enthusiasm for the rapid construction of Taiwan Province. We cannot but believe that this serious reality will cause some bad consequences in the future, but we cannot but firmly believe that the surge of this undercurrent will become the main obstacle to the government's policies.

Antipathy, Discrimination, Resistance

Just like the situation in Shanghai, there is also a conflict between Taiwanese and mainlanders here. In terms of time, the Taiwanese have been under the oppression of the Japanese for 51 years. They have no human rights to protect, and are restricted everywhere. After the victory, they were suddenly liberated. In terms of space, they have not smelled the air of freedom and democracy, and they have not understood the reality of China's war of resistance, and have been blinded by the Japanese's "Greater East Asia" propaganda policy. Young people under the age of 40 have not had in-depth and extensive contact with the people of the country. Upon being suddenly liberated, on the one hand, they gained freedom, and on the other hand, they showed licentiousness; and due to a lack of understanding of the country, on the one hand, they had a lingering fondness for the Japanese, and on the other hand, they felt antipathy due to the imperfect reality. We cannot say that this phenomenon is not abnormal; on the contrary, it may be the inevitable state of affairs?

Because of licentiousness, mainlanders find it unpleasant; due to antipathy, discrimination and jealousy arise. The result is poor public security, slow progress in work, and rapid changes in social customs. This is a terrible phenomenon. On the whole, it is much more serious than the conflict between Shanghainese and Chongqingese.

Errors in Concepts

In terms of concepts, both Taiwanese and mainlanders have made mistakes. Soldiers, large and small civil servants, and leaking merchants and boatmen who came to Taiwan from Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Chongqing seem to have the mentality of conquerors. They think that the war of resistance liberated them, so they might as well adopt a high-pressure and biased attitude, giving mainlanders preferential treatment and spiritual comfort. Some even have the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgetting rich and digging gold mines. They say, we crossed the ocean, betting our lives on it, isn't it for fame and fortune? In the "enslaved" Taiwan, after the Japanese left, isn't it our world?

The Taiwanese have a psychological feeling that the mainland guests are grabbing territory and stealing jobs. They believe that the Taiwanese people's resistance against the Japanese has always been working hard, and even during the war of resistance, they did their best and shed a lot of blood and sweat. After the restoration, it should be returned to the Taiwanese people, cultivated and planted by the Taiwanese people themselves, and the mainlanders should not be allowed to "sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor." Even the war of resistance was only the assistance of the Allied American, and did not belong to the Chinese military and civilians. (According to a report by a mainland colonel.) They emphasize that "Taiwan has not been enslaved" (editorial in Taiwan Minbao). During the era when the Japanese ruled with a colonial policy, they superficially touted the Japanese "equal treatment," but from the beginning, they formulated the "Article 63 Act," giving the governor-general special powers to oppress the Taiwanese. However, the Taiwanese still did not submit to force, publishing publications to criticize and argue, and even forming groups and clashing with Japanese police officers many times, which lasted for decades. They even expressed opposition to the meaning of "exploitation," saying that the Japanese colonial lack of self-reliance in economic policies was not entirely "exploitation." (Quote from a Taiwanese gentry.)

Manifestations in Actions

In terms of actions, the fact that the mainlanders could not be as satisfactory as expected was also a major factor in fostering resentment. The control and blockade policies that could not be implemented smoothly made the Taiwanese, who had been living a relatively low life in the past, not only lack allocations, but also increased the heavy burden of high prices, especially rice. In the Taichung Plain, a rice-producing area, the high price of rice caused small families who make their living from rice farming unstable and thus lead to accidents. Even in Taipei, there were unfortunate incidents between the military and civilians due to the purchase of military grain, and fertilizers that could be allocated in the past could not be supplied due to transportation. The factories, mines, schools, and banks that were taken over were all in a state of long-term stagnation. The seizure of general Japanese properties and enemy properties often showed confusion, lack of planning, and lack of steps. The efficiency of administrative work could not be expressed remarkably and nimbly. In addition, there were layer upon layer of bribery cases, such as the shooting incident in Kaohsiung, where the military police interfered with people watching free movies, and the bribery of NT$100,000 by the Jiaoyi Branch Director Zhou Bizhang, and the issuance of Japanese return certificates at NT$50,000 per certificate by a section chief in Yilan City. These chaotic phenomena during the transitional period directly and indirectly gave the Taiwanese people mental and material feelings, making them unable to tolerate, unable to accept, and unable to continue to sustain. We have no evidence to determine whether the Japanese are plotting behind the scenes, but the authorities have discovered that they have organized illegal disruptive actions in the failure to ensure public security and the prevalence of theft.

In terms of living habits and thoughts and actions, the mainlanders do not seem to be able to get used to the Taiwanese. In general, they have a stronger and more exposed island mentality than the Japanese. They are narrow-minded, unwilling to socialize, unkempt in dress, and the women have rough feet and lack a sense of beauty. They do not know how to spend money and love to be beautiful like those from the mainland. There is little contact with mainlanders, and they cannot use language to express themselves. These barriers often lead to misunderstandings. The mainlanders said: They love the Japanese's perseverance and hard work, and the Japanese women's gentleness and politeness, but they do not love the Taiwanese.

Necessary Psychological Construction

Due to the antipathy between the Taiwanese and mainlanders, some of it has turned into ill-will. The Taiwanese have one thing in common towards the mainlanders: if there is dissatisfaction, they will gather evidence to attack you. This primitive way of fighting is, on the other hand, knife killings and shootings. There are still not many mainlanders who have been sent to Tainan who can bravely go to the countryside. In Taipei, where the mainlanders are concentrated, the situation is much better, but it is still scary to have Taiwanese go to the countryside to collect taxes and herd livestock. This phenomenon caused by discrimination is only temporary and transitional, but we cannot ignore its impact. What is expected of the current authorities is to strengthen psychological construction while building political and material structures. It is difficult to expect improvement if you hold an irresponsible attitude, twist the concepts, and deal with Taiwan's political affairs. It is more necessary for the Taiwanese to do self-construction and carry forward the inherent spirit and one virtue of the Chinese nation. We all need to be responsible, calm, and not be harsh on blaming others, or demanding performance.

Chief Chen instructed his subordinates: "People are very resilient. As long as we work hard, we will have good results. Otherwise, not only will our enemies laugh at us, but our allies will also look down on us!" I firmly believe that Chief Chen and his subordinates will definitely have good performance, and will be able to win the hearts of the six million people in Taiwan!

The small Japanese warships in Wu Port have been blown up by the Allied forces stationed in Japan, with the aim of completely eliminating the remaining combat power of the stubborn enemy.

This is the highest administrative body of Taiwan Province, the Chief Executive Office. Chief Chen Yi, who advocates "No sentries are allowed except at the headquarters," works on the third floor. The Education Department, Secretariat, and Industrial and Mining Department are all together here. It controls the political, cultural, and economic lifelines of all counties and cities in the province. It is the base camp for building a new Taiwan.

The Governor-General's Office was the central hub for the Japanese to run Taiwan for 51 years. The Governor-General had to be appointed by the "Emperor." The towering and solemn building has been hit by a bullet in the waist, and the park opposite has also become a rubble field. The Governor-General's Office is temporarily used as a concentration camp for the Japanese people, and after all the Japanese people return to their country on the 10th of this month, it will be repaired and used as the location of the Chief Executive Office. The picture shows: Workers are clearing the rubble field, and people seem to be recalling the wild faces of the past Japanese rulers, but the tall and sharp pagoda shadows are welcoming new light.

### Soviet Union's New Five-Year Plan Focuses on Expanding Heavy Industry

Voznesensky, the design minister of the Soviet Union, instructed the Soviet people on what contributions they should make to the new five-year plan. Voznesensky said: "We must not forget that monopoly capitalism can produce new aggressors. To prevent new aggression, all aggressor countries must be completely disarmed and subjected to military economic control. A body must be set up in the United Nations to monitor international peace and security, and to maintain peace and prevent aggression. The Soviet Union's combat troops must be strengthened and continuously equipped with the latest modern weapons. The Soviet Union's military and economic potential must also be strengthened." Voznesensky further listed the Soviet Union's monthly goals as follows: First, restore the areas destroyed by artillery fire, so that industry and agriculture can be restored to pre-war levels, and then greatly expand them. The new five-year plan focuses on restoring and expanding heavy industry. In order to make the annual steel production exceed 45 million tons, the Soviet Union plans to build 45 steel plants, 104 rolling mills, and large-scale new plants in Siberia and the Urals. Siberia and the eastern part will open iron mines. Most of the mining areas will be surveyed for mining. About 168.8 million tons of commercial iron sand can be obtained (100 million tons in western Siberia) and 110 million tons of manganese sand. Copper production is expected to increase by 1.6 times, aluminum production by 1 times, tin production by 1.9 times, lead production by 2.6 times, zinc production by 2.5 times, tungsten production by 4.4 times, molybdenum production by 2.1 times, and tin production by 2.7 times. Coal production is planned to increase by 51% compared with the pre-war level. The virgin coal mines in the Vilyuy and Chita areas of the Far East will be mined, and 183 million tons can be obtained. In addition, coal gas will be produced on a large scale, and oil refining will be carried out in the Far East, Sakhalin, and other places, so that the industrial development of the Far East can catch up with the south. The Soviet Union expects that by 1950, the commercial oil reserves will be enough for two or three years. At the same time, it also focuses on increasing the production of high-octane gasoline. By the end of 1950, it can build 4 oil refineries and 10 major oil refining facilities. Large hydroelectric power plants will be restored and 30 new ones will be completed. The first part of another eight plants has already started, and five major new plants have started construction. The amount of machine manufacturing will also be doubled in 1950. In that year, 500,000 motorized vehicles can be produced. The production of synthetic rubber has doubled, car tires have increased three times, and rubber soles have also increased by 1.3 times. By the time the new five-year plan is completed, synthetic rubber will account for 38% of the total. In housing construction, attention is paid to workers' housing, with 4 million square meters of construction each year. (United News Agency, Moscow, 16th)

### "Love" and "Beauty"

‚Äî Song Shoulu

The two nouns, "love" and "beauty," are understood and also most pleasant to everyone. There is no one who does not know love, and no one who does not like beauty; this psychological phenomenon of love and the ability to appreciate beauty, I dare say, are commonly possessed by everyone. In terms of function, there is a certain connection between the two, which leads to misunderstandings among many people, who believe that whatever is lovable must also be beautiful, and whatever is beautiful must also be able to inspire love. But that is not the case; love and beauty seem similar, but there is a significant difference.

According to aesthetics and psychology, love originates from taste, while beauty is based on aesthetic sense. If we want to love someone or something, we must first have a sense of beauty about that person or thing, and then we will feel taste and be aroused to love. Beauty exists in the appearance of objects, while love originates from our inner hearts. However, beauty is sometimes not expressed outwardly but is hidden inwardly, such as knowledge, talent, character, etc. Such beauty cannot be discovered until it is expressed. Therefore, love is more subjective and belongs to the individual, while beauty is more objective and belongs to the general public. The two cannot be confused. To distinguish between love and beauty, we can define it as follows: beauty is not entirely love; love is not entirely beauty. But some of beauty can be said to be love; some of love can also be beauty. Beauty often arouses people's love, and love is often caused by beauty.

For example, with the so-called "beauty," the evaluation of this beauty varies entirely according to each person's aesthetic sense. A beauty is not necessarily loved by everyone, and an unattractive person may be loved by people. People also know that this person is beautiful but do not love them, and some know that this person is not beautiful but love them instead. As the saying goes, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," which is the principle. Therefore, beauty can certainly arouse love, but it is also possible to feel that something is more beautiful because of love.

If we further discuss whether love or beauty is right or wrong, since people have different tastes for aesthetics, then we cannot criticize whose love is right and whose love is wrong, or what someone loves is beautiful and what someone loves is not beautiful.

For example, some people like to watch Peking opera, some like to watch spoken drama, and some like to watch movies. These different forms of entertainment each have their own unique appeal; we can never say which entertainment is appropriate and which is inappropriate, or which entertainment is beautiful and which is not. Also, some like to listen to Western music, and some like to listen to Chinese music. Those who like to listen to Western music cannot arbitrarily judge Chinese music as not beautiful and their love as appropriate, and those who like to listen to Chinese music cannot, because of their dislike of Western music, conclude that Western music is not beautiful.

To summarize the above, we can use two sentences to draw a conclusion: beauty differs according to each person's aesthetic sense, and love is aroused by taste. Xu Weinan

### Beautiful Paintings and Calligraphy by Wang Yachen

‚Äî Xu Weinan

There was once a joke that nowadays, when Chinese painters go abroad, they paint Chinese paintings; when they return to their country, they paint Western paintings. Because foreigners do not understand Chinese paintings, and Chinese people do not understand Western paintings, no matter where they are, everyone says they paint well.

However, Mr. Wang Yachen of the Chinese Painting Exhibition does not follow the joke mentioned above. In France, he copied and studied Western masterpieces from various eras. After returning to China, he abandoned canvas and studied Chinese painting more deeply. What he exhibits in China, nine out of ten times, are domestic paintings, especially his goldfish, which are loved by the general public. There must be a reason why domestically produced paintings that everyone recognizes can be created to be loved by everyone. For example, in Mr. Wang's paintings of fish, he did indeed study the living habits of fish for a long time in the Wuxi area.

Chinese characters originally were pictographic, in other words, they were drawings, hence the saying that calligraphy and painting have the same origin. Even now, I believe that the reason why Chinese writing has become an art form is because writing is equivalent to drawing a picture. When we write, we are drawing portraits of the characters in the dictionary. Moreover, our painting emphasizes spiritual likeness rather than physical likeness, so cursive script is more valued than regular script. However, this drawing task of writing is more difficult to express than drawing flowers and figures. Because writing is just the coordination of lines, and it is only a movement of one color, it is really not easy to write well, making people feel skilled and not oily, feel lively and not rigid. Knowledgeable people in our country often say that once you write well, it is easier to learn to paint. This is indeed true. Because Chinese painting is based on lines, writing is the basic practice of Chinese painting, just as charcoal drawing is the basic practice of Western painting.

Mr. Wang's calligraphy also has its own characteristics, just like his paintings. Now his calligraphy and paintings are displayed together. If we want to know how he paints, we can verify it with his calligraphy, and nothing will be able to hide.

### A Pair Flying Together (28)

‚Äî Zhao Qingge

Master Mo has no worries now, he understands that his life is like a candle in the wind, nearing its end! Therefore, he can quietly endure the torment of illness, and he is waiting for an eternal and transcendent rest!

Since being beaten that night, Madam Mo had planned to retaliate the next day, using all her strength to return the favor to Master Mo, but Master Mo's illness prevented her from fulfilling her resolution. Therefore, she has been deeply aggrieved! She even hoped that Master Mo would get well soon, so that she could have a serious fight with him, in order to vent her anger. In short, she had no intention of pitying Master Mo, let alone caring for him. Because of the damage to her self-esteem, she had not gone to see Second Madam Weng for a long time. At the same time, her anger had not subsided, so she often vented it on the children!

Now, Madam Mo overprotects Master Mo because of Lihua, and she no longer likes her very much. Every time she thinks of this, she is annoyed! Neither of the two children she gave birth to is on her side. Therefore, she transferred her affection to Liyun. The children did not know jealousy about this, and Lihua was happy instead, because with Liyun accompanying Madam Mo, she could have more time to serve Master Mo. At the same time, Second Madam Weng had a new interest and gradually became distant from Madam Mo, which was also a source of complaint for Madam Mo.

Liyun was almost at the Mo's house every day. In fact, she was not there for Madam Mo, but for Lihua. Her friendship with Lihua almost surpassed the friendship between Madam Mo and Second Madam Weng. Although she was very wild, she listened to Lihua's words very much. Lihua taught her to be good; taught her to read; so she loved Lihua and respected her. Lihua occupied a very important position in her little heart, and the impression her father and mother gave her was very indifferent, neither yes nor no, but she could not live without Lihua.

Suddenly, one day, Liyun arrived at the Mo's house crying with a letter in her hand. Madam Mo and Lihua were both surprised, thinking that Second Madam Weng had beaten her, or that she had caused some trouble, so Madam Mo quickly asked her:

"What's making you so sad? Xiaoyun! Who bullied you? Tell me, and I'll help you get even."

Zhang Ruisheng asks: I am thirty-three years old and have suffered from lung disease for two years. I have been getting pneumothorax for half a year. My chills and fever have decreased, but my appetite has decreased recently. I have had diarrhea often for the past year, and my lower right abdomen hurts when I press it with my hand, which has been going on for two years. Are these symptoms caused by lung bacteria entering the gastrointestinal tract? If so, what medicine can cure it? Is it effective to use penicillin? Please advise. Dr. Yu Xinen answers: It has become intestinal tuberculosis. Penicillin is ineffective.

Please tell me: (1) What is the name of the disease? (2) What medicine is effective and how much should I take? (3) What are the daily care methods for this disease?

Dr. Yu Xinen answers: A detailed examination, such as blood, stool, bile, etc., is needed first to determine the location of the disease, and then the right medicine can be prescribed. Letian asks: I don't know what fistula is. It looks like a needlepoint, very thin, but my pants always have yellow pus seeping out. I don't know how many doctors I've seen and how much bitter medicine I've taken, but it's never gotten better. Please advise me.

Dr. Yu Xinen answers: The disease is called anal fistula and there is no specific medicine. It can be treated surgically.

### A Widow's Hope for Her Son's Return

‚Äî Xinyu

My neighbor, the lonely widow, Old Mrs. Ma, originally from Baoshan, is kind and virtuous, and taught her son the way of righteousness, which is praised by everyone. Her only son, Ma Xiaojun, courtesy name Zemin, received training at the Shanghai Military Training Headquarters before August 13th. With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he withdrew with the team. Before leaving, his mother followed the example of Yue Fei's mother, tattooed the words "Loyalty and Bravery" on his arm, and tearfully sent him off to Wenzhou. In the early years, there was news from home, and she learned that he had been reassigned to political propaganda work, moving around Anhui and Jiangxi. In the winter of the 30th year, the last letter came from Yichun, claiming that he had made contributions to the Republic of China and had not failed his mother's teachings. At that time, letters from occupied areas were subject to enemy and puppet inspection, so the words were unclear. Afterwards, there was no news at all. I have heard that it has been more than half a year since the victory and restoration. The elderly mother leans on the door, hoping for her son's return, inquiring everywhere, but there is no news. His life or death is uncertain, and how can this situation be endured? Therefore, her nerves are disordered, and she mumbles all day long, declaring in public that his death on the battlefield was long expected, but she wants a real and definite news about his life or death, otherwise she will have nothing to say to her ancestors underground, which is painful to hear. Even if Mr. Ma's life and death are known, comforting the bereaved family is our responsibility after his death. We urgently hope that kind-hearted people will know his news and send a letter to Sun Qianyuan at 40 Yuelai Lane, Caishi Road, Shanghai, or publish it in the newspaper, which is not only the gratitude of Old Mrs. Ma alone.
