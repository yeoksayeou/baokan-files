### Military Trio Met Yesterday Morning: Regarding the Transgressions of the Communist Army Inside and Outside the Pass, Ma and Xu Personally Requested Zhou to Quickly Devise Measures to Stop Them

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The preliminary consultations of the Military Trio Conference have become concrete since General Xu Yongchang met with Zhou Enlai at Meiyuan New Village last night and directly exchanged opinions. However, the two sides still have some differences on the Northeast issue, the issue of cease-fire and military reorganization, and the issue of restoring transportation. They agreed to go to Marshall's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road this morning to discuss with Ambassador Marshall. Before 10 o'clock this morning, Xu and Zhou arrived at Ambassador Marshall's residence successively, and after discussing with Ambassador Marshall once, Ambassador Marshall then met with Xu and Zhou to formally exchange opinions on various difficult issues to be resolved. However, according to people in Ambassador Marshall's residence, although the representatives of the three parties in today's Military Trio Group meeting have met and discussed, it was not a formal meeting. It is reported that General Xu Yongchang paid a visit to the Chairman this afternoon, and it is also reported that Ma and Xu personally requested Zhou Enlai to quickly devise measures to stop the Communist army's transgressions inside and outside the pass, and restore the original situation before 12 noon on the 7th to avoid hindering negotiations. If this yields results, the Military Trio Conference may be held immediately. Shao Lizi returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] General Marshall first met with Mr. Zhou for half an hour today, and then went to the Chairman's residence to meet with the Chairman for two hours. The topic of the meeting was whether there are any supplementary plans or any methods for permanently resolving the issue after the expiration of the truce agreement on the 15th, but nothing was announced.

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] According to the opinions of most observers, the final success or failure of Special Envoy Marshall's mission in China will be decided within the next ten days. Most people familiar with China's national conditions and public sentiment say that if Ambassador Marshall's efforts for a permanent truce cannot produce reasonable hope before the expiration of the truce order on the 22nd of this month, he will return home. At the same time, many people also strongly stated that even if Ambassador Marshall cannot promote a rapid and lasting solution to China's internal affairs, the Chinese people unanimously recognize that Ambassador Marshall is the most appropriate mediator for the long-standing disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If Ambassador Marshall fails, it is definitely not due to his own fault or lack of ability, but purely because the problem is too confusing and difficult to solve. Generally speaking, among people who dare to say that there is still hope for the permanent peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, only about one in five people. Ambassador Marshall's tireless efforts prove that he himself does not hold such a view.

[Central News Agency, this city] Li Huang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and convened a party affairs meeting with the main personnel of the party in the afternoon. On the Civil League side, Shen Junru, Zhang Junmai, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, etc., reviewed the recent situation in the Northeast yesterday morning, and Zhang Junmai and Huang Yanpei sent a letter inviting Li Huang of the Youth Party to exchange opinions at Zhang's residence at 3 pm this afternoon, and Mo Dehui will also be invited to participate.

### Du Yuming Arrived in Changchun from Shenyang: Before Departure, He Notified the Communist Army to Withdraw from Lafa and Stop Attacking, Otherwise the CCP Should Bear All Responsibility

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] General Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, arrived in Changchun by special plane at 11:25 am on the 12th. After getting off the plane, he took a car directly to Chairman Liang's residence to rest. Commander Du declared: This visit to Changchun is to represent Chairman Chiang in comforting the people of the Northeast and to solicit the opinions of the elders of the Northeast in order to quickly achieve the purpose of pacifying the local area and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Du also said: Since the government took over the Northeast, this is his third visit to Changchun. If time permits, he will go to various places to comfort and inspect.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 11th] Cai Zonglian, the government representative of the Military Mediation Department, accompanied Rao Shushi, the CCP representative of the Changchun Executive Division, to visit Commander Du on the 11th for about half an hour. After Commander Du received the order to stop pursuing and advancing in the Northeast, the military units had completely stopped advancing at 12 noon on the 7th. However, the Communist army took the opportunity to attack the National Army in various places, which seemed to be a planned action. In particular, near Lafa, the main force was concentrated to attack, causing a regiment of the National Army to suffer losses. He made a special request to Rao Shushi, hoping that he would immediately telegram the front to withdraw from Lafa and stop all attacks by noon on the 12th, otherwise, the CCP should be responsible for all unfortunate events caused by the accident. Rao said: The Northeast Truce Order was only read in the newspaper, and the CCP has not received a formal order. This truce order is a national consensus between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and senior CCP officials should not deny it.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Since the Communist army besieged the old and new stations of Lafa on the 7th, they have repeatedly increased their troops and cut off the rear of the National Army. As of the 10th, they have increased to 21 infantry regiments and 1 artillery regiment, launching a full-scale attack, and even using heavy artillery and mountain artillery to concentrate fire on Lafa, causing a major fire in the entire area and destroying all houses. The National Army adhered to the order, strictly observed good faith, and did not increase reinforcements or counterattack. However, the regiment of the National Army stationed there, confronted by an isolated army and a disparity in strength, was forced to withdraw to the Xiaogujiazi Mihua line. Regiment Commander Wei Yaodong was killed in action, and more than half of all officers and soldiers were killed or wounded.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Major General Zhou Liwu and more than a dozen other government personnel of the Military Mediation Changchun Branch departed from Beiping by special plane to Changchun at 7 am on the 12th. Currently, government and American personnel have gathered in Changchun one after another. After the personnel of the CCP arrive, they can start mediation work in Changchun.

[United Press, Beiping, 12th] Government and American representatives of the Military Mediation Executive Department today denied the CCP's claim that Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, had notified the Military Mediation Department that his troops had resumed the offensive and declared that the truce agreement on the 15th was invalid.

### Nanjing is Actively Preparing for the Election of Senators

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Nanjing is actively preparing for the election of senators. It is learned that the number of senators to be elected is stipulated by law. For those with a population of more than 100,000, 19 regional representatives should be elected, and one additional representative should be added for every 30,000 beyond that. According to the statistics in April, the population of Nanjing has reached 703,906, and there should be 39 representatives, plus 17 professional representatives, for a total of 56 people. It is heard that this work can be started in August.

### Minister Peng Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters: The Current Situation is Extremely Serious: American Representatives Must Have Arbitral Power, Otherwise All Agreements Will Be Empty Words

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 4:30 pm on the 12th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Kai. The following is a record of the main questions and answers:

Question: The Communist Party said that when the government issued the order to stop the conflict, it began a large-scale attack in eastern China. If this is true, why did the government take this action of attack when this permanent agreement is about to be established?

Answer (Minister Peng): This is the old method of Communist propaganda, that is, to blame the other party for the evil deeds it has done. It is very easy to prove which side launched the attack. Before June 7, Lafa and Texas were originally in the hands of the government army, but now they are in the hands of the Communist army. Three hours after the order to stop military action was issued, the Communist army attacked Lafa, and then launched a large-scale attack on Texas, massacring countless government troops and local people. On June 9, the Communist army blew up the Hanzhuang Bridge on the Lusu border canal. The Communist army is concentrating its troops, attempting to attack Jinan and Qingdao. The Communist army's strategy is clearly to use the 15-day truce period to occupy cities as much as possible. They especially want to seize the entire Shandong Province, divide China into two parts, north and south, and strengthen the danger of the national economy. This kind of behavior reminds people of the mission of Kiso Saburo in Washington. I would like to call the attention of the whole country to the seriousness of the current situation. The Communist army must withdraw from the cities it has occupied since June 7, and quickly restore the transportation lines it has destroyed, in order to remove the major obstacles to negotiations. Some people say that the attack on Lafa, Texas and other places was an order issued before June 7, and because the telegram was delayed, it was not stopped in time. We will retreat 100 steps, assuming that this statement is not false, and regardless of the losses of the government army and innocent people, we still feel that it is very easy for the Communist Party to prove its sincerity. The simplest way is to withdraw from the cities that were forcibly occupied after June 7, otherwise it is difficult to shirk the responsibility for destroying the truce agreement. Many observers believe that the Communist Party's strategy is to delay comprehensively and infiltrate locally. Recent events have confirmed that this statement is not wrong. The government army has been ordered by the Chairman to only defend and not attack, and after taking back the seized location, it must not pursue.

Question: Regarding the negotiations between the government and the Communist Party, can you give an interim report to clarify various rumors?

Answer (Minister Peng): The central issue of recent negotiations is how to ensure the rapid and effective implementation of all agreements and avoid such delays. Therefore, the government insists that the American representative must have the power of arbitration. This suggestion was proposed by our side on its own initiative. Without this arbitration, all agreements will be empty words and will never be realized. The Communist Party still rejected this suggestion after General Zhou Enlai returned to Nanjing from Yan'an. We still remember that we suggested that for the dispatched teams of the Mediation Executive Department, as long as two of the three people agree, a decision can be made. The Communist Party also opposed this point. With so many trivial matters and endless disputes, how can the agreement be realized? Regarding the power of arbitration, the government also informed the Communist Party that if there is a better way, it can be proposed for discussion, but the Communist Party has not yet proposed any method.

Question: Will the Trio Conference resolve political disputes or military conflicts?

Answer (Minister Peng): Within the 15-day period, three of the most pressing issues must be resolved, namely, stopping the conflict, restoring transportation, and reorganizing and unifying the army. After these issues are resolved, other political issues will not be difficult to solve, and most of them have already been resolved by the Political Consultative Conference.

### The Situation in North China is Becoming More and More Tense: Generals in Various Places Send Urgent Telegrams to the Ministry of National Defense for Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Today is the sixth day of the effective period of the truce. Early in the morning, news came that Dawenkou was attacked by the Communist army again. The situation in North China is becoming more and more tense. It is heard that generals such as Li Zongren, Liu Zhi, Sun Lianzhong, Yan Xishan, Fu Zuoyi, and Wang Yaowu have successively telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to report the serious situation caused by the large-scale offensive of the Communist army and requested instructions on how to deal with it. It is heard that the extensive offensive launched by the Communist army in North China this time, the troops assembled, the weapons equipped, and the unpredictable Japanese bombers that cooperated with the ground troops in combat, seemed to have been fully prepared in advance, which is extremely noteworthy. The most difficult thing for the National Army in various places at present is that they must absolutely adopt a defensive posture within the truce deadline, and because there are many places to defend, it is impossible to defend against everything. If the Communist army concentrates its forces and chooses a point to attack fiercely, the National Army will suffer a great loss due to being caught off guard. In Lafa outside the pass and Texas inside the pass, the defending troops have made tragic sacrifices, just because they are in an unfavorable position of being beaten. Therefore, the morale of the National Army soldiers in various places has been extremely angry and resentful due to being burned by anger. According to a senior military official: This point can be used as a reference for the CCP, do not take temporary pleasure and leave yourself with endless troubles.

### Zaozhuang Commander Captured

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 11th] Wang Gang, the commander of the Zaozhuang garrison, has been captured by the Communist army, and Wang Jimei, the commander of the unit, was killed in battle.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 12th] Major Lei Fenqiang, the government representative of the Yancheng Transportation Team, was shot and killed by the Communist army near Sangzidian on the 10th. Currently, Lei's body has been sent to Jinan Station this morning. It is reported that Lei was a major staff officer of the Second Pacification Zone Command, only in his twenties. It is a pity that he suffered this tragic murder. In addition to the resolutions reached in the consultations in Yancheng, Lei also carried detailed records of the Communist army's three destructions of the railway between June 7 and 9.

### Communist Army Attacking Qingdao Repelled

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] The Communist army's siege of Qingdao is becoming increasingly urgent. At about 10 pm on the 12th, more than 20 junks gathered again and attacked the central area, attempting to land, but were repelled by the combined efforts of the defending troops and the navy. Fierce battles also broke out on the Qingdao Jimo border on the evening of the 12th.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] The Communist army in Weixian, Gaomi, Jimo, Chengyang and other places attacked the National Army on the night of the 8th and are currently engaged in fierce battles.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 12th] The Communist army attacking Chengyang has been repelled after two days of fierce fighting. The Communist army is now concentrating its main force in the Dongdaguan area, five kilometers north of Chengyang, confronting us.

### Cooke Flew to Nanjing Yesterday to Discuss the Qingdao Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Admiral Cooke, Commander of the US Seventh Fleet, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th.

[Central News Agency, this city] Admiral Cooke, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy in China, flew to Nanjing from Shanghai by special plane yesterday (12th) morning, with the appearance that the Communist army in Shandong Province is expanding its rebellion and is prepared to attack Qingdao at any moment, for important consultations with Special Envoy Marshall. General predictions are that General Cooke may go to Qingdao after completing his official duties in Nanjing, and consult with General Loji, Commander of the US Marine Corps in China, and General Kliman, Commander of the US Marine Corps in Qingdao, who flew to Qingdao from Tianjin the day before, to find appropriate methods that suit the environment. The US Navy authorities here refused to discuss what attitude and actions the US Navy in Qingdao will take towards the current critical situation, but said: The US Navy generals in Ningdao are currently in consultation, and they do not want to be attacked by others. The decision to adapt to the situation in Qingdao may be announced after consultation. The US Navy expressed surprise at the Communist army's sudden attack on Shandong Province, but the US Marine Corps in Qingdao is currently using the airport in the north of the city and the shipyard in the east of the city for external transportation as before.

### Chen Lifu's Remarks: Taking Over the Northeast is Based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] This afternoon, Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, was surrounded by several reporters at the welcoming ceremony for Cardinal Tian Gengxin and asked for his thoughts on the current situation after the issuance of the truce announcement. According to Chen, the truce is in vain if it is discussed without reorganizing the army and restoring transportation, and the war inside and outside the pass are two different things. The National Army outside the pass went to take over based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty. For example, a house whose sovereignty belongs to me should be taken over, but someone refuses to let it go, so the police should be asked to drive them out.

### Supervision and Implementation Meeting of the Resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee Held

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] After the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee was held in Chongqing at the end of March, it was the beginning of the capital relocation. Various agencies moved to Nanjing one after another.

### Major Traitors in North China Indicted: Public Trial Before the 20th

### The Coming Ten Days are "Decisive Days": Central Daily News Publishes Commentary on the CCP Issue, Hoping the Communist Party Will Leave a Ray of Hope for the People

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Today, the Central Daily News published an article entitled "Decisive Days," discussing the issue of a ceasefire between the KMT and the CCP. The newspaper believes that enhancing General Marshall's arbitration authority is the last resort to achieving peace between the two armies. It also stated that if the Communist army captures Jinan or continues to obstruct the Northeast's takeover at this time, it should be considered the beginning of the party's rebellion. The newspaper also advocated that if the Communist Party attacks the National Army in any location, the National Army should immediately counterattack. However, the counteroffensive should stop when it reaches the original defensive line, awaiting the best possible mediation. The article points out, "As of today, the Communist Party has shown no sign of a ceasefire. Its intensified military actions are cooperating with its propaganda offensive, which confuses black and white. With only ten days left in the ceasefire period, the Communist Party has not been able to prove its sincerity in the ceasefire with facts. This is undoubtedly a heartless blow to the Chinese people who earnestly seek peaceful unification. Isn't it also a great irony for General Marshall, who has traveled tens of thousands of miles for the peaceful unification of China? Does the Communist Party not know that the people's hope for peace is greater than that of a hungry infant waiting for milk? Does it not know that General Marshall and even all of China's friends around the world hope for China's stability more than a severe drought hopes for rain clouds? And does it not know that the people's and the government's tolerance has its limits? Then why is it unwilling to immediately abandon its attempt to divide the Northeast, dismember China, destroy transportation, and massacre the people? Is the Communist Party really a different kind of people, who have long lost normal human nature? The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. We hope that the Communist Party will cherish the hard-won sovereignty for the country, leave a ray of hope for the people, understand that the government's tolerance cannot be limitless, and value General Marshall's friendship of mediating for China's peaceful unification despite traveling tens of thousands of miles. It should quickly abandon its violent doctrine and power politics, put away its attempt at a full-scale rebellion, and stop its mad attacks in the Northeast and Shandong. The coming ten days are decisive days, because it is the crossroads for the entire nation and all its people, and also the dividing line between whether the Communist Party is willing to leave a way out for the entire nation and a ray of hope for all the people."

### He Yingqin Returns to Shanghai by Plane from Taiwan: Talks About Impressions After Inspection, Expresses Hope That Chinese People Will Jointly Plan Construction Due to Lack of Talent

[Central News Agency, this city] He Yingqin flew to Taiwan from Shanghai a few days ago for an inspection, stayed for five days, and returned to Shanghai from Taiwan yesterday at 12:40 noon. He refused to talk about military issues. When reporters asked about his views on the overall situation, he said he did not want to make any criticism. He also did not want to express opinions on the work of the Military Mediation Office. When reporters asked when he would go abroad to participate in the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting, he said that the date had not yet been determined and he was afraid that he would not be able to leave this month. However, the responsibilities of the headquarters had been properly handed over. He would return to Nanjing today or tomorrow. Before going abroad, he would inspect the Northeast and Northwest to understand the domestic situation after the war. This trip to Taiwan was entirely for inspection purposes. When reporters asked him to share his impressions of the inspection of Taiwan, he said that he had visited seven places in Taiwan, including Taipei, Keelung, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, for five days. His impressions included the following: (1) Over the past 50 years, the Japanese have achieved considerable success in managing Taiwan, whether in military, political, economic, transportation, or agricultural, forestry, industrial, and mining construction. Moreover, every undertaking is large-scale and well-planned. Their meticulous planning and hardworking spirit are truly worthy of our vigilance. (2) The national concept and ethnic consciousness of the Taiwanese compatriots are very strong. Although they have been under foreign rule for 50 years, they have not forgotten their motherland and have not been assimilated by foreigners. This spirit is extremely gratifying. (3) The most important work and difficult problems in Taiwan at present are two points: First, the education problem. We cannot deny that the colonial education implemented by the Japanese in Taiwan has had some adverse effects on some Taiwanese people. Now, if we want to eliminate the remaining poison, the education problem is very important. However, in the past, Japan restricted Taiwanese people from entering normal schools, so there is a severe shortage of teachers, especially teachers for secondary schools and above. It is hoped that compatriots in the country will go to Taiwan to serve in education. Second, the problem of restoring transportation and production. In the past, transportation on Taiwan Island and between the island and the outside world was very developed. During the war, water and land transportation tools suffered heavy losses and damage. In addition to the destruction of some production enterprises, they were all in the hands of the Japanese in the past. Now that most of the Japanese have been sent back to their country, there is a great shortage of talent. It is still not enough to rely on Taiwan Province's own strength now. It is hoped that domestic experts, industrialists, and overseas Chinese will jointly assist, and the central authorities should also give special support to facilitate early recovery. In short, Taiwan has fertile land, abundant products, and a foundation laid by the Japanese. As long as we work hard, it is easy to revive and prosper. It is hoped that compatriots will turn their attention to Taiwan and jointly plan the construction and prosperity of a new Taiwan.

### Shaanxi Actively Promotes Prohibition of Opium While Simultaneously Commencing Rural Reconstruction

Zhu Shaotong Delivers Speech Before Departing Beijing for Hangzhou

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zhu Shaozhou, Chairman of Shaanxi, went to his hometown of Hangzhou on the 12th to sweep tombs and will return to Shaanxi after staying for one or two days. According to him: (1) The more difficult aspect of Shaanxi's administration at present is the issue of opium prohibition, as the Japanese openly cultivated it in the past. However, opium prohibition is now being actively promoted. (2) Public opinion and social customs are trending in the right direction. (3) Prices are normal, and sugar prices are stable. It was originally planned that there would be a bumper harvest this autumn, but there has been a lot of rain in the past month, so there is only a 60% hope. (4) A rural reconstruction plan is being formulated to stabilize the lives of farmers. It has now been decided to start with water conservancy, increase production, select seeds, improve agricultural tools, and improve soil quality. It also advocates rural cooperation to support self-cultivating farmers, overthrow those who do not work for a living, and release cotton goods (3 billion this year) and agricultural loans (500 million for planting this year) to overthrow high-interest goods. (5) Regarding the results of this conference, he said: At present, all methods still boil down to "taking" from the people, and have not achieved "giving". Giving means enabling them to produce more, and then taking from the people. If those who produce are few, the people will be rich. However, this conference has made the financial and food aspects also problematic and has enabled top-down penetration. Once the truth is clear, gaps can be avoided. Mr. Zhu flew to his hometown of Hangzhou on the 12th to sweep tombs and will leave Hangzhou and return to Shaanxi after one or two days.

### Kunming's Money Supply Eases

[Our Correspondent in Kunming, 11th] Kunming's money supply has been easing since the 10th. However, due to the impact of the tight monetary policy last week, a small number of banks still do not lend to non-factory businesses. Because there are many people withdrawing money from the "貨帮", some small banks are still tightening loans. There are more remittances to Shanghai and Chongqing. The Central Bank is now taking a coordinated approach to Shanghai remittances. Various banks and money houses can supply as much as needed based on actual needs. Kunming's capital has been trending towards gold since the 10th, and the price has risen from 228,000 to 235,000 yuan. Cotton yarn has risen with the price of gold. There are many fabrics that cannot be sold, and the price will fall. The supply of cigarettes exceeds demand, and the market is trending downward.

### Editorial: The Communist Army's Idea of a Ceasefire is Just This!

Ceasefire! Ceasefire! This is the appeal of the people, and also the expectation of friendly countries. A fifteen-day ceasefire! This is the order of the government, and even more so a method agreed to by the Communist Party. When the fifteen-day ceasefire took effect today, we sincerely appealed to both sides not to miss this opportunity again. However, the answer that reality has given us is too disappointing! The Communist Army's answer is the resumption of gunfire in the Northeast, the large-scale attacks within Shandong, and the full utilization of Japanese bandits and their weapons to attack the National Army, to seize cities, and to destroy transportation. How strange! The Communist Army's idea of a ceasefire is just this!

However, there is no need to be surprised. The Communist Army's idea of a ceasefire is still an old trick of the Communist Party. We have said long ago that there must be credibility before negotiations can take place, and negotiations can only have value. Now, we are talking again and again, fighting while talking, and talking while fighting. What is the use of negotiations? If the Communist Army always wants to use negotiations as a period of rest for attacks, or as a cover for surprise attacks, then there is no such thing as a ceasefire at all. Under the supreme decision-making of the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Army's actions are always the same, seemingly with the sole purpose of preventing China from becoming strong under a unified national government. Therefore, even enemies can be used, and enemy weapons can be used as well, as long as they can cause trouble for the National Government, prevent the National Government from smoothly taking over the Northeast, and prevent the National Government from restoring national transportation, thereby preventing the people from obtaining the basic conditions for a peaceful and prosperous life. The Communist Army can do anything. In other words, the Communist Army's fierce attacks on Lafa and its encroachment on Yongji in the Northeast these past few days, and its capture of Dezhou and its fierce attacks on Tai'an, Jiaoxian, Weixian, Gaomi, and other places in Shandong, even with the appearance of attacking Jinan, Qingdao, and Xuzhou, all show that the Communist Army is simply not only not ceasing fire, but is also taking a road that is the opposite of a ceasefire, and is intensifying the fighting and expanding the war zone every day.

On the one hand, the Communist Army's representative in Changchun, Rao Shushi, blindly announced that he had not received a ceasefire order, believing that the violation of the ceasefire agreement was not the fault of the Northeast Communist Army. On the other hand, Zhou Enlai flew from Yan'an to Nanjing to visit General Marshall, visiting this party today and making appointments with that faction tomorrow, making it seem as if the Communist Party alone eagerly hoped for peace, in an attempt to confuse the eyes and ears of the world. Some minority politicians who claim to be neutral have also completely forgotten the position of the people, disregarded the suffering of the people, and especially abandoned justice and fairness. They only know how to follow behind the Communist Party and shout for a ceasefire and peace, but they do not know that the ceasefire and peace they are shouting for have long been kicked to the clouds by the Communist Party, the Communist Army, and the remnants of Japanese bandits protected by the Communist Army. To be honest, the Communist Army's idea of a ceasefire will not deceive a truly discerning ordinary person. At this time, our ordinary people have a simplest view, which is that during the fifteen-day ceasefire period, whichever side starts fighting first is a public enemy of the people and a sinner of the country!

Speaking of this, we are willing to make another heartfelt appeal on behalf of the truly ordinary people in the position of journalists:

First, we will first rebuke the wise, so we still earnestly request the government to strictly order the National Army in various places to strictly abide by the ceasefire agreement and the ceasefire order. Even if the Communist Army challenges every day and attacks everywhere, the National Army, in order to protect the people and defend the local area, cannot but counterattack. However, this counteroffensive should absolutely be limited to defending the original defensive line, so that Chinese and foreigners can understand who started the trouble, and so that the final mediation directed by General Marshall can still have a chance to proceed.

Second, based on the principle of "treating people with kindness," we still hope that the Communist Party can pull back from the brink. At this time, the Communist Party should recognize that its mission of the era is to promote China's unification and strength, rather than to create division and separation, thereby weakening China's strength. The Communist Party should know that this fifteen-day ceasefire is indeed the only good opportunity for the Communist Party to change its style. If the Communist Party still obstructs the unified takeover of the Northeast at this time, or even uses force to seize cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Xuzhou, our ordinary people will only recognize that the Communist Army is a group of bandits who are deliberately rebelling, and can no longer regard them as some kind of army with which the government can still negotiate.

Third, we believe that all negotiations between the government and the CCP must be conducted in an atmosphere of complete ceasefire, and during the process, the opinions of a third-party arbitrator must be respected. This so-called third party is definitely not a small number of politicians posing as democrats, but should be the objective and detached General Marshall, and especially the Chinese ordinary people who are suffering from the war. We believe that in order for future negotiations to be effective and powerful, it is necessary to first grant General Marshall the power of arbitration, and when necessary, the National Political Consultative Conference and the provincial and municipal councils should elect representatives of the truly ordinary people to form a supreme arbitration committee to make a final judgment on the disputes between the government and the CCP. Whoever obeys this judgment, the ordinary people will support; whoever opposes this judgment, the ordinary people will rise up and attack. We believe that during the period when the government and the CCP have disputes, there is only one way to achieve peace in the country, which is to respect the arbitration power of the people and General Marshall. Whichever side opposes or disregards the arbitration power of the people is undemocratic, which is also a sign that it does not want peace. The people will eventually have a way to deal with these anti-democratic and anti-peace rescuers!

### Local Correspondences Wuhu

#### Central Government Agencies' Grade Six Treatment Personnel Consistently Work Slowly

Protesting the Inequity of Regional Adjustments to Treatment High and Local Courts Handle Appeals as Usual

[Our Wuhu Correspondent] Since the announcement of the Measures for Regional Adjustments to the Treatment of Public Servants and Teachers, all personnel in central government agencies in Wuhu, except for state-owned enterprises and special institutions such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Postal Administration, the Relief Administration Branch, and the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, believe that since the victory, the prices of all goods in Wuhu have not only exceeded those in the Beijing-Shanghai area but are also the highest in the country. However, Wuhu has been ranked as Grade Six, with a basic amount of 35,000 yuan and a multiplier of 180, which is only half that of the Beijing-Shanghai area. This not only makes it impossible to maintain a livelihood but is also greatly unfair. Therefore, the entire staff of the Sanitary Brigade, the Commodity Tax Bureau, the Direct Tax Bureau, the Salt Administration, the Local Court, and the Third Branch of the High Court held a meeting at the Third Branch of the High Court at 10:00 AM on the 10th. They also invited the press. President Wang of the High Court, Chief Sheng, and Brigade Commander Xiang reported the opinions of all personnel in succession. They expressed sympathy for the attitude of public servants and teachers in Hangzhou who resigned. After discussion, and after the strenuous persuasion of their respective supervisors, they unanimously decided to initially work slowly while awaiting a solution. During the period of slow work, in order to take into account the interests of the people, the High and Local Courts will continue to handle scheduled and appealed cases as usual.

Rental Dispute Resolved Through Mediation

The issue of rents in this town has been dragging on until now and has never been resolved. It is now learned that the party and government agencies convened a mediation meeting on the 10th. After discussion, it was decided that the rent amount in 1937 would still be used as the standard. Storefronts will increase by 700 times per yuan (for example, 10 yuan before the war is now 7,000 yuan). Residences will increase by 500 times per yuan (for example, 10 yuan before the war is now 5,000 yuan). The validity period is limited to six months (from May to October). Thus, the long-standing rental issue has been temporarily resolved.

### Before the Reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference Bevin Makes Important Statements If the Conference Fails, He Will Act Alone Primarily Place the Ruhr Area Under International Management

[Our dispatch] London, 12th (Radio): British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed his opinion at the Labor Party annual conference, saying: If the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference still fails, he intends to sign peace treaties separately with the former Axis countries and their European satellite states.

[Our dispatch] London, 12th (Radio): British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech at the Labor Party annual conference today, refuting the criticisms of the opposition. He made important statements on the issues of Palestine, the Soviet Union, and Spain: (1) Regarding the Palestine issue, he does not want 100,000 Jews to enter the region, because if this is done, British troops will need to station one more division in that area. (2) Regarding the Soviet Union, his wording was even stronger. Bevin listed his past friendly actions towards the Soviet Union, but today he knows that the Soviet Union has forgotten these favors. He pointed out that the Soviet newspapers recently did not mention a single word about his diplomatic speech. Everything must come from the sincerity of both parties, but the Soviet Union is like this, so what else can be said. (3) Regarding Spain, Bevin believes that if other countries do not interfere in Spain's internal affairs, Franco may have already fallen. Bevin does not advocate economic sanctions against Spain, because the victims are only the Spanish civilians.

Bevin also commented on the German issue. He said: France's demand to divide the Ruhr is understandable, because France has been invaded by Germany three times, and in order to ensure its own safety, it has to take this measure. However, according to Bevin's opinion, the Ruhr industrial area should be placed under international management, because this will not only benefit the 6.6 million people in the area, but will also ultimately benefit all European countries.

Bevin welcomed the United States' proposal for the four powers to conclude a 25-year mutual assistance treaty to monitor Germany's disarmament. He said: Some people believe that we are trying to establish a Western bloc, but in fact, the Eastern bloc already exists. However, Bevin does not advocate adopting this approach, which will create barriers.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The representatives of the four foreign ministers recently continued their meeting and decided that the items of the Italian peace treaty that have been agreed upon should be drafted immediately.

In addition, it has also been decided to handle the Romanian peace treaty issue in the same manner.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 11th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to resume in Paris on the 15th. The most difficult issues of Austria and Germany, which have a very short time frame, are once again at the center of international negotiations. The governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are studying the draft Austrian peace treaty submitted by the Allied Control Council in Vienna. Regarding the German issue, the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are also exchanging opinions. It is expected that the Austrian issue will be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference by US Secretary of State Byrnes. The German issue will be submitted by British Foreign Secretary Bevin.

Byrnes said that the United Kingdom's request for US military assistance did not mention the number of troops required. Byrnes refused to express an opinion on whether the United States is willing to send troops to Palestine. Byrnes' statement was issued immediately after President Truman advocated the establishment of a Palestine Committee by the cabinet. Byrnes is the chairman of the committee.

Britain Asks the US Six Questions

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] US Secretary of State Byrnes stated on the 11th that the six inquiries made by the United Kingdom regarding the implementation of the Palestine report recommendations have now been submitted by US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Harriman to the newly appointed cabinet committee for organization and research. Although Byrnes did not have accurate information, he believed that after the United Kingdom received satisfactory answers to the six inquiries, it would implement the recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine. The six inquiries made by the United Kingdom are as follows: (1) If chaos occurs in Palestine due to immigration, what assistance will the United States provide to quell it? (2) How will each homeless Jew in Europe be selected and allowed to move to Palestine? (3) How can transport ships be obtained? (4) Who will provide the transport ships? (5) How will the immigration expenses be handled? (6) How will the materials for temporary housing for new immigrants be supplied?

The above six questions from the United Kingdom will be submitted to the newly appointed cabinet committee by the President for research first. At the same time, the committee will also discuss the economic and cultural development, irrigation matters, employment of immigration services, and the disposal of other refugees to Palestine in Europe. During Byrnes' visit to Paris, Grady will represent Byrnes in attending the committee's discussions.

### Umberto Reluctant to Give Up Throne Italian Political Situation Serious If Not Resolved, It Will Lead to Civil War

[United Press, Rome, 12th] The Italian cabinet has held five consecutive meetings in 30 hours, but has not yet decided on the national system. It has also failed to persuade King Umberto to abdicate. Moreover, the pro-monarchy demonstrations in Naples caused a bloody incident in which seven people died, which shocked the cabinet.

A stalemate has now been formed between Umberto and the De Gasperi cabinet over whether Italy is a republic.

### Japanese Major War Criminals Tojo et al. Retried Today Qin Dechun Arrives in Tokyo To Testify

Regarding the application for the Soviet Union to allow Japan to resume fishing near Kamchatka, the Soviet government has refused, but this matter may be reconsidered. Now that the case has been approved by the committee, the Soviet Union's opposition will not be a problem.

### The Corpse of the Former King of Siam Is Placed in a Golden Urn Cremation After 100 Days

[United Press, Bangkok, 11th] The Siamese Parliament has re-elected Fanomien as Prime Minister, and the formal appointment can be seen tomorrow. It is expected that the new cabinet will be formed within a few days. The body of the late King Mahidol was bathed and laid out in a golden urn according to traditional Buddhist rituals. After at least 100 days, the final cremation will be held. The government has announced a one-year mourning period. Some say that the claim that Mahidol's death was suicide due to love is absolutely groundless.

### Words of the Atomic Bomb Inventor: Establish a World Government to Avoid Global Destruction; Atomic Bomb Should be Controlled by International Body

[United Press, Los Angeles, 12th] Dr. Szilard of the University of Chicago, one of the personnel involved in the invention of the atomic bomb, stated today at the Southern California Atomic Information Committee: Now that new discoveries have been made regarding the atom, and the possibility of biological warfare is even greater, the only way to avoid global destruction is to establish a world government. If airplanes, cannons, and tanks remain the primary weapons of war, then the United States, with its vast production capacity, can still maintain a strong position. However, with the existence of the atomic bomb, the situation has completely changed. The United States may produce more atomic bombs than other countries, but once we have enough atomic bombs to destroy all the cities of an enemy nation, producing more will be of little benefit to us. The question becomes: Who has more cities that are easily destroyed? Sixty million people in the United States live in large metropolitan areas. If we want to make the United States less vulnerable to attack, these people must relocate elsewhere, which could be completed within ten years at a cost of $200 billion. Many people believe that the United Nations may have a good chance of preventing war, but no one believes that the organization has made war impossible. Only a world government is a clear answer. If people intend to organize a world government, they must consider the welfare of all mankind. In the next two or three years, various international organizations should be established. The first should control atomic energy, and others should restore living standards, assist with economic issues, handle monetary situations, and redistribute scarce resources.

### Shocking News: One Ounce of Bacteria Powder Can Poison Two Hundred Million People

[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to a recent brief report from the Naval Biological Warfare Research Bureau, the United States has now invented a new bacterial warfare weapon with extraordinarily potent effects. This pure white, sharp crystal is the most toxic bacteria known. One ounce can poison two hundred million people. This is only one of the bacterial warfare weapons being prepared by the United States.

### Ten Thousand Atomic Bombs Can Destroy All of America

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th, United Press] Thomas, one of the leaders engaged in atomic energy research, stated during a speech: Atomic bombs with far greater power than those previously made can now be produced in quantities of thousands. If ten thousand of these powerful atomic bombs are launched via unmanned aircraft and rockets, the entire United States could be destroyed in a matter of minutes. He, who has received the Atomic Bomb Research Medal, said during a discussion of the power of atomic energy: All nations must realize the existence of this common danger. We must work together to avoid mutual destruction.

### Case Labor Bill Vetoed by Truman

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The President of the United States today vetoed the Case Labor Bill. The House of Representatives accepted the veto by a vote of 255 to 135.

### Lie to Go to Nuremberg to Study Automatic Translator

[U.S. News Service, New York, 11th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie will go to Nuremberg, Germany, next month to study the automatic telephone language translator used in the Nuremberg trials. This translator uses special "translation winds" to translate the proceedings of the meeting into the necessary languages of the United Nations, namely English and French.

### Thunderstorm Strikes America, Causing Widespread Damage

[United Press, New York, 12th] Last night, severe summer thunderstorms and hurricane-like gales occurred in New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other states. At least nine people died, four of whom died in the crash of a naval aircraft. The hurricane caused widespread damage, uprooting trees, blocking roads, destroying farmhouses, and disrupting power and transportation lines.

### America Uses DDT to Make New Insecticide: No Trace When Applied to Walls, Insects Paralyzed and Die Upon Contact

[United Press, New York, 11th] Officials at William Company here announced that they have now used DDT to create a new transparent insecticidal liquid that can be applied to walls, ceilings, or stairs. It dries quickly, leaving no trace. Insects are immediately paralyzed and die upon contact. It is harmless to humans. Another powder acts on insects like tear gas on humans, driving insects out of cracks. Contact with the powder leads to death.

### U.S. Navy Scheduled to Test V2 Rockets for Probing High-Altitude Ionosphere; Will Soar Straight Up to a Distance of One Hundred Miles

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 11th] On June 27th, the U.S. Navy will launch V-2 rockets equipped with scientific instruments at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. At that time, the rockets will soar straight up one hundred miles, entering the high-altitude ionosphere, which no one has yet been able to explore. This experiment will be conducted in cooperation with Army Ordnance engineers, who will be responsible for launching and controlling the rockets. Rear Admiral Both, Director of the Navy Research and Invention Group, said when announcing the planned experiment: "The June 27th experiment will only be the first step in a vast research program to acquire scientific knowledge of the high altitude, which may open new horizons for mankind. According to the Navy Research and Invention Bureau's plan, V-2 rockets will be used to penetrate the upper atmosphere at least twice, as far as possible. Scientists hope that this V-2 experiment will enable them to obtain answers to some of the most difficult problems in the universe. They will use observations of cosmic rays to learn more facts about atoms and their constituent particles, electrons, positrons, and neutrons. Their testing of the high-altitude atmosphere will also benefit astronomers, who must see through this barrier when observing stars. Scientists will also gain more new knowledge about the electron clouds in the high-altitude atmosphere of the earth, known as the ionosphere, which are closely related to short-wave radio communications. Most of the earth's energy is derived from the sun, so astronomers and physicists have been studying solar radiation for many years. Now, for the first time, they can observe radiation that is isolated by the atmosphere. It is believed that if this radiation could penetrate and reach the ground, all life on earth would be destroyed."

### Rocket Travel to Planets Could Be Realized Within Twenty Years

[U.S. News Service, Pasadena, California, 11th] Dr. Seifert, a scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said yesterday that rocket travel to planets may be realized within the next ten to twenty years. Dr. Seifert declared, "Planetary travel is indeed not a pie-in-the-sky dream." But he said that before achieving this goal, two major problems must be solved: First, how to produce an atomic energy unit that is light enough to be attached to a rocket; and second, how to build a strong combustion chamber that can accommodate the gas produced by atomic energy.

### Seems Like a Lot of Talk: Pan Sanxing Shows Off His Accomplishments, Claims to Have Assisted in the War of Resistance and Saved Comrades in Distress; Looks Pleased When Speaking of His Relationship with the Traitor Zhou

(Reported by this newspaper) At 10:00 AM yesterday, the High Court opened the trial of Pan Sanxing on charges of being a traitor. Before the war, Pan was the representative of the German trading company Arnhold, Karberg & Co. stationed in Beijing. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Pan colluded with Ju Xun to reach Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, as well as enemy spies Chou Ye, Japanese rōnin Sasaki, and Nakamura, Umemoto, and Yamaguchi of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Japanese Camp, organizing the Shanghai Shipping Company, taking on the role of manager. He also joined the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, an enemy-controlled entity, as an inspector. He further organized the Gold Industry Joint Exchange Association, disrupting finance, and another Cotton Industry Joint Exchange Association, specializing in speculation. Later, he founded the Trading Bank, promoting the dark market for pseudo-currency Zhongchu Banknotes. He also frequently gathered crowds to frequent the Asia General Association and other large gambling dens, and organized the "Three Provinces Football Team" to participate in the ball game donation competitions organized by the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Sports Association, donating more than three million pseudo-currency. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted based on the Punishment of Traitors Regulations and the criminal law on gambling.

When the trial opened yesterday morning, Pan wore a grey long gown and black cloth shoes. His hair was neatly combed and shone brightly, his face was rosy, and he looked energetic, not like a prisoner. First, Judge Cao asked the defendant's age and place of origin, and then asked about Pan's property. He claimed that his only real estate was the residence at 201 Julu Road and the land at the intersection of Rue Lloyd and Niuzhuang Road. All stocks and personal property have been handed over to the Military Statistics Bureau. He also said that the Shanghai Shipping Company was organized by the Shanghai-Xixi Charity Association to rescue refugees from Wuxi. The "Lianyi Bank" was organized by the exchange, with a capital of two million yuan, each share worth twenty thousand pseudo-currency. The football team was organized to cover the activities of underground comrades. As for the ball game donation, Pan said during the investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office that he had tried to prevent the "plane donation movement," and Liu Yangshan from Nanjing even made a long-distance phone call to warn him, saying that the enemy constitution had noticed his actions and advised him to be careful. Therefore, he requested that Fu and Liu testify. Yesterday morning, Judge Cao summoned Liu Yangshan, who flatly denied it, saying that there was no such thing. Pan Sanxing immediately said: "Don't be timid, it doesn't matter if you say it!" Originally, Liu's indictment by the High Prosecutor's Office did not include membership on the Pseudo-Plane Donation Movement Committee, probably for fear of implicating him and increasing his sentence. Lawyer Zhou Yingcai used the "New China Handbook" as evidence to expose his secrets, but Liu still did not admit it. Judge Cao also asked Pan about his relationship with Zhou Fohai. Pan said that he was a godson, and smiled as he spoke. Later, the defendant's lawyers Zhou Yingcai, Li Mo, and Tang Ying presented six pieces of physical evidence. Finally, Pan still stated two points: (1) He assisted in the War of Resistance against Japan, contacted Ji Xizong, a specialist of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee, provided intelligence, excluded underground workers, and rescued comrades in distress. He was even imprisoned by the enemy constitution and joined the Central Statistics Bureau in 1944, serving as a design committee member. (2) He assisted the Allied forces in combat, contacted Major Martin and Mr. Howard of the American Embassy, investigated the enemy's movements, provided favorable intelligence, and learned about the enemy's anti-aircraft firepower when Allied aircraft bombed Shanghai, that only two or three of their anti-aircraft guns could reach an altitude of 8,000 feet, and knew their deployment locations and the airport's takeoff and landing conditions. He told Martin, informing the American Air Force, so they could fly low to fight, increasing the hit rate and avoiding the deaths of many of our people. Witnesses Martin and Ji Xizong were both present in court, but due to lack of time, they were not summoned, and the court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.

### Four Cases Concluded Yesterday

(Reported by this newspaper) Four cases of suspected traitors were concluded by the High Court yesterday: (1) Wang Xuenong, permanent director of the pseudo-Huazhong Water and Electricity Company, (2) Jiang Quan, judge of the pseudo-local court, were both scheduled to be sentenced on the 18th. (3) Juror Qiaopoke, (4) Huang Wenzhong, clerk of the pseudo-Huangpu branch, were both scheduled to be sentenced on the 19th. Xu Shengyang, chairman of the pseudo-Xujiahui Baojia District Committee, Zeng Guangyan, director of the pseudo-Huaihai Provincial Department of Education, Chen Shaogui, director of "Hengchan Company," and Xu Zuiren and Hu Zhanggen, employees of Gongji Rice Shop, were interrogated yesterday and the court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.

### Yuan Ludeng Depressed and Soon: Family Files Appeal with the Supreme Court; Cultural Traitor Wu Liande Retried Today

(Reported by this newspaper) After Yuan Ludeng was sentenced to life imprisonment, he became depressed and soon. His family has already hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. Another case of traitor appealing for retrial, namely Wu Liande, the former manager of Liangyou Book Company, has been sent back for retrial by the Supreme Court and will be retried in the High Court this morning. In addition, the major traitor Liang Hongzhi will be tried again tomorrow (the 14th) afternoon. Also, the cultural traitor Zhang Ke will be tried in the High Court at 10:00 AM this morning.

### Singing "Welcome Soldiers": The Third Batch of Demobilized Youth Soldiers Arrives in Shanghai; Ninety-Five Members of the Shanghai Team Arrive Together; Part of the Fujian Team Returns Home

In early 1944, more than 150 youths from the city, inspired by the call of "100,000 Youths for 100,000 Soldiers," under the leadership of the Youth League of the City Party Headquarters, braved the dangers, crossed the enemy blockade line, and traveled to Tunxi, southern Anhui, to gather and join the intellectual youths in the military. They were then assigned to the 208th Division of the Youth Army for training. The total number of people who passed the examination was 134, who were organized into a company. After demobilization, except for a small part who remained in the camp to work, all 95 volunteer youth soldiers from the Shanghai Company, together with the third batch of demobilized Youth Army mixed brigade, arrived in Shanghai North Station on a special train from Hangzhou at 1:30 PM yesterday. Those who welcomed them at the North Station included Wu Shaohui, chairman of the Party Headquarters, and more than 3,000 people from various agencies, schools, and organizations. The City Government Band and the Guangxia Middle School Scout Band played music to welcome them at the station. When the train arrived at the North Station at 1:30 PM, the Shanghai Company was in the seventh section of the train. Outside the train, the seventeen large characters "Greetings to the Elders of All Circles in the City from the Shanghai Military Youth" were written. Amidst the sounds of military music and firecrackers, Xiong Zeguang, the captain of the Shanghai Company, led the first to disembark and gather. Chairman Wu, Wang Xiaolai, and others immediately stepped forward to express their condolences to the Shanghai military youth who had won honor for Shanghai. The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League sent Miss Dai Kaizhu, Miss Lu Wenmei, and Miss Zhu Lanchi to present flowers to the Shanghai Company Youth Army, which were accepted by Mr. Qin Tingyao. Then, the team marched out of the station, and the students of various schools who were lined up to greet them sang the "Welcome Soldiers" song to show their welcome. After the Shanghai troops departed, the mixed brigade re-formed the team and disembarked, with a total of more than 1,800 people arriving in Shanghai yesterday, including the Fujian Brigade of the 209th Division, the Xiamen Battalion, one company of the Wenzhou Independent Company, one team of the Guangdong Company of the 208th Division, one team of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Company, and one team of the Shanghai Company, led by Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Xianzhang. After disembarking, the Student Union sent Miss Wang Jiazhu, Miss Yan Yunhong, and Miss Pan Zhian to present flowers to the entire Youth Army of the mixed brigade, which were accepted by Mr. Hu Baoquan and Mr. Chen Youxi. Then, the team marched to the Fuyuan Warehouse on Guangfu Road and the Zhongziwan Zhong Company for rest. The demobilized youth soldiers of the Shanghai Company were invited by the Youth League to stay at the Youth Hall on Haig Road.

Embarking on a Journey

In addition, the Fujian Battalion that arrived in Shanghai on the 10th embarked on the "Mingxing" and "Zhoushan" ships at Wharf No. 13 on the Bund yesterday to return to Fujian. The "Mingxing" is scheduled to set sail this morning, and the "Zhoushan" is scheduled to set sail on the morning of the 14th. The Xiamen Battalion that arrived in Shanghai yesterday will also reportedly take the "Zhoushan" back to Fujian. In addition, the Guangdong Brigade that arrived in Shanghai on the 11th was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Liberty Ship this afternoon, but due to lack of time, it may be delayed by one day and travel with the Guangdong Company and the Overseas Chinese Team that arrived in Shanghai yesterday.

### Welcome Guangdong Team: A Grand Event Yesterday

The second batch of demobilized Youth Army, the Guangdong Brigade of 2,300 people, arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. All sectors of the city held a grand "Shanghai Municipal All Circles Welcome the Youth Army Demobilization Conference" at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The Youth Army 209th Division Deputy Division Commander Gu Rongjun, Demobilized Youth Army Guangdong Brigade Commander Tu Chengqing, and more than 2,000 officers and soldiers, and representatives from all walks of life, including Wu Shaohui, chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Cao Jun of the Youth Army Demobilization Committee, Mrs. Li Hanhun, former chairman of Guangdong Province, and now a member of the Central Party Headquarters, Ms. Wu Jufang, and Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, attended. Chairman Wu and Mrs. Li delivered speeches to encourage the troops. Miss Wang Jiazhu, a student from Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, presented flowers on behalf of the students. Finally, artistic performances were performed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

### Gated North and South Shanghai: Building Houses; Municipal Government Cracks Down on Occupation of Private Land

(Reported by this newspaper) The Municipal Government authorities, in view of the serious housing shortage, are providing construction convenience for residents in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas to build houses. However, if some citizens illegally occupy private land and do not apply for licenses from the Construction Office of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, the bureau will strictly crack down on them in conjunction with the Construction Police Bureau. If landowners discover such situations, they can also file complaints with the office and demand that the occupants demolish the houses. On the other hand, the Engineering Bureau requests the Land Administration Bureau to requisition citizens' open spaces for housing construction. In addition, the construction of thatched houses, which pose a safety hazard, is also subject to crackdown.

### The Biggest Difficulty Currently Is Still the Economic Problem

The deepest impression Mr. Chu Huiseng (Fucheng) gave me was of solemnity, integrity, and meticulousness, never saying a redundant word or using a vague word—I have never seen a person who paid such attention to "accuracy" when speaking.

He sat upright, his long beard gradually turning white. Behind the seat was a bottle of extremely beautiful fresh flowers. The room was silent, only the slow and clear voice of Mr. Chu could be heard. He is already 74 years old this year. However, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, he still devoted himself to national affairs in the rear, working hard! He said, "For eight years, my body has been fine, but since last year, it seems to be a little worse."

Regarding the political situation, he said that there was no point in being pessimistic or optimistic. The biggest difficulty at present is still the economic problem. Foreign goods are being imported in a steady stream, and domestic industries have no way out. The situation is really dangerous.

After the victory, two types of people deepened the extravagance of Shanghai. The first group of people who returned to Shanghai included many who made fortunes from the national crisis in the inland. They brought money to Shanghai and still hoarded and speculated, disrupting the market. These were the first people to make Shanghai's atmosphere worse. The second type of person was a group of unscrupulous receiving personnel. Old Mr. Chu said angrily, "What they are doing is not receiving, it's simply stealing things!"

He told me that recently, the Political Council, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Central Supervisory Committee have jointly formed an investigation team to specifically investigate the receiving work. If evidence of corruption is found, it will be handed over to the court for strict punishment. He hopes that the people can assist in reporting.

He said with emotion, "Shanghai was originally a place where people from all over gathered, and with the addition of these two types of people to fuel the flames, it has been reduced to this state. Today, it is no longer possible for one or two people to set an example to reverse the decline!"

I walked into the rain with a heavy heart and squeezed onto a tram full of men and women. Shanghai was still so noisy, but it seemed that I had just heard the morning bells and evening drums from afar. In the crowd, I suddenly felt lonely.

### Wang Chonghui Postpones Trip to Beijing Due to Illness

(Reported by this newspaper) After arriving in Shanghai, Wang Chonghui was originally scheduled to return to Beijing yesterday, but he suddenly fell ill the day before yesterday afternoon. After medical diagnosis, it was said that it was still caused by the old illness of high blood pressure. Injections were given immediately and he was told to rest. Therefore, the date of the trip to Beijing will be postponed. When returning to the capital, both Wang and Feng Yuxiang originally planned to fly to Beijing, but because both of them suffered from high blood pressure, they took the waterway to the east. It is said that Wang's illness is quite serious this time. Doctors visited Wang's residence in the mornings and afternoons for the past two days to provide medical care.

### Non-Judicial Torture: Japanese War Criminal Haruki Yonemura on Trial

[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday morning, the First Pacification Area Military Tribunal again interrogated a case involving a Japanese war criminal. The accused, Haruki Yonemura, was the former captain of the Changshu Military Police. In July of the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], he led his subordinates in Taicang to search and arrest over fifty patriotic Chinese people, including Lu Xiaoyun. Apart from releasing thirty-odd of them, the rest were detained for over half a year. Various forms of torture were used to coerce confessions, resulting in the deaths of five people, including Hu Yucang, in prison. Later, Yonemura falsely accused Lu Xiaoyun and seventeen others, and had them sent to the Japanese military headquarters in Shanghai to be executed. After the victory [of the war], he was arrested by the Third War Area Army. Yesterday morning, during interrogation by Judge Lu Qi, the accused's testimony was evasive, and he denied the non-judicial torture alleged in the indictment. The court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

### Civil Servant Salary Adjustments: Municipal Government Finances More Strained

[Our Own Dispatch] Deputy Director Hu of the Municipal Finance Bureau stated: Salary adjustments for civil servants will be implemented by the municipal government starting this month. However, this will inevitably strain the municipal government's finances further, as the Executive Yuan only covers the salaries of 3,000 employees, while the municipal government has a total of 36,000 personnel. Financial expenditures will be impossible to cover.

### Civil Defense Corps to Be Abolished: Currently Undergoing Closure; Rong Youlue Offers Some Opinions

[Our Own Dispatch] Rumors circulated that the Municipal Civil Defense Corps would be abolished. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to Corps Commander Rong Youlue, who stated: To streamline organizations and unify command, the authorities plan to abolish the Corps. The closure is currently underway and is expected to be finalized by the end of this month. As a military man, I have found it particularly difficult to handle affairs since taking office due to financial difficulties. After the abolition, I may return to the military. However, I have two points I would like to bring to the attention of the public: First, since the Civil Defense Corps was established, there has been much misunderstanding from the outside world, with many believing it has achieved nothing. In fact, the members of this Corps are all local citizens, spread throughout every corner [of the city]. Their power to assist the military police and prevent [minor incidents] is undeniable. However, precisely because its effect lies in active prevention, there are few concrete facts to show for it. After the abolition, with military and police forces prevalent in the urban area, there should be no impact on public security. However, in the suburbs, there will be a feeling of a weak police presence. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this and that citizens will continue to provide assistance. Second, after the abolition of the Corps, hundreds of officers will be unable to find placement. They are all military academy students from various places. Although they will be given severance pay and travel expenses, their livelihood will inevitably be difficult to maintain under the current high prices. I hope the authorities can find a way to help them.

### New Telephone Directory to Be Printed and Distributed by the End of the Year

[Our Own Dispatch] The Shanghai Telephone Company plans to compile and print a new telephone directory. Once the paper arrives in Shanghai, it can be printed and distributed by the end of this year. The company also stated that since the price increase for telephone calls, the number of calls has decreased, and work efficiency has improved significantly. However, they hope that users will still conserve telephone usage as much as possible. As for new telephone equipment, the United States itself is experiencing shortages. Although orders have been placed, it will take more than a year for them to be shipped to Shanghai.

### Settlement of Compensation for Crew Members Lost in the "Haitong" Vessel Disaster

[Our Own Dispatch] The families of the crew members lost on the Sanbei Company's "Haitong" vessel demanded compensation. After days of negotiations, it is reported that labor and management reached an agreement yesterday. In addition to compensation according to maritime law, an additional year's compensation was agreed upon, with each person receiving 1.5 million yuan. The payment has already been made, totaling 55.5 million yuan for 37 people. A disturbance has finally been quelled.

### Appointment of Whiteley as Customs Commissioner: Customs Officers Request Reversal of Decision

[Our Own Dispatch] All Chinese employees of the Jianghai Customs expressed their opposition to the appointment of the Englishman Whiteley as Customs Commissioner. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, they convened a meeting at the Customs Senior Club in Tongyi Lane, Nanjing Road, and resolved to issue a declaration, demanding that the government reverse its decision to appoint foreign customs officials.

### New Chen Police Officers Commended and Rewarded

[Our Own Dispatch] The Judicial Section of the New Chen Police Department has solved major cases one after another. A few days ago, Director Xuan specially awarded bonuses to encourage them. Former Section Chief Zhang Rou (who has now been transferred to the Taishan Branch) received 15,000 yuan, Section Members Gu Qiliu, Liu Zhufeng, and Wang Wenbin received 10,000 yuan each, and Sergeants Zhu Wanjun, Zhang Junfeng, Jiang Run, etc., received amounts ranging from 2,000 to 8,000 yuan each.

### Case Alleging Illegal Election: Debate Concluded, Awaiting Verdict

[Our Own Dispatch] The case in which lawyer Xia Gongkai and four others sued the Shanghai Municipal Government and its subordinate district offices, seeking confirmation that the election of Shanghai city councilors was invalid, was heard again yesterday morning in the Civil Division of the District Court. The plaintiffs' lawyers Yan Yuan'ao, Fang Zhong, and Lu Yunhai appeared in court. In addition to the lawyers Zhang Shijian and Qin Liankui representing the first defendant (the Municipal Government), the second defendant (the district offices) also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Jiang Pingfan, Wang Shanxiang, Zuo Dexi, Feng Xizui, and Huang Ji to defend them. Only Xia Gongkai appeared for the plaintiffs. He withdrew the allegation of fraud but continued to insist on the allegation of illegality. Zhang Xiaosong and Li Xuexun, representatives of the statutory agents, appeared for the defendants. They presented counter-evidence to the plaintiffs' allegation of illegality. The debate then began and lasted for an hour. The defendants' lawyers argued that the plaintiffs' lawsuit had no legal basis, and that the presentation of evidence after the filing of the lawsuit showed that the plaintiffs were finding facts to support the lawsuit, rather than having facts first and then filing a lawsuit. Furthermore, since the plaintiffs knew that the defendants' election procedures were illegal, why did they not correct them within the previous three days, and only filed a lawsuit after losing the election? At 11:40 AM, the court ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month.

### Many Wrongdoings During the Enemy-Puppet Period: Still Living at Sea After the Victory; Chen Guangquan Arrested

[Our Own Dispatch] Chen Guangquan, a well-known gangster from Western Shanghai, 40 years old, residing at No. 12 Meifang Lane, Jiaozhou Road, colluded with Japanese spies Kawashima Yoshiko, Mitsuo Miyara and others during the enemy-puppet period. He served as the lieutenant general and adjutant of the puppet Peace Preservation Army, collecting intelligence for the enemy, harming patriotic people, oppressing the common people, and committing many wrongdoings. The Shanghai Command of the Third War Area Army Headquarters learned of this and dispatched personnel with the Putuo Road Police Station at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday to the aforementioned location. Chen had not yet gotten up and was arrested. He was then taken back to the Shanghai Command Headquarters and escorted to the First Pacification Area Command in Wuxi that day for punishment.

### Hu Xiyuan Discusses the Electrical Appliance Industry: Prospects Not Optimistic; High Labor Costs, Heavy Costs; Unable to Withstand the Onslaught of Foreign Goods; American Electric Fans Arrive in Hong Kong at Low Prices

[Our Own Dispatch] As foreign goods flood in and our national industries teeter on the brink of bankruptcy, this reporter visited Hu Xiyuan, general manager of the Ya'pu'er Electrical Appliance Factory, yesterday to inquire about the current situation of the electrical appliance industry. He said that the industry is currently barely surviving, but the prospects are not optimistic. The General Electric Edison Bulb Factory, established by foreign merchants in Shanghai before the war, has been unable to resume production because its machinery was moved away by the Japanese during the Shanghai occupation. Furthermore, due to the unstable domestic political situation, foreign merchants are afraid to invest rashly. Therefore, domestic electrical appliances have not yet encountered a major enemy. Although the United States produces light bulbs and sells them for only one dime (US), which is equivalent to just over 200 yuan in our currency, transportation is not smooth, and the goods are not of great value, so they are not willing to import them in large quantities. Otherwise, compared with domestic light bulbs that cost 400 yuan to produce, how could they not be overwhelmed? However, American electric fans have arrived in Hong Kong, costing 80 Hong Kong dollars each, which is equivalent to 32,000 yuan in our currency. However, the current selling price of domestic electric fans in Shanghai is 140,000 yuan per unit. With such a comparison, the future is worrying. Therefore, domestic electrical appliances are fundamentally unable to be exported and can only seek development inland.

Speaking of the issue of workers' wages, Mr. Hu said: The reason why domestic goods were able to flourish and be exported in large quantities before the war was that our labor costs were low, our costs were light, and our selling prices were lower than those of foreign goods. However, the wages of our workers, calculated in currency, have now become the highest in the world. There are many irrational aspects of the current wage standards for workers. Although they are calculated according to the cost of living index, the base salary is much higher than before the war, making it difficult for general factories to bear.

Regarding the upcoming production conference, Mr. Hu's opinion is that in order to save the current industrial crisis, in addition to protective tariffs and other measures, the most important thing is cooperation between the government and the people, and cooperation between labor and capital; otherwise, they will all perish together.

### Letter to the Editor

We are informed by the concerned parties, Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy Weiersheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Wang Danqing, Xu Weigong, Yang Jiaquan, Xu Liangkun, and Cheng Meisheng, that they have read the article published in your newspaper on June 10 concerning the trademark infringement case in which Weiersheng lost the lawsuit. The article states: "According to the English-language 'Great American Evening Post' on June 6, the Jiangsu High Court has confirmed the Shanghai District Court's judgment in the lawsuit filed by Shanghai Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy (i.e., British Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy) against Weiersheng Pharmaceutical Factory for trademark infringement as reasonable (omitted below)." This does not correspond to the facts. It has been found that because the Shanghai District Court's judgment was improper, your esteemed lawyer and lawyers Tan Yigong and Tan Mingde were commissioned to appeal to the Shanghai High Court. After two court sessions by the Shanghai High Court (not the Jiangsu High Court), the original judgment of the first-instance court was completely changed. The two parties were ordered to reach a settlement in court, with Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy voluntarily changing its trademark. British Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy returned all the pharmaceutical machinery owned by Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy and the affidavit signed by Xu Weigong under duress. There was no dispute over the business name. Hua Shang Wei Lianshi Pharmacy and others were by no means the losing party, and the appellant, British Wei Lianshi Physician's Pharmacy, was not represented by foreign lawyer Alman in court (foreign lawyers are not yet allowed to appear in court). It is clear that the English-language 'Great American Evening Post' made a factual error. In addition to waiting for the Shanghai High Court to deliver the settlement record before publishing an advertisement to clarify the truth, we have first commissioned your esteemed lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper to set the record straight. We hereby convey the facts accordingly and hope that you will investigate and show your public spirit. Lawyer Zhou Kun

### Mo Dehui Presides Over Disaster Relief Affairs in Shanghai

[Our Own Dispatch] This reporter recently interviewed Mr. Mo Dehui, who recently came to Shanghai, who stated: Mr. Zhang Xueliang's current living situation is quite comfortable. He is immersed in his studies and occasionally goes fishing. However, as he is approaching middle age (Mr. Zhang is 46 years old this year), his eyesight is gradually failing. In addition, he has been studying ancient books under oil lamps and now wears glasses. He also suffers from slight hearing loss due to a previous case of acute appendicitis. Regarding the situation in Northeast China, Mr. Mo said that the situation is complex, but currently eight of the nine provincial chairmen are from the Northeast, which should have a corresponding effect on local revenue. Mr. Mo did not express his opinion on the future of the Northeast. The Northeast has suffered 14 years of enemy devastation, and the people are still in dire straits. Therefore, Madame Chiang, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyu, and others have specially initiated a charity performance for disaster relief in the Northeast, with Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Ma Lianliang, and others performing on the same stage, which is truly an unprecedented event in the Peking opera world. Mr. Mo's visit is to preside over this disaster relief effort. It is estimated that the income from the charity performance will reach over 100 million yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Xu Jiyu also paid a special visit to Mr. Mo's hotel and had a long and pleasant conversation.

### Chen Guangfu Returns from Overseas After an Eight-Year Absence from Shanghai: Discusses How American Materials Are Not Abundant After the War; Hopes That Our Future Economic Construction Will Progress

[Our Own Dispatch] Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, suddenly arrived in Shanghai yesterday from the United States on the "MacMurray Victory" after an eight-year absence from the city. As soon as he unpacked his luggage, this reporter rushed to his residence for an interview and was granted an audience. Mr. Chen was modest and had slightly graying temples. Although he described himself as being in ill health, his spirit was very good. He was dispatched in October of last year to represent the National Federation of Commercial Associations of our country to go to the United States to participate in the International Business Conference. After the conference adjourned, he spent most of his time in Boston recuperating, so he had little contact with various circles. This reporter asked about the recent economic attitude of the United States. He said: The current economic situation in the United States is transitioning from a wartime state to a peaceful stage. During this adjustment process, labor strikes have occurred repeatedly. For example, the National Maritime Union is currently brewing a strike, with rumors of an outbreak on June 15. However, the authorities have stated that they are confident that they can resolve it before then. Furthermore, American materials are not abundant after the war. Therefore, when our country purchases goods in large quantities from the United States, the United States still needs to consider its own supply and demand problems before issuing export permits. This is especially true for machinery, where the supply is even smaller. The reporter then asked about his expectations for our country's economy. He said: Our country finally achieved victory after many years of war, and we urgently hope that our future economic construction can enter a path of progress. Mr. Chen is currently 66 years old and is from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States in his early years. After returning to China, he served at the Jiangsu Bank. On June 2, 1915, he and others, including Zhuang Dezhi, founded the Shanghai Bank. Mr. Chen served as the manager of the bank. At the time of its establishment, it was located at the current site of the Ningbo Road Yongda Bank. It had only one shop front with two bays, and the capital was only 100,000 yuan. Later, under Mr. Chen's meticulous planning, the bank's capital increased year by year. In 1919, the capital was increased to 1 million yuan. In July 1921, it was further increased to 2.5 million yuan. The current capital is 20 million yuan. The bank has been known for promoting small savings deposits. During the silver dollar rush in the financial community in 1931, the bank provided the convenience of unlimited withdrawal of silver dollar deposits to all depositors, and its reputation grew even stronger. In June 1931, the bank's new building on Ningbo Road was also completed, and its business grew by leaps and bounds. Currently, the total amount of deposits exceeds 20 billion yuan. There are as many as 41 branch offices and 1,500 employees throughout the country. In normal times, it uses talent only and strictly implements scientific management. Its excellent discipline and sound business have been praised throughout the country. The bank's associated business, the China Travel Service, provides services to travelers and develops traveler's checks, which are particularly convenient. In addition, there are also the First Credit and Dahua Insurance Companies. All of these were created by Mr. Chen, who spent half his life working hard. In peacetime, in addition to dedicating himself to financial affairs, Mr. Chen enjoys reading and researching and often browses Chinese and foreign books in his spare time. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident, Mr. Chen immediately went to the rear to assist the central government in planning various financial measures. He also repeatedly represented our country, traveling overseas to complete various important economic missions. His contributions were outstanding.

### Unexpected Tension in the Match, Eastern Star Fought Hard to Defeat the Jewish Team, The Dark Horse was Stubborn and Difficult to Subdue, Winning 5 to 3 with Great Effort, Eastern Star Recovered its Lineup and Overwhelmed its Strong Opponent in the Second Half

The Eastern Star Expedition Football Team played against the Jewish team, known as the dark horse, at the Yiyuan Stadium at 5:30 PM yesterday. Before the match, fans predicted a one-sided victory for Eastern Star. Unexpectedly, the dark horse was stubborn and difficult to subdue, and Eastern Star almost fell. In the first half of yesterday's match, the score was tied at 2-2. Fortunately, Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong of the Allied Forces entered the field in the second half, which allowed them to win 5-3, but it took a lot of effort. The audience was crowded yesterday, estimated at more than 10,000 people. The referee was Jiang Yinseng. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:

Eastern Star

Zhu Zhaoheng

Huo Yaohua Hou Rongsheng

Luo Weiquan Xu Jingcheng Guo Yingqi (out) Feng Kunsheng (in)

Jewish

Analysis of Yesterday's Match

Yesterday's match between the Jewish team and the Eastern Star Allied Team was unexpectedly tense. Initially, it was thought it would be a one-sided affair, but it was not. Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong, who were originally scheduled to rest, had to enter the field in the second half to suppress the Jewish team. Eastern Star then restored its original best lineup, but only won 3-1 in the second half, one of which was a penalty kick, which shows how fierce the competition was. The Jewish team's goalkeeping was too poor, some errors were inexplicable, otherwise the score might have been closer. The Jewish team's individual skills are not bad, but the forward cooperation is not as skilled and wonderful as Eastern Star's. This is where the visiting team's victory lies. Yesterday's match also had some elements of luck, with both sides having shots that were bound to score, but hit the goalpost and bounced back, just missing the net. Within the first five minutes of the second half, the two sides scored three goals each, gaining and losing in a inexplicable manner. In the last ten minutes, the Jewish team's attack was very fierce, but fortunately there were no mistakes. In short, the Jewish team played very well, but Eastern Star was not ideal, resulting in this situation.

Jewish Team Presented Flowers

At 5:30 PM, the whistle blew to start the match. The Jewish team manager De Foelis first presented flowers to the visiting team, and then Eastern Star took the lead with a favorable wind. The two sides were evenly matched. In the seventh minute, Li Shuoyou and Deng Guangsen flanked, and the ball moved like a shuttle. Liu Songsheng got an opportunity and shot fiercely from 25 yards away. The ball went into the net from the right corner, 1-0, Eastern Star opened the scoring first. The Jewish team launched a counterattack, but Huo and Hou's two defenders were well-fortified and there was no gap to exploit. In the eleventh minute, Oliveira came on and McKinley switched to the right inside forward, and Stanslund was temporarily substituted. The formation adjustment immediately showed improvement. Le Lia led the ball forward, and Feng Kunsheng committed a handball foul in the penalty area. Fan Fuxiao took the penalty, but failed to score. In the fifteenth minute, Songsheng received a pass from Shuoyou and knocked on the door in front of the enemy, but it was blocked by Wen Nuogan and failed. In the twenty-second minute, Liu and Guo advanced side by side, and Lisburg neglected his duties. Songsheng took the opportunity to enter and kicked the ball into the net from five or six yards away, 2-0, Eastern Star scored another goal. The Jewish team was not willing to give up. Oliveira advanced alone, and Fan Fuxiao touched the ball and passed it to Kopstein, who failed to score with the first attempt, but scored with the second, 2-1, the Jewish team pulled back a goal, and their morale was greatly boosted. In the twenty-seventh minute, the five forwards advanced together, and Xu Jingcheng failed to save in time. Hou and Huo tried their best to block, creating a dangerous situation. Less than three minutes later, McKinley came again, and Zhu Zhaoheng patted the ball into a corner kick. Stanslund re-entered the field to replace Que Lisi, and took the corner kick, which was just right. Fan Fuxiao shot fiercely with his thigh, and General Hou made a surprising save. As the first half was about to end, Feng Kunsheng committed another foul, and a penalty was awarded. Manya executed it and completed the mission, 2-2, and the two sides were evenly matched, ending the first half.

Urgently Called for Reinforcements

After the lemon break, Eastern Star saw that the situation was not good and urgently called in generals Li Zhaorong and Feng Jingxiang, and Liu Songsheng and Feng Kunsheng were substituted. Guo Yingqi returned to his original position as left midfielder, Zhang Jinhai moved to the center, and the Jewish team also used Xue Pandsiding to replace Que Lisiji. After the start of the second half, Eastern Star took the initiative and launched an offensive. In the third minute, Feng Jingxiang shot strongly, and Zhang Jinhai assisted and passed the ball into the net, 3-2, Eastern Star took the lead again. Less than three minutes later, Nas advanced alone, directly into the Eastern Star hinterland, and shot from 30 yards away. Zhaoheng got the ball but lost it again, and the Jewish team equalized again at 3-3. In the eighth minute, Li Shuoyou teamed up on the left and immediately returned the favor, 4-3, Eastern Star led for the third time. At this time, the Jewish team's five forwards were running and active, and the visiting team was almost busy parrying, so Xu Jingcheng retreated to the inner guard to assist in the defense. In the mixed battle, one minute before the end of the match, Manya fouled, and Feng Jingxiang took the penalty kick, which hit the bullseye, 5-3, Eastern Star's victory was established, and the time also ended.

### Why Should the "Art" Subject Be Restored in the Elementary School Curriculum Research Meeting?

In order to adapt to the needs of national construction, the Ministry of Education, under the premise of simplifying the curriculum and lacking teachers, discussed how to revise the elementary school curriculum standards. The "Art" subject was restored under my firm advocacy. After the meeting, I was not abandoned by my colleagues in the education field, and they inquired about the reasons for restoring the "Art" subject. I will answer as follows:

(1) The Highest Ideal of Art Education

Why should elementary school students learn art? The reason is very simple, it is to use art to change their behavior, and it is definitely not to make them successful writers.

How can this goal be achieved? The first step is to make children enjoy beauty, using two methods simultaneously, namely (1) art appreciation, and (2) art creation. From such implementation, children can then apply these principles and methods of beauty to their daily lives to complete the beautification of life. As a result, behavior is changed. Richtwark once had the same proposition, and Cai Yuanpei's advocacy of "aesthetic education replacing religion" in the "May Fourth" era was also the same.

The "Drawing Subject" in the revised curriculum standard in the 31st year of the Republic was a kind of "knowledge and skill training." The "Art Subject" that is now being restored should be included in "moral conduct."

(2) The Problem of Children's Art Creation

Advocating the enjoyment of beauty does not completely deny the creation of beauty. However, how to develop its ability is an important issue.

Professor F. Cizek, the host of the Vienna Children's Art Class, has implemented a teaching method that can be said to be completely in line with the ideal of children's art creation. He set up a rich learning environment and used methods such as guidance and suggestion to skillfully develop children's creative abilities. Unlike our drawing curriculum standards in the 31st year of the Republic, which used methods such as "basic exercises" and "copying" to hinder children's free expression and free creation, it is indeed worth referring to. (Note 2)

Therefore, in the assignments of the "Art Subject," the teaching of "basic exercises" and "copying" must be absolutely abolished.

(3) After the Restoration of the "Art Subject"

Some people may worry that the revision of the curriculum is to "simplify," and the rich "Art" seems to be a problem compared to the simple "Drawing."

But the truth is not so. Forcibly demanding children to draw accurate "Drawings" is more in line with children's needs in terms of common sense judgment than taking enjoyment as a prerequisite, especially with absolutely free creation as the publishing assignment. From the perspective of interest principle, simple "Drawing" is more boring than rich "Art." "Children's painting is not based on training in any aspect." (Note 1)

His abstract knowledge, but based on what he directly sees in a natural attitude. Painters paint based on what they see with a special perspective; the painter's perspective requires learning knowledge and training to be possible. " (Note 3) This is a correct conclusion based purely on the study of children's painting psychology. Therefore, it does not violate the premise of simplifying the curriculum.

As for the lack of teachers, so using methods such as "copying," but, calmly think about it, there are probably not many teachers who can draw. Does that mean that the "Drawing Subject" can be cancelled, and the subject can be set up after the teachers are trained? That's a joke. Then, I think: the lack of teachers is indeed a big problem, but the material conditions needed are not solved one day, and having teachers is also a problem. (Wen Zhaotong, 35, 6, 12.)

### Davis Cup European Zone Semifinals, Yugoslavia Wins Over France, Bunes Defeats Bertra, France Fails to Achieve Success, Yugoslav Team Comes from Behind

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 11th] In the Davis Cup tennis European Zone semifinals, France and Yugoslavia were evenly matched. In the first day's competition, France won two singles matches, taking the lead. They were confident that they could eliminate Yugoslavia by winning another match. However, in yesterday's doubles match, the French team made inappropriate personnel adjustments, which allowed the Yugoslav team to win, making the score 2-1. There were two more singles matches today. If France could win one of them, they could still win. Unfortunately, both matches were lost. According to the first day's singles, French players Bertra and Benat played against Yugoslav players Mitic and Bunes. Each match was a five-set thriller. The Yugoslav players eventually lost due to unfamiliarity with the venue. In the second day's doubles match, the French team captain replaced Belichai and Testramo to allow the two players to rest. The Yugoslav team still fielded Bunes and Mitic. They were familiar with the venue and won the match. Two singles matches were held today. In the first match, Yugoslav Mitic defeated Benat. The general French audience was not pessimistic, believing that there was still hope of winning the last match. When Yugoslav Bunes and French Bertra took the field in the second match, the whole atmosphere became tense, as the key to victory or defeat was in this battle. Bertra, with the prestige of being the French national singles champion, would surely overwhelm his opponent. At the beginning of the match, Bunes was more calm and won the first set. However, Bertra immediately responded in kind. In the fourth set, the two sides were inseparable. Bertra won this set 9-7. In the fifth set, Bertra's leg cramped, and his movement was inconvenient. Unfortunately, he was defeated. The score was 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 7-9, 6-0. As a result of the three-day competition, Yugoslavia eliminated France 3-2 and entered the finals, where they will face the winner between Sweden and Belgium.

### Discussions on Governing the Yellow River (2)

— Chu Tongan

(2) Research on Dam Location: The lower reaches of the Yellow River, besides the small tributaries of the Luo and Qin Rivers, have no other tributaries; the river flows north into Zhan and south into Huai. The Yellow River is simply a channel to the sea, carrying the water from its middle and upper reaches into the ocean. The water volume of the Yellow River, from Longmen upwards, receives the Fen River to the east and the Wei River to the west. The Wei River further receives the Jing and North Luo Rivers. The drainage area of these four rivers accounts for approximately half of the Yellow River's drainage area, and the water levels of these four rivers fluctuate unpredictably. Therefore, if a dam is built above Longmen, it will not be able to regulate the entire water volume of the Yellow River. Thus, the dam should be built below Tongguan. Below Tongguan, the Yellow River is blocked by the Xiaoshan Mountains to the south and the Zhongtiao Mountains to the north, until it passes the Xicheng and Mang Mountains and enters the plain. Within this area, there is a 300-li stretch of mountainous terrain, which is an ideal location for dam construction. In this area, with careful investigation, a suitable site for dam construction can surely be found. Failing that, if a suitable dam site cannot be found in this ideal location to regulate the entire Yellow River's water volume, then only a smaller dam needs to be built to regulate the water volume of the Fen, Wei, Jing, and North Luo Rivers. Another dam should be built in the mountainous area 700 li above Longmen to regulate the water volume of the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Such segmented regulation could also maintain a constant water volume in the Yellow River.

(3) Water Volume Regulation Method of the Dam and Utilization of the New Science of Meteorology: After the dam is completed, the water level can be raised by one to two hundred feet, thereby forming a long and narrow lake; this "artificial lake" is used to regulate water volume. Simultaneously with the completion of the dam, new-style meteorological stations should be established at suitable locations in the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. Using the latest "high-altitude air mass analysis method," it is possible to predict weather changes six months or even several months in advance, and thus predict when a certain region will have heavy rainfall, and report it to the dam at any time. The dam can then release water stored in the "artificial lake" in advance based on these reports. When heavy rain comes and the river water rises sharply, the dam can discharge the appropriate amount of water to prevent endangering the downstream area, while storing the excess water in the "artificial lake." Then, the downstream area will not be threatened by sudden floods and levee breaches.

(4) Using Dredgers to Remove Sand from the Riverbed to Maintain a Certain Depth; and Using the Dredged Mud to Thicken the Levees: The water of the Yellow River contains a large amount of sand and mud. According to Zhang Qiyun's estimate, it accounts for about 11%. The Book of Han once said: "One shi of Jing River water contains six dou of mud." In fact, the Jing River is sometimes entirely mud slurry. Although the Yellow River is not as bad as the Jing River, the mud and sand content of 11% is still quite high. After flowing slowly for two thousand li, how can the riverbed not be raised by the accumulation of mud and sand? The targeted solution is to remove the sand. In the past, during a certain period of the Qing Dynasty, river dredging was also used to govern the Yellow River, but the old method was used, so it was not very effective. Today, the Panama Canal is constantly dredged using modern dredgers. Before the July 7th Incident, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs' Dredging Bureau had eight dredgers, which regularly undertook dredging work; one of them was the largest in the world. As a result of the dredging, in a very short period of time, the Shintang Shoal in the Yangtze River was prevented from hindering navigation, and the effect was remarkable. Therefore, the author believes that to deal with the high riverbed of the Yellow River, dredgers can be used to deepen it section by section; the cost is low and the operation is easy. The dredged mud can be used to thicken the levees on both banks, so that the levees will not be neglected. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?

In summary, after the dam is built, the downstream of the Yellow River can be free from the danger of sudden floods; deepening the riverbed can lower the riverbed day by day, and strengthen the levees. The main causes and contributing factors of river disasters can be eliminated, and the Yellow River will naturally not have floods again.

(C) Economic Review of the Aforementioned Remediation Plan

(1) Cost of Dam Construction: We know that the construction cost of a large Yangtze River dam is between 700 million and 1.3 billion US dollars. The water volume of the Yellow River is much smaller than that of the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River dam also requires many navigation facilities. The Yellow River has a smaller flow and smaller ship tonnage, the main purpose being only to regulate water volume. The cost for navigation facilities can be simplified. Therefore, the construction cost will inevitably be cheaper than that of the Yangtze River dam. Although the electricity generated will also be smaller, it seems possible to recover the cost of dam construction with the income from the electricity generated.

(2) Compensation for the "Artificial Lake" and the Transformation of Agriculture in North China: The "artificial lake" created by the dam will inevitably be quite large; otherwise, it cannot fulfill the mission of regulating water volume. Therefore, some fields will inevitably be abandoned into the lake. However, after the lake surface is created, the mountain land on both sides of the lake, which was originally unable to obtain irrigation benefits, can now use electricity to draw water from the "artificial lake" to irrigate those barren hills, turning them into forests and farms, to compensate for the loss of creating the lake. Furthermore, we can broadly use the electricity generated by the dam to make agriculture on the entire Loess Plateau take a leap forward. With modern scientific and technological advancements, once seeds, planting methods, fertilizers, and pest control are all improved, the agricultural products on this vast plain will surely increase dramatically. The loss caused by creating the artificial lake is insignificant.

(3) Improvements in Navigation: As mentioned above, the Yellow River is often less than one zhang deep and no more than dozens of zhang wide. Because it is so shallow, although the downstream of the Yellow River can be navigated by civilian boats from Rongze onwards, the shallow riverbed makes navigation very difficult. In April and May, when the river water is low, boatmen in some shallow areas east of Rongze have to undress and get into the river to push the boats along. A large river with such difficult navigation is truly rare in the world. Now, if dredgers are used to deepen it section by section, and the dam is used to regulate and control the appropriate water volume, then navigation will be greatly facilitated. Not only civilian boats, but perhaps small steamships of several dozen tons will also be able to pass without obstruction.

(4) Development of Industry and Mining and Other Economic Benefits: The provinces traversed by the Yellow River are extremely rich in mineral resources, and Shanxi Province's coal mines are famous throughout the world. We know that after the completion of the Dnieper River Dam in the Soviet Union, many newly emerging industries sprang up, and in a short period of time, a city with a population of 300,000 was created. By analogy, with the construction of the Yellow River Dam, the industry and mining of North China will undoubtedly develop greatly, and the dam site will inevitably become a transportation and industrial center; the rise of a brand-new city is absolutely to be expected. Furthermore, due to the development of industry and agriculture in the entire North China region, production will increase sharply, the wealth of the people will increase, and commerce will inevitably become more prosperous. Then, doesn't the prosperity of the North depend on the Yellow River? (To be continued)

Riverside Family, Carved by Wang Zhen

### Random Notes from Prison

— Yao Jun

In prison, I come into contact with about twenty fellow inmates every day. I have inquired about their cases and studied their criminal facts. According to my observation, many of them have been wronged, and a small number of them have committed crimes in a confused manner. In these twenty-odd cases, I have not found a single one who knowingly committed a crime. Almost invariably, when each person finished telling me his story, they all said with emotion, "I suffered this loss because I was too honest!..."

For example, the small businessman Wang Xingshun, whose cousin killed someone in a dispute over the purchase of land. The murderer naturally fled, but he was sued in court. The judge asked him, "So-and-so was killed, do you know that?" "Reporting to the judge, of course I know..." "Were you at the scene when he was killed?" "I wasn't at the scene..." "Did you see the body?" "I saw it later..." "Did the deceased have any grudges with your family?" "He was just competing with my cousin to buy a piece of land..." "Then he had grudges with your family..." As a result, he was convicted of "joint murder" and sentenced to ten years in prison.

Also, the village head named Guan, one day he sent two deserters to the county government escorted by village guards. On the way, because the deserters wanted to seize the guns and escape, one of the village guards shot them dead. Later, the village guard was sentenced to ten years in prison, while he was charged with "inciting murder" and sentenced to life imprisonment. The main reason for establishing his crime was: someone testified that he had said to the village guard, "If they want to escape on the way, you can shoot them dead." However, the village guard had already died in prison from illness and could not be cross-examined...

As for the tenant farmer named Wu, he was transformed from the plaintiff into the defendant. Because he owed the landlord some rent grain, he was arrested, hung up, and beaten. Feeling resentful, he came to the court to sue, and invited several witnesses. But during the trial, the judge asked him what kind of rope was used to tie him up. He said it was a palm rope. The witnesses said it was a hemp rope. He said it was more than one zhang long. The witnesses said it was seven or eight chi long. As a result, he was falsely accused of "false accusation" and sentenced to six months in prison. The three witnesses were also sentenced to perjury, also for six months in prison.

I have heard and seen too many examples like this. Therefore, there is a popular saying here: "One word in the public court, nine oxen cannot pull it back!" This is an experienced saying that many people have exchanged for at the cost of their grievances.

It is said that in many truly confirmed cases, as long as you flatly deny it, the judge cannot convict you. But in many unjust cases, you can be framed and convicted for a slip of the tongue. Therefore, those who suck people's marrow and shed people's blood can often go scot-free, while those who dare not even kill a chicken end up becoming "murderers" and sitting in prison...

I am a layman when it comes to law. I don't want to make arbitrary criticisms, nor am I interested in uttering any grand theories here. Of course, our judicial system has its own complete set. (To be continued)

### Overcoat

— Zhongyuan

This morning, my father, who usually sleeps in late, suddenly got up very early, didn't even have porridge, and hurriedly stepped out of the door. I asked him where he was going. He replied, "To the Commissioner's Office." I was startled and asked him, "What's the matter?" He smiled and said, "To draw lots!"

Later, I asked my mother and learned that recently the county received a batch of old clothes sent by the Relief Administration and decided to distribute them to all public education personnel in the county by drawing lots. Last night, they were notified that everyone had to go to the Commissioner's Office this morning to draw lots. It is said that those with a bright forehead can draw an overcoat or suit, while those with a dark forehead will only get some old socks, broken hats, or menstrual belts. "We have always been unlucky. It looks like we'll only get a share of old socks and menstrual belts. It's really not worth rushing out so early!" said my mother.

"That's not necessarily so. Maybe today Father will be lucky and draw a top-notch leather coat, so you can show it off in the New Year!" I said with a smile.

"Dream on!" Mother retorted me.

Waiting and waiting, until a quarter past nine, Father came back panting. It wasn't a dream. What he held in his hand was actually an overcoat. Although it couldn't be called "top-notch," it could be said that it was a "three-lifetime blessing" for such a "distinguished guest" to visit Mother's old box! So the whole family rejoiced, especially Mother, whose pair of bound feet almost flew up.

Father said triumphantly that when he drew this overcoat, even the secretary of the Commissioner's Office was envious and kept congratulating him. He also said that although the style of this overcoat was not very modern, it was indeed a genuine imported product. If we didn't believe it, he told us to put our noses up to it and smell it: "Isn't there a smell of milk and butter? Foreigners eat milk and butter, so their clothes have this smell."

Hearing this, Mother hurriedly put her nose to the overcoat, and while squinting and smiling, she mumbled: "This material is still very strong! At least it can be worn for five years; oh, after wearing it for five years, we can ask a Red Gang tailor to turn it over and wear it for another five years; oh! There's even flannel lining inside! In the future, when the outer fabric is torn, we can take out this flannel lining and make shirts, pants, and linings for cotton shoes..."

Ladies and gentlemen from across the Pacific, who eat milk and butter! If you see this Chinese woman, hunched over your old coat, planning her "ten-year plan," will you be surprised and amused, or will you shed tears of sorrow?

Long Serial

### Doubly Nesting, Doubly Flying (3)(5)

— Zhao Qingge

"What if I'm pushed too hard?" the landlady said, not wanting to be outdone.

"If I'm pushed too hard, I'll beat you, you old woman!" Boss Liao said, rolling up his sleeves and making a threatening gesture.

The landlady panicked and quickly grabbed the large medicine-cutting knife, holding it up defensively towards Boss Liao, while saying fiercely:

"Come on, I'll fight you to the death today! If I don't slaughter a pig during the New Year, I'll have to slaughter you!"

The landlady stepped forward with the knife, looking just like her executioner father. Boss Liao was a little afraid at this point. The landlady was wielding a shiny, murderous weapon, which was no joke! If he was careless, he could end up with a bloody head on the ground. But Boss Liao couldn't let the landlady see that he was afraid. Just as he was in a difficult position, Liao Liang happened to be in the courtyard, grabbing handfuls of the cut medicine and scattering it all over the ground. So Boss Liao had a flash of inspiration and quickly ran out, grabbed Liao Liang, and scolded him in a feigned anger.

"I'm already unlucky enough. You, you little devil, are still wasting medicine!"

Liao Liang burst into tears.

The landlady was indeed tricked. She hurriedly put down the knife and rushed over to grab Liao Liang back, scolding:

"You're unlucky, what does it have to do with my son? Shameless old ghost, you dare to vent your anger on a child."

After arguing with Boss Liao in a shrewish manner, the landlady returned to the room and cried for a while, wiping away her tears and snot. Boss Liao, fearing that things would escalate, changed his attitude and said to the landlady calmly:

"Business is bad, so I don't have much money. It's not that I deliberately don't want to buy a pig. Think about it, there are five or six shop assistants in the store, and at the end of the year, I have to give them bonuses and wages. I didn't even pay them last month. Where would I have extra money to buy a pig?"

"If business is bad, you should think of other ways! Buying a pig isn't worth losing ten strings of cash!" The landlady said, wiping the tears from the corner of her eyes, sobbing.

"What other ways are there? The world has changed. Foreign things are prospering, and Chinese things are just unlucky!" Boss Liao said, sighing with emotion.

"You can fire one shop assistant and buy a pig. If there's no business, why do you need so many shop assistants?"

These words reminded Boss Liao. He didn't adopt her suggestion to realize the landlady's plan to buy a pig, but he felt that this was a way to save expenses and reduce the burden. Anyway, there was still a lot of medicine in stock. First, there was no need to go out to purchase it anymore. Second, the medicine that had already been cut was enough to sell for three to five months. Therefore, the shop assistant who purchased the medicine could be fired. The apprentices who cut the medicine could also be fired. Only one master was enough. In this way, the Huichuntang would save a lot of money, and the family's life would be slightly more comfortable. (Buying a pig was naturally not a problem.) After deciding on this austerity policy, he decided to implement it before the end of the year.

The information about Huichuntang's austerity was told to Baoling by Liao Dong, who also congratulated Baoling that he was not included in the austerity budget. This indeed made Baoling feel gratified! He was not afraid of losing his job and having no food to eat, but he was afraid that if he lost his job, he would have to go back home. He didn't want to go back home; it was because he didn't want to be a parasite of the Mo family; he would rather be a slave of the Liao family!

### Dispute Erupts Among Rice Merchants; Black Market for Rice Emerges

Social Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Conduct Thorough Investigation and Prohibits Brokers from Entering the Market

Since the authorities have adopted strict management of the rice market, the market conditions appear to be very stable on the surface. However, in reality, rice stores have the notion of creating a black market because they have no goods to purchase. Yesterday's registered arrivals were approximately 3,700 shi, but transactions were very rare. When rice stores attempted to purchase from the rice wholesalers, the rice wholesalers claimed that they had already sold out. A dispute then arose between one rice wholesaler and one rice store. According to a certain gentleman in the rice industry, for the past three days of this week, the registered arrivals have been over 10,000 shi. However, for the first two days, transactions were only around 1,000 to 2,000 shi. This morning, it was even less, only several hundred shi, and all of it was inferior goods sold at high prices. The rice stores are truly suffering from a lack of goods to sell. It is heard that the Social Bureau is dispatching personnel to investigate, and yesterday posted a notice in the rice market, stating: "Upon investigation, the rice price in this city has gradually stabilized in recent days. It is hoped that rice merchants will exercise their conscience, conduct business in an orderly manner, and benefit the people's livelihood. However, according to reports, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants, engaging in speculation and manipulation, and engaging in black market transactions, resulting in the rise of black market rice prices in recent days. This shows that a few rice merchants are defiant and unafraid of the law, which is truly hateful and should be strictly prohibited to maintain the people's food supply. In addition to the announcement, it is urgently ordered that, starting from the date of this order, brokers are not allowed to enter the market, and black market transactions are strictly prohibited. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely punished without leniency upon discovery."

Yesterday, the rice market's source of supply was sluggish, and transactions were also rare. The situation was firm. Flour stores, on the other hand, were very active, and appetite for purchases was strong, with prices rising by over a thousand yuan. The soybean market trend turned firm and attractive. Raw peanuts were also selling well, with prices increasing by one or two thousand yuan. Broad beans were high and stable, while intermediate grades were flat. Corn was tired and then recovered, with prices rising by a thousand yuan. Small wheat from Ningbo was slightly purchased, and the flour market rose, followed by a rise of over a thousand yuan. Bean cakes' appetite for village sales was not good, firm in the morning and tired in the afternoon. The oil market digestion turned better, with prices increasing by two thousand yuan.

### Government Bonds Plummet - The Bitter Fruit of Speculation

Yesterday, a large multi-position trader in a building on Eighth Floor dumped a huge amount, and the situation suddenly became tragic. Series C bonds, which opened at around 5,200 yuan in the morning, gradually declined to 4,200 yuan before slightly stabilizing and closing a hundred yuan higher. The trend will continue to decline. The result was a tragic drop of 900 yuan compared to the previous close. Series A and B were dragged down by a small amount of 550 yuan, Series D fell by 700 yuan, and Series E by 600 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton Transactions are Both Smooth

Yesterday, the yarn market was very firm and attractive. The Guangzhou buyers suddenly had a strong appetite for buying, and absorbed large-scale yarns such as Double Horse and Golden Rooster. The price was raised by 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining medium and small-scale yarns followed suit and rose by 20,000 yuan. Twenty-count Great Flying Boat yarn was especially popular because it was favored by the Jiangxi buyers, so the spot goods were especially in demand. Fine yarn still had no progress, because the sales were not large. At noon, Fang Jian opened the yarn as usual. The price of 32-count or higher fine yarn was marked down by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous period. There were also 16 types of coarse and fine yarn threads, which were sold by voting.

Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegraph suddenly plummeted 39 to 46 points. The near-term contract was USD 28.70, the forward contract was USD 29.06, and the Meterlin spot price was USD 29.41. The local cotton transaction was increasingly smooth. The demand for cotton from private cotton mills was extremely urgent. Changzhou Dacheng and Minfeng cotton mills, Shanghai Anda Baofeng and other mills, each purchased 1,200 to 1,300 bales. In addition, Shenxin First Mill purchased extra-grade Meterlin at a price of 109,000 yuan, which was about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan higher than before.

### Silk and Satin are Weak and Declining

Yesterday, the artificial silk market was similar to the previous day in the morning, but fell 30,000 to 40,000 yuan in the afternoon. 120 Tianqiao filament opened at 1.48 million yuan, and traded at 1.44 million yuan in the afternoon. Miscellaneous brands of Beauty sold for 330,000 yuan in the morning, and slightly less 20,000 in the afternoon. Yinniao semi-lustrous goods were popular, and the price was the same as the previous day. 150 Jin San Ma filament was slightly less at 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. 75 Jin Ji semi-lustrous goods traded for 1.52 million yuan in the morning, but were short 20,000 yuan in the afternoon. Factory silk 75 points in even grade opened at 1.2 million to 1.225 million yuan. Middle-grade 5 dan silk was another 50,000 yuan higher compared to the previous day. Foreign company goods of high even grade had no transactions. Dry warp silk also did not open. The asking price for 5 dan heads was 560,000 to 600,000 yuan. For silk fabrics, Meiya quilt covers were 1.65 million yuan in the morning, and short 50,000 yuan in the afternoon, with very few transactions. Dacheng Gezi Bizhou had a maximum price of 6,090 yuan in the morning, but later some large traders sold at a high price, so it retraced slightly to 5,750 yuan, and then went down slightly another 50 yuan in the afternoon.

### Hankou Bristle Price - USD 4.30

The pig bristle market has been extremely quiet recently. The goods in Tianjin and Shanghai have no market. Recently, only 200 dan of Hankou bristles and 80 dan of Sichuan bristles were traded. Hankou bristles sold for USD 4.30 per pound. The price of Sichuan bristles was unchanged. In addition, 2,000 dan of Sichuan pig bristles traded in May and June have also been shipped and will be shipped to the United States in batches in the near future.

### Serge Demand Exceeds Supply

Serge, in addition to silk and artificial cotton, regardless of thick or thin, dark blue, primary colors, straw yellow, and straw green, are currently in demand for trading. Buyers from Chongqing, Chengdu, Henan, Hunan, and the Beijing-Hangzhou Road have successively requested samples. The industry colleagues in this street have also been absorbing each other. With the limited inventory, there is a trend of demand exceeding supply. Yin Feng 101, Hualun 210, Hua Jiu 18, and Hongkang 4000 and other brands are selling even better.

### Timber Actual Sales Not Weak

Yesterday, the timber market situation was strong and prosperous due to persistent actual sales and stimulated by gold currency. The market trend gradually improved, with slight increases in both foreign pine and local Anhui timber prices.

Furthermore, news arrived that the William Lyburn, a vessel managed by the Dodwell shipping company, was transporting 4,500,000 feet of lumber from Seattle. The ship was scheduled to arrive at the Wusongkou port last evening. However, due to a lack of space for floating docks within the harbor, it is temporarily anchored outside the mouth, awaiting entry.

### Central Bank Sells Off According to Market Prices: Gold Price Reduced by Over 40,000; Settlement Suspends Supply, Abundance Prevails; US Dollar Also Falls Back 70 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market initially started strong but then weakened. At the opening, prices were moderate. Afterward, the US dollar remained popular, bolstering buying power and pushing the price to 1,985,000 before gradually stabilizing. The Central Bank allocated 206 gold bars to the industry at a price of 1,960,000. Following this, the upward trend was hindered, and the Central Bank released over a hundred bars into the market, gradually shifting from strong to weak. Multiple parties lacked the power to resist, leading to substantial liquidation. At noon, the price fell back to 1,920,000. In the afternoon, the Central Bank's selling intentions intensified, repeatedly selling off and pushing the price down to within 1,900,000 before stabilizing slightly. As a result, the closing price was 45,000 lower than the previous day's. Gold ornaments were valued at 1,002,000. Silver ingots and silver dollars remained stable. The demand for unofficial discounts was high, with interest rates rising slightly to around 1.5 jiao.

The foreign currency, the US dollar, continued to advance sharply, but selling pressure gradually increased at higher levels. It opened at 2720 yuan in the morning. Afterward, demand continued to exceed supply, unexpectedly surging to 2810 yuan before slightly retracting. As multiple parties began to liquidate their positions, a turbulent situation arose. At noon, the price dropped to 2720 yuan as settlements concluded. The situation further weakened in the afternoon, with an abundance of supply, causing the price to fall back to around 2670 yuan before stabilizing slightly. Consequently, the closing price was 70 yuan lower than the previous day's. Hong Kong currency started strong but remained steady, falling back 10 yuan from 465 yuan to close, mirroring the previous day's closing. The same was true for Indian currency, closing at 565 yuan. Hong Kong currency had sell orders at 460 yuan, and the US currency was nominally flat but actually stagnant.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward as both the Sugar Merchants' Association and companies did not open for sales. The Association quoted prices for medium-grain white sugar at 78,500 to 79,000 yuan for double bags in the morning and 80,000 yuan for single bags. Prices softened slightly in the afternoon, initially holding the original prices but later changing to 79,500 to 78,500 yuan. Warehouse receipts were even tighter, trading at 81,500 to 82,000 yuan in the morning, then slightly decreasing to 81,750 to 81,500 yuan, and further softening to 80,000 yuan in the afternoon. Three-and-a-half carloads of white sugar were priced at 95,000 yuan. Special grade Qing sugar was offered at 65,000 yuan, and the next grade at 62,000-63,000 yuan. Rock sugar was priced at 100,500 to 115,000 yuan, and refined Qing sugar at 65,000-66,000 yuan, later increasing by 2,000-3,000 yuan without any transactions.

### Reasons for Caustic Soda Price Surge

The price of caustic soda, an industrial raw material, has risen sharply in recent days. According to investigations, the reasons are as follows:

(1) Local spot inventory is dwindling daily. (2) Demand from the dyeing and weaving industries and other regions is substantial. (3) Export procedures from Europe and the United States are cumbersome. (4) Import and export companies are unwilling to accept new orders. (5) A certain foreign firm has not been allocating goods for a long time. These factors have created the conditions for a sharp price increase.

### Long Positions Cashed Out at High Prices; Chinese and Foreign Stocks Enter Slump Again; China Textile Increases Capital, Giving Two Shares for Each Share

Chinese stocks initially stabilized but then weakened, though the process was quite steady. The overall trend shifted to consolidation. Yong'an Spinning reached a high price of 6,150 yuan, Meiya 4,650 yuan, Jingfu 320 yuan, Xinguang 313 yuan, and Qinxing 242 yuan. The low prices were Yong'an Spinning 5,700 yuan, Meiya 4,350 yuan, Jingfu 298 yuan, Xinguang 292 yuan, and Qinxing 218 yuan. Prices hovered around these levels at noon. As a result, due to some liquidation of long positions, Yong'an Spinning, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang all experienced slight declines. Qinxing fell by more than half a percentage point. Among other popular small and medium-sized stocks, besides New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, which remained steady due to its low price, the rest also saw slight declines. Veteran stocks also weakened. Operators in foreign stocks remained inactive, and securities firms also stood by as observers. Consequently, with some unloading from foreign merchants and financial circles, the situation could not be sustained. Yishun Spinning fell by slightly less than 10% from an opening of around 12,500 yuan to just over 1,000 yuan. Apart from Yeguang and Steel Industries, which were being absorbed, the rest of the stocks all saw slight declines. By the close at noon, Yishun Spinning was down slightly less than 10%, while Yeguang and Steel Industries remained steady. The rest had all fallen back by about half a percentage point.

Furthermore, the China Textile Mill's capital adjustment plan was approved by shareholders yesterday, increasing the value from 99 million pseudo-Central Reserve Certificates to 29.7 million legal tender, with each old share receiving two bonus shares.

### Ningzhou Sprout Tea Sells Well

Ningzhou sprout tea has been adopted in the Suzhou area due to its affordable price. Unfortunately, the market inventory is low, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Yesterday, the market only saw the sale of over forty dan by the Anhui Tea Company, priced at 30,000 yuan per dan. The market atmosphere remained solid. Although other grades from nearby villages are still hesitant to watch the market, holders maintain a firm stance. With local shops and firms continuously acquiring tea, the trend is considered sharp.

### Imported and Exported Poultry and Livestock Must Be Reported for Inspection First

Imported and exported livestock and poultry often carry infectious diseases. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has resumed inspections from the 10th of this month. All livestock and poultry that have not been inspected and issued a certificate will not be allowed to be declared for import or export. The Ministry has been notified to inform the Jianghai Customs to assist in accordance with the regulations. All livestock imported from foreign countries must be reported to the Bureau for inspection by filling out an inspection form 24 hours before import. If necessary, they may be required to submit a certificate of inspection issued by the veterinary institute of the source area or the exporting country's government. Upon arrival, officials from the Bureau will conduct inspections on board the ship or at other designated locations. If they are deemed healthy and free from disease, a certificate will be issued for release.

### Chinese Silk Sales to England: 2.5 Million Pounds, Official British Estimates

[Reuters, London, 12th] A representative of the British Board of Trade recently stated in response to an inquiry in the House of Commons that Britain could obtain 17,000,000 pounds of raw silk from Japan in the next twelve months, of which 6% could be allocated to the United Kingdom. This proportion is based on the pre-war percentage of Japanese trade with the United States. Regarding how much raw silk Britain could obtain from China, it was stated that it is currently impossible to predict. It is expected that 2,500,000 pounds could be obtained after the cocoon harvest this season. The export of raw silk from China is not subject to any allocation arrangements.

### American Steel Industry Stocks

Chinese Holdings Have Decreased

[Reuters, New York, 12th] The amount of American steel industry stocks held by foreigners only accounts for 5.36% of the common stock and 1.488% of the preferred stock, spread across fifty countries around the world. Only five countries hold more than 5,000 shares of preferred and common stock. In Asia, China has decreased its holdings from 1,336 shares at the end of last year to 420 shares. Manila holds only 100 shares, while India holds 70 shares of common stock and 141 shares of preferred stock.

### Who is Hoarding US Dollars? Import-Export Merchants Say It's Jews and Speculators

Recently, merchants have found it difficult to obtain approval for foreign exchange to purchase non-essential goods. They have sought alternative routes by depositing US dollars in foreign banks in Shanghai, and the foreign banks issue demand drafts payable in the US. They directly send these drafts to the US to place orders, saving the trouble of applying for foreign exchange and allowing them to place orders at any time. However, according to the Import-Export Association, the widespread rumor that import-export merchants are hoarding large amounts of US dollars is not entirely true. The majority of the activity is driven by Jewish merchants and speculators seeking to profit.

Furthermore, in order to reduce the massive import of non-essential goods, the authorities are strictly enforcing the review of foreign exchange applications. It is rumored that foreign banks in Shanghai will be instructed to stop the outflow of currency, and the customs authorities will be instructed to conduct detailed inspections of imported goods. If there is no foreign exchange settlement certificate, the goods will not be allowed to be imported.

### Rayon Supply Difficult; American and Italian Prices Exceed Shanghai; Surplus Enemy Assets Are Incomplete

Before the war, most of the rayon raw materials needed by our country's silk factories came from Italy. Since the outbreak of World War II, the source of Italian goods has been cut off. With no rayon factories in the country, Japanese rayon flooded the market. During the one to two years before the victory, Japan itself was bombed repeatedly, and transportation became increasingly difficult, further diminishing the source of rayon. After the victory, it was difficult for Japanese rayon factories to recover temporarily, and the same was true for Italy. Currently, the supply of rayon in Shanghai relies entirely on the enemy property distributed by the Textile Construction Company and the China Trust Bureau. However, due to the limited supply and incomplete assortment, it is difficult to maintain price stability. The official price of rayon on the American market is 50 cents per pound, while the black market price has reached 2 US dollars per pound. Each case of 200 pounds requires 400 US dollars. The production cost in Italy is similar to that in the United States. If shipping costs and tariffs to Shanghai are added, it is estimated that each case would cost 2.5 million yuan, more than 1 million yuan higher than the market price. According to industry insiders, if the country does not find a way to produce rayon, prices may rise.

### Economic Briefs

The manager of the Shanghai branch of the Agricultural Bank of China was originally concurrently held by Assistant Manager Zhu Runsheng. It is reported that the Standing Committee of the Agricultural Bank has approved the appointment of Pan Jiufen as the manager of the Shanghai branch last week.

Overseas remittances from Nanyang have been gradually increasing recently. To facilitate overseas Chinese, the Bank of China has dispatched personnel to prepare for the reopening of its Batavia branch in the Dutch East Indies. It is expected to officially open on August 1st. Branches in Surabaya and Ipoh are also being planned for reopening. If the situation in the Dutch East Indies improves, they should be able to open on Double Tenth Day this year.

Publishing Industry Special Edition

### A Word of Advice to the Chinese Publishing Industry

— A Warning

The Chinese publishing industry is evidently quite impoverished, and now seems to be somewhat pathological. Chinese publications, analyzed according to their nature, can generally be classified into three categories. The first category consists of propaganda materials from politicians. These are not necessarily explicitly political articles. This type of publication may be literary, sociological, philosophical, or even scientific, but their primary purpose is not academic but rather a tool for politicians to achieve certain political goals. The content of these publications is often a kind of Party jargon. The second category is textbooks prescribed by the Ministry of Education. These are all stereotyped articles that must meet certain standards. There is no spirit of academic freedom here, and no room for free expression. The third category is pornographic publications. They cater to low tastes. The writers only care about payment, and the publishers only care about making money. Here, anything goes, from fabricating rumors to creating incidents out of thin air.

Please readers, choose fairly! How many books in the Chinese publishing industry are purely academic research? How many books introduce the latest Western science? How many books introduce the daily knowledge necessary for modern life? There are so few it's pitiful! Why? Because there is no market, publishers are unwilling to lose money. If publishers don't want something, no one dares to try writing it.

We believe that the Chinese publishing industry places too much emphasis on business. Therefore, the things they publish always try to cater to the readers' tastes, instead of raising the readers' tastes. We believe that this is not serving the cultural community, but hindering cultural development. We hope that publishers will publish more academic works, books that fairly discuss the world situation and national construction, and publications that are beneficial to daily social life. Political parties can have their propaganda tools, but the general publishing industry should be liberated from political parties. The publishing industry can meet the needs of the masses, but at the same time it should shoulder the responsibility of raising the cultural level of the masses.

### "Thought and Society"

— Chuan Tongxian

Author: Zhang Dongsun

Publisher: The Commercial Press

Date: Chongqing Edition, March 1946

Pages: 204

Recently, Mr. Zhang sent me his book "Thought and Society," published in Chongqing, which is a sequel to his "Knowledge and Culture." The entire book has nine chapters, which can be divided into six major parts: (1) A general discussion of the social factors of human thought; (2) An explanation of three knowledge systems; (3) The relationship between philosophy and social organization; (4) The Chinese tradition—Confucian thought and Neo-Confucianism; (5) The Western tradition—Christian thought, socialism, and democracy; (6) The future of Chinese culture.

Because this book has not yet been released in Shanghai, I think everyone would like to see it as soon as possible. Now I will just draw an outline of the content of this book and give a brief introduction. As for my criticisms of this book, I will publish them in the next issue.

I. Factors in the Organization of Human Thought

There are three basic factors in the organization of human thought: (1) The perceptual configuration of biological nature; (2) The purely formal conceptual framework; (3) The functional determination of social culture. To put it more simply, they are (1) sensory experience, (2) conceptual form, and (3) social culture. These three layers are mutually intertwined rather than independent. Human thought is based on concepts, and concepts are influenced by perceptual configurations on the one hand and determined by culture on the other. In other words, the formation of concepts is due to two aspects: one is due to the schematization of perception, and the other is due to the symbolization of representation. Human perception of the outside world has a Gestalt organization, and the image left behind by this perception is not exactly the same as the perceptual object. This image is often extremely vague and only retains a general outline. Thus, the specificity of the perceptual object gradually disappears. And images with similar outlines are organized to form a universal prototype, which is what we call a concept. But a concept is not only a schematization of perception on the subjective side, but also a symbolization of representation for mutual communication between individuals. Because of the need for social co-existence, we need to express our emotions to each other, so there is language, and the symbolization and abstraction of language becomes thought.

II. Three Knowledge Systems

In essence, human knowledge is based on the biological standpoint on the one hand and inseparable from the background of social culture on the other. Thus, several systems of human knowledge are built on these two aspects. Mr. Zhang specifically proposes three major knowledge systems and explains their relationship with society. These three knowledge systems are (1) the common sense system, (2) the scientific system, and (3) the metaphysical system. Common sense is created by distinguishing it from a unified whole of perception. This creation is purely for convenience, and this convenience is due to biological use, psychological simplification, and social learning. Science extracts facts from the nature of things. Metaphysics treats ideals as reality, and its purpose is to create "ideal reality." Mr. Zhang said: "The tool relied upon in the common sense system is the distinction of perception, and the method is analogy. In the scientific system, the tool relied upon is the analytical effort of reason, and the method is measurement and experimentation. As for metaphysics, it relies on 'insight.' It is the so-called deductive method."

These three knowledge systems are three realms created to meet cultural needs. The common sense system is for the convenience of daily life habits; science is for human beings to deal with nature, understand nature, and explain nature. Metaphysics is limited to the cultural aspect, and it should include morality, society, and politics. Metaphysical knowledge is the reason for establishing faith. It is not only "knowing", but also naturally changes one's behavior after knowing.

Although these three knowledge systems are built on psychological foundations, their development is entirely within the scope of culture.

III. Philosophical Theories and Social Organization

The predecessor of metaphysics is religion, and religion is the method for human beings to find spiritual comfort. Metaphysics is not the highest knowledge or the truest knowledge. It is limited to the realm of ideals, and it is only finding reasons for actual life. This knowledge system is "non-experimental" and at the same time must be "historical." The nature of metaphysics is determined by tradition. Its problems are inherited from tradition, and the concepts it uses are based on its own tradition. Therefore, Zhang Guangsheng believes that the concepts used and the problems raised by metaphysics express the tradition of that culture. Taking British empiricism as an example, this philosophical thought is closely related to the entire British culture. From official experience, the "anti-mysticism", individualism, and utilitarianism traditions are deduced.

From another perspective, social organization has its own psychological foundation. Society cannot be separated from language. If individual minds do not possess a common concept for mutual communication, society cannot be established. The cultural tradition of a nation not only includes social systems, moral standards, but also ways of thinking and national character. For example, Chinese society has a set of Chinese-style thoughts, and Indian society has a set of Indian-style thoughts. As for how human thought determines actual society, Mr. Zhang puts forward a special argument. He believes that the active influence of thought is limited to stabilizing and ordering society, but if someone uses thought to stir up social change, this is not very powerful. Therefore, Mr. Zhang said: "Social systems are shaken more by their own flaws. Theories can only fuel the waves, not create them. As for turning from shaking and breaking to stability, the power of theory is not small in this process. Because it is necessary to make almost everyone in a society comparatively acknowledge that such an organization is appropriate or close to reasonable, so that people's hearts can be at peace... From this, we know why many scholars come out and work hard on the explanation of 'reason', wanting to establish a theoretical system, but in fact they are only trying to obtain a better state for human affairs, or only seeking a relatively comfortable state psychologically." (Page 86)

IV. Chinese and Western Traditions

The Chinese and Western traditions include moral standards, social systems, and political principles, and there must be a set of metaphysical mysteries as its backbone. Chinese philosophy history has a series of concepts that represent the mental prototypes of Chinese culture. Their development all has its social background and social influence. Mr. Zhang proposed several major concepts, "Heaven," "Dao," "Virtue," "Benevolence," "Righteousness," "Principle," "Nature," and "Ritual," and explained them systematically and developmentally.

And I want to infer the influence on social and political aspects from the development of these concepts. In the pre-Qin period, the Chinese tradition was Confucian thought, and in the Song and Ming dynasties, it was Neo-Confucianism. Ancient social organizations always tended to the collective whole and neglected individual characteristics. The emphasis on heaven by Chinese Confucians or the emphasis on the unity of all things by Neo-Confucians is the thought of emphasizing the whole. The characteristic of Chinese culture is that there is a scholar class in Chinese society, and this scholar class is responsible for maintaining this tradition.

For the Western tradition, Mr. Zhang proposed (1) Christian thought, (2) socialism, and (3) democracy, two thought systems. The teachings of Christianity can be summarized into five points: (1) believe in only one God; (2) take love as the nature of God; (3) take faith as life; (4) original sin; (5) eternal life. The development of Western culture relies on the maintenance of this Christian spirit. Marx's socialism also has several unique concepts: (1) surplus value tax, (2) historical materialism, (3) class struggle, (4) deduction (formerly translated as dialectics), (5) the social revolution theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The motivation of this theory is still to save the world, and its sincerity is even greater than any religion. Democracy in the West is not only a system, but also a culture, a way of life. This concept comes from socialism, and it contains all aspects of culture. Democracy is not only the spiritual tradition of the West, but also the treasure of all mankind.

V. The Future of Chinese Culture

Since Chinese culture came into contact with Western culture, it is now in a transitional period. The first time Western culture transitioned from the Middle Ages to modern times, it produced naturalism, individualism, nationalism, and rationalism. The second time it transitioned to modern times, modern thought is socialist, internationalist, emotionalist, and collectivist. Since China came into contact with Western culture, she must not only accept the individualism and liberalism of the 19th century in the West, but also accept the socialism and collectivism of the 20th century in the West at the same time. Thus, China is caught in a double contradictory life; on the one hand, she must resolve the conflict between Chinese and Western cultures, and on the other hand, she must adapt to two different Western cultures. Mr. Zhang said: "Today's problem in China is that it missed the Western cultural stage... For example, it has not been long since China changed the imperial system, and the atmosphere of autocracy still exists in people's hearts. In theory, only freedom and civil rights should be advocated, but in the trend, the meaning of the government representing the national whole must be raised, which is no different from helping the government to carry out its long-standing habits of dictatorship."

The only way to solve China's problems now is to restore the mission of the original scholar class. Let them stand up and use the power of public opinion to distinguish right from wrong, and use international organizations and international economic forces to give these scholar class people an independent and autonomous "education association" that is not controlled by the government, so that international forces can have moral, rational, and cultural forces in the country as new blood for the construction of a new China.

### "On Foreign Investment in China"

— Yang Jie

Author: C. F. Remer Translator: Jiang Xuekai Zhao Kangjie Publisher: Commercial Press

The abolishment of unequal treaties has stirred the confidence of many friends concerned with China's economic construction. The victorious end of the war against Japan, the replacement of the Japanese overseas market, and the utilization of domestic industrial equipment have aroused our immense hopes. All sorts of favorable conditions seem to have been arranged, awaiting only our efforts. However, since the end of the war to this day, we have seen not the erection of chimneys, but only the successive cessation of smoke. Whether engaged in light or heavy industry, all are lamenting the severity of the industrial crisis. This crisis is multifaceted: foreign exchange policies promote the decline of foreign trade [foreign exchange policies only encourage imports, neglecting the adverse consequences on production], currency inflation promotes labor-management disputes... Regarding foreign exchange policies and currency inflation, many scholars have already discussed them in detail. However, the capital, one of the three elements of production, has been discussed by very few people. I specifically recommend C. F. Remer's "On Foreign Investment in China," a book that, I believe, is not superfluous in today's call for unified efforts to promote China's modernization!

This unique and systematic study of foreign investment in China, although using data from before 1930, allows us to glean the trends of foreign capital formation and its inherent factors from the summarization of past facts, serving as a reference for us today. Remer wrote this book entirely under the commission of the Pacific International Institute. Because at that time, the utilization of foreign capital and foreign investment in China was not only a topic of enthusiastic discussion among Chinese, but also a subject of attention for foreigners. Therefore, at the Pacific Institute's meetings, foreign investment in China was listed as a major topic. For the sake of thorough understanding, Remer was commissioned to complete this book. Remer was an appropriate choice, having taught for many years at St. John's University in Shanghai and the University of Michigan in the United States. He possessed academic expertise. To complete this book, in addition to sending out thousands of questionnaires, he personally investigated in various treaty ports in China, as well as in England, America, France, Japan, and Southeast Asia. This diligent spirit has led to the book's achievements today!

The book is divided into two volumes. The first volume, General Discussion, discusses foreign investment in China and China's economic and financial status in the international arena, consisting of fourteen chapters: Introduction, China's Population and Resources, China in the Old Era, Modern Economic Relations, An Overview of Foreign Investment in China, Overview of Enterprise Investment, The Significance of Enterprise Investment, China's Foreign Debt, Foreign Investment and the Balance of Payments, Remittances from Overseas Chinese, International Trade and the Movement of Gold and Silver, China's International Balance of Payments, and China's International Economic Status. The second volume, Specific Discussions, consists of seven chapters: American Investment in China, British Investment in China, Japanese Investment in China, Russian Investment in China, French Investment in China, German Investment in China, and Investment in China by Belgium and the Nordic countries.

The general discussion is a general narrative. The author divides foreign investment in China into three periods: before 1900, before 1914, and before 1930. In the translator's opinion, this division has special significance. The period before 1900 was from the Opium War to the Boxer Rebellion, the situation of foreign investment in China. The period before 1914 was the situation before World War I. The period before 1930 was the situation before the September 18th Incident. We are not interested in this kind of narrative of aggressive investment. What we want to know is the other side.

In the opening sentence of the introduction, the author said: "Foreign investment in China is but one aspect of China's international economic relations and China's general international relations. Seeing the true face of these relationships clearly reveals the part of the world that China occupies. Understanding these relationships allows one to understand the modern world." Some scholars who study the Chinese economy believe that the Chinese economy is just a mess, with no principles to follow, or only some biased views. The author seems to intentionally avoid these, and after on-the-ground observations, he is confident that he can obtain some important facts from the collected facts and economic analysis. However, he does not believe that this is purely objective and without prejudice, because he believes that no matter who or what organization is examining the behavior of others and then making judgments, it is impossible to be completely objective. His approach is simply to do his best.

The author's conclusion on the nature of Chinese economic research is that, while the family is indeed the unit of Chinese society, it is also the most prominent unit in economics. This economy (family economy) is clearly different from the European and American economies (political economy). European and American political economy is where politics and economics are mutually supportive, focusing on the relationship between the state and the people's economic activities. Therefore, all mercantilism, laissez-faire policies, and neo-mercantilism simply incorporate economics and politics into the system of racial ideas and policies, which is also called economic nationalism. However, the author believes that the Chinese family economy cannot be understood simply by applying a Western term, because the most prominent thing in China is the separation of politics and economics.

He believes that the capital for China to develop industry cannot be obtained domestically given the generally poor living standards of the Chinese people. Although he also thought of the railway and other operating revenues, which could create new construction, this path seems impassable due to improper management and poor management. Therefore, he believes that the only source of capital is to rely on foreign investment. There are three ways to obtain the necessary capital:

(1) Following the example of the great powers, grant all powers to the government and officials.

(2) Develop private enterprises under Chinese collective individualism.

(3) Communism.

He believes that developing along the first route easily tends toward national socialism, which Chinese traditional politics likes, but an untrained official class will not easily achieve this goal. The second is to develop private enterprises, which must first form a new concept and have a constitution that constrains officials and the people, giving freedom to private enterprises and guaranteeing their rights. The third is welcomed by the rural tradition, but to succeed, it must adapt to the family and the countryside, but leading China's economic development is a difficult dream to realize. In summary, although he provided three routes, he only focused on the first two. Therefore, in the seventh chapter, The Significance of Enterprise Investment, he repeatedly mentioned that there are two routes for China's future management organization: one is government-led national socialism, and the other is private enterprises under the leadership of merchants that are suitable for Chinese industrialists.

The following specific section describes the actual situation of each group's investment, limited by space, I cannot do a detailed description.

The author said: "China's political security depends on economic security, and China's economic security also depends on political security." Today, it seems to have another layer of meaning. China's industrialization is necessary, and capital is indispensable. Don't miss the opportunity, I hope the government opens its eyes and does it boldly, and I hope that those in the opposition will promote this matter, and don't let future generations regret today's foolishness!

### Introducing "British Dominions"

— Sun Hang

Author: Lou Bangyan Publisher: Commercial Press

The British Empire is a product of history. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the composition of Britain from a logical point of view. Perhaps it is better to say that Britain itself is a special logic that cannot be confused with other established systems.

For example, using the concept of a modern country to say that Britain is a country is correct, but also wrong. Britain is a large country with the elements that a country should have, but the components of Britain, especially those dominions, are by no means provinces or local governments within a country, but also seem to be small and large countries. For example, under the United Nations mechanism, Britain's dominions such as Canada and Australia have equal footing with other countries. For example, if other parts of Britain declare war on Germany, Ireland can safely maintain neutrality. These are mysteries and challenges for researchers of political systems. But this is not Britain's fault. Studying something should be based on the facts.

Therefore, in studying the composition of Britain, especially the relationship between Britain and the dominions, established political theories are sometimes useless and impractical. Someone with a little political knowledge often finds it difficult to understand works on the British system. Those who explain the British system must first put forward the particularity and explain it thoroughly, and then let the readers compare it with traditional theories themselves, or more conveniently, the author himself helps the readers to compare; the worst thing to do is to first shoehorn the traditional theories, and then ignore those British-style beauties and criticize them.

Mr. Lou Bangyan's recent book, British Autonomy, has this style. This is a thin book of less than one hundred pages, which includes six of Mr. Lou's recent papers on the British dominions. Although it is not a book in terms of the system but a collection of six articles, it is very attractive to beginners or people who know some political systems.

The narration here is very easy to understand. There are no piles of political theories, no forced compromises with logic. Mr. Lou simply describes the British system in the British way. We seem to browse through it, just like sitting on a streamlined British car and traveling in Britain. Everything is British, very comfortable and natural.

The whole book describes a lot of facts, and the analysis is also very detailed. For those who do not understand the British system, this is an introductory book; for those who understand a lot of traditional theories, this is a reference book.

But the six articles were not written at the same time nor published at the same time. There are inevitably repetitions in meaning. Readers should understand that what the author wrote is not a book but a magazine article, so don't be too demanding of him. The contents of the six articles are as follows: First, the British dominions and the King. Second, the British dominions and the British Parliament. Third, the British dominions and the Imperial Conference. Fourth, the external relations of the British dominions. Fifth, the British dominions and war. Sixth, the treaty-making power of the British Empire.

Among each article, the historical record is very valuable. Britain was not born in its current form. It is a product of history. Without understanding her history, one cannot talk about her system. Mr. Lou is very good at seizing this opportunity. The causes and consequences he talks about can make readers feel that everything is in order.

Among the six chapters, the first chapter, which describes the relationship between the King and the dominions, is the most thorough. The King is a feature of Britain, and can also be said to be the source of the British system. Understanding the King's position, we already have a concept of Britain. Therefore, understanding the first chapter, and then the following chapters, will not be difficult. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters actually discuss the same theme, that is, the external relations of the British dominions. The three chapters have commonalities and continuity, just like the drawings made by an architect. Looking at a three-dimensional house from three aspects, the situation is clear at a glance.

At the end of the book, there are two book reviews introducing two books on British issues. At the beginning of the second book review, Mr. Lou said: "There are not a few books on general issues of the British Empire, but it is quite difficult to find a relatively simple one that is easily understood by the general public. Stephen Leacock's recently written book "The British Empire" can meet the conditions of being thorough and easy to understand, and can be introduced to the general public." I think Mr. Lou's "British Dominions" can also meet this condition and can be introduced to the general public.

### This Column Adds: Readers' Mailbox

Recently, some young and studious friends often write to ask the editor how to read and what books to read. Therefore, we plan to add a readers' mailbox in the next issue of this journal to systematically introduce readers to books in various fields, and are willing to answer various questions from readers about reading. Letters of inquiry are welcome.

### Cultural News

The "Wen Chao Monthly" Volume 1, Issue 2, published by the Wen Chao Press, was published on the first of this month. The content includes Zheng Boqi's National Research and Literary Popularization, Li Jianwu's Flaubert and Turgenev, Zhao Jingshen's Reading Kang Dui Shan's Collected Works, Zang Kejia's Family Letters, and Jin Sheng Yu Zhen co-edited by Lao She and Zhao Qingge, etc., more than ten articles. The content is extremely exciting. Each copy is still sold for six hundred yuan. It is said to be exclusively distributed by Zhengzhong Bookstore.

Female writer Feng Zi, formerly suffering from appendicitis, was cured after surgery at the Fifth Hospital. After a good recovery, she has now moved to the Wen Chao Publishing House in Hongkou. Following the doctor's orders, she needs to stay in and rest, so she will not be able to engage in writing work recently.

My country's science is backward, and the general public's scientific knowledge is also very poor. According to statistics from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, among the 65 types of publications applying for registration, only five are scientific. During this period when science is needed to build the country, the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers shoulders the task of promoting and disseminating electrical knowledge and publishes a popular electrical publication—"Electrical World Monthly." The inaugural issue of the journal was published on June 1. In terms of layout and content, the goal is to popularize. In the future, regarding the selection of materials, if it can be as popular as possible, so as to match the general level of scientific knowledge in China, and add more illustrations to supplement the lack of textual explanations. The journal is distributed by the China Science Company and is on sale in bookstores inside and outside the city.

Reading "The Second Generation" Scholar

Cui Wanqiu's work "The Second Generation" was published, reprinted, and reprinted again in Chongqing, and all copies were sold out. The New York Herald Tribune's editorial once wrote an article for evaluation, believing that during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, there were two valuable full-length novels, worthy of reading, one is "The Second Generation", and the other is Zhang Henshui's "The Great River Flows East".

The Shanghai version of "The Second Generation" has been added and deleted by Mr. Chu and published by Readers' Bookstore. The content is about the love story of a couple during the Battle of Xuzhou and the Battle of Wuhan. The Herald Tribune's evaluation of it is not comparable to ordinary love novels, castles in the air, focusing on business acumen, or novels suitable for low-level tastes. In a grim war atmosphere, it either uses its own life experience or depicts social forms, writing truthfully. If it is not based on facts, how can it be so realistic.

When I read "The Second Generation", from the author's plain narration, the aura of Miss Hua Xihua's charming, wisdom, and the innate feminine beauty of a maiden spirit will immediately be reflected in my mind.

Liu Jianming's affair with Lei Dasheng is depicted with sadness, saying: The love between husband and wife is not absolute. If men and women are separated, it is easy to have problems. I understand this very well. However, she has only been separated from me for half a year, and it is not clear whether I am alive or dead, and she has already remarried. This inevitably makes people feel too cold. There are many men in the world, why not find someone else, but insist on finding my fellow countryman, my classmate, my colleague?" How can we bear to finish reading it? I cannot help but sympathize with him! Liu Jianming is an allegory of a very active section chief in the current Army Headquarters.

Others, such as the personality of the division commander Lin Wenhua, say that he is rough, straightforward and quick-witted, which is indeed the true character of a soldier, which shows the breadth of the author's life range.

The two characters in the so-called Low-Key Club, Zhu Fushan, refer to Zhou Fohai, and Meng Bowen, namely Hui Zhongming, are extremely obvious writing techniques. The Low-Key Club is a place that Miss Hua Xihua and others are unwilling to go. From the Low-Key Club, one can see what kind of people Zhu Fushan and Meng Bowen are. "The Second Generation" mainly writes about Ye Weiming and Zheng Xihua getting to know each other before the Anti-Japanese War and engaging in national salvation work after the Anti-Japanese War, which are mostly the author's actual life, so the writing is interesting and incisive. Ye Weiming traveled thousands of miles to the battlefield to see his lover, it is true: "A lover makes a fool turn into a genius." "Those who do not love money or beauty are fools."

### The Satire of the Food Department

— Shao Fu

After reading the official letter from the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner's Office to the Executive Yuan for correcting the malpractice of grain loans, it is infuriating and heartbreaking!

All citizens of Shanghai should stand up and support Commissioner Cheng's case and demand that the government execute these corrupt officials who are derelict in their duties and disregard the lives of the people in order to uphold the law and punish corruption. Otherwise, this angry fire will make every citizen mad and will incite other unexpected events.

The government holds grain loans, originally to relieve the people's food, but now from the ten facts investigated and listed in the official letter from the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, grain is no different from exploiting citizens, increasing the burden on citizens, and letting a few grain officials make a fortune. We want to ask the government, is this the purpose? If not, what should be done with these corrupt officials? Let them wander overseas? Let them eat their fill of the people's blood and enjoy themselves there? To be honest, we believe that the government will definitely "use heavy penalties in troubled times, punish one to warn a hundred" for this shocking corruption case, because there is no reason for the government not to do so.

The social atmosphere has deteriorated to this point, and many people scold unscrupulous merchants. We admit that there are unscrupulous people among merchants, but why do they have the guts to commit fraud? Are they really not afraid of the law? From the grain loan case, we can believe that there is a group of corrupt officials colluding with them, supporting them, and giving them convenience to collude to exploit the common people.

Finally, we must all pay close attention to the development of this matter. The supernatural powers of this group of corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants are quite small. They will use various methods to escape. If you don't believe it, on the same day that the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner's Office announced the case, the Food Department issued a so-called "abolition of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office and the establishment of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Office." It is still Director Yang Xizhi and Deputy Directors Ye Xinming and Wang Daren. It's just changing the soup but not the medicine. This is a smokescreen.

It seems that the Food Department is joking with the Jiangsu District Supervisory Commissioner's Office. We have such a feeling, but the Food Department is too majestic, because this kind of satire is unbearable for anyone.

### Preliminary to the Police District System

— Jin Xie Shan

Yesterday, I met a Mr. Hou, who works at the ×× district police station. We chatted about the police district system.

Mr. Hou is from Beiping (Beijing) and graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy. He has served in the police bureau for many years and has rich experience in both police science theory and practice. Our conversation began as follows:

"The term 'police district system' is really quite foreign to us," I started.

"No, this term has actually been around for a long time," he replied with interest. "It was implemented in Beiping for many years before the war and achieved very good results. The police and the people became one, truly achieving a harmonious atmosphere. Anyone who saw it would feel a sense of peace and happiness."

"Oh, but why must police visits be conducted in the evening? This seems to greatly disrupt the peaceful lives of citizens!" I asked curiously.

"That's all just disruptive propaganda," he said. "The anxiety that the police district system causes among the general public is caused by these absurd rumors. Why would visits have to be in the middle of the night? Such rumors are clearly self-defeating. Unless there is a specific incident, it would never happen! As for the way visits were conducted in Beiping in the past, it was not like what people imagine today, where the police bureau would bring a team of people, knock on doors in a pompous manner, and ask questions incessantly, which is annoying. Instead, it was done in a more intentional and unintentional way." He paused for a moment and then said:

"For example, if a police officer wants to visit a certain resident, he can choose a time when Mr. × is free or when he is strolling along the road. Then, the police officer can chat with the person he wants to visit in various different and natural ways, without making him feel bothered at all. Over time, they might even become good friends. The police officer can casually enter the resident's home – like visiting an old friend – to rest or have a cup of tea and be welcomed. The resident can also casually enter the police bureau, nod his head, and borrow the phone. This is very convenient for everyone. The impression that citizens of Beiping had of the police bureau was never like the reaction of citizens in Shanghai today, who feel fear at the mention of the police bureau. This can be said to be a side effect of the implementation of the police district system. Because only in this way can the police and the people achieve true cooperation."

"So what exactly is the purpose of implementing the police district system?" I asked again.

"Regarding this question, the general public thinks that the responsibility of police officers is to catch criminals, which is of course a necessary responsibility. However, the highest goal of the police bureau is not to consider catching people as the only ultimate responsibility. The best and most perfect police administration should prevent the occurrence of crime. The police district system largely adds such a goal to its purpose. Because the people can live and work in peace and contentment only when unfortunate things do not happen. Otherwise, even if the police bureau helps solve the case after something happens, it is still not a peaceful experience. Therefore, preventing the occurrence of crime is the highest task of the police bureau. The implementation of the police district system will carry out this task, clearly understanding the living conditions of the general public and the whereabouts of petty criminals. I ask, where can petty criminals use their skills under vigilant surveillance? The peace and contentment of the people will then be guaranteed!"

"Will the police district system also assist in political work?" I asked.

"That will never happen. The police district system is entirely for preventing petty criminals from causing trouble. Politics is politics, and police affairs are police affairs; this is very clearly separated. If this causes anxiety for some people, it is completely unnecessary!"

This conversation gave me a new understanding of the police district system and also dispelled the more or less negative impressions that I had picked up from some newspaper propaganda.

### Japanese Prisoner Slogan: Wolfish Ambitions

— Feng Yi

I recently received the May 18th Guilin Guangxi Daily. Although there were only a few advertisements on the first advertisement page, one can imagine a glimpse of the cityscape of Guilin. On Zhengyang Road, there is the Xijing Theater, performing excellent dramas day and night, and promoting itself with "comfortable seats and refreshing air." On Lequn Road, there is the Samsung Chang Cinema, which is currently showing "Earth Roars." In addition, there is the Qunzhong Grand Theater, performing scene dramas. On the other hand, the Guilin Police Bureau and the Guangxi University school buildings are currently open for bidding for construction.

The trend of organizing "parties" in Chongqing is very strong. Two new "parties" have emerged: one is called the "Sworn Brotherhood Party," with hundreds of members, and the other is called the "Loyalty and Righteousness Party," also with hundreds of members. Both "parties" are currently very active, but it is said that their organization is based on "gangs" and "associations."

Beiping journalists Cheng Shewo, Zhang Henshui, etc., have recently suggested that the Central News Agency send out telegrams daily, ending by 11 PM so that colleagues working at night have the opportunity to go to bed.

After the victory, all of the Fujian Xiamen University school buildings were occupied by Japanese prisoners. After they were sent away, there was only a dilapidated house left, with walls covered in their slogans. One of them was particularly startling: "We will be back in twenty years..."

A principal in Chongqing said to his students: "This semester, the students who live here pay a total of 88,000 yuan for both accommodation and meals. That's an average of only 628.5 yuan per person per day. We have provided you with very comfortable dormitories and classrooms. You eat three full meals a day, and I have hired so many teachers to teach you. Go ask the people at the inns how much it costs per night!"

Guangzhou is trying traitors. Last month, it publicly tried "Market Bridge Emperor" Li Fuqun. When he was brought in for questioning, the traitor Li was short and fat, looking exactly like a pig. He was originally a "Dan household" (boat dweller) and had no knowledge. He didn't even know whether to write his own name from the beginning or the end. But his "puppet government" luck was very good. He was promoted and ennobled, and in a few years, he became a "lieutenant general." Therefore, he often made big jokes. Once, when introducing his "staff" to a friend, he said, "That's my lower part." His friend almost couldn't help but laugh, and the "staff" felt even more embarrassed.

According to a Chengdu newspaper, Xu's wife, a resident of Jiaotong Street in Hechuan, Sichuan, had four breasts. Recently, after giving birth, she had abundant milk and nursed people, which was discovered by neighbors on the street. In addition to the two breasts on her chest, she also had two breasts in each armpit. Their shape was slightly smaller than the ones on her chest, and the milk was the same as the two breasts on her chest. Xu's family is poor and is willing to be hired as a wet nurse.

### The Life of a "White Tiger"

— Huang Quan

People call us "boys" or "waiters," but we call ourselves "white uniforms." Every day, we work more than twelve hours in restaurants, tea houses, and cafes.

We arrive at the service place at 9 AM, report for duty, and receive instructions from the foreman to mop the floors, wipe the tables and chairs, and clean the silverware, soy sauce bottles, cups, and saucers until around 11 AM, when we all eat lunch. After lunch, we start business. Customers come in to eat Western food, Chinese food, coffee, tea, and snacks, non-stop. Each person is assigned a certain number of tables to serve, from serving tea and setting the table to finishing the meal. During this time, we have to ask what they want to eat, how many guests there are, light their matches, hand them towels, and take their coats and hats. We treat customers with absolute kindness and thoughtfulness because customers are our breadwinners. Under the foreman's supervision, we cannot leave for a moment, standing like this hour after hour until we get off work late at night and rush home before curfew.

When business is good, we are so busy that we can't breathe. If we make an occasional mistake, the customer skips the bill, or we send the wrong food, we are unlucky if the customer has a bad temper. We swallow our anger. When business is slow, we chat with regular customers and joke with colleagues, so we see and hear a lot. No one can hide their secrets, and male and female colleagues are even so frank that they are almost vulgar. It is easy to fall in love, get up early in the morning, and go home together at night, which is an opportunity.

Work is always unevenly distributed between joy and suffering. We wear white clothes all year round, a uniform. It's cold in the winter and hot in the summer. We can't sit down even when our legs are sore. We only have three or four hours of time off each week, and it's easy to get sick coming home late at night. What's interesting is watching the nouveau riche eat Western food, flustered and awkward, the embarrassment of empty-headed young masters who can't pay the bill, and the ugly appearance of old but not dead philandering men flattering women. The mischievous ones give stale snacks and dishes to customers and "foreign devils," but they secretly replace the good ones and take them home for breakfast. When the customers are all gone around 11 PM, we sit down in rows and listen to the "foreign devils" play music. They can't rest until the hour is up, which is really infuriating.

The income of the "white uniforms" depends entirely on 20% of the tip money on the table and other rewards. Each month, it is divided according to the percentage, with the manager and others taking 2%. Ordinary workers now get a little over 100,000 yuan per month, but the regular salary is only 3,000 yuan. So it all depends on how the business is or finding extra money, otherwise, they can't support their families.

Because of the long working hours, we rarely see the sun every day, lack exercise, and work too hard, so most of us are not healthy and are more likely to get lung disease. After working for five years since leaving school, I feel that I have forgotten all my knowledge, and the monotonous work has extinguished the sadness of my youthful ambitions.

A Few Words

### Women's Hair Styles Uniformly Required by Government?

— Wuling Ren

The first bad impression I had after returning to Shanghai was that many people urinate by the feet of walls on busy roads, which has almost become a public toilet, and the ground is full of flows. Pedestrians cover their noses and pass by. It is not only unhygienic but also extremely inelegant. One can infer the so-called municipal administration under the enemy's occupation.

Opening an old newspaper from twenty years ago, there were habitual phrases "with torches and staffs" and "whistling and escaping" used in news of petty theft, which feels ridiculous. In fact, one or two thugs broke into a room to rob, "with staffs" may be the case, but "with torches" seems an exaggeration; "whistling and escaping" is even more absurd. It's better to say "pull out a pistol to shut up..." Although it has become a cliché, it is still relatively reasonable.

It is said that the staff of the Housing Allocation Committee often found vacant houses when they recently set out to investigate the houses left by Japanese expatriates, but in a blink of an eye, they were occupied by people who moved in, and the purpose of these occupants was mostly not to live in themselves, but to resell them and profit from them, making it even more difficult for those who really had no houses to live in to find a house. After Mayor Wu took office, he made his best efforts to suppress the price of rice and eliminate labor unrest. After many unscrupulous rice merchants were arrested, the rice market has indeed stabilized a lot; I hope that the same strict measures will be taken to solve the housing shortage problem, punishing one to warn a hundred, now is the time.

In several newspapers, the "杰" character of Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has an extra dot in the upper right corner, which becomes the "杰" character, as if to specially point out the heaviness of the burden on the foreign minister's shoulders.

A senior officer in a certain US military agency stationed in Shanghai asked his Chinese female staff, saying "The hair styles of Chinese women in general have little difference, is it stipulated by the government". Roughly, foreigners see too few "uniform" things in our country, if any, it is on women's heads.

### Fundraiser

— Jin Guang

A well-dressed female student was using fluent eloquence to solicit donations from a middle-aged pedestrian, and the pedestrian stared at the female student's hand for a long time and said, "Miss, can you take off the two gold rings on your finger to help your teachers?"

### Buying Popsicles

— Jin Yang

The early summer sun hung high in the sky, hot!

The child selling popsicles was carrying a wooden box, walking quickly along the foot of the wall, shouting:

"Beauty Brand Popsicles, Beauty Brand Ice Cream!"...

"Beauty Brand Popsicles,..."

At this time, a boy of eight or nine years old came out of the alley, he pulled his mother and said "Mom, buy me a popsicle to eat!" She (his mother) shook her head and said: "Baby, popsicles are not delicious, eating them will give you a stomach ache! Tomorrow I..."

"No, popsicles are delicious, they all eat them at school, buy me one to eat!" the child pleaded.

"I'll buy you chocolate candy tomorrow! Chocolate candy is really delicious, baby be good!" she wanted to deceive him, but she had no money to buy chocolate candy.

"Don't want to eat chocolate candy, want to eat popsicle!"

……

She finally agreed to him after several requests from him.

"Buy popsicle, how much money?" The popsicle seller stopped his footsteps in time and said, "Popsicles are two hundred and fifty yuan, ice cream is six hundred yuan!"

Hearing this answer, she looked at her son thoughtfully, and he seemed to understand something and remained silent.

"You buy?" The popsicle seller asked impatiently.

"Mom" the child called out affectionately to his mother.

"No need!"——"No, I want to eat!"

After a moment of silence, she finally took out two hundred and fifty yuan to buy one. When the child got the popsicle, he smiled understandingly.

The child selling popsicles raised his voice again, shouting triumphantly: "Beauty Brand Popsicles!..."

He smiled again when he heard this shout, but she was estimating: "Another quarter of the day's salary is gone!"

### Social Service: Answering Readers' Questions

Legal Inquiries

(1) Wu Xianhou asks: After the August 13th Incident in the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic of China, 1937], the enemy army attacked the capital, and the National Army retreated. In March of the following year, a large army gathered in Fanchang. At that time, there was a shortage of military food. Wang Bingcheng, the director of the Fanchang County Granary Management Committee, issued a note to me to borrow 1,000 dan of grain to provide military food. Unexpectedly, the National Army abandoned Fanchang that year. It was not until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War last year that the county government was restored to its original state. This January, I submitted a document to the Finance and Grain Department of the county government (the County Granary Management Committee was abolished) requesting repayment. It has been several months, and they have ignored it. I am deeply resentful. May I ask: 1. Is the IOU valid? 2. If it is valid, which agency should I request repayment from? 3. What kind of procedures should be used to request repayment? 4. The county granary director has now died of illness, but the party affairs committee members Yao Shiyu and Du Xuebin still live in the same place. (These three are all wealthy local gentry).

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: (1) If it was issued by a legitimate agency, it should be valid. (2) Find the agency in charge of grain storage in each district. (3) In your written request, the amount should be deducted from the county granary grain to be paid. (4) You can ask them to assist in the reconciliation.

(2) Huang Xiuzhu asks: My wife's special real estate, which was allocated by her parents at the time, invited relatives to make a note. When the note was issued, it was recovered from the eldest sister-in-law, and after the receipt was issued and then given to the eldest sister-in-law, it was deposited with relatives by the wife. Now that the wife has died, the bloodline inheritance only has the right to fully recover from the mother's family brother and sister-in-law. I don't understand the law, and I only have a photo of the note. Please, sir, explain the law in detail and reply!

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: (A) The wife's death, the wife's original property belongs to the wife's heirs, so if the wife dies without children, then the wife's special property, by her parents, or her brothers and sisters, (if her parents are both dead) and her husband each gets one-half, the mother's family brother and sister-in-law do not have the right to fully recover. (B) The difference between a written note and a photo, one is the original, and the other is a copy. The former has stronger evidentiary power than the latter. When a lawsuit occurs, the party who uses the content of the document as a method of proof should present the original. If the original is not presented or cannot be presented, the court makes its own judgment about the evidentiary power.

(3) Zhou Shihua asks: My late husband and his brother entered a stone-gate [Shikumen] room for a share, each contributing half. Now that my husband is dead, his father has a written note, giving me ownership of half of the share. Now, because my father and brother do not provide for me, and I have financial difficulties, I want to rent out my half of the share to others, but his son objects unreasonably. Can I file a legal lawsuit? I sincerely ask the jurist of your column to instruct me.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: "Entering for a share" is probably rough. If so, then renting a house does not mean acquiring ownership and cannot be arbitrarily transferred. If there is an agreement that "the tenant shall not sublet the leased property to others without the consent of the landlord", the landlord may terminate the contract and take back the house if the tenant violates the agreement, even if there is no agreement, only the tenant may sublet part of it to others. If the city room is the brother of the husband, the daughter-in-law of his deceased brother cannot rent out half of the share to others.
