### Entering a Crucial Stage in Constitution-Making: The First Meeting of the Comprehensive Committee, The Results of the Fourth Review Committee Today Incomplete

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Constitution Draft Review Committee's incomplete groups will continue to meet on the 14th. The first, second, and seventh review committees will meet in the morning, and the first and tenth review committees will meet in the afternoon. The Comprehensive Review Committee is scheduled to hold its first decision-making meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 14th. The conveners' meeting of the Comprehensive Committee was held all day on the 13th, with the Deputy Secretary-General reporting on the results of various discussions and separately discussing the following issues as preparation for the Comprehensive Review Committee meeting: (1) the issue of the form of government; (2) the issue of the capital; (3) the issue of the National Assembly; (4) the issue of the Legislative Yuan's powers; (5) the issue of the power of consent and impeachment; (6) the issue of the Judicial Yuan's powers; (7) the issue of the Control Yuan's organization; (8) the issue of the Examination Yuan's organization; (9) the issue of examinations for public office candidates; (10) the issue of changing the name of Chapter Eleven; (11) the issue of adding clauses on provincial divisions; (12) the issue of adding articles on national economy, education and culture, and social security chapters; (13) the issue of students needing to be above party affiliation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Since the National Assembly began the group review of the draft constitution, the discussions in each review committee have been extensive and heated, with many positive and negative opinions being expressed. Representatives with special insights or proposals on relevant issues have also expressed their views on various issues. The review results may lead to significant changes to the original draft, or conflicts may arise between the various review committees. These events in the constitution-making process have reached society through newspapers and have attracted attention in Shanghai, Beijing, and other places in recent days. Some individuals have even been quite critical. For this reason, our reporter made a special visit to an important figure in the Kuomintang, who stated: "The government's proposed amendments to the draft constitution have indeed experienced twists and turns during the National Assembly's review process. This is a well-known fact, and the Kuomintang Central Committee has not ignored it. However, there are still many procedures from the initial review to the final decision in the constitution-making work. As far as the representatives participating in the various review committees are concerned, since the grouping method is based on each individual's interests, the number of people in each review committee varies. Therefore, when a certain review committee makes a resolution on a certain article of the draft constitution, the correct view is that we can only learn from this how many representatives in that review committee agree or disagree with a certain proposition or article. Although the draft constitution amendments are divided into chapters and sections, and the review is also divided into groups and sections, the intention is simply to make the outline clear and to save time through a division of labor and cooperation approach. It is by no means a piecemeal dismemberment, and it will not affect its consistent spirit. The resolutions made during the group sorting may inevitably lead to some changes to the draft constitution, and even discrepancies or contradictions may occur between the resolutions of the various review committees. However, no matter what, the overall review opinions of the draft constitution must wait until the completion of the overall sorting method. He hopes that those who care about the constitution-making work should not regard the passage or modification of a certain article of the draft constitution in a certain review committee as the final decision. It is unacceptable to think that this initial change will overthrow the theoretical and practical basis of the draft constitution and cause unnecessary worries, affecting the general public."

### The Second Review Committee: Decides on the Powers of the National Assembly; Session Amended to Once Every Two Years

### The First Review Committee: Continues to Hold Meetings Today; Chapter on the Rights and Duties of the People Has Been Passed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Chapter Two of the Draft Constitution, "The Rights and Duties of the People," was passed in its entirety on the 13th in the First Review Committee. Today's important amendment was the addition of "When people suffer illness, disability, or death due to military service or corvée labor, the state shall provide appropriate relief and compensation to them or their families" under Article 21. Article 16 was changed to "The people's rights to survival, work, and property shall be guaranteed." Regarding articles on education and illegal acts by public officials, although there was debate, they were all passed in their original form. Since the committee still has many articles in the election chapter, it will continue to meet on the 14th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of what quotas should be allocated to occupational representatives and nationals with special living habits in various elections was supported by Jiang Wanping (a famous lawyer from Shanghai) and Cai Jinying (a famous accountant from Shanghai), a representative of freelance professionals. A concrete result was achieved in the First Review Committee on the afternoon of the 13th. The original text of the case was "The number of election quotas for occupational groups, freelance professional groups, and nationals with special living habits as stipulated in Articles 26, 65, 96, 115, and 123 of the original draft constitution shall be separately specified, and the measures shall be determined separately." The First Committee passed it by a majority vote. After which article it should be added will be discussed at the meeting on the 14th.

### Total Number of Legislative Yuan Members Not to Exceed 500; Each Province and City May Elect at Least Four People

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Third Review Committee held a meeting this morning, chaired by Liu Keshu. He first reported on the revised articles of Article 65. After discussion, it was amended and passed. The articles are as follows: "The total number of Legislative Yuan members shall not exceed 500, and shall be composed of the following members: A. Those elected from each province and city, with at least four people from each province and city.

B. Those elected from the leagues of Mongolia and Tibet. C. Those elected from nationals residing abroad. D. Those elected from occupational groups. The election of Legislative Yuan members, the allocation of the number of Legislative Yuan members, and the percentage of women members that should be occupied in each of the preceding paragraphs shall be determined by law."

### National Fiscal Final Accounts Audited by the Procuratorate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Third Review Committee continued to hold a meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, chaired by Liu Keshu. He began to discuss Article 66. Regarding the term of office of Legislative Yuan members, some believed that three years was too long and that two years would be sufficient, while others believed that three years was not long. After a vote, the original plan was passed, and the term of office of Legislative Yuan members remained three years. Article 67 was passed in its original form. It was generally believed that Article 68 belonged to the organizational scope of the Legislative Yuan and should be deleted. After a vote, the majority agreed to pass it. Chen Changheng still advocated deleting Article 69. During the vote, Ning Encheng, Cui Weiyin, and others spoke, believing that it could not be included in the organization of the Legislative Yuan and was of great importance, so it could not be deleted. It was decided to maintain the original plan and pass it. Articles 70, 71, and 72 were all passed in their original form. Article 73 was amended and passed. The article is as follows: "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries and commissions may attend and express their opinions." Article 74 concerned the issue of the right to audit the final accounts of national finance. It was discussed for a very long time. Some believed that the Legislative Yuan should clearly understand the national revenue and expenditure situation, while others believed that auditing should be the responsibility of the Control Yuan and should not be handed over to the Legislative Yuan. Some believed that Articles 74, 75, and 76 should be merged. After careful study, the three articles were merged, amended, and passed. The article is as follows: "The Executive Yuan shall, within four months after the end of the accounting year, submit the final accounts to the Control Yuan. After auditing in accordance with the law, it shall submit a report to the Legislative Yuan." Articles 77, 78, 79, 80, and 81 were all passed in their original form. The last thing discussed was Article 38: "The President" shall promulgate laws and issue orders in accordance with the law, which must be countersigned by the President of the Executive Yuan or the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries and commissions. The right to countersign is of great importance. Some believed that the President of the Executive Yuan should be changed to the President of the relevant Yuan, but after a vote, the original plan was still passed. Article 62 was also passed in its original form. The Third Review Committee has completed its entire review and has scheduled a convener's meeting for 9:00 AM on the 14th to organize the review report.

### Constitution Draft "Control" Chapter: All Review Completed; The Work of the Fourth Review Committee Ends

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Fourth Review Committee of the Draft Constitution held its last meeting at 9:20 AM on the 13th, chaired by Li Zhongxiang. Starting from Article 99 of Chapter Nine, "Control," except for Articles (100), (101), (106), and (109), which were passed in their original form, Article (99) was amended to "When the Control Yuan exercises the power of consent in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, it shall be done by a resolution of a majority (delete the four words 'plenary session')." (Add an annotation: "This article on the power of consent may be deleted if it does not belong to the Control Yuan.") Paragraph 2 of Article 101 was amended to "When the Control Yuan believes that central and local public officials (originally 'Executive Yuan or its various ministries and commissions') have committed dereliction of duty or illegal acts, it may propose a censure case or an impeachment case. If it involves litigation, it should be transferred to the court for handling." In Article 103, the number of Control Yuan members proposing an impeachment case was changed from "three or more people" to "one or more people." Article 104 was amended to "The impeachment of Judicial Yuan (originally 'judges') and Examination Yuan personnel for dereliction of duty or illegal acts shall apply (add four words) to the provisions of Articles 100, 102, and 103." Article 107 was amended to "Control Yuan members, except for those caught in the act (add five words) or those being prosecuted, shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Control Yuan," and sent to the Third Review Committee for reference. Article 105, which involved the special impeachment of the presidents and vice presidents of various Yuans, and Article 108, which related to the nature of the position of Control Yuan members, were both decided to be referred to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and the entire work of the committee came to an end.

### Pure Peiping: Does Not Welcome Politicians; Xu Beihong Opposes Moving the Capital

[United Press Tianjin Dispatch, 13th] The local Jin Bu Daily reported today that Xu Beihong, President of the Peiping National Art Academy, strongly opposes moving the capital to Peiping. He stated: "The beautiful and pure Peiping will be stained by the arrival of base politicians, and the people of Peiping will despise various political parties and all their political activities."

### On the Issue of the Powers of the National Assembly: Awaiting Resolution by the Comprehensive Committee; The Democratic Socialist Party Issues a Written Statement

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party issued the following written statement tonight regarding the Second Review Committee: "Today's discussion of the powers of the National Assembly, regarding various chapters such as 369, will be discussed by the Comprehensive Review Committee. Our party will reserve its statement today and await the discussion and resolution by the Comprehensive Review Committee."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Yang Junming, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters: "The draft constitution proposed by the government has its political origins and is not just empty talk about idealism. The Second Review Committee is discussing the National Assembly chapter. The National Assembly is a non-permanent institution and is in fact unable to supervise the government. The power of the National Assembly is too broad and it also produces legislative and supervisory members, and the five-power system cannot be guaranteed. This point needs to be considered, and we must not disappoint Chairman Chiang and the ancient heart of the military men who started the constitution."

### Proposals and Resolutions on Changing Exchange Rates: To Be Decided by Governments of Each Country; International Monetary Fund Scheduled to Meet Next Week

[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 13th] People here believe that when the International Monetary Fund accepts the exchange rates of the currencies of its member states next week, even if the black market exchange rate of the currency of some countries is higher than its official exchange rate, such as the black market exchange rate of the French franc to the US dollar being 325 to 1, while the official exchange rate is 119 to 1, and the black market exchange rate of the Czech koruna to the US dollar being 140 to 1, while the official exchange rate is 50 to 1, the current official exchange rate of each country will be the basis. Although some directors of the International Monetary Fund advocated adopting a practical exchange rate in order to support it for a longer period, the directors with a majority of voting rights, including the United States, believe that the current environment is not yet stable and it is not appropriate to immediately determine this practical exchange rate. Furthermore, if the International Monetary Fund raises questions about some currencies, it will be unfavorable to the currency and its government. The British government strongly advocates that no avoidable changes should be made to the existing exchange rate at this time. Since Sweden changed its exchange rate in July, the British government's proposition has become more reasonable, but the Fund's acceptance of the existing exchange rate of each country's currency is only a formality, because the Fund's commencement of foreign exchange transactions will not be until March 1 next year at the earliest. Before then, some countries, especially France, will probably have adjusted their currencies or strengthened their economies. It is heard that the Fund's directors intend to visit the capitals of some countries to urge the governments to either devalue their currencies or strengthen their economic conditions so that the exchange rate matches the economic reality. The Fund itself can at most give limited and temporary support to any currency and cannot adjust its fundamental imbalances. Therefore, proposals and resolutions on changing exchange rates are the business of the governments of each country and are not the responsibility of the Fund.

### The Seventh Review Committee: Holds a Plenary Meeting; Enthusiastic Discussion of the Chapter on Basic National Policies

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Seventh Review Committee of the Draft Constitution held a plenary meeting on the morning of the 13th, attended by 177 representatives, chaired by Lai Lian. Leng Xin, the convener of the First National Defense and Foreign Affairs Group, reported on the five articles passed in the review and stated that it was proposed not to set up a special chapter. The convener of the Second National Economic Group reported on the five articles that had been reviewed and decided, and reported that the group would continue to meet in the afternoon to complete its work. Zhu Jiahua, the convener of the Third Education and Culture Group, reported on the ten articles passed in the review and stated that it had been decided to set up a special chapter. Gu Zhenggang, the convener of the Fourth Social Security Group, reported on the six articles passed in the review and stated that it had been decided to set up a special chapter. The representatives then spoke enthusiastically on the matter of whether the "Basic National Policies" should be divided into several special chapters. It was resolved to send it to the Comprehensive Review Committee for discussion. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and the plenary meeting will continue on the morning of the 14th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Seventh Review Committee held a review meeting on the morning of the 13th, and the National Economic Group held a meeting in the afternoon. In the morning, it was chaired by Lai. Each group reported on the review results. Leng Xin reported on the National Defense and Foreign Affairs Group's resolution that no special chapter should be set up for national defense, and whether the National Policy should be divided into chapters should be submitted to the Comprehensive Review Committee. Liu Zhendong reported on the National Economic Group, and Zhu Jiahua reported on the Education and Culture Group's resolution to set up a separate Education chapter. Gu Zhenggang reported on the Social Security Group's resolution to request the establishment of a special chapter, and Shao Lizi reported in detail on the drafting process of the entire National Policy chapter. In the afternoon, the group meeting was chaired by Liu Zhendong Wang, and two temporary proposals were passed: (1) Leng Shaoquan et al. proposed the use of science to build water conservancy, improve agriculture, and promote agricultural industrialization; (2) Cheng Xiaogang et al. proposed that all those who participate in enterprises with mental or dynamic labor should be recognized that their labor has the right to share the rights of shareholders who contribute capital, and the calculation method of capital and subsequent regulations shall be determined by law.

### Women Account for 20 Percent of the Proportion in Elections

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] What proportion women should account for in various elections was hotly debated in the afternoon of the 13th in the Constitution Draft Review Committee. This matter is of great importance to 200 million female compatriots, and all female representatives paid close attention. Nearly 40 people came to the meeting specifically for this matter, accounting for almost half of the attendees. Female representative Tao Jitian took the floor first and expressed her gratitude to the male representatives for supporting equality in marriage between men and women, and hoped that they could also help in the election aspect so that she could overcome the difficulties. Female representative Fei Xia then stood up and appealed for the female compatriots who have been oppressed for 5,000 years. Fei said: "According to the principle of equality between men and women, women originally have 50 percent of the rights, so why only propose that women should not account for less than 20 percent of the quotas in various elections? The reason why I agree to this unequal treaty (general laughter) is that in view of the current situation, women are not like men in thought, economy, and culture due to thousands of years of restraint, so I am making this practical request, hoping that representatives from all walks of life can support women and move forward step by step to serve the country and fulfill their obligations (male and female representatives applauded). So that we can move forward side by side in 20 or 30 years." Fei then explained that a country that does not respect women is like being hemiplegic, and everything cannot be promoted, and cited Germany and Japan as examples. Finally, she explained that governing a country and bringing peace to the world must start from governing a family, and women bear more responsibility for governing a family than men. She hoped to support this request from the female representatives. Representative Fei's speech was very inflammatory, and everyone in the audience was moved. After the speech, female representatives rushed to the front to comfort her. Another female representative, Guo Changhe, also said: "Men have participated in politics for 5,000 years, while women have only 30 years of experience, and it is undeniable that they are not like men. It is also conceivable that they cannot compete with men in the length of one day in the election in the future. If there is no such provision, women will definitely suffer a great loss." Most of the male representatives expressed sympathy for this, and even those who opposed only spoke on the facts and did not disagree in principle. Only Wu Yanhuan and others pointed out that if women demand 20 percent, other representatives of farmers, religions, and border areas will also make this request. How should it be handled? Zhang Xiulan and others sternly refuted, pointing out that there are also women among the above-mentioned various representatives, and this matter cannot be compared with women's participation in politics. The discussion has lasted for a while, and the entire mood of the meeting is to pass it. The chairman then put it to a vote. Seventy-four of the ninety-one people present agreed. No female representative raised their hand. The appeal that 200 million female compatriots have made unanimously for 5,000 years has finally passed the first difficult hurdle under the united strength of more than 30 female representatives. After the vote, the female representatives were all happy and congratulated each other.

### Tongue-Lashing and Lip-Snatching in the National Assembly Lounge; Petition from Beijing Municipal Councilors; Stating Reasons Why It Is Not Necessary to Move the Capital to Peiping

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Although the First Review Committee of the National Assembly passed the establishment of the capital in Peiping on the 12th, the people of Nanjing are still unwilling. They launched a campaign to reverse the decision on the 13th. At the same time, because Li, a representative of the Committee, stated in yesterday's Review Committee that the reason why the capital should be moved to Peiping was "Nanjing is the capital of Wang Jingwei and the capital of national humiliation," giving the citizens of Nanjing a great stimulus, the first congress of the Nanjing Municipal Council was held on the morning of the 13th. A motion was made on the spot to form a "Nanjing Citizens' Representative Petition Group to Support Nanjing as the Capital," composed of all municipal councilors, to petition the National Assembly, requesting two items: (1) State the reasons why it is not necessary to move the capital to Peiping and why Nanjing should be established as the capital. (2) Punish Li He. Led by the chairman and vice-chairman Chen Yuguang and Chen Yaodong, they arrived at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM. Sun Ke, the chairman of the presidium, and Hong Lanyou, the secretary-general, met them in the second lounge. Chen Yuguang, Chen Yaodong, Gai Fuchu, and others spoke one after another, with intense emotions, especially expressing their indignation at Li He's improper wording. They began to disperse one after another at 12:00 PM. The conversation went as follows: Chen Yuguang said: "The government has only recently returned to the capital, and the people's hearts are not at peace. Now we hear that the National Assembly has disputes over the issue of moving the capital, which all the councilors believe is inappropriate, so we are here to petition." Chen Yaodong said: "December 13th is one of the most painful days. On this day in 1937, the compatriots in Nanjing suffered the most brutal massacre, and 300,000 compatriots were killed. We are here today to petition, which has the most important significance. If the country wants stability, it should not have any prejudice against the issue of moving the capital and should take the facts into consideration. In the Father of the Nation's industrial plan, it is said that Nanjing has high mountains, deep water, and plains, making it an ideal metropolis. Therefore, to say that moving the capital is a violation of the Father of the Nation's will, which not only the Kuomintang should abide by, but also all parties and factions should abide by. The reasons for moving the capital in various countries are nothing more than two points: (1) For revolutionary reforms, such as the Northern Expedition reforms and the Turkish revolution, the capital was moved. (2) Forced by war, such as the French move of the capital from Paris and the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Moscow, were all due to war. Other than that, there is no precedent in history. If the capital is really moved one day, it will be equivalent to sacrificing 300,000 compatriots in our capital city in vain." The wording was very painful. Then a certain councilor explained the two matters of today's petition: one is to request to maintain Article 7 of the draft constitution, that is, it is not necessary to move the capital; and the other is to punish Li He. Sun Ke then delivered a speech saying: "Since the founding of the Republic of China, the capital has been established in Nanjing (applause from all). During the Xinhai Revolution, the Father of the Nation established the capital in Nanjing. Later, due to Yuan Shikai's relations, it was forced to move to Peiping. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition in Guangzhou, the capital was restored to Nanjing. Nine years ago, it was moved to Chongqing due to the impact of the war. Now that victory has arrived, the capital has been restored to Nanjing. Therefore, in terms of 'establishing the capital,' there is no doubt that it is Nanjing. What the National Assembly is discussing is moving the capital, not establishing the capital. The forced move of the capital to Peiping in the early Republic of China and the move to Chongqing during the War of Resistance were all last resorts. Could it be that the National Assembly has encountered a last resort that requires moving the capital? I cannot represent the National Assembly in answering whether the capital will be moved in the future, but I want to tell you on behalf of the government 'the capital is established in Nanjing.'" Then Gai Fuchu and others said: "What Representative Li said in the meeting that Nanjing is the capital of Wang Jingwei is not only an insult to the citizens of Nanjing, but also an insult to the people of the whole country. I hereby request the Assembly that Representative Li should apologize to all compatriots." "It is not only an insult to our citizens of Nanjing, but also an insult to our Father of the Nation, because Nanjing was established as the capital, which was the Father of the Nation's proposal, not what Wang Jingwei decided. We want to shoot him." "We want to cry at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum." "We want to impeach Representative Li." "We want to put Representative Li in Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and shoot him." Sun Ke withdrew first, and Hong was also surrounded. The crowd was extremely agitated. Finally, they made a strong appeal, "Please convey to the presidium the request that Representative Li apologize. If the goal cannot be achieved, we will launch millions of citizens to petition the presidium." "We demand a public trial of Li He." Tongue-lashing and lip-snatching in the lounge broke out at the same time. The fierce debate ended at nearly 12:00 PM.

### Zhang Lan Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 13th] Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, stated in an interview with reporters on the morning of the 13th that the Democratic League would not participate in the National Assembly for the following reasons: (1) This move deviates slightly from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (2) Since the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not yet yielded results, the participation of the Democratic League in the National Assembly may hinder future mediation efforts, thus unnecessarily creating obstacles to democratic peace. We firmly believe that military actions cannot be sustained for long, and the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will ultimately be resolved through political means. Once the opportunity for negotiation arises again, the Democratic League will do its utmost to mediate. At the same time, while the Democratic League seeks to participate in the National Assembly, it sincerely hopes that a democratic constitution will be drafted to reduce obstacles to peace. Mr. Zhang will fly to Shanghai on the 15th.

### Constitution's Provincial and County System Changed to Local System; Eighth Review Committee Passes Entire Proposal

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Eighth Review Committee convened a sorting group meeting at 10:00 AM on the 13th to sort through proposals. Chairman Luo Jialun made the following decisions: (1) Chapter 11, the Provincial and County System, will be changed to the Local System. (2) The following will be added to Articles 12: "The autonomous systems of the Mongol leagues and banners, and the Tibetan region shall be determined by law." (3) The opinions raised by the Tibetan representatives will be handed over to the comprehensive group for discussion and decision. The Review Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Bai Chongxi. First, Liu Jianqun reported on the results of the sorting and the proposal was discussed and passed. The details are as follows: A. It was agreed to increase the number of representatives from Mongolia and Tibet for the National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors based on Article 5, "All ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal under the law," and this was transferred to the comprehensive sub-group for discussion and regulation. B. (1) It is recommended that Chapter 10 of the Constitution, the Provincial and County System, be changed to the Local System. (2) The following Article 12 will be added after Article 120: "The autonomous systems of the Mongol leagues and banners, and the Tibetan region shall be determined by law." D. The following two articles will be added after Article 145: Article 146: "The state shall provide legal protection for the status of all ethnic groups in the border areas and shall especially support local autonomy." Article 147: "The state shall actively promote and support the development of education, culture, transportation, water conservancy, health, and other economic and social undertakings for all ethnic groups in the border areas (including Xinjiang). With regard to land use, protection and development shall be provided according to the climate, soil characteristics, and the customs of the people." E. Proposals No. 148 by Representative Pu (Ru) and No. 89 by Representative Huang Zhengqing were sent to the comprehensive sub-group for discussion due to their relation to elections. When the discussion was completed, a representative stood up and shouted "Long live the Republic of China," which was echoed by everyone present.

### National Assembly's Female Representatives Fight for Marriage Charter; Relaxed Atmosphere and Laughter Fill the Meeting Hall

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of marriage between men and women was raised in a somewhat humorous manner at today's first review committee of the draft constitution. Female representatives fought for their own interests, and some male representatives even stated that they were "speaking under the orders of their wives" to express their support, a stark contrast to the heated debate over the capital city issue. After the review of all the articles in Chapter 2, the original proposer of the motion, Lü Xiaoda, stood up to explain, first reciting the original text of the proposal in her Zhejiang dialect, saying: "Marriage should be established based on the free will of the man and woman involved. Husband and wife should mutually protect their equal rights and interests. Marriage, divorce, property, inheritance, and household registration laws should be formulated based on the principles of safeguarding individual dignity and equality." She explained, "Marriage is an important part of human life, and it is related to the prosperity of the nation and the security of society. After the war of resistance, marital chaos has become increasingly serious, and the impact is not limited to disrupting society and destroying families. The constitution does not have a single word about marriage, which is a major omission. Please include it explicitly." Before she finished speaking, the female representatives shouted, "No objection! No objection! Please pass it!" Just as they hoped to pass it in a "fast track" manner, a male representative suddenly shouted: "I object!" The male representatives applauded in support, and the female representatives were all taken aback. Yu Zheng then rose to speak, explaining that the Civil Code already has clear provisions for this matter, and there is no need to specify it in the Constitution. As soon as these words were spoken, the female representative Zhang Xiulan, who was sitting behind him, jumped up and questioned: "Chinese men take marriage too lightly. It is not enough to regulate marriage only in the Civil Code. Look at the cities, those who have resources and money, which one doesn't have another arrangement?" The crowd laughed, and some whistled. The military police, not understanding the situation, peeked into the venue to observe. "This kind of arrangement not only disrupts family order, but also undermines social stability. This matter is not only a women's issue, but also a social issue. After it is stipulated in the constitution, it will also be beneficial to you men, please pay attention." Of course, not all the male representatives were against the female compatriots. Yin Shu whispered to the female representative Tao Jitian and others for a moment, then stood up and said: "Brothers are not speaking under the orders of their wives." "The issue of marriage between men and women is indeed a social issue worthy of attention. We all have children, and we should also consider it for the sake of our next generation." The female representatives applauded when they saw male representatives supporting the female representatives, and the power of the women's faction in the venue seemed to rise slightly. Unexpectedly, another male representative, Mou Zhendong, stood up to oppose, and his first words were: "Brothers do not think this is necessary." The female representatives let out a collective sigh, and hisses filled the air. "It is true that polygamy exists, but there have also been cases of polyandry (the crowd laughed). These cases are all done with the consent of both men and women, please pay attention." He only spoke for a little over ten minutes, but he earned more laughter, applause, and hisses than any other representative. At this time, the meeting hall was no longer in the mood for discussion, and it was only two or three minutes away from the break. The male representative Pan Chaoying, mixed in with the female representatives, stood up to salvage the situation, saying: "The issue of marriage concerns both women and men. We should discuss it seriously. I propose that we leave it for discussion this afternoon." The representatives agreed, and the morning session ended with laughter. The Review Committee continued to meet in the afternoon. Before 3:00 PM, the female representatives arrived one after another, totaling more than 33, accounting for the majority of the female representatives of the National Assembly. Lü Xiaoda also actively lobbied, hoping to persuade some of the male representatives who opposed the motion. At 3:30 PM, the meeting began. Li Junfu, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, first stated that his party agreed to the demands of the female representatives, but said that this was a "problem between people." At the same time, the marriage systems of other ethnic groups are different from the Han ethnicity, please consider this. Yuan Shiyuan sympathized with this request, but hoped to add it to the chapter on fundamental national policies, to which some female representatives also agreed. Zhang Xiufeng, a well-spoken and eloquent female representative, proposed a new motion, advocating the strict implementation of the "one husband, one wife system," with severe penalties for violators. She also explained the reason for placing the word "wife" above the word "husband," which caused everyone to laugh. Another representative even made a strange remark, arguing that local inspectors should report anyone who violates the one-husband, one-wife system. In the end, the vote was unanimously in favor of passing the motion, and it was decided to transfer the proposal to the discussion.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 13th] Huaian telephone: Although the Communist forces in the rural areas of the area are still roaming everywhere, the important rural towns have been recovered by the National Army. After Chairman Wang's arrival here, he is determined to thoroughly suppress them. It is expected that the Communist forces in Huaian Prefecture can be eliminated within the lunar new year.

The 17th and 18th Brigades are fleeing to Xuzhuang in northern Huaiyin. The 2nd Division of the Communist forces in Shuyang is currently arriving in the vicinity of Gaozhuang and Dingjiatangfang, and has built five pontoon bridges between Jiangdukouchi and Wudukouchi on the Tanghe River, plotting to cross the river south and invade Lianghuai. Chang Jian, commander of the 6th Military Sub-district of the Central China Communist forces, led more than 25,000 of his troops from Dayishan in Haizhou to Qianji in southern Shuyang, intending to attack Yugou and Siyang, cutting off the highway between Xuzhou and Huaiyin. Bing Shi, the political commissar of the Su (county) Huai (yuan) county government of the Communist forces, defected to our Mengcheng county government a few days ago with more than 800 troops because he opposed the Communist forces' destructive acts.

### Western Shandong Situation Tense Again; Communist Forces Crossing Yellow River to Invade Heze; Local Qingping Team Drives Away Communist Forces

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The situation in western Shandong has become tense again. The 2nd, 3rd, and 8th Divisions of the Communist forces, after capturing Puyang, are now crossing the Yellow River south and heading towards western Shandong, with the intention of invading Heze.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] Zhang Taisheng's unit of the 12th Brigade of the New Fourth Army of the Communist forces, with over ten thousand people, fled from the counties of Shang, Xia, Bo, and Qi in eastern Henan to northern Anhui. They recently captured Yuanxiji and are now preparing to attack Taihe and Fuyang.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] The Communist forces in Qingping County, western Shandong, were driven out of the county seat on the 8th by the local teams and the people, fleeing towards the northeast, while another part fled towards the southwest. The county is now guarded by local teams, awaiting the National Army to restore order. In addition, the Communist forces in Tangyi County, western Shandong, are actively preparing to invade, and are forcibly requisitioning food from the people on a large scale, transporting it to Linqing in dozens of trucks every day. The goods of commercial firms such as Minsheng Minli, which are operated by the Communist forces in the city, are mostly transported to Wuzhen (35 kilometers northwest of Tangyi City) for storage.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 13th] The Communist forces are increasingly actively trying to win over Shandong. Recently, they have successively transferred heavy troops from the Northeast and northern Jiangsu to Shandong, intending to destroy the Jiaoji Railway and defend the Jiaodong corridor. The Communist forces in southern Hebei are again threatening the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in southwestern Shandong. The Communist forces in the border area between Hebei and Shandong are gathering in Dezhou, cutting off north-south traffic, and then besieging the provincial capital. At the same time, they are launching political offensives and strengthening economic struggles. Recent developments are as follows: (1) The Emergency Mobilization Committee of the People of the Communist Forces Liberated Areas was officially established on November 2, with Mei Liyu as the chairman, and recently issued an order to complete the preparations for strengthening the walls and clearing the fields within a time limit.

(3) The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region of the Communist forces recently held a joint meeting of staff officers in Fan County to determine future combat strategies: (1) avoid direct combat; (2) implement a long-term war of attrition; (3) all levels of government are militarized; (4) use militia and local troops to fight on the front lines.

(4) Eight thousand Communist troops (including five thousand Japanese) arrived in Penglai from Dalian to help fight.

(5) A part of the Qingqiang National Salvation Army of the Communist forces landed in Haiyang and then occupied Fushan.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] The 11th War Zone authorities are quite furious that Baodi County in eastern Hebei fell to the Communist forces again on the 11th, and County Magistrate Wang, who abandoned the city, will be punished. However, after the Communist forces entered the city, they carried out major destruction and had no intention of holding it. A certain military expert pointed out that the government's current military strategy is to "press the nails." All the forces are used to defend every county and town and cannot be used flexibly. The Communist forces can concentrate their forces to remove the "nails" that they can remove. The number of guns lost due to the sporadic losses after the recovery of eastern Hebei alone is no less than two thousand.

### Jiaoji Railway Reconnected; Sectional Traffic to Resume in Coming Days

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 13th] The Jiaoji Railway was officially reconnected on the 12th. The Qingdao-Jinan and Jinan-Weifang section trains will resume on the 16th. The recovery of this major artery in Shandong, which had been interrupted for more than a year and is 392 kilometers long, will greatly benefit the stabilization of public security in Shandong Province and the recovery of economic prosperity. A grand and solemn reconnection ceremony was held at Taibaozhuang at 12:00 noon on the 12th, presided over by Director Chen Shun Geng. More than 800 workers and Chinese and foreign guests attended. British Professor Feli of Qilu University said in his speech: "You have suffered hardships you should not have suffered, and suffered losses you should not have suffered." The road was thoroughly destroyed by the Communist forces, and it took half a year to repair, costing more than 400 million yuan, with a total of 264,000 workers used. In the future, the National Army is determined to protect the road, but the Communist forces on both sides are still restless.

### Communist Forces Organize Assassination Squad on Beining Line

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] Pei Jingui, the captain of the Beining Railway Destruction Brigade of the Communist forces, recently convened a cadre meeting in a certain place southwest of the Langfang Railway Station, and decided to organize an assassination squad, which is now ready.

### Mystery of Receiving Dalian City; National Army Has in Fact Reached City Border; Communist Forces Stop "Struggle" Due to Public Resistance

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] According to the reporter's synthesis of news from various sources, a part of the National Army arrived at Dongdaheshang Mountain (also known as Laohushan) in Jinzhou a week ago, but did not enter Jinzhou city and railway station. Daheshang Mountain is the border line of Dalian city. The right wing seems to be in the area of the mountain southwest of the railway. In addition, another part of the advance troops seems to be in the Nanguanling and Ganjingzi area of the waist of the peninsula, which has entered the city boundary. As for the main National Army force, it is said to be still near Shihe, which is the boundary of the defense area of the Lüshun Naval Base jointly used by China and the Soviet Union. According to people from Dalian, the Soviet Union will have 1,500 merchants coming to Datong from Vladivostok, of which more than 370 merchants arrived in Dalian half a month ago with their families. In addition, three ships fully loaded with cotton yarn, flag cloth, sugar, and matches came along. Some people use this to counter-prove that there will not be a major war in Dalian, because the Soviet Union has already made commercial plans to gain an advantage.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] In view of the increased public resistance, the Datong Communist forces have stopped "liquidation" and "struggle".

### Both North and South Mountains Occupied by Communist Forces; Zhongyang City's Situation Critical; Southern Shanxi National Army Enters Yuanqu County

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th] Deputy Commander Yang Aiyuan announced: The Communist forces, with a force of 30,000, are besieging Zhongyang. The defending army has only two battalions, fighting with outnumbered forces, and repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attacks. The Communist forces used a large amount of explosives to attack the city, with the later batch alone transported by 32 mules. The quantity and viciousness of their intention can be imagined. At present, the highlands outside the city have all fallen. The Communist forces are concentrating their strength, using toxic gas, artillery fire, and explosives to bombard the city fiercely. The situation is extremely critical. As of the morning of the 12th, the battle was still going on fiercely. The National Army reinforcements have advanced to more than 30 li away from Zhongyang. If the defending army in the city can hold on until the evening of the 12th, the siege can be lifted.

[Another dispatch] After the Communist forces in the suburbs of Zhongyang occupied Nanshan, they used it as cover to launch a fierce attack on the south city, and the sappers carried a large amount of explosives to bomb the city walls. The National Army is bravely resisting. At the same time, the artillery fire of the Communist forces besieging Beishan is becoming more intense, and all positions have been destroyed. At around 10:00 AM on the 11th, Beishan was also captured. In the evening, the Communist forces continued to launch a fierce attack on the city walls.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] On the morning of the 10th, the National Army defeated the Communist forces in Yiluozhen, northwest of Yuanqu City. By noon, they approached the highlands north of Yuanqu, and at 4:00 PM, they entered the county seat. The Communist forces retreated to Tongshanzhen (an important stronghold northeast of the city).

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th] There are currently more than 20,000 Communist-Democratic League joint forces in the Suide Mizhi area, who are currently attacking Yulin. In addition, there are more than 100 Communist troops in Yujiabao, 60 li south of Yulin, who have surrendered to the National Army. The area is now guarded by the local self-defense force. In addition, He Kaizhang's 20th Brigade of the Communist forces, about 6,000 people, has crossed west from Xing County and is now stationed in the area south of Jia County. Recently, the number of Communist forces in northern Shaanxi has indeed increased significantly, and they seem to be preparing to attack Yichuan and Luochuan.

### British Trade Mission Leader's Briefcase Stolen; Returning to England Empty-Handed Today

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 13th] The briefcase of Sir Bowes, the leader of the British Trade Mission to China, was stolen on the streets of Hong Kong yesterday. The Hong Kong authorities have not obtained any clues in a day. The mission is scheduled to return to England tomorrow morning.

According to the Central News Agency, the rumor last night that the theft of Bowes' briefcase had political undertones is not accurate. The Hong Kong police authorities believe that this is a normal theft case and has no political significance.

We also had the opportunity to discuss various difficult issues. What moved Mr. Li deeply was the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese and their increasingly strong sense of the motherland. "I believe that this trip has especially strengthened the connection between overseas Chinese and the motherland," and can prove the care of our government for the welfare and interests of overseas Chinese. Every time we arrive at a place, the overseas Chinese welcome us with unprecedented enthusiasm and hope, even in the scorching sun and rainstorms. Mr. Li said: "This visit also made the Dutch East Indies authorities understand the concern of our government for the treatment of overseas children. The Indonesian authorities and people now have a clearer understanding of the situation of overseas Chinese and have realized the necessity of improving their treatment." During the Goodwill Mission's two-month stay in various parts of Nanyang, we were overwhelmed with visits to various places, holding discussions, and attending major meetings. All ethnic groups in Nanyang expressed goodwill towards our Goodwill Mission. Special Envoy Li Dijun was considered a diplomat "without official airs" and everyone could approach him.

### Six Difficult Factors for Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Sichuan Province - Investigation Team Publishes Research Results on Poverty

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 13th] The Sichuan Provincial Government Industrial and Mining Investigation Team recently published the general difficulties of industrial and mining enterprises in Sichuan Province based on the results of their investigations in various regions, which are nothing more than the following: (1) Lack of working capital, high interest rates, and tight deadlines. National banks have complicated loan procedures, making it impossible for small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises to survive, leading to increased costs, financial depletion, and reduced production. In general, medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises feel that equipment and tools are insufficient. Although they have natural advantages, it is not easy to survive and develop, especially the difficulty in solving the problem of power. (2) Most industrial and mining enterprises are still in the old-fashioned manual handicraft stage, lacking specialized technology and industrial and commercial management talent, wasting human, financial, and material resources. (3) Industrial and mining enterprises are generally troubled by the transportation of materials and products, stagnant funds, and increased costs. (4) Foreign goods flood the market, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the people's purchasing power is weak. (5) Production and sales are not coordinated, supply and demand do not match, trade associations are poorly organized, and government promotion, protection, and supervision lack strength. (6) Failure to effectively cultivate, promote, improve, inspect raw material varieties, and focus on maintaining and developing rural sideline industries, resulting in increasingly scarce and inferior raw materials, leading to the withering of industrial and mining enterprises.

Essay

### On the Interpretation and Declaration of Laws that Violate the Constitution

— Luo Bida

Since the draft constitution of the Republic of China was personally submitted by Chairman Chiang of the National Government to the National Assembly for deliberation on the 28th of last month, there has been enthusiastic sentiment from all sides, and the fundamental law of the country has been discussed in detail. All issues regarding the National Assembly and the capital have been revised and changed, which is gratifying. Now that the work of deliberating on the draft constitution is nearing completion, an important issue has been neglected, namely the interpretation and declaration of laws that violate the constitution.

Article 147 of the draft constitution stipulates: "Laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid. If there is doubt as to whether a law conflicts with the constitution, it shall be interpreted by the Judicial Yuan." The author believes that this provision is open to discussion. It is natural that laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid, otherwise the constitution would have no guarantee and could not become the fundamental law of the country, the mother of all laws. There are two types of laws that violate the constitution: one is a formal violation of the constitution, and the other is a substantive violation of the constitution. A formal violation of the constitution refers to a law whose formulation and provisions clearly conflict with the constitution, while a substantive violation of the constitution refers to a law that, while not obviously violating the constitution, has results in its implementation that conflict with the spirit of the constitution. A formal violation of the constitution is obvious and absolute, while a substantive violation of the constitution is relative. The so-called violation of the constitution should naturally include both formal and substantive aspects, and substantive violations should be given more attention, and whether they violate the constitution must be decided very carefully. Examining examples from various countries, except for the 1920 constitution of Czechoslovakia, which distinguishes between formal and substantive violations of the constitution, the other countries do not explicitly distinguish between violations as formal or substantive. Because formal violations of the constitution are absolute and easier to judge, the 1920 constitution of Czechoslovakia stipulates that they should be reviewed by ordinary courts. Substantive violations, because they are relative, are reviewed by a specially established constitutional court for the sake of caution. It is generally believed that under the constitutional system of the separation of powers, the Congress is solely responsible for making laws, the president for promulgating laws, and the courts for applying laws. If a law is made and promulgated in accordance with the law, the court should apply it. If the court is given the power to review whether a law violates the constitution, the court will be suspected of infringing on the rights of the Congress. Therefore, in Austria, whether federal laws or state laws conflict with the federal constitution is not reviewed by ordinary courts, but by a specially established constitutional court (Verfassunggerichtshef). The United States is the most prominent example of a country that recognizes the right of ordinary courts to review whether laws violate the constitution, and the Federal Supreme Court exercises this power. The Federal Supreme Court of the United States has a total of nine judges. Six judges present at each hearing are sufficient for a quorum. All judgments can be made as long as the majority opinion of the judges present is consistent. Therefore, if eight or nine people are present, only five people need to agree to make a judgment. If six or seven people are present, only four people need to agree to make a judgment. It seems unreasonable that the opinion of these four or five people can overturn a law made by hundreds of people in Congress. Moreover, judges are also human beings, and as human beings, their political, economic, ethical, and social thoughts are inevitably influenced by the environment and are biased. Therefore, whether a law is judged by judges to be constitutional or not inevitably depends on the judge's own views, and they will choose to declare as unconstitutional those things that are unfavorable to their own environment. Because the power of judgment in the hands of judges has this drawback, the Weimar Constitution of Germany does not allow the courts to review whether federal laws violate the constitution. If there is a violation of the constitution, it should be proposed by the Senate, the president, or the citizens, and decided by a referendum. This method is of course very democratic. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, including the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, passed by Congress during his first term, was thwarted by the Federal Supreme Court's declaration that they were unconstitutional. Because the failure of the New Deal affected the improvement of people's lives, there has recently been a movement in the United States to improve this shortcoming. There are three plans: the first is that if a court declares a law unconstitutional, the court's judgment should be submitted to a referendum. If the citizens object to the court's judgment, the law should be valid. The second is that if a court declares a law unconstitutional, the law should be submitted to Congress for reconsideration. If Congress still maintains the original draft, the law can be valid. The third is that the court should review whether a law violates the constitution based on the opinion of two-thirds of all judges, and should not only use a majority opinion as the standard. If at least six of the nine judges believe it is unconstitutional, the law will be invalid. In the first plan, the power to decide whether a law is unconstitutional rests with the citizens. In the second plan, the power to decide rests with Congress. In the third plan, the power to decide rests with an absolute majority of the judges. The decision-making power rests with the citizens. The theory is the best, but it is the most difficult to exercise in practice, especially in China, with its large territory and large population, the difficulty of exercising it will be even greater. It is more convenient to exercise the decision-making power in Congress, but if Congress makes an unconstitutional law, especially a law that expands the power of Congress, there is no way to deal with it if Congress does not recognize it as unconstitutional. As a result, Congress will inevitably become autocratic, and the constitution will not be able to be guaranteed. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the decision-making power to remain in the courts. However, judges must be very careful when exercising this power. In order to increase the degree of their caution, Article 147 of the draft constitution should preferably be amended as follows: "Laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid. The Judicial Yuan shall interpret whether a law conflicts with the constitution. The Judicial Yuan shall submit laws that are judged to conflict with the constitution to the President for an explicit order to abolish them. If the President believes that the law is formally unconstitutional, he shall immediately order its abolition. If it is substantially unconstitutional, it shall be submitted to the Judicial Yuan for reconsideration. If two-thirds of all judges uphold the original judgment after reconsideration, the President shall order the abolition of the law."

This amendment has at least three major advantages:

First, it forms a relationship of checks and balances between the executive and judicial branches, because the courts can judge laws to be unconstitutional, the president can request reconsideration, and the law only needs to be explicitly repealed if two-thirds of all judges uphold the original judgment after reconsideration. If a law judged by the court to be unconstitutional takes effect no matter what, then if the judges believe that something is unfavorable to them, they will declare it unconstitutional, and the court will inevitably infringe on rights, and the judicial organs will inevitably be suspected of being autocratic. Now, laws that have been judged by the court to be unconstitutional can be submitted by the president for reconsideration, and the law will only be invalid if two-thirds of all judges uphold the original judgment after reconsideration. This forms a relationship of checks and balances between the executive and judicial branches, and a relationship of checks and balances is a good symbol of a constitution.

Second, it can avoid erroneous judgments by the courts. Judges are human beings, and all human beings are inevitably wrong. Even if the judges' review is fair and cautious, it is still inevitable that there will be mistakes. Therefore, ordinary cases often have preliminary hearings, rehearings, and third trials, and sometimes even retrials are allowed. However, for major events regarding whether a law is unconstitutional or not, retrials are not allowed. This seems unreasonable. Now, after the amendment, there is an opportunity for retrials, which is naturally very suitable in terms of both theory and fact.

Third, it can accommodate public opinion and flexibly adjust judgments. Sometimes a law's violation of the constitution is not a violation of the provisions of the constitution, but a violation of the spirit of the constitution. However, the so-called spirit of the constitution is abstract, so a law's violation of the constitution is vague and relative. Therefore, A believes that it is a violation, while B believes that it is not a violation. Because whether it is a violation can be interpreted positively or negatively, all judges cannot have a completely consistent opinion. Because there is no completely consistent opinion, the best judgment should be based on public opinion. However, the people do not pay attention to whether a law is unconstitutional before it has been judged to be unconstitutional. Because the people do not pay attention, the judges have no way of knowing public opinion. Now, after the amendment, there is an opportunity for retrials. The people will inevitably pay attention during the retrial, especially to laws that have a direct relationship with the people. Because of their attention, they will study it, and because of their research, they will obtain the correct result. The courts have an opportunity for retrials. On the one hand, the research can be thorough, and on the other hand, public opinion can be clear. The judgment made in this way can naturally be very appropriate. The president must execute this judgment, which is also appropriate. Because such a judgment is not only correct but also pays attention to public opinion. For the sake of these three major advantages, I humbly present my views for the correction of wise people.

### The Steadfast Hero Sleeps Forever at the Foot of Yuquan Mountain - Wu Peifu to be Publicly Buried the Day After Tomorrow - Chairman Sends You Siyuan to Represent and Offer Sacrifices

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Wu Peifu will be publicly buried on the 16th. Today, Chairman Chiang has telegraphed He Siyuan to represent him and offer sacrifices at that time.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 13th] With Wu Peifu's public burial approaching, Wu's son, Daoshi, entertained reporters at his private residence in Shijin Garden today, recalling how Wu refused to be a puppet under the oppression of the enemy and puppets, which caused the Japanese to harbor resentment. In the 28th year of the Republic, after Wu fell ill, the doctor at the Tongren Hospital performed an operation without obtaining the signature of Wu's family, and then did not inject a cardiotonic drug, causing Wu to die of a minor illness. Wu's son said: Before Wu passed away, he swore not to be a puppet, and then closed his eyes. Wu was old and had no son. Daoshi was adopted as his nephew. He now has two grandsons, both studying at Yuying Middle School. The eldest grandson is 18 years old and loves music and art, which is very different from his grandfather. Wu's wife is still alive, but because Wu did not manage his property during his lifetime, the family is currently not wealthy. The marshal's wife often carries a basket to the market to buy vegetables. Wu enjoyed poetry and prose in his later years, and his proud works include "Spring and Autumn Justice," "On the Gentleman," and "New Book on Following One's Duty," most of which have been published. Friends and relatives plan to organize them into a complete collection. Three days later, this generation of steadfast heroes will sleep forever at the foot of Yuquan Mountain in Xixian Huying Village. According to Wu's son: The reason for choosing this place is that he wants Marshal Yu to find his place.

### Rampant Banditry in the Suburbs of Changshu - Self-Defense Force Disarmed and Town Mayor Killed

[Our newspaper, Changshu News] Banditry has recently been discovered in Zhenlilizhen outside the Dadongmen in the urban area, and it is quite active. The county government has obtained confidential reports and is planning a raid. Unexpectedly, at about 7 pm on the 11th, they suddenly broke into the town, shot and killed the town mayor Shao Junbi and three members of the self-defense force, including Ju Gensheng. All five firearms were confiscated on the spot. Town mayor Shao Junbi also served as the head of the town's self-defense force. After attending a security meeting with the garrison troops and returning to the town, he happened to be having dinner in the team. Suddenly, many bandits with weapons arrived at the team's gate and fired shots at the gate. The guard at the gate was caught off guard and was shot several times and died on the spot. Hearing the alarm, Town Mayor Shao took the lead and led a breakout. The two sides engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand battle. In the end, the team was outnumbered. Member Ju Gensheng was shot three times and fell into a pool of blood. Town Mayor Shao was captured by the bandits and taken to the market, where he was shot and killed. At the same time, five self-defense force firearms were confiscated by the bandits. The injured member Ju Gensheng was escorted to the city for medical treatment, but eventually died due to excessive bleeding from the serious chest and abdominal wounds. After the news spread, the whole city was shocked. County Mayor Pan was furious that the bandits were so rampant, since the town was only ten li away from the city. He immediately ordered Section Chief Chen of the Military Affairs Section and Captain Gu of the Security Brigade to lead the self-defense security forces to set out at night in order to wipe them out. District Chief Lu of the urban area and others went to investigate and handle the aftermath in the morning of the 12th.

### Dachang and Yangxing Still Under Baoshan Jurisdiction

[Our newspaper, Luodian News] The border dispute between Baoshan and Shanghai has been suspended for a long time. Recently, after Chairman Yuan and others of the County Provisional Council went to Beijing to petition, the results were quite satisfactory.

### Restoring the Fan Family Library of Ningbo to Tianyige

[Our Ningbo Dispatch] The Tianyige Library of the Fan family in Ningbo was established by Fan Qin, then Vice Minister of War, during the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty. It houses a vast collection of books from past dynasties. His descendants have also been able to abide by his instructions and preserve it properly. It has existed for no less than four to five hundred years and is a famous library in China. During the July 7th Incident, the Ministry of Education, fearing that the library's collection might be lost, instructed the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education to transport it to Longquan. Eight years have passed since then. Now that the country has been restored, councilors Zhang and Feng Chun of Yin County have proposed to the county government that the library's collection, which has been brought back to Hangzhou by the Provincial Library, should be transported back for safekeeping to restore the cultural heritage. Their proposal to request funding for the transportation has been approved, and it has been decided that Fan Luqi, a descendant of the Fan family, will travel to Hangzhou with documents on the 15th of this month to transport the entire collection back.

### Two Silk Banners Presented Separately to Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing, Representing the People of the Entire Province in Praising Their Political Achievements

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] After the victory of the War of Resistance, the counties of Southern Jiangsu, under the command of Commander Tang of the former Third War Area, have been promoting pacification and reconstruction. As a result, the political, educational, and commercial aspects of various counties have gradually recovered and returned to normalcy, and the security of Southern Jiangsu has been ensured. Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, representing the people of the entire province, specially dispatched Deputy Commander Xia of the Provincial Security Command to Wuxi at the end of last month to present Commander Tang with a silk banner reading "Protect the Country and Defend the People" and Deputy Commander Chen with a silk banner reading "Pacify the Southeast" in recognition of their political achievements. Because both Tang and Chen were away from Wuxi on official duties, they were unable to receive the banners at that time. The banners were entrusted to County Magistrate Xu to present on their behalf. Magistrate Xu, upon receiving the order, specially presented the two silk banners to the Wuxi Command on the 12th, where they were received on their behalf by Senior Staff Officer Peng.

### The Collapse of the Riverbank in Xiaoshan is Very Dangerous; Raising Funds for Building Dams is Difficult

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] The collapse of the riverbank in Nansha, Xiaoshan, is very dangerous. The Dike Works Bureau has designed four diversion dams, which require 1.3 to 1.4 billion yuan. The bureau has only allocated 200 tons of flour for work relief, while local fundraising has only amounted to 300 to 400 million yuan.

The Jiaxing Road Bridge is Being Surveyed for Repairs

Regarding reader Sun Bingwen's appeal to repair the Jiaxing Road Bridge, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works has replied, "The bureau has ordered a survey and handling of the matter." This is published to inform Mr. Sun.

The Route of the Ninth and Tenth Bus Lines

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company has replied, "Regarding reader Zhou Desheng's concern about the route of the Tenth Bus Line, we offer the following explanation: The route of the Tenth Bus Line was decided after a meeting, reported to higher authorities, and has already been put into operation. Therefore, it is not convenient to change it immediately. At that time, considering that this line is a major transportation artery in the city, and passengers are crowded, there was a great need for it. After deliberation, it was decided that its purpose is to supplement the inadequacy of the trams. Although the Third and Tenth Bus Lines are parallel routes, they each have their own needs and do not conflict. The committee has also considered Mr. Zhou's suggestion to restore the former British-owned Ninth Bus Line, but this will have to wait until there are sufficient vehicles." This is published for information.

Discussion of the Telephone Business in This City

Respectfully, I read in the newspaper that Director Yu of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau gave a speech at Jiaotong University on the history of Shanghai telephones and future reorganization plans, which was quite insightful. The Shanghai telephone business has long been in the hands of foreigners, causing the communications authorities in our country to be constrained in handling telephone services. Moreover, when citizens call each other, they have to go through manual transfers between two institutions, which not only causes delays but also places an additional burden of connection fees on citizens. This kind of shortcoming is unique to our country. As for future reform plans, it is indeed true that the government is unable to take it back due to insufficient financial resources. A special limited liability company jointly established by China and the United States is a more appropriate approach, but the government must obtain the right to manage and supervise it in order to benefit the citizens. (Zhang Guohua)

### Zhi Lao's Visit to Wuxi: Dividing the Estate for a Late Friend, Sweeping Wu Zhiying's Grave, and Discussing the Past and Present While Explaining Each Sentence of the Datong Pian

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and a native of this county, has been traveling between Beijing and Shanghai since the victory for over half a year and has not yet had time to return to his hometown. Recently, the former residence of his late friend, Mr. Lian Nanhu, near the Shuidaqiao Bridge, was completely sealed by the Jiangsu Office of the Enemy Property Administration because it was involved in the case of his younger brother, Lian Yu (the puppet ambassador to Manchukuo). Mr. Lian Nanhu had not divided the estate with Lian Yu before his death, so the inherited property belonged to the brothers jointly. However, because Lian Yu held an important position in the puppet government and violated national laws, all his property should be sealed according to law. However, this has affected the interests of others, and those affected can apply for protection. Wu Zhihui has a deep friendship with Mr. Lian Nanhu, and the Lian family is currently in dire straits. Therefore, he spared time to return to Wuxi from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 12th. Because he kept it secret in advance, only Chen Zikuan and Sun Zhenqiu were at the station to greet him. After Zhi Lao got off the train, he went directly to the Park Hotel to rest. Later, he invited relatives of the Lian family to a public meeting to divide the estate between Nanhu, Lian Yu, and their descendants. It is planned to apply to the competent authorities after the agreement is drawn up. In addition to confiscating the part that should be allocated to Lian Yu, the rest should be returned to the family. On the morning of the 13th, he also took time to sweep the grave of Mrs. Wu Zhiying, Mr. Nanhu's wife, with relatives of the Lian family in Wuxi. Mrs. Zhiying was a close friend of the martyr Qiu Jin, the female knight of Jianhu. After the female knight was martyred in Shaoxing, Mrs. Zhiying collected her remains and moved them to the West Lake, earning fame for her righteousness. Her thin gold style calligraphy is especially well-known and has long been admired by Zhi Lao. Mrs. Zhiying passed away before the war due to illness, and her remains were buried in Yanjia Peng in Huilu. This time, Zhi Lao came to Wuxi to pay his respects to his old friend. Zhi Lao, wearing a blue silk lambskin robe, with a bald head and a childlike face, sat dignifiedly among the guests in the Chen residence on Xinsheng Road, feeling very excited. He spoke eloquently and discussed the past and present, sometimes with humor, and showed no signs of fatigue for two hours. According to Zhi Lao, the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is like "ghosts fooling the sky" and "ghosts pushing the mill." He also said that Trotsky once said, "The world gains progress with every chaos." Although Trotsky was rejected by Stalin, his words are still accepted by the communists. Before the victory, the central government's planning and construction focused on railways. Unexpectedly, after the victory, disturbances continued, and not only were the planned railways not built, but the existing roads were being demolished, resulting in traffic disruption, hindered freight transportation, and difficult livelihoods for the people. He then said that the composition of the world has four elements: morality, economy, politics, and desire. Since the beginning of mankind, it has always leaned towards morality. If you ask anyone what they hope for in this world, they will all hope that this world will become the best possible world. It can be seen that leaning towards morality is the nature of mankind. However, humans cannot live without economics, so there will inevitably be disputes. To restrain these disputes, there is politics, and people have their own desires. Due to the development of desires, chaos never ends. To achieve eternal peace, it is necessary to achieve Datong (Great Harmony). In the past, I was extremely opposed to Confucius, but now I am gradually becoming more respectful of Confucius. Confucius truly had a unique understanding of the development of the universe. More than two thousand years ago, he recognized that politics can only be applied in the short term, and the end point of development will be the Datong era, a great harmony era without politics or government. The Datong Pian in the Book of Rites gives a concise and meaningful description of the atmosphere of the Datong era, the method of advancing to Datong, and the special circumstances of the Datong era. When Wu said this, he explained each section and each sentence of the Datong Pian in detail, and new meanings emerged one after another, enlightening all who heard it. He went on to say that the reality of the Datong era will require at least 20,000 years. 20,000 years may seem like a long time, but from "Peking Man" to the present, it has been about 500,000 years, and the historical period of mankind, according to Europeans and Americans from the founding of Egypt to the present, is about 8,000 years. China from Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang to the present is 6,000 years. If Gu Jiegang denies Shun and Yu, then China's historical period is only more than 4,000 years. Comparing 4,000 years to 500,000 years is like a blink of an eye. Therefore, if we view the progress of the universe, 20,000 years is just a fleeting moment. Wu also said that the influx of American goods is a very natural thing, and in China, it is necessary to spend some teacher's money, which is unavoidable. Zhi Lao is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the evening of the 13th.

### Greece Accuses Three Neighboring Countries of Conspiring to Fuel Internal Turmoil; The Greek Prime Minister Appeals to the Security Council to Send a Delegation to Investigate; The Representative of Yugoslavia Countercharges That the Presence of British Troops in Greece Leads to Unrest

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 12th] Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris, sitting alongside representatives from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania at the Security Council today, formally proposed that the Security Council organize a four-power investigation team to go to Greece to investigate the situation of the disputes on the country's northern border. Tsaldaris strongly emphasized Greece's efforts in resisting the Axis powers during the war and stated that the country has decided to appeal to the United Nations because this seems to be the only way to restrain the unrest in northern Greece. He believes that Greece has become a victim of an "undeclared war," the purpose of which is to divide the territory of the Macedonian province of Greece and to establish a regime in Greece that violates the will of the people. The current situation in northern Greece is a danger to international peace and security. Yugoslav Representative Kasanović replied that Greece's attitude is naive and that the country wants to blame its peaceful northern neighbors for the conflicts caused by the totalitarian regime. It is not true that guerrilla teams in northern Greece have been trained in neighboring Balkan countries, as Tsaldaris claimed. The photographic evidence presented by the Greek delegation is also inaccurate. In short, the presence of British troops in Greece is largely related to the country's unrest, and the Yugoslav delegation will formally oppose conducting investigations on the southern Greek border.

[United Nations, Lake Success, 12th] Yugoslav Representative Kasanović today requested that the Security Council immediately send a delegation to investigate Greece's accusation that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are encouraging the Greek civil war. This surprising proposal came immediately after Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris's speech. Previously, when the Security Council discussed Ukraine's accusation against Greece, the United States proposed sending an investigation team, but the Soviet Union vetoed it. It is unexpected that Yugoslavia, which has been following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union, would bring up the old matter again. Kasanović said that Tsaldaris's accusation has no basis. The current war in Greece was not caused by foreign forces but is merely due to the domestic policies adopted by Greece and its efforts to stifle the masses. The Security Council should send a delegation as soon as possible to investigate the internal situation in Greece. This situation may even become more serious because the United Kingdom, which supports Tsaldaris, still has troops stationed in Greece and should bear its responsibility. The stationing of foreign troops in Greece hinders the Greeks from expressing their true will.

### The United Nations Headquarters Will Be Located in New York; Rockefeller's Donation Has Been Accepted

[United Press, New York, 13th] Rockefeller is willing to donate a skyscraper site in Manhattan, New York, worth $8.5 million, as the permanent headquarters of the United Nations.

The subcommittee has inspected the site and believes that it is "very suitable for building a three-dimensional clubhouse."

### The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is Coming to an End; Another General Assembly Will Be Held Next Year; We Request That Technical Experts Stay in China

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Representatives of all countries in the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) unanimously passed a resolution today to hold another General Assembly in 1947. The current General Assembly was originally scheduled to be the last meeting of UNRRA, with European relief work scheduled to end at the end of this year and the Far East at the end of March next year. Soviet Representative Fyodorov insisted that another meeting should be held in 1947 to hear the report on UNRRA's work over the past two years, while US Representative Wood opposed it. The current resolution was proposed by the subcommittee in an attempt to reconcile the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union. After its passage, it is equivalent to guaranteeing that another General Assembly will be held before June next year.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Concludes, Completing the Work on Peace Treaties; A Total of 122 Meetings Were Held; The Peace Treaties with Germany and Austria Will Be Discussed in London Next Year

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] The four foreign ministers held their last meeting tonight in an atmosphere of coordination and mutual congratulations, ending the work of negotiating peace treaties with the five former Axis countries. The four foreign ministers, reclining on swan down sofas in the special conference room of the Astoria Hotel, looked forward to the Moscow conference in March 1947. US Secretary of State Byrnes smiled and suggested that if the representatives could not reach an agreement in Moscow, they could return to New York at any time, as New York seemed to be fortunate for them. After a brief discussion on the Moscow agenda, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov congratulated everyone on the success of the meeting and thanked Byrnes for the generous hospitality of the United States. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Viril also expressed their thanks. Byrnes replied that he was particularly pleased with the conclusion of the agreement in New York. The foreign ministers traveled back and forth before the final agreement on the peace treaties, and they finally succeeded, which can be said to be worth the hard work. The four foreign ministers then agreed that the experience gained in negotiating the peace treaties with the five countries would be of great benefit to the discussion of the peace treaties with Germany and Austria in the future. Byrnes said that the long-term meetings have allowed the foreign ministers to know each other's views and be able to understand each other. Regarding the Moscow agenda, the Foreign Ministers' Conference decided to continue issuing instructions on the draft treaty with Austria, and the undersecretaries are scheduled to meet in London on January 14 next year to hold preliminary discussions on the peace treaties with Germany and Austria.

[United Press, New York, 12th] The four foreign ministers have held 33 meetings here, and a total of 122 meetings have been held since the drafting of the peace treaties with the five countries began in September 1945.

### The Powder Keg of the Future World War is in the East; Mrs. Pandit Expresses Deep Regret That India Did Not Obtain a Seat on the Security Council

[United Press, London, 12th] Mrs. Pandit (the sister of Nehru), the Indian representative to the General Assembly, told the press here today that the Third World War will be in the East. She stated: "I know that there will be no war in the West for a long time. If there is a war, it will be in the East. Conflicts are inevitable if any form of racial discrimination is implemented and colonial countries continue to hold on to their territories. If there is a dispute in the East, India will be at the center." Mrs. Pandit has requested that India obtain a seat on the Security Council but was opposed by the United States and others, and therefore criticized them. She stated, "I do not know where the US State Department and the people have lost contact, but there must be cracks in some places. The US representative prohibited India from obtaining a seat on the Security Council, which is an example of this. Other countries have also voted against India. Frankly speaking, I do not know what the goals of US foreign policy are." Mrs. Pandit will depart for India on the 13th.

### Draft Resolution on Disarmament Includes Six Specific Measures; Investigation of Military Forces Is Not Included

[United Press, New York, 12th] The 20-nation subcommittee of the General Assembly unanimously adopted two major principles of the general disarmament plan today: (1) prohibiting the use of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, and (2) reducing the size of armed forces as soon as possible.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] Regarding the draft resolution on general disarmament and arms limitation, the Disarmament Subcommittee discussed it and finally passed its final content after four hours of debate, which will be submitted to the Political and Security Committee and the General Assembly for discussion. The content of the resolution is based on the draft prepared by the Drafting Committee, which includes several key points as the basis for disarmament. The provisions are as follows: (1) Stipulate a control and monitoring system. (2) Establish a committee responsible for drafting an agreement to ensure the authority of the control and monitoring system and its legal status. (3) The Atomic Energy Commission should accelerate its work, but there should be no changes to the work that has been stipulated by the General Assembly held in London. (4) The member states of the United Nations should hand over the necessary troops to the command of the Security Council in order to maintain peace. (5) Member states of the United Nations that have troops stationed in other member states should gradually withdraw them according to a progressive percentage unless they have obtained the consent of the latter's government. (6) The military forces maintained by member states of the United Nations domestically should also be reduced according to a progressive percentage, and all navies of all countries should be handled in the same way.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] The General Assembly Disarmament Subcommittee decided today not to include the resolution on investigating military forces in the draft disarmament and requested the Security Council to quickly implement the various measures recommended by the committee. The disarmament resolution was proposed by the Belgian representative and requested that the Security Council decide on the various statistical materials needed to implement the draft of arms reduction. The motion strongly emphasized the General Assembly's desire to implement disarmament measures as soon as possible. As for the proposal by the Political Committee to include the investigation of military forces in the motion, it has been rejected. Fifteen countries, including China and France, supported the Belgian proposal, while the Soviet Union and Ukraine opposed it, and Poland, Canada, and Brazil abstained.

### French Political Circles Extremely Busy, Blum Undertakes to Form Cabinet, New Cabinet Members Expected to be Announced Within Days, Washington Welcomes New French Prime Minister

[This newspaper's report] Paris, 13th, broadcast. The new French interim government chairman Blum, in light of the rapid deterioration of the domestic economic situation, has decided to form his "crisis response government" by next Tuesday. Blum met with leaders of various political parties this morning, and it is expected that the Blum cabinet will include members from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement.

### British House of Commons Debates Indian Issue, Churchill Criticizes Government, Says Indian Civil War Almost Inevitable, Dark Future, Nehru to Meet with Gandhi to Discuss

[United Press, London, 12th] Former Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons today, predicting that a civil war will occur in India, and said that thousands of people have lost their lives in Indian civil unrest, for which the Labour government should be responsible. Minister of Commerce Cripps said that only if India fully complies with the British plan, so that opposing political and religious beliefs can be integrated into a unified government, can the tragedy of civil war be prevented. Churchill also said that Cripps' efforts for Indian independence have had a great misfortune. He then recounted the terror of civil war, concluding that whether for good or bad, this responsibility should be borne by the government. Churchill believes that the unity of India is superficial, entirely due to the rule of British generals. The government's delegation of the power to organize an Indian interim government to the Congress Party led by Nehru, dominated by Hindus, was a big mistake. If the Hindus are allowed to rule the country by virtue of their large number of people, it will inevitably cause civil war, and before the civil war has any results, it will greatly reduce the Indian population, which is frightening. Cripps then stood up to answer Churchill, saying; the government wants to hand over the ruling power to the Indian government and prevent internal strife, which is very difficult, and the biggest difficulty is that Hindus and Muslims have not expressed their readiness to trust each other. The separation of factions in India is indeed a legacy, and the Muslims want to decentralize the power of the central government in order to largely realize their dream of partition, that is, to build another Muslim country, while the Congress Party wants to establish a strong central government. However, I do not want the House of Commons to have the impression that the situation is hopeless. Muslim League leader Jinnah remained in London after attending last week's meeting, and sat in the gallery today with his chin in his hand, listening quietly to the debate. Next to him was Mrs. Pandit, the sister of Nehru, the chief Indian representative to the United Nations General Assembly, with a curtain separating the two representatives of different political and religious beliefs.

[This newspaper's report] London, 13th, broadcast: The British House of Commons ended the debate on the Indian issue after two days, passing a resolution calling on Indians to resolve disputes peacefully. Alexander also refuted in the meeting the opposition's claim that the British representatives' mission in India failed. It is said that the British mediation plan has won the support of the majority of Indians.

Also reported: According to Cripps, 10,267 people have died and countless people have been injured since the Indian civil unrest.

Also reported: Nehru gave a speech in the Indian Constituent Assembly today, emphasizing that India must obtain independence, hoping that the British side will treat Indians with goodwill, and not resort to oppressive means, and expressed his willingness to continue to cooperate with the British side.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 11th, special dispatch] While the Constituent Assembly is in progress, it is reported that Nehru will go to the Bengal provincial headquarters to meet with Gandhi, and discuss the recent British statement with Gandhi to determine the future policies of the Congress Party.

### Chinese Merchant Ship in Distress, United States Sends Personnel to Rescue

### Director Wu Convenes All Sectors to Discuss Year-End Bonuses, Redetermines Four Principles, Stipulates January as the Standard but Maintains Flexibility, and Hopes for the Widespread Establishment of Factory Councils

[This newspaper's report] The Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the China Industrial Association, and other organizations to a discussion meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on the year-end bonus issue. The attendees included Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhao Banfu, Director of the Department, and Xu Jizhu, Shui Xiangyun, Shou Jingwei, Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, Ge Jechen, Zhang Zhusan, Liang Yongzhang, Fang Rusheng, Wu Chixian, Ye Xiang _, Wang Xianqing, Gui Fuxing, and others. Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, also arrived at around 6:00 PM. Director Wu Kaixian served as the chairman and said that the absence of labor disputes in the past few months is the reason why industry and commerce have been able to barely maintain. If the year-end bonus issue cannot be resolved as soon as possible, it will be the seed of labor disputes. I raised this point at the Municipal Government meeting a month ago, and Mayor Wu deeply agreed and ordered that measures be drafted for submission to the Central Government. At the joint meeting of the Municipal Government, after detailed discussion by all parties, the principles for handling the year-end bonus issue have been decided as follows: (1) The business situation of each manufacturer this year will be used as the standard for the year-end bonus. In other words, not the industry as a unit, but each factory and each business firm as the object. (2) Manufacturers with profits will issue a one-month year-end bonus according to last year's example, but it is stipulated that workers who have been in service for a full year can get a one-month year-end bonus. Those who have not completed one year will be calculated proportionally, but the minimum cannot be lower than one-twelfth of a month. (3) Manufacturers without profits will reduce the year-end bonus according to the standard of one month. The labor and management will directly negotiate according to their ability to bear. If no agreement can be reached, the Social Affairs Bureau will make a ruling. If necessary, an accountant can be invited to assist. (4) Some manufacturers have suffered great losses, and the owners have no intention of operating. All are forced to maintain compliance with government orders and do not give year-end bonuses. If there is a surplus in the future, it will be issued from a rich source.

After Director Wu reported, he asked the attending representatives to express their opinions as much as possible, so that the year-end bonus method would be more perfect and effectively implemented.

### The General Labor Union Hopes That Manufacturers Will Establish Labor-Management Symposiums

Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, first stood up to speak, believing that the decision principles of the Municipal Government Joint Meeting were very fair, and the Labor Union was willing to support them. There are many labor disputes currently brewing. It is hoped that manufacturers can establish a labor-management symposium to communicate the opinions of both labor and management and eliminate labor disputes in the bud. Workers also have a conscience and will never force the factory to go bankrupt with year-end bonuses, and it is also hoped that the capital side will not deceive the workers. "The two sides will help each other in the same boat" to get through this difficult time. Recently, the National Products Company borrowed 200 million yuan to distribute to employees in the name of medical expenses. When the employees received it, they were greatly moved and automatically canceled the Sunday afternoon holiday to serve the company. The recent business income has greatly increased.

### Hu Boxiang of the Industrial Association Points Out That the Meaning of Surplus Should Be Determined

Hu Boxiang, the representative of the China Industrial Association, then spoke, pointing out that the year-end bonus is determined according to the profit and loss situation, and there should be a clear stipulation on the interpretation of surplus. Today, in the factory, there is often a situation where the books show a profit, but the inventory is reduced, which is actually a loss. Can this situation be considered a surplus? If the factory does not issue a year-end bonus this year due to losses, it is allowed to issue it from a rich source when there is a surplus, which is equivalent to signing a treaty, which does not seem to be a good strategy. Regarding the latter point, Director Wu explained at the time that this is a gentleman's agreement and not a condition. Hu finally stated: He supports the principles, but should be cautious when implementing them.

### The Problem of Year-End Bonuses for Temporary Workers, Director Zhao Gives an Explanation

Tian Heqing, the representative of the Industrial Association, supplemented Hu's opinion, advocating that the surplus section can be individually reviewed by the industry association to determine the profit and loss of each manufacturer, and to determine the year-end bonus distribution method and report it to the Social Affairs Bureau, while notifying the Labor Union. This method is more appropriate than the Social Affairs Bureau asking an accountant to check the accounts. Because there are technical difficulties in checking accounts, and it is delayed for a long time, the year-end bonus will lose its timeliness. Tian also asked to discuss whether temporary workers should have year-end bonuses. Director Zhao Banfu immediately stated at the time: According to the factory law, workers who have served for three months are considered long-term workers. But I know for sure that there is a part of silk factories whose employment contracts are ordered every two months, so that the workers will always be temporary workers. Obviously, the capital side intends to take advantage of this and deprive the workers of their due rights, so there should be a fair handling of the year-end bonus issue for temporary workers.

### The Chamber of Commerce Proposes a Double Salary System, One Month's Salary as the Standard

At this point, Xu Jizhu, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, said: I have been engaged in the business community for many years. I have always advocated the principle of "good treatment, high efficiency" for the Sichuan people. Therefore, on this issue, I do not advocate using the name of year-end bonus, but I agree to adopt the method of double salary. Manufacturers with profits and no losses will pay one month's salary more. The workers should understand that those who really lose money do not issue year-end bonuses. This principle can avoid the trouble of an accountant checking the accounts, and the year-end bonus issue can be resolved in a short period of time. At the same time, I hope that the Labor Union can also make more efforts in this regard.

### Labor Union Representatives Raised Different Opinions, Rigid Regulations Are Unreasonable

After Xu finished speaking, a representative of the Cotton Textile Industry of the General Labor Union immediately raised a strong objection to the principle of limiting the year-end bonus to one month. He said that the special profitability of the cotton textile industry is a matter of common knowledge, so the year-end bonus method advocates handling it according to precedent. If you must limit it to one month, the remaining profits should be returned to the country, which is reasonable. Moreover, cotton textile workers managed 50 wooden tubes per person during the enemy and puppet period, and now they manage 200 wooden tubes per person. The workload has increased three times. If the bonus does not increase but decreases, it will be difficult to maintain the production quantity. At this point, another Labor Union representative added that some manufacturers pay very low wages to workers on weekdays, relying entirely on the year-end bonus. The current rigid regulations limiting it to one month will be used by them to exploit the workers. It is also unreasonable not to issue year-end bonuses for piece work. For example, female workers in cigarette factories are all piece work.

### Labor and Management Can Negotiate Directly, Which is Easier to Reach an Agreement

At this time, the representatives of the General Labor Union of the Cotton Textile Industry and the Tobacco Industry respectively elaborated on the generous year-end bonuses of the two industries in the past. The representative of the Cotton Textile Industry also estimated that if the year-end bonus is limited to one month, those who are allocated 20% will take 40 days less of the salary bonus, those with 25% will take two months less of the bonus, and those with 30% will take two and a half months less of the bonus. This kind of huge profit is enjoyed by the capital side, and the real heart is unwilling. At this point, several representatives of the General Labor Union agreed that the year-end bonus should not be rigidly stipulated. Manufacturers with huge profits should issue more, otherwise it will make the workers feel bad and production will inevitably decline. It is best to have representatives from both labor and management openly and honestly directly negotiate, which should be easier to reach an agreement. Piece work should also be given a year-end bonus, because female workers in the overshoe industry and the cigarette industry are all piece work and are highly efficient. This working system cannot be overthrown due to the year-end bonus issue. Of course, the so-called "piece work" refers to piece work done in the factory, and those working outside the factory are not in this case.

### Industries with High Profits Should Increase Public Accumulation Funds

At this time, Shou Jingwei provided his opinion from a neutral standpoint, saying: I advocate that the name of the year-end bonus should be changed to "year-end bonus", so that it has the meaning of rewarding hard work. Industries with high profits, such as today's cotton textile industry, should increase public accumulation funds to strengthen the foundation of the business. The labor and management of our country need to increase the opportunity to contact each other in order to communicate ideas and eliminate misunderstandings. Shou emphasized the fundamental solution, stressing that the government must reform the financial and economic policies to save the crisis of industry and commerce.

### Fang Xikong Expresses His Opinion and Proposes Six Measures for Year-End Bonuses

After the representatives generally expressed their opinions, the chairman invited Chairman Fang Xikong to give a speech. Fang made proposals on the year-end bonus issue item by item: (1) The year-end bonus is limited to one month. (2) The industry association and the Labor Union should first negotiate. If there is a dispute, they should submit it to the government agency for ruling. (3) For a small number of manufacturers with considerable profits, their year-end bonuses can also be negotiated first by representatives of labor and management. If there are difficulties, the government will raise the year-end bonus to seek its balance. (4) It is hoped that each industry will complete the above method within a week and do not delay it, so as not to change. (5) The year-end bonus should be changed to a bonus to imply the equality of labor and management. (6) It is best to give bonuses to workers with special achievements and reduce bonuses to those who deliberately disrupt.

### Director Wu Summarizes Opinions and Decides that the Bonus Has Flexibility

The meeting had passed 7 o'clock at this time. Director Wu summarized the opinions of the representatives and made the following decisions: (1) "Year-end bonus" is renamed "year-end incentive bonus". (2) The incentive bonus is based on one month's salary, but needs to be flexible. (3) Once the bonus is determined, the capital side should pay it quickly to avoid the drop in currency value. (4) The bonuses for piece workers and temporary workers shall be handled in accordance with the previous year's precedent of each manufacturer (temporary workers who have been in service for three months are considered long-term workers). If there is a dispute over the year-end bonus, it must be handled in accordance with the legal procedures, and neither party shall take free action, otherwise it will be strictly enforced by law.

At this point, Director Wu emphasized the benefits and importance of the "Factory Council", hoping that the factory will widely establish this kind of conference and exert its true effect. Shui Xiangyun pointed out that the establishment of the factory council system is just a formality, mainly because the capital side's behavior of buying US dollars for hoarding is too much, and they dare not make the accounts public. A representative said that the lack of understanding between labor and management is indeed the reason for this. Wu emphasized that the factory council is a bridge between labor and management. The factory can select talents and train cadres, and this meeting has no right to interfere with administration, so there is no need to be afraid of opening it. Wu also believed that the Soviet Union's "Labor Hero" model worker system is worthy of being adopted by China's industrial circles.

It is said that the various bureaus of the Municipal Government held emergency meetings in the afternoon yesterday to rush to produce the expenditure budget for next year again.

### Discovery of an Illegally Established Radio Station in Zhabei; Investigation Reveals No Political Activity; Male and Female Perpetrators Handed Over to the District Procuratorate

In order to prevent traitors from using radio waves to transmit intelligence and undermine national defense construction, the Ministry of National Defense has specifically ordered all provincial and municipal public security agencies and the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to strictly crack down on such activities. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, upon receiving the order, immediately utilized special equipment to closely detect secret radio stations. Recently, while measuring space radio waves with a radio wave measuring device, the Headquarters discovered abnormal radio waves in the Zhabei area north of the city. They then used a mobile, small-scale wave measuring device to investigate based on the direction of the radio waves, and learned that this secret radio station was located at No. 75 Shuidaidian Road, Zhabei. They immediately dispatched personnel to raid the location and seized a medium-sized transmitter and two radio operators, Wu Xuesi and Xu Ping, who were working at the time. They were immediately taken back to the Headquarters for strict interrogation, which revealed that An Shitang, who resided at the same address, had funded the establishment of the radio station, and that the equipment belonged to Dong Zhibin, an employee of a certain organization in Suzhou. The Headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to arrest An Shitang, but Dong Zhibin had already fled upon hearing the news. According to An's confession, they established the radio station for profit, charging 150 yuan per word for commercial telegrams, which were sent to Haimen, Xuzhou, Suzhou, and Guangzhou. The recipient location was a female employee of the Dayun Transportation Company, Lu Maozhu, at No. 666 Fuzhou Road, who was running the business. Lu was immediately arrested at the address, and her testimony matched An Shitang's. After further investigation of the seized evidence, it was confirmed that there was no political activity involved, and the offense was a violation of the Telecommunications Control Regulations promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Communications. In addition to confiscating the transmitter according to regulations, the original case file was transferred to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for handling. The Bureau Director, Yu Bingjian, immediately reported to the Ministry of Communications for instructions on how to handle the matter. The Ministry instructed that they must be severely punished according to the law, and therefore the involved individuals were handed over to the District Procuratorate. The staff of the Garrison Headquarters worked day and night to detect and investigate secret radio stations, and their dedication is truly admirable. Therefore, yesterday, 3 million legal tender was allocated as a bonus.

### China National Aviation Corporation Plans to Establish Sino-American Air Route; Plans to Cooperate with American Airlines First

[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the official signing of the Sino-American Aviation Agreement, various American airlines will soon begin flying to China. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining large aircraft ordered by Chinese airlines, they are currently unable to fly long distances for the time being. China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) previously ordered four C-54 aircraft from the United States, but due to frequent worker strikes in American aircraft factories, these aircraft will not arrive in China until the end of next year at the earliest. Before the arrival of its own aircraft, CNAC plans to cooperate with Northwest Airlines of the United States, but this can only be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Communications. If approved, Northwest Airlines will be responsible for the Sino-American route from the United States to Manila, and CNAC will be responsible for the section from Manila to Shanghai.

### Abolition of the Slaughter Tax Collection Office

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Finance Bureau considered the situation of the slaughter tax in Shanghai to be extremely complex. Upon initial takeover, in order to facilitate centralized management, it specially established the Slaughter Tax Collection Office to be solely responsible for its duties. After the Office's active reorganization, tax revenues increased every month. Now, the Finance Bureau believes that the slaughter tax has entered a regularized state, and in order to unify tax administration, it has decided to abolish the Office. Its business will be handled separately by the tax collection offices in each district, with the handover scheduled for the 16th of this month. It is also reported that the Finance Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of the tax collection offices in each district and the head of the Slaughter Tax Collection Office the day before yesterday (the 12th) to discuss the handover procedures.

### Refusal to Pawn Clothes Leads to Shooting and Injury; Two Police Officers Injured in the Line of Duty

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At about 9:30 last night, a customer suddenly arrived at the Yongda Pawnshop at No. 35 Xinmin Road, Hongkou. He resembled a soldier, with a shaved head, wearing a military uniform under a black coat. He pointed to the coat and said to the shop assistant that he wanted to pawn it. At that time, two shop assistants were in the shop, one named Song Jifang, 25 years old, was washing his feet, and another named Shang Ling (20 years old, from Anhui Province) was sitting on a high stool at the counter. Shang casually told him that military uniforms could not be pawned. Unexpectedly, without asking for a reason, the man took out a pistol and fired a shot at Song, hitting his left temple, causing blood to flow profusely. Brain matter splattered, and the injured man fell back on the chair. The shooter immediately fled out the door. People in the shop shouted loudly. Soon, three or four security team policemen arrived at the scene after hearing the shouts. After asking a few questions, they turned around and went out to pursue the shooter, but were unsuccessful. At the same time, the Hongkou Police Station received a report and immediately dispatched Inspector Yin and policemen Ma Guiliang and Hu Genbao to investigate. They immediately called an ambulance to rush the injured man to the Public Hospital for emergency treatment. On the way, the policemen were hit by a tram at the intersection of Bazilu and Sichuan Road, causing Police Chief Ma Guiliang to be concussed and bleed from his left temple, and Policeman Hu Genbao to injure his left knee. According to investigations by reporters, the injured shop assistant, Song Shangling, has little hope of survival.

### Textbook Piracy Case; Court Postpones Retrial

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wu Bingchang, the legal representative of the Joint Office of National Primary and Secondary School Teaching Materials, sued Zhu Wenxiang of Wanyou Bookstore for infringing copyright by reprinting teaching materials. Yesterday, the court held a hearing. Judge Zhu Yuhuang stated that because the first defendant, Zhu Wenxiang, had also been prosecuted by the District Procuratorate, he needed to review the prosecution case file before deciding whether to accept the private prosecution or the public prosecution. Therefore, although Zhu Wenxiang was currently in custody, he was not brought in for questioning yesterday. Only the second defendant, Lu Xiancheng of Guomin Printing Bureau, the third defendant, Wang Jisheng of Shengji Printing House, the fourth defendant, Lu Jinrong of Tuhai Xingye Printing House, and the fifth defendant, He Zongliang of Juji Binding Workshop, were summoned. This was because all five defendants were suspected of assisting or being entrusted by Zhu Wenxiang to reprint 290,000 copies of national primary and secondary school teaching materials. Judge Zhu stated that the trial procedure was still pending decision, and ordered the case to be retried on the morning of the 19th.

### Social Bureau Convenes Coal Briquette Merchants to Form Coal Price Review Committee; Allocates 4,000 Tons of Manufacturing Raw Materials

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Social Bureau convened the Coal Briquette Merchants Association, the Coal Industry Association, and representatives of coal briquette retailers for a discussion at the Social Bureau. It was resolved that the Social Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council, the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Coal Industry Association, the Coal Briquette Industry Association, and coal briquette retailers would jointly form a Coal Price Review Committee, and that the first meeting would be held on the 17th.

### Shinsin Company Employees Implement "Lazy Work"

Employees of the Shinsin Company began a "strike" at around 4:00 PM on the 12th due to a request for year-end bonuses. The employees believe that the cost of living is rising day by day, and their income is insufficient to make ends meet. Therefore, they requested that the half-year bonus (one month's salary), which has been in place for 21 years, be issued as usual. The management, however, stated that business was sluggish and losses were accumulating. Therefore, the labor and management sides insisted on their respective positions, and yesterday they were still in a state of "lazy work". The walls and counters were covered with slogans such as "Today, according to government orders, we neither strike nor slack off" and "Please customers take the trouble to purchase goods elsewhere."

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Related parties stated that in this labor dispute at Shinsin Company, the employees demanded that the person in charge respond within a very short period after making their request. When the person in charge said that the conditions needed to be approved by the board of directors, they demanded that he guarantee that the board of directors would definitely approve the labor's conditions, which was clearly unreasonable. Moreover, without the permission of the Social Bureau, they implemented a disguised strike, which is illegal in terms of legal procedures, regardless of whether their demands are reasonable. It was heard that the workers' representatives even stated at the Social Bureau that they could resolve the matter themselves and did not need the Bureau's mediation, which was an attempt to threaten the management with free action. The Social Bureau has now ordered them to immediately restore normal operations and then negotiate. According to a responsible person from the General Labor Union, the labor-management relationship at Shinsin Company has always been relatively good. In the past, when the company had financial difficulties, the labor side accepted the method of paying 70% of their salaries. When salaries could not be paid, the company used gift certificates instead. The "bonus salary" has a history of 21 years, and the management's sudden cancellation of it has caused the labor dispute.

### Collusion from Inside and Outside; Traffic Police Collude with Postal Workers; Shanghai Bank Robbed; 30 Million Stolen During Closing; Employees in the Vault Shouted for Help; North Railway Station Identifies the Perpetrator; Accomplice Arrested in Suzhou

[Reported by Our Newspaper] At 7:30 PM the night before last, four robbers wearing uniforms suddenly entered the Tilamqiao branch of Shanghai Bank at No. 1144 Daming Road through the back door while the bank was closing accounts. One of the robbers, with his face blackened, raised a pistol and ordered all personnel inside the bank to raise their hands. Then, they drove them to a corner, tied up the bank employees one by one with leggings, and took the safe key from the pocket of the bank's accounting director, Wu Yufu. They opened the vault door and stole 30 million in cash and four gold rings. Then, they locked the employees inside the vault, closed the vault door, and the robbers escaped through the back door. When the bank employees saw that the robbers were gone, they shouted for help. Passersby heard the shouts and immediately rushed to the Tilamqiao Police Station to report the crime. After receiving the report, the Police Station dispatched Judicial Section Chief Ma and police officers to the scene. They first released the bank employees, but by that time the robbers had already fled far away. Only two hand grenades were found left behind. Fearing that the robbers might leave Shanghai by train, they took two bank employees to the North Railway Station to wait that very night. At about 11:00 PM, they saw two robbers wearing traffic police uniforms and carrying travel bags approaching. The bank employees identified them without error and they were immediately intercepted. A portion of the stolen money was found on the spot. According to their confessions, their names were Luo Bo and Gong Xisheng, and they were taken back to the Police Station. Subsequently, two postal workers, Li Xiguang and Yuan Zemin, who served as inside men, were arrested at the Zhongshan Hotel in Hongkou and the Shanghai Bank branch on North Sichuan Road. It was heard that there was still a traffic policeman at large, who had taken a train back to Suzhou to rejoin his unit. Therefore, the Tilamqiao Police Station prepared a document yesterday and dispatched personnel to Fengqiao Town outside the Suzhou gate to arrest the robber Liu Yucheng. Three gold rings and 3 million in stolen money were found. According to his confession, he is a current messenger for the 11th column of the Traffic Police Team, and he admitted without hesitation to the robbery. He was escorted back to Shanghai last night. Another accomplice who is still at large is being vigorously pursued. It was learned afterwards that the four robbers were all policemen from the 4th battalion of the 11th column of the Traffic Police General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.

### 1.5 Million Tons of UNRRA Relief Supplies; UNRRA Plans to Ship 300 Ocean Liners to Shanghai Next Spring; Mostly Food, Machinery, and Materials

[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to UNRRA sources, after the resolution of the U.S. maritime workers' strike, 83 ocean liners will soon transport supplies to China. Some of these are currently being loaded, while others are already en route. The first two ships to depart are the "Protector" and the "De Lin Maxke." The former is carrying 260 tons of cargo, and the latter is carrying 560 tons, including diesel engines, water pumps, electric welders, sewing machines, and fishing equipment.

UNRRA hopes to have 300 ocean liners to transport all 1.5 million tons of relief supplies. However, the exact number of ships needed will depend on loading conditions, ship size, and the number of ships specifically carrying relief supplies. The main supplies carried by these ships are food, including American flour, Siamese white rice, and South American soybeans. The next is industrial equipment, including machinery, railway tracks, locomotives, and bridges. In addition, there are fishing gear and clothing for the restoration of China's fishing industry.

The arrival date of the ships in Shanghai will be around January or February next spring, but this mainly depends on the condition of the city's port and warehouses. UNRRA is now able to free up some warehouse space on a weekly basis. The speed at which China transports the supplies inland will determine how soon the ships will arrive in Shanghai. The congestion in the city has now been eliminated, and the wharves and warehouses have been greatly improved. UNRRA and the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) also have many tractors, barges, cranes, and other tools, so it is believed that even if a large number of ships arrive, unloading will be very rapid. UNRRA and CNRRA authorities are closely monitoring the port situation to prevent congestion from recurring and will telegraph instructions to the ships en route.

### Temporary Postponement of Demolition of Shantytowns Due to Cold Weather; City Council Asks City Government to Consider the Livelihoods of the Poor

After the chairman's report, the following proposals were discussed: (1) The Speaker submitted a proposal stating that since the city has entered winter, there have been frequent reports of refugees freezing to death. It is proposed that the council launch a city-wide fundraising campaign to assist with winter relief efforts, and to attach a notice to all citizens of the city. The question is whether this is appropriate. Resolution: Passed. (2) Approve the City Government's response regarding the adjustment of pawnshop interest rates and submit it for discussion. Decision: The period is still set at six months. If there are difficulties in turnover, the Municipal Bank should adjust it. (3) Approve the City Government's response regarding compensation for war losses. The Executive Yuan has approved the extension of the reporting deadline by one month, and the compensation value is a general case and cannot be changed easily. How should this be handled? Resolution: Report to the general meeting. (4) Approve the City Government and Social Affairs Bureau's separate forwarding of the implementation measures for sugar sales per capita in the city. What should be done? Resolution: If it is intended to handle the matter, it should be filed for record and kept on file. (5) Approve the transfer of the revised draft management measures for employee welfare facilities by the Law and Regulations Committee. How should this be handled? Resolution: Passed in accordance with the amendments of the Law and Regulations Committee. (6) At the previous meeting of this committee, Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan proposed that the Public Utilities Bureau restrict the use of electricity. The Public Utilities Bureau should be requested to send personnel to attend and report in detail for reference and research. Now that the Public Utilities Bureau has sent personnel to report, how should this be handled? Resolution: Request the Public Utilities Bureau to actively find ways to open up power sources, while paying attention to the minimum needs of the people and taking into account the needs of handicrafts. There were also two temporary motions: (1) Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan proposed that the City Government be requested to temporarily postpone the demolition of shantytowns in the midst of winter in order to maintain the livelihoods of the city's poor. Should this be decided? Resolution: Passed. (2) For the sake of conveying democratic education to the public and making the contents of the General Assembly clear to all citizens, broadcasting equipment should be installed in the meeting place to broadcast the actual situation of the General Assembly to the city. Is this appropriate for submission to the General Assembly for decision? Resolution: Passed, please have the Speaker and Deputy Speaker verify.

### Senate Appeals for Disaster Relief Victims: Letter to Citizens Urging Donations

To all citizens of Shanghai: Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been severely cold, and scenes of suffering people are commonly seen in the streets and alleys. They have no food for the night, their clothes do not cover their bodies, they are tormented by hunger, struggle under the frost, their bodies are weak, diseases follow, and news of death is heard daily. Thinking of the disaster victims, how can we not feel deep sympathy? Fortunately, the local authorities in this city are preparing for the winter season and various relief efforts are being actively carried out. However, the disaster victims are scattered and difficult to track, and the relief efforts may not be comprehensive. The scope of assistance should be as broad as possible. Taking the lead in righteousness is something that should not be disturbed. This council sincerely appeals to all sectors of the city, respectfully requesting people from all walks of life to rise up and provide assistance by donating to the Winter Relief Committee of this city. The aim is to ensure that all refugees in the city receive practical benefits and that the rescue work is completed as soon as possible. This council is deeply concerned about the displaced and feels the suffering of those affected. We dare to make an appeal, asking for generous assistance. We do not dare to expect a grand mansion, but even a spoonful of help will be greatly appreciated. Respond to the call and be eager to do good. Seeing righteousness, one should bravely act. With this announcement, we hope for your kind consideration. Respectfully, the Shanghai Municipal Senate.

### Barber Served as Enemy Interpreter; Bu Jisheng Exploited Power

The case of Bu Jisheng was also concluded yesterday, with the verdict scheduled to be announced on the 20th of this month. Bu is a barber who is fluent in Japanese. He was accused of serving as an interpreter for the enemy forces in Guazhou and Zhenjiang. Later, he opened a barber shop in Shanghai, while still working as a translator for the enemy navy. In April of the 28th year of the Republic, he learned that Sun Guangqing, the head of the township who had organized a self-defense force to resist the Japanese in Guazhou, had come to Shanghai. He reported Sun to the enemy police, who arrested Sun at the Huade Restaurant on Fourth Road.

The matter was reported to the ERRSA headquarters in Nanjing. After receiving the report, the headquarters sent personnel to Shanghai for a secret investigation. It was learned that after coming to Shanghai, Xizhi became acquainted with a Chinese woman and they were deeply fond of each other. Many of the factory staff were introduced through family connections. Some of the above suspects are also considered to be "close relatives." Xizhi usually lived a very extravagant lifestyle, leading to heavy suspicion of theft and sale.

### ERRSA Assists Manufacturers in Ordering Industrial Machinery

[Report from this Newspaper] The ERRSA Shanghai branch believes that the ERRSA's work in the future will focus on post-war reconstruction, and the Shanghai branch will give as much assistance as possible to industrial development. However, the branch's task is only to accept and review applications from public utilities and manufacturers for ordering machinery. The final decision rests with the headquarters. The principle of application is to prioritize public utilities, followed by coal mines, machine repair shops, and then building materials. After the application is approved, a deposit of 30% of the price must be paid first. If the goods can be delivered in a short period of time, the payment should be cleared within six months, otherwise, it can be paid within three years, but 30% of the original price must be added as transportation costs. Currently, the supply of goods from American factories is extremely scarce. Domestic manufacturers find it faster to order through ERRSA, so the number of applicants is extremely high.

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Bureau of Public Works believes that the central Huangpu District of this city has the most prosperous traffic, with extremely crowded vehicles and pedestrians. The protruding bottleneck buildings on the roads are the biggest cause of traffic congestion. However, the depth of the bottlenecks occupying the roads is different, and the building height and period are also different. Therefore, it is planned to classify and eliminate them in stages. Within the area south of Suzhou Creek, north of Zhongzheng East Road, west of Zhongshan East 1st Road, and east of Xizang Middle Road, the bottleneck buildings that protrude the most into the road, with a depth exceeding one-half of the prescribed road width, totaling 29 locations, will be ordered to be taken down first to facilitate traffic. The 29 locations are based on each land registration number. If the height and construction period of the houses are used as a unit, they are as follows: (1) 18 locations are buildings of two floors or less that are more than 20 years old. (2) Four locations are buildings of two floors or less that are less than 20 years old. (3) 12 locations are buildings of three floors or more that are more than 20 years old. The Bureau of Public Works has conducted a detailed investigation and will begin to implement it after it is approved by the Municipal Conference.

(3) What kind of food causes roundworm parasitism? (4) What kind of food should be avoided when taking vitamin supplements?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin, Doctor of Physical Education] (1) The dosage and method of administration of Santonin or Bedermin (Bayer) must be prescribed by a doctor; (2) Eat less meat, hard fruits, and stimulants that are not easily digested. Walk for a while after eating, or use the method of eating less and more meals; (3) The invasion of roundworms is mostly mediated by unclean raw food; (4) No taboos.

(Two) Hair and eyebrow loss

Zhang Jifen asks: I have suffered from hair loss for two years. Although I have been treated by skin experts, it has been ineffective. Although new hair grows in the area where the hair has fallen out after a considerable period of time, the old hair continues to fall out. Recently, my eyebrows have also begun to gradually fall out. I have three questions, please answer them. (1) Is there any special treatment for this disease? (2) Is exposure to a sun lamp effective? (3) Can it heal on its own without treatment?

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] (1) Usually, apply a local irritant to improve blood circulation in the hair loss area, thereby promoting the nutrition and regeneration function of the hair.

(Three) Chest pain and hemoptysis

Due to an unstable life and malnutrition after the illness, I often have chest pain, severe coughing, and frequent facial inflammation. I have hemoptysis every few weeks. Doctors say it is bronchitis, some say it is anemia, and others think it is pulmonary tuberculosis. There are different treatments, and I don't know what to do. I have injected calcium iodide, glucose calcium, and anti-tuberculosis, and also take cod liver oil and Halipar pills, etc., but none of them have worked. Recently, the disease has changed slightly. The chest pain is as usual, my appetite is almost gone, and I often have chills and fever. I feel hot and swollen when I get up and lie down. I don't know what disease it is, so I pray for a treatment method.

[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] Immediately perform an X-ray examination of the lungs to diagnose whether there is pulmonary tuberculosis, test the blood pressure to see if it is too high, and then decide on a treatment method.

### Market Buying is One-Sided; Gold, Stocks, and Foreign Exchange Soar to Unprecedented Heights; Gold Spot Prices Break Records Again; Shanghai Stocks Rise to the Limit After Opening

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, gold prices soared, and the rise was extremely violent. The Central Bank's supply was extremely scarce, and people's hearts were unusually firm. The opening price in the morning was 3,000,800 yuan. After the opening, people still seemed dazed, struggling at the 3 million yuan mark for a while. Once the 3 million yuan mark was stabilized, buyers were extremely excited, the supply was not smooth, and the price rose sharply. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 3,060,000 yuan. Foreign exchange repeatedly assisted buying, and the market became better and better. Near noon, it suddenly soared to 3.2 million yuan. At noon, it hovered around 3.19 million yuan. In the afternoon, next-day delivery soared to over 3.35 million yuan in the chaos. The Central Bank exerted pressure, and many parties sold off urgently, immediately falling back more than 100,000 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 250,000 yuan compared to the previous day, decorative gold was 340,000 yuan, silver ingots and silver dollars were flat, and dark interest was still around 1 jiao 3 fen.

In the afternoon, a high price of 6,500 yuan was seen, but later, as the gold market fell, it also fell back. The buying and selling prices diverged by 200 yuan, and the transaction was extremely chaotic. Finally, it was between 6,300 yuan and 6,500 yuan, a sharp increase of 600 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars were extremely high and also rose by 220 yuan.

### Even Tiles Have Their Day; The Shanghai Stock Market is Bustling

Shanghai stocks rose abnormally again yesterday. Some bulls entered after exiting first, and the shorts were squeezed and could not move, almost in a situation of buying without selling. In addition to rising to the limit, there were also buyers willing to buy at today's limit. Each stock had already reported a surge at the opening in the morning. No. 199, No. 233, No. 133, etc. all advanced and then reported a high flight. Some of the selling at high prices included No. 151, No. 177, No. 179, No. 90, No. 145, No. 198, and Guangbang, causing a falling wind, but it did not break the opening line. People's hearts are still stable. No. 38, No. 133, No. 76, No. 12, No. 36, No. 142, No. 160, No. 83, No. 212, and No. 215 were successively purchased.

Financial gangs such as No. 181 and No. 68 also advanced. In addition, the outside market first reported a limit up, so the current Diyong Yarn also reported a limit up after the cold stocks rose to the limit. Afterwards, the shorts urgently replenished, and the longs vigorously raised the price. Diyong Yarn even rose to over 600 yuan, and Xinhuo also had a transaction at 290 yuan. All stocks except Cement Five Harmony all reported a limit up. In the afternoon, they were still in the limit up. The outside dark market Diyong Yarn once pulled up to 640 yuan, and then quickly returned. Xinhuo traded at 295 yuan. Finally, the price of gold fell sharply, and the longs closed out and fell sharply. Diyong Yarn once fell to 570 yuan, and Xinhuo was 275 yuan. At the close, Diyong Yarn was around 580 yuan, and Xinhuo was around 280 yuan. The outside stocks also reported an upward trend.

### Government Bonds Also Turned Up Yesterday

Government bonds also trended up yesterday. The Tong Bing opened in the morning at 1,250 yuan, and rose back to 1,430 yuan due to purchases by rooms 503 and 604, and then slightly flattened.

### Under Gold Price Leadership, Silk Rises in Unison

Yesterday, the silk market was again influenced by the rise in gold prices, with all categories blindly following suit. No trading was done for No. 120 rayon, Guangtian Bridge brand. Gaoshan brand opened in the morning at a bid of 300,000 yuan, rising to 520,000 yuan by noon, and the highest bid reached over 700,000 yuan in the afternoon. Later, as gold prices slightly retreated, it also softened, with a bid of 600,000 yuan lacking takers. Dongyang brand was bid at 650,000 yuan, a significant increase of 200,000 to 250,000 yuan compared to the previous day. No. 120 brand semi-lustrous was traded in the morning at 3.85 million yuan. No. 75 Golden Rooster semi-lustrous saw transactions at 4.15 million yuan in the morning. No. 100 Snow Pagoda non-lustrous opened at 3.6 million yuan, but there were no transactions in the afternoon. Factory prices were also high, and the market was quite chaotic. Holders were unwilling to sell, resulting in few transactions. The China Silk Corporation did not open yesterday. The Silk Industry Corporation sold 20 to 30 bales at a price of 4.05 million yuan. Due to the high price of raw materials, the factory prices of silk fabrics also increased, with bedspreads up by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, patterned crepe up by 100 yuan, and Hua scarf crepe and feather gauze both up by 100 yuan. Dawei tweed was selling well, and the price was also hot. Sheng Hang and other goods remained relatively stable. Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned higher, as the余鈔 (Yu Chao, likely referring to excess paper money) was repeatedly reported to be soaring. The sluggish yarn market received a shot in the arm, boosting morale. Industry insiders absorbed the念支 (Nian Zhi, likely referring to a brand of yarn) brands earlier, and weaving mills sought 42-count double-strand yarn later, eventually closing at the highest price.念支 brands were up 30,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and 42-count yarn rose by about 100,000 yuan.

### National Cotton Should Improve: Observations on the Dyeing and Weaving Industry

[Our Report] According to a leading figure in the local dyeing and weaving industry, the government's decision to exchange yarn for cotton will require yarn mills to use American cotton, which must be exchanged for their yarn production, thus making full use of national cotton to avoid exchange restrictions. Therefore, it is expected that the future of national cotton will gradually improve.

### Importers Switch to Export Business

Since the establishment of the Import Control Committee in this city, the control of imported goods has gradually become effective. Therefore, local importers are switching to export goods. It is expected that the export business will have a promising future. However, a large supply of production is needed to cope with the demand.

### Generator Malfunction Forces Yarn Mills to Halt Production

The power company is actively repairing; power generation may be restored today.

Amidst the panic over power shortages, yesterday, all state-owned and private yarn mills in this city were cut off by the power company and forced to stop production. Seventeen factories of the Fangjian Corporation and 34 private yarn mills were cut off at 10:00 AM. The factories reported to the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, which was extremely alarmed, but no one knew the truth about the power outage. Wang Qiyu, the chairman of the association, together with Shu Yunzhang, the general manager of the Fangjian Corporation, and others, visited Mayor Wu around 4:00 PM and requested Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to jointly inquire about the truth. According to Mayor Wu's report, the Shanghai Power Company had a 12,000-kilowatt generator that malfunctioned the day before yesterday. Yesterday, another 10,000-kilowatt generator suddenly broke down, reducing the total power supply by 30,000 kilowatts. The company had no choice but to temporarily cut off power to all yarn mills in the city. Other power users were not affected. However, the two damaged generators had only minor internal problems, and the power company is rushing to repair them and expects to restore power generation today.

### Rice Market Rebounds with Gold Price; Oilseed Cakes and Grains Also Show Strength

The rice market received over 16,000 shi (a unit of dry volume) of rice from both north and south. The weather turned overcast, and demand from stores increased. With the surge in red gold, morale improved, leading to strong sales and a rebounding market. Northern and southern japonica rice rose in unison by over 1,000 yuan. White阴元 (Yin Yuan, likely referring to a grade of rice) was high, while削次 (Xiao Ci, likely referring to a grade of rice) was stable. Indica rice also followed suit, rising by 1,000 yuan. The oil market echoed the other commodities, stopping its decline and rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Demand remained strong. Flour showed slight strength, while bran remained flat. Soybean exports slowed, and oil mills were selectively purchasing, resulting in a mediocre trend. Broad beans remained unchanged.南洋 (Nanyang, likely referring to Southeast Asia) continued to purchase green beans, with limited supply, leading to another increase of over 1,000 yuan. Red beans were nominally stable but actually firm. Red sorghum saw movement in distilleries due to scarce supply, rebounding by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame continued to be selected for high quality by Cantonese merchants, rising by another 300 to 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw ordinary purchases from Cantonese merchants, resulting in a fluctuating situation. The supply of wheat was very limited, and prices were strong, rising by another 300 to 500 yuan. Soybean cake saw transactions in both Taiwan and oil production, and sellers were firm, with prices rising by 200 to 300 yuan. The future trend will depend on the extent of digestion in other areas.

### Mayor Wu Answers Reporters' Questions: No News of High-Price Policy; Loans Intended to Promote Factory Production; Improper to Stir Up the Market Opportunistically

[Our Report] Yesterday, the gold, US dollar, and stock market in this city continued to climb to new peaks under the continuous stimulation of various rumors. There were reports that the authorities would consider a high-price policy, and that the International Monetary Fund Conference would announce the exchange rates between member countries next Monday, predicting that China's external exchange rate would change. Reporters then visited Mayor Wu to inquire whether the authorities were considering a high-price policy. Mayor Wu said: "I have not heard of it." He also said: "The authorities are handling production loans to facilitate the funding of production enterprises, so as to continue to increase production. When the decision was made, it was also expected that the market might be stimulated. As expected, before the loans were released, speculators stirred up the market and caused trouble, which is very inappropriate."

According to an observer, although the International Monetary Fund Conference is scheduled to announce the exchange rates between member countries next Monday, President Song has previously stated that countries directly affected by the war can postpone the announcement of their external exchange rates. Therefore, it is expected that the news may not be as general as observed in our country. Moreover, the implementation of the revised import and export trade measures is in its initial stage, and it seems unnecessary to adjust the exchange rate again.

### Taiwan Trade Bureau Emphasizes the Export of Special Products

In the past, the focus of the Taiwan Trade Bureau's business was on supporting production and transportation, supplying important raw materials, and solving the problems of "clothing," "food," "housing," and "transportation" to meet the needs of the people of Taiwan Province. In the future, it will focus on the export of Taiwan's special products such as coal, tea, pineapple, canned goods, fruits, grass mats, and sugar produced by the Bureau itself.

### Hankou Plans to Establish Public Warehouses; Warehouse Receipts Can Be Used as Collateral

The Hankou Municipal Government plans to establish public warehouses to store industrial and commercial raw materials and finished products. Once the goods are stored in the warehouse, merchants can apply to municipal banks for loans based on the value of the goods to facilitate turnover.

### New Plan for Handling Black Market Cotton Yarn; Under Review by President Song; Preliminary Agreement Reached at Group Meeting

[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Guild convened a nine-member group meeting again yesterday morning from 11:00 AM. Wang Qiyu, the chairman of the association, and several executive directors also attended. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged on the new principles for handling cotton yarn. It was heard that several representatives at the meeting could not fully agree on the concentration of guild applications and distribution. The discussion lasted until about 3:00 PM before the meeting adjourned. It was heard that a preliminary agreement has been reached on the final application and distribution point.

According to Wu, the concurrent chairman of the Cotton Management Committee, the new plan for handling cotton yarn is currently under review by President Song. Once the approval is received, the Cotton Management Committee can convene a meeting to discuss implementation.

### Tea Market Still Not Reviving

The domestic sales of black and green tea have still not revived. In the foreign tea market, English merchants are still holding onto high-end old Keemun tea, making transactions sluggish. Other teas, such as 抽珍 (Chou Zhen, likely referring to a grade of tea) and 珍眉 (Zhen Mei, likely referring to a grade of tea) of inferior quality, are difficult to sell continuously. Although this year's new tea suits the taste, the price is surprisingly high, and merchants are afraid to touch it. Therefore, the process is clear. However, since Wenchang Tea Company resumed the handling of Wenzhou Xin Zhenmei (New Zhenmei) tea, it is still being dragged in, and the situation is very stable. According to industry insiders, the low-grade green tea, such as Gongxi and Gongzhu, that used to be sold to India has been self-sufficient since the country strived to produce it itself. However, there is still a need for high-end varieties, but the lack of shipping makes it difficult to fulfill.

### Barter Trade; More Tung Oil and Bristles; Tea Sales Sluggish and Procurement Becomes a Problem

The Sino-Soviet barter trade handled by the Central Trust Bureau will take several more years to complete due to poor transportation and difficulty in determining prices, and will not be completed until 1952. The Sino-Soviet barter trade work this year will end soon, and the specified barter value has also been fulfilled. The total barter value this year is 11 million US dollars, all of which are agricultural products, including tung oil, bristles, tea, etc.

Regarding the Sino-French barter trade, the Central Trust Bureau has also received several calls from French merchants to purchase tea, but the price could not be agreed upon, so the tea handled by the Central Trust Bureau was not exported. There have been sporadic automatic sales by tea merchants, but they are very few and are only exploratory in nature.

According to another source, tea merchants, hopeless about tea exports, are asking the government to purchase tea at reasonable prices. The government is unwilling to freeze a portion of funds due to stagnant tea sales. However, remedial measures are still under discussion, and it is feared that there will be no concrete measures this year.

### Central Bank Revises Method for Exchanging Damaged Banknotes

The Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has noted that there are a large number of damaged banknotes and unneeded small denominations held by merchants and residents in various places. To facilitate the exchange for citizens, it has notified all branches and offices to earnestly redeem damaged banknotes and small denominations according to the revised method for exchanging damaged banknotes. (1) For slightly damaged banknotes, where the remaining portion is more than three-quarters, even if they have been split but can be matched, or are stained and charred, but the signatures, numbers, words, patterns, etc. are all recognizable, they will be redeemed at full value. (2) For stained banknotes where the remaining portion is less than three-quarters, they will be redeemed at half the value. (3) As for those that have been smoked by fire, immersed in water, stained with oil, or dyed, making it impossible to identify the authenticity, or the remaining portion is less than one-third, or cannot be matched when pieced together, (4) those that have been deliberately cut, dug, tampered with, or had one side removed, or unusable yarn tickets, such as sample tickets and canceled tickets, will not be redeemed. However, in special circumstances, if the remaining portion does not meet the requirements of this method, but the person can prove the facts and the supervisors of the four banks believe that it can be accommodated, it can be redeemed at their discretion. However, the damaged banknote must be signed and certified by the supervisors of the four banks.

### Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Fuel Meeting; Decides to Organize Fuel Price Review Committee; Sets Up Bituminous Coal Ball Group to Review Prices Next Time

The Social Affairs Bureau convened relevant parties yesterday to review the methods for factory coal and rationed coal balls due to the surge in fuel prices in this city and the difficulty for citizens to purchase. Gu Bingyuan, the director of the Economic Administration Office, Wu, the director of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Lu Houlian of the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, Luo Xiongqin of the Coal Business Association, and Wu Yanling, a representative of coal ball retailers, and more than ten other people attended. Five points were discussed: (1) The problem of unblocking the source. The Fuel Management Committee's supply of coal in this city was 4,081 tons in July, 5,058 tons in August, 10,427 tons in September, 13,540 tons in October, and 10,580 tons in November. The rationed price has been maintained since June. Recently, due to the increased allocation price of public utilities, a black market has been triggered. At present, the demand for coal for factories and coal balls for citizens has not increased, but the supply has increased proportionally. The reason is that manufacturers believe that the Fuel Management Committee cannot always maintain the price of coal unchanged. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to unblock the source. The Fuel Management Committee has decided to plan as a whole. This month, 4,000 tons of white coal (2,000 tons of which are semi-bituminous coal) have been shipped in, and it is planned that the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association will formulate the distribution method. 14,095 tons of bituminous coal are planned to be distributed to factories by the Coal Business Association. (2) The previous fixed proportional distribution method for coal allocation was not satisfactory. Starting this month, the quota will be determined based on the size of the factory's business scope and the amount of electricity used, which was passed at the next meeting. (3) The inspection of the composition of coal balls will be supervised by the Social Affairs Bureau and retailers. (4) The problem of coal ball allocation will be drafted by the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association based on the size of the retail store. However, the original stores of the coal ball factory will continue to exist. (5) The problem of coal ball prices is closely related to supervision and manufacturing. The amount of raw materials used by the coal ball factory will determine the amount of coal allocated by the Fuel Management Committee, which will be advanced from the coal business. The proportion of this combination will be used as the standard for setting the price. (6) In order to stabilize coal prices in the future, the Shanghai Coal Price Review Committee will be organized, consisting of seven units: the Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council, the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, the Coal Business Association, and retailers. Two groups will be set up under the committee: the bituminous coal group to handle coal for factories, and the coal ball group, and the price will be reviewed next time.

### Newly Extracted Green Sugar Opened; Goods Can Be Delivered Next Monday

Yesterday, the sugar market was tight due to the shortage of Chaoqing sugar. The recently arrived 300-odd packages of newly extracted green sugar opened at 100,300 yuan yesterday, and the goods can be delivered next Monday. Xinghua Gang opened with Tribute Powder White at 132,300 yuan to 130,000 yuan, followed by 128,000 yuan, Xinghua Red High at 123,000 yuan, and Juezhi at 118,900 yuan. Jian Gang Diaogreen opened up to 100,000 yuan. The association's current market price for white refined sugar is 135,000 yuan, with 3,500 yuan less for the next grade, and 116,000 yuan for raw red sand.

### Abnormal Development of Hong Kong Banking Industry

The Hong Kong industrial and commercial industry is in a slump, but the number of newly opened banks here is increasing every month. Due to the increasing number of newly established banks, each bank is competing for business and has raised the interest rate on deposits to as high as 4%. In terms of remittances, they are also striving for speed and have reduced the remittance rate to 5%, which is equal to the lending rate. It is heard that some banks, due to poor business, have changed their funds to engage in speculation, which is extremely risky.

### American Merchants Hope to Ship National Goods to the United States for Sale

[Our Report] According to Mr. Harvan, the Far East manager of Macy's Company (the world's largest department store), Americans are more concerned about the "Made in China" label after the war than ever before. He hopes that our national products can take advantage of this period to ship to the United States for sale in large quantities at reasonable prices, otherwise other Far Eastern countries will take their place. For example, goods similar to Chinese styles from India and South America are currently being shipped to the United States for sale. He hopes that Chinese producers and exporters will have a long-term vision and try to reduce profits in order to stimulate trade. If goods are not sold during this transitional period, it may lead to dangerous consequences, causing buyers and consumers of Chinese national products to turn to products from other countries.

### Merchants Hope to Relax the Deadline for Pledging Export Materials

The China Import and Export Trade Association, in order to facilitate the turnover of funds for export materials for the industry, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to transfer the business to the Four Banks Joint Office. The Four Banks Joint Office then transferred the request to the Central Bank to formulate a method for lending, re-pledging, and re-discounting export materials, which was approved and notified to various banks and offices for handling. However, the association only received the telegram notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 11th, and has notified the colleagues in the industry. According to a spokesperson for the association, transportation has not fully recovered since the restoration, and inland transportation is quite difficult. According to reports from colleagues recently, it takes as long as two months for goods shipped from Chongqing to Shanghai. Although the government and banks are doing their best to encourage exports and fully supply funds, the third point of the original method stipulates that "the original pledge shall not exceed 90 days, and for Shanghai re-pledging, Chongqing shall not exceed 30 days, Yichang, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shashi shall not exceed 25 days, and other places shall not exceed 20 days," which restricts the export industry and fails to give full play to it. Now, the association is requesting the transportation authorities to allocate ships to speed up transportation, and is encouraging colleagues to actively increase exports in accordance with the government's intentions. At the same time, it plans to request the national banks to appropriately relax the deadline in order to encourage exports and achieve practical results.

### League A Football League: Youyou Meets the Jews Again: Whether Today's Game Can Be Played Depends on the Weather

In the League A football league, Youyou will meet the Jews at Jinyuan Park at 2:30 PM today. Tickets cost two thousand five thousand. However, due to intermittent rain in the past few days, whether today's game can be played, the ball team can call to inquire before 1:00 PM, Jinyuan Public Kingdom No. 36701, Football Committee Office 38683, or listen to the broadcast of the Youth Cultural Changtai at 12:00 noon. The frequency is 1220, call sign YGXM.

Youyou is making a comeback. In the first cycle, except for unfortunately losing to Hequn, they were able to win all the rest of the games. They also tied Qingbai with a score of 1-1, fully demonstrating their strong strength. Today they meet the Jews. Goalkeeper Ladi has recovered from his illness and will play. Cao Qinfang will be replaced by Yuan Kuntian due to illness. The others remain the same. In this year's league, although the Jews have the Italian overseas Chinese Iron Gate Mainiti and the Three Musketeers such as Bao Jiexilati, they are unfortunately a scattered team with a lack of contact and no vitality. They lost to the Soviet Union last week, and there is a general trend of depression. Meeting Youyou today is more ominous than auspicious, and Youyou is sure to win.

According to the notice from the Football Committee: The original Group C game between Meitong and Shangwu tomorrow will be held at Meitong Public School, but the Meitong team has sent a letter requesting withdrawal from the league, so tomorrow's game is decided to be cancelled.

Every Family With Hanging Willows, Canal Water Green at the Door

"The electricity generated by Longmen can reach 1.2 million kilowatts; this work should be done by the central government. The surrounding irrigation and water conservancy should be handled by the local government." But there are more things to think about than can be done. Shaanxi's water conservancy is still centered on irrigation. Canal water turns the yellow earth banks green, and every family has hanging willows in front of their door. However, the Water Conservancy Bureau doesn't know how much more there is to do. Water conservancy projects should have multiple goals, but now there is only one: irrigation. For the Ba'ou Canal, which has been completed and has started releasing water, the Yongli Bureau has sent more than 400 people to manage it and collect water fees based on acreage. For cotton fields, the fees are divided into three grades, with 1 jin, 1 liang, and 4 liang of cotton collected per mu, converted at 360 yuan per jin. For wheat fields, the fees are divided into three grades, with 5 jin, 12 liang, 3 jin, 12 liang, and 1 jin, 14 liang of wheat collected, converted at 48 yuan per jin. For rice fields, 3 jin, 12 liang of rice are collected, and for newly added paddy fields in southern Shaanxi, 7 jin are collected, converted at 40 yuan per jin. The method for converting water fees for the 34th year was agreed upon this spring. Cotton and wheat prices soared, and the autumn collection reached 290 million yuan, which was not enough for management fees. The Water Conservancy Bureau lost money this year, losing 400 million yuan. "We can't do this next year," Water Conservancy Bureau Director Liu Zhongrui told me. "An average of 3,500 yuan per mu is just over 2 jin of cotton, which is not much. Next year, we can collect 4 billion yuan, which can be used for other things."

Four hundred people are not enough to take on all the management work. There are water elders, ditch chiefs, and canal guards on the canals, nominally assisting the water flow personnel. Each canal has a management bureau, divided into several sections, with one ditch elder per section, in charge of several ditch gates, one ditch chief per ditch gate, in charge of several villages and fortresses, and one canal guard per village or fortress. They are all elected by local farmers and are unpaid, only receiving a small stipend, based on acreage, less than 100 yuan per qing. Ditch chiefs receive twice as much as water elders and canal guards because they are more responsible. The Water Conservancy Bureau told me that the water fee grading system is based on ditch gates: each year, from November 1st to October 30th of the following year, is the irrigation year. At the end of the year, each canal management bureau requests the Water Conservancy Bureau, and then forwards a letter to the Finance Department, with both parties sending personnel to the canal to check the water intake situation for the entire year, to see whether to collect or not, and to consult all the water elders. Then, the water fees are set. If the water elders think it is fair, they sign and stamp separately. As for those who are irrigated less frequently or not irrigated at all, they are all exempt. After the date for collecting is set, the local county governments, in accordance with the collection of grain tax version string method, create strings and distribute them for the landlords to seal and submit to the treasury together with the grain tax.

Currently, the Jinghui, Weihui, Meihui, Heihui, Hanhui, Ganrui, Baohui, and Tonghui canals irrigate 1.3 million mu of land. The Jing and Wei canals were completed before the War of Resistance, the Mei, Hei, and other five canals were completed during the War of Resistance, and the Tonghui Canal was funded by local funds, started after the victory, and completed in May of this year. The irrigation area varies, with the Ganrui Canal being the smallest, at just over 3,000 mu, more than 20 times less than the Jinghui Canal, which irrigates more than 700,000 mu.

The five canals currently under construction can irrigate one million mu of land upon completion. The Fenghui Canal is in Qinduzhen, Wei County, irrigating 230,000 mu of land. Construction began in September of the 30th year, and the water diversion project has been fully repaired. Most of the channels and buildings have been completed, and earthen channels are being repaired. The Xuhui Canal is in Shengxian Village, Chenggu County, irrigating 160,000 mu of land, and construction also began in September of the 30th year, with one-tenth or one-twelfth of the project still incomplete. The Laohui Canal is in Yan County, irrigating 100,000 mu of land. Construction began in the 32nd year, and the river dam and tunnel have been completed, and buildings are being repaired. The Dinghui Canal is in Zhaoshiku, Hengshan, diverting water from the Wuding River to irrigate 40,000 mu of land. Construction began in April of the 30th year, and the equipment was completed long ago. Among the buildings, only the inverted siphon and culvert are missing, and the project is still dragging its tail. Recently, there has been heavy fighting in this area, and all the engineering personnel have fled to Yulin. The Luohui Canal is the largest in the middle, diverting water from the Luo River in Dengcheng to irrigate 500,000 mu of land in Dali, Chaoyi, and Pucheng counties. It was started by Li Yizhi's Jingluo Engineering Bureau, which has been working on the project from the 22nd year of the Republic of China until now. Most of the project has been completed, but the water transmission project is extremely difficult. The channel must pass through an iron ore mountain. The 5th tunnel, 3,000 meters long, passes through a quicksand layer and requires a large amount of money and tools. Recent news has come that the 5th tunnel was finally broken through on the 24th of last month. Ten years of construction is really not easy!

The project cannot be completed, dragging its tail, is said to be for money, but in fact, it is mostly affected by bureaucracy, and there are problems with the system. Which of the book-smart guys engaged in these projects is not full of complaints? Making budget requests, the Executive Yuan approves, the Farmers Bank lends at three years' interest, deducted immediately because it is agricultural loan, the procedure is time-consuming, always calculated by the season or year, but always less than the number, tens of percent less than the budget, resulting in a dragging tail, and then make another budget request, scaring the gentlemen who sit in the office with cigars in their mouths, because it is even more than the total amount requested for the first time. The Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau's Laoxu and Ding canals are all like this: the 35th year also needs construction funds. If a discount is given again when issuing the funds, then another request will be made next year, and a small tail will be dragged on the tail. Last year, the Agricultural Bank lent money, but this year the contract has not been signed. The Water Conservancy Bureau said: It's okay if you don't lend, we'll find another way. It is scheduled to be completed this year, let's see by the end of the year.

If international banks lend to Chinese banks, and these banks use the money to raise interest rates and lend it out, making money in the process, it is a big problem. Unless there is a special tacit understanding, international banks are unwilling to do it. The cannon fire drove away the engineers of the Dinghui Canal, and the price crushed the scholars, which the entire international bank cannot buy back.

The Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau is still the same group of people that Li Yizhi brought, and there have been no changes so far. Most of them are Li's students. Shaanxi has achieved some success in water conservancy projects, which is not accidental.

Sanyuan at Dusk, Ancient City Canal Quiet

That evening, I still used the carriage with the surname Tie, leaving the Jingyang farm for Sanyuan. The vast mist gradually enveloped the fields, like a white silk wrapped around the waists of the white poplars. It was just getting dark when I arrived in Sanyuan. The carriage owner kindly took me directly to Dongguan. On the highway, there was a sign of Commander Hu Zongnan, which read in large letters: "Iron-wheeled carts are strictly prohibited from driving on the highway." Because the highway had just been repaired, filling in the ruts. These iron-wheeled carts, pulled by cattle or donkeys, were really powerful and could crush the cement road. My carriage traveled fifteen li on winding country roads before reaching the city of Sanyuan.

Sanyuan is like Suzhou on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Many people who work in Xi'an live here. The small city of 50,000 people is very peaceful. The streets are also lined with neat, towering white poplars. Large and small shops, the calligraphy of Yu Youren on the signboards is everywhere in national stores, and the percentage of signboards with calligraphy by Yu Youren is probably the highest in Sanyuan. Because Sanyuan is Yu Youren's hometown, and Yu Youren's calligraphy has become a trend, even making it unrecognizable. The next day, I went to see the old gentleman's former residence, a few old houses, still with the old scenery. Next door, there is a very beautiful Minzhi Elementary School, which he founded. Every time he returns home, he does not live in the old house but lives in this elementary school. This street is called Xiguan Canal Bian. Large carts loading cotton are arriving one after another.

The city of Sanyuan has an air of affluence. The sounds of cotton ginning and weaving machines can be heard everywhere, all from family handicrafts. The faces of boys and girls are very delicate, which may be why Sanyuan has a Suzhou-like effect on Xi'an. There are as many as eight middle schools, but "the quantity is enough, but the quality is not." Sanyuan is known for its flourishing literary style. Yaoxian to the north is called the gateway to northern Shaanxi. "It will be difficult to go north." I began to hear this kind of talk in Sanyuan. In front of the county government, there are many stone tablets from the Ming and Qing dynasties, explaining the exile system of the Qing dynasty and engraving the water release regulations of the Ba'ou Canal. This canal is still there today. The only special feature of the streets in Sanyuan County is the canal, which is made of brick and is three meters wide. It is in the center of the street, used to draw water from several water ponds. Now the water has dried up, and children are playing in it. This canal was exquisitely built, with small bridges every ten steps or so. It was built with the assistance of the garrison in the 32nd year. People in the Northwest are grateful to those who give them water.

The County Council is in session because the county budget deficit has not been resolved and is in recess for three days. The county budget is almost always in deficit, and there is no source for the deficit. This kind of major problem is often unresolvable in formal meetings. The conclusion is mostly "local fundraising," either apportionment or dispatch. Now apportionment is prohibited, and if the Council comes out to resist, the problem cannot be resolved.

After the victory, the cotton farmers of Sanyuan suffered a bit. The government suddenly abandoned the control policy. The control policy was much criticized during the War of Resistance, but the sudden abandonment and the announcement that it would be purchased at "market prices" caught the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau unprepared, and the officials rushed around, each going their own way. The financial market suddenly changed, and most of the shops closed. The predictable victory depression was falling right when the cotton was coming to market. Cotton prices plummeted from 150,000 or 160,000 yuan to 15,000 or 16,000 yuan, a terrible drop of ten times! The cotton farmers sighed, carrying their loads into the city, but no one paid attention. The Sanyuan agricultural loan of 150 million yuan from the 34th year had to be repaid by the end of November. At that time, a loan of 15,000 yuan was equal to ten jin of cotton, but now it would require a dan. This situation was the same throughout Guanzhong, leading the cotton farmers to complain to heaven and earth, and beat the cotton seeds to extract oil. Sanyuan is the center of the cotton market, and the people of Sanyuan are still frightened. Today, large and small cotton purchasing firms in Sanyuan are lined up, but the cotton price is still low, at 150,000 or 160,000 yuan, and is scolded as a "trust." This number has completely changed its quality compared to before the victory. How high is the price of yarn? In contrast, how low is the price of cotton? How large is the scissor difference between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products? This is the direct pain of Chinese farmers today.

After the victory, enemy planes disappeared, conscription stopped, the treatment of troops was improved, and the troops stationed in Shaanxi in various war zones advanced to take over, and military transportation suddenly decreased. The last time the Provisional Council shouted loudly, "Quickly cut off unnecessary institutions to reduce the burden on the people. Anti-aircraft surveillance teams, anti-aircraft surveillance posts, national military corps, each township team leader and each bao team leader's officers and soldiers, as well as the military conscription committee, the fodder station and its stationed Fuping Yao management and transportation personnel, should all be abolished. Otherwise, the summer harvest will be a disaster. Victory depression, budget deficit, how can we get by?" These things were indeed done. But how long ago was that? Only a year ago, as soon as I entered Sanyuan, I ran into troop personnel who had come to collect new recruits, sweating profusely, asking me for directions. I said, "I don't know either! Sir."

I arrived in Sanyuan at dusk, and left Sanyuan at dusk. I have a good impression of this quiet ancient city in Guanzhong, except for a few unpleasant things.

### Sanyuan People's Sense of Supervision: A Victory Checklist - A Cold Hard Number - Tells How Much Sweetness, Sourness, and Bitterness!

The old League members of Shaanxi Province are all hardliners and full of humor. The people of Sanyuan also seem to be like this, with serious faces, as if they all have a sense of supervision.

At the end of the War of Resistance, the people of Sanyuan produced a victory checklist, saying: Look at how much we contributed to the War of Resistance. It also said: How did the War of Resistance win? It also said: Look at how big a price the people of Sanyuan paid for victory? It also said: Look at how much pain we have? The checklist read:

The burden of our farmers: Since conscription began, the actual number of draftees totaled 13,162 (statistics from the National Military Corps); since the in-kind collection of land tax began, the actual amount of wheat collected totaled 267,981 shi, 5 dou, 2 sheng, and 7 he (statistics from the Land and Grain Department); 4,056 dan and 53 jin of cotton were levied (statistics from the Flower and Yarn Bureau); and since the procurement of military grain began in the 29th year of the Republic, a total of 102,684 packages of wheat and 3,681 packages of corn were transported (statistics from the county government). In the 32nd and 33rd years, a total of 73,065 dan and 69 jin of cotton were sold (statistics from the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau's purchase statistics, the 31st year was not found). From January to August of the 34th year, various long and short-distance transportation and compensation for the purchase of military grain totaled 25,494,559 yuan. In addition to the small amount of money received for the supply of grass and fodder to the various armies, the total compensation was 50,764,639 yuan (the above are statistics from the Military Emblem Branch over the years, not including those under 1,000 yuan). From January to August of the 34th year, the average extra levy from each township totaled 58,489,624 yuan (statistics from various township offices over the years are not included). The above, excluding the draftees who cannot be calculated in money, the compensation for the purchase of military grain is not listed, and the difference in the control of cotton is not counted. The in-kind collection of wheat is temporarily calculated at an average of 1,000 yuan per shi, which is 267,752,522 yuan. The cotton levy is calculated at an average of 120,000 yuan per dan, which is 4,053,000 yuan. The total of the previous items is 800,838,349 yuan. For a small county with less than 100,000 people (99,088 people, county government statistics), based on a partially incomplete survey (the number of people includes merchants, the number of burdens does not include merchants), the contribution of money and effort to the country is so great, which can be said to be fulfilling the responsibility of the people.

The burden of our business and industry circles: According to the investigation, the business and industry people of this county, in addition to their formal tax obligations to the country for the past eight years, all the additional levies for the purchase of military wheat, national defense projects, public debt savings, donation of money and machines, compensation for carts and mules,慰勞伤兵, compulsory police, various civilian workers, and youth joining the army, and the additional apportionment of the local budget deficit have been increasing in stages. The additional funds for the business and industry circles were 5,600 yuan in the 26th year, 60,000 yuan in the 27th year, 156,000 yuan in the 28th year, 290,000 yuan in the 29th year, 1,955,000 yuan in the 30th year, 2,830,000 yuan in the 31st year, 8,080,000 yuan in the 32nd year, 6,986,000 yuan in the 33rd year, and 10,080,540 yuan as of the end of August in the 34th year, totaling 30,443,140 yuan. The formal taxes, excluding the unified tax and customs tax, which have not been investigated, and before the 31st year, the figures for income tax, profit tax, and before the 33rd year, the figures for business tax and stamp tax are unclear. It is estimated that the profit taxes in the 32nd year were 9 million yuan, the business tax in the 33rd year was 5 million yuan, the stamp tax was 5 million yuan, the profit taxes were 17,733,300 yuan, the business tax in the 34th year was 10 million yuan, and the stamp tax was 10 million yuan, totaling 56,733,300 yuan (statistics from the Chamber of Commerce). With more than 530 retail businesses, without any company with more than one million yuan in capital (statistics and registration from the Chamber of Commerce members), such a burden cannot be said to be small. Before the war, there were no factories in this county. Two or three years before the victory, due to supply and demand relations, there was a gradual business of weaving domestic cloth, but it was soon controlled by the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau and changed to weaving military cloth, only paying wages, receiving yarn and exchanging cloth, and not being able to operate privately. It is estimated that there were 435 wooden machines initially registered. Among them, 151 were closed due to losses, and only 284 remain. Over the years, they have handed over military cloth, amounting to more than 271,000 yuan at the military supplies bureau (statistics from the Sanyuan Textile Industry Promotion Branch); and 138,756 pi (statistics from the Flower and Yarn Control Bureau). This contribution to the war effort is also not insignificant.

I think it is easy to do this work. If the people in the rear of the War of Resistance, like the people of Sanyuan, come up with a checklist, it can be calculated how much the people in the rear of the War of Resistance directly contributed to the War of Resistance. What about the National Assembly representatives from various provinces and cities? Do you have this kind of number in your leather包裹?

### Additional Surtax on the Boxer Indemnity: A Painful Account of Land Tax History from the People of Shaanxi

The people of Shaanxi still remember the years when Empress Dowager Cixi fled and the Boxer Indemnity was imposed. The people of Sanyuan County are protesting, saying that they are still burdened with the Boxer Indemnity. The people of the entire Shaanxi Province are also protesting, saying that they are still burdened with the Boxer Indemnity. This is surprising and is tantamount to recounting the chaotic history of land tax in Shaanxi. The complete book on land tax only offered a preface. During my journey in the northern part of Guanzhong, I witnessed the particularly heavy burden of land tax in Shaanxi compared to other provinces. Calculated per yuan, one had to pay 1.4 dou of wheat as land tax (50% each for central and local governments); 1.4 dou of wheat as military rations (delivered to the central government); and 0.42 dou of wheat as public grain (50% each for the province and local governments). In total, 3.22 dou of wheat were levied per yuan. During the War of Resistance, 5 dou were levied per yuan. This year, Sanyuan County is short 16,390 shi of public grain in its budget, which is a difficult problem currently being discussed by the Council. In the past, what Shaanxi called "Diding Yin" was where "Di" meant land tax and "Ding" meant changing conscription to recruitment, with additional taxes levied through land tax. Therefore, it was collectively called "Diding". A notice of apportionment in Anyang, Henan, reads: "Mr. So-and-so, so much in Diding Yang," which is calculated based on how much land he owns. Traces of the Qing Dynasty can still be seen today. This Diding Yin has become a regular silver. A Shaanxi proverb says: "One regular, one wasteland," meaning that in addition to one tael of regular silver, the additional wasteland silver ("huangyin") would also amount to more than one tael. This wasteland silver varied from county to county in Shaanxi Province, some at seven qian and some at nine qian, of which three qian was for the Boxer Indemnity. In addition, there were the old customary fees, the basis for the Chinese saying "promotion and wealth." The items included loss compensation (melting loss of broken silver), "da ping yu" (large balance surplus), "xiao ping yu" (small balance surplus), courtyard room clerks, meal expenses, delivery fees, new balance, paper fees, vermilion fees, local retention for errands, etc. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Shaanxi military government reorganized the land tax, bringing both regular and wasteland silver to the provincial level. Local governments had no funds, and the burden was not reduced, because local governments raised funds separately, and the amount was even heavier. From this beginning, the people of Shaanxi said, "We are still burdened with the Boxer Indemnity," and one tael of silver became 1.7 to 1.9 taels, heavier than in other provinces.

In the 21st year of the Republic, the yuan was changed twice. One tael of flat silver (pingyin) was equivalent to 1.5 yuan in new national currency. Under the principle of "equal burden, no reduction in total amount," the 92 counties of Shaanxi Province uniformly converted at 1.8 qian per tael, becoming 2.7 yuan, which was still completely transferred to the provincial treasury. Because local governments needed funds, they invented "land tax surcharges," which increased every year. In the 29th year, the government finally issued an order: surcharges shall not exceed 100%. Thus, 100% was levied uniformly, and 2.7 yuan became 5.4 yuan, that is, in addition to the 1.5 yuan of one tael of regular silver, an additional 3.9 yuan was added.

Starting in the 26th year, the Ministry of Finance designated that regular taxes and surcharges (referring to wasteland silver) would be allocated to the national treasury and implemented a national treasury system. Local governments would receive monthly payments from the national treasury. The people of Shaanxi have been scolding Finance Minister Zhou Jiechun for being absurd. He actually reported all 5.4 yuan to the ministry, including the 2.7 yuan of local surcharges, and stipulated a method of allocating 55% of this 2.7 yuan for local expenses, which was unprecedented among all provinces.

However, this 55% could not be issued on time once it entered the treasury. Local governments needed money urgently and could not delay it. Therefore, they had to add surcharges again, but not call them surcharges. From then on, they invented apportionment. If one wants to study the history of apportionment in Shaanxi or has a penchant for research, this is the original material.

After the 30th year, land tax and surcharges were levied in kind. Shaanxi still calculated at 5.4 yuan, levying 5 dou of wheat per yuan. Local expenditures were 15% of the surcharge in kind, as very expensive for local undertakings, that is, 0.405 yuan was drawn from 2.7 yuan. The method in Shaanxi was special. Instead of providing in kind, it was converted into money and issued. As a result, in the 32nd year, wheat was 1,000 yuan per shi, but the converted value was only 120 yuan. In the 30th year, it was 2,400 yuan per shi, and 200 yuan was issued. In the 34th year, it rose to 17,000 yuan per shi, but the converted value was 600 yuan. The so-called appropriation of 0.405 yuan was actually less than 0.04 yuan. However, every year the local budget was insufficient, often tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars, and the expenses for garrison troops were huge. Therefore, the apportionments developed into a new stage, repeating and repeating, failing utterly!

This year, in order to reduce the burden on the people, the government reduced the surcharge by 50%, that is, subtracting 1.35 yuan from 2.7 yuan, but the total amount is still 4.05 yuan. If based on the principle that the additional surcharge does not exceed 100%, then the regular tax and surcharge should be no more than 3 yuan. This year, reducing it by 50% would often be 2.5 yuan. In any case, it should be reduced by 1.05 yuan or 2.45 yuan. The people of Shaanxi are still going to protest. They have been protesting for 35 years.

However, the people of Shaanxi silently said: "This reduction of 1.35 yuan can be regarded as canceling the Boxer Indemnity, right? Moreover, the indemnity was only 0.9 yuan, which is already much stronger."

I left Sanyuan in the twilight, drove 70 li to Yaoxian County, and knocked on the gate late at night, entering the gateway to northern Shaanxi. I heard that it was snowing in Xi'an. Yaoxian County is hundreds of meters higher than Xi'an. No wonder the cold is so biting.

### From Dongtai to Nantong

— Nantong Dispatch on the 10th, by Ling Songshou, Our Reporter in Taixian

After the recovery of Dongtai, I made another trip to Nantong. Originally, there was no such plan. The night before departure, Section Chief Li of the adjutant's office jokingly said to me, "Go to Nantong, shall we?" I thought to myself, since I was idle in Dongtai, I might as well go to Nantong. Before this matter, it seemed that going or not going to Dongtai was irrelevant; but once this decision was made, I began to think about many things to do.

The next morning, I set off at nine o'clock, in a light-duty transport truck. This truck was for sending the Air Force liaison mobile team back to Nantong, so in addition to a truckload of people, there were many parts. As a result, the truck appeared particularly crowded. Upon arriving in the urban area of Nantong, what caught my eye was the clean streets, tall buildings, and prosperous market... Everything was full of vitality; especially after seeing enough of the desolation after the calamity in the recovered area, coming here was refreshing, and I felt infinite joy in my heart. The primary school students were dismissed from school and, led by the teachers, lined up to walk out of the school gate, lively and innocent. Seeing this group of little angels, I thought to myself: "China still has hope!"

Six full hours of bumping and sandstorms were really unbearable. However, because there were too many events, and the truck had to be driven back to Dongtai the next morning, I could not care about the fatigue of my body. After finding a hotel, I went to the street to take a look.

Nantong is in northern Jiangsu, like Yangzhou and Taixian; although it has gone through eight years of vicissitudes, it has not been destroyed by war. Buses, Jeeps, and private cars were flying on the road. Three-story and five-story buildings were standing tall. Red and green neon lights were shining... All kinds of facts proved that although Nantong was after a great calamity, it was still rich and prosperous. The nickname "Little Shanghai" is worthy of it.

However, on the other hand, Nantong still has not escaped the state of military times. There is a curfew at 11 o'clock in the evening; and, if you pay attention, you can sometimes find a bunker next to the wide road.

After running around and buying something, it was already evening. The original plan to visit Commander Li Mo'an had to be moved to the next day. After eating a random dinner in the restaurant, I went to the hotel and fell asleep.

Because I heard that the truck was leaving very early, I got up early the next morning. I ran to the Nantong branch of our newspaper, but the person in charge had not yet come home. After waiting for a while, I discussed some distribution plans with them, and then went to the Pacification District Headquarters. It was too early, and the commander had not yet gone to the office. I took a break and ate some snacks at the snack shop. Then I went to the headquarters, where I was received by the commander in the office.

### Commander: A Scholar in Military Uniform, Looking Forward to the Complete Clarification of the Situation in Northern Jiangsu

I knew from the newspaper that the commander was a scholar in military uniform. After meeting him, it further proved the truth of this statement. Not too tall, with a smiling face and a relaxed tone, set off the grace and serenity of this person who manages the military and political affairs of northern Jiangsu.

The commander knew that I was from Dongtai. He earnestly inquired about the situation in the recovered area. He deeply cared about the suffering of the people in the recovered area and repeatedly instructed me to report more on the suffering of the people and the atrocities of the Communist army, so that the general public could recognize how the people of northern Jiangsu were in a state of dire straits.

Then, I asked the commander about the future of the situation in northern Jiangsu. The commander's opinion was this. He believed that, militarily, the complete clarification of the situation in northern Jiangsu was something that could no longer be delayed. The important policy for future governance lies in how to stabilize the people's livelihood after the great calamity and actively correct the psychological errors of the people. Everything in the future depends on the work efficiency of the local administrative authorities.

It was already more than eight o'clock, and Section Chief Li of the adjutant's office rushed to the headquarters to urge me to get on the truck. Time did not allow me to delay any longer. I asked the commander to allow me to take a photo. The commander agreed and went downstairs with me to find a good background.

### General Li Mo'an in the Garden of the Pacification District Headquarters

(Photo by Ling Songshou, Our Reporter)

The commander's house was probably a Catholic church. It was surrounded by water on three sides, and the environment was quite good. There was a garden behind the house, and we chose this place as the background to take a photo.

I was about to leave, and the commander wrote a few words for me:

"Life is to serve the people."

Saying goodbye to the commander, I asked him if he was planning to inspect Dongtai.

"Of course! As soon as the airport is repaired, perhaps in two or three days I will go," the commander replied.

I smiled and said, "I am waiting for the commander's visit in Dongtai."

The commander smiled and nodded.

I left the Pacification Headquarters. I also left Nantong.

### Introducing the Person and Paintings of Fu Baoshi

— Tang Qingge

If an artist's personality is noble, his painting style must also be noble! Because they have an interrelated relationship, which can be cause and effect. Therefore, if an artist wants his work to reach the peak of perfection, he must first cultivate his knowledge and morality. Otherwise, no matter how skilled your technique is, what you paint is just a mediocre scenic picture composed of colors and lines on paper, not a weighty and living work of art.

Mr. Fu Baoshi can be regarded as a modern Chinese artist with a noble personality and a noble painting style. I saw his paintings first and then met him; I loved his paintings first and then respected him. It was precisely because I saw his paintings and loved them; I smelled a similar breath in the style of his paintings, that I was willing to meet him and respect him! Only in this way did we become good friends. However, readers should not misunderstand, I am not praising him because Baoshi is a "good friend," I am introducing him out of respect for the soul of art.

Baoshi studied painting in Japan for many years and is currently a professor in the Art Department of Central University. He has a noble artistic soul. He regards painting as his second life. He cherishes his second life. Therefore, he is meticulous in every stroke when he paints. If he has to hold an art exhibition to make a living or to exchange for painting materials, then his most proud works will not be priced, that is, he will never be willing to use the crystallization of his hard work as a commodity. He feels that if he does that, it would be the stench of money insulting his soul and also insulting art—on the other hand, if he gives a painting to a friend—a friend who understands his paintings—then he will definitely give his most proud work to the friend. He sells very few paintings, but he bears the heavy burden of a family of five or six. His life can be said to be quite difficult, but his spiritual cultivation has enabled him to uphold a noble artistic soul! He spends his artistic and supreme simple life in the poor and remote village of Jin Gangpo in Chongqing during the Great Rear Area. Apart from tobacco and alcohol, he has no hobbies. Tobacco and alcohol are his inspiration and his tonic. He cannot paint without tobacco and alcohol. Therefore, he takes a puff of smoke and drinks a glass of wine for every stroke he paints. When he is slightly drunk, the work is completed. He is such a unrestrained and upright painter. He is so indifferent to fame and wealth, but so serious about art!

Baoshi is not only a painter, but also an art theorist. He has created a lot in art theory. His solid and profound theoretical foundation has also helped him to succeed in his paintings. The style of his paintings is ancient and has the style of the Tang and Song Dynasties. The artistic conception is transcendent, the interest is elegant, the aura is magnificent, the brushwork is firm but not rigid, the coloring is simple and moist but not dry; the material is pure and elegant, and the composition is unique. For example, the "Eastern Mountain Leisure" published here shows his wisdom. Why does his painting have these advantages? We can see from his paintings his cultivation of knowledge and morality. He has read a lot of dead books and living books, so he can nurture the true meaning of life in his paintings, and in his brush and ink, there is an implicit revelation of infinite philosophy. This revelation makes you feel that life should be enjoyed in a kind of sublimated realm! Naturally, there are not many people who can appreciate and accept his artistic attainment, but he will never change his style because of this, tend to flatter, and pander to low-level requirements.

However, I also feel that Baoshi's artistic life seems to be a little fragile, that is, his artistic view seems to be a little negative. If this is his shortcoming (some friends who love him have criticized him to me in this way), it is very easy to make up for it, just pay attention to the selection of materials. For example, in order to cooperate with today's ideological trends, he can use his excellent skills in landscape and figures to draw more historical achievements, such as Qu Yuan's loyalty and Tao Yuanming's noble integrity, which are enough to express the national spirit and can increase the weight of his paintings. I have this kind of superficial view, I wonder if Baoshi thinks so?

Some people advocate that Chinese painting must be improved, or even a combination of Chinese and Western painting. I am very opposed to combining things that are incompatible. I think Chinese painting has its traditional value, and we should have the belief to preserve the essence of national art—Western painting is Western painting, and it has its own independent artistic value, so there is no need to combine it with Chinese painting. In fact, writing Western painting with the technique of Chinese painting, or writing Chinese painting with the technique of Western painting, cannot be reconciled. Therefore, I advocate that each should stick to its position, each should work hard on its specialty, and each should have its own merits! Baoshi is a painter who is loyal to Chinese painting. He has a unique creative spirit. Although he has an ancient style, he does not fall into the common imitation style! This may be because he reads a lot of books and studies deeply. I hope he will always maintain this rigorous artistic attitude.

Baoshi will hold an art exhibition in Shanghai soon. Before the people of Shanghai see his works, I will briefly introduce them above. It is inevitable that I will make a fool of myself by talking about painting outside the door. I am very afraid!

### The History of Xunqin Painting

— Pang

My younger brother was four years old, and he made figures at his desk, with lifelike expressions. Confucius set up a teaching at Apricot Altar, with dozens of disciples, some pondering, some looking, some opening, some whispering, none the same, truly a genius. Mr. Pu, a friend of his father, was good at calligraphy, painting, silk, bamboo, and often held his brother on his lap, teaching him flowers and plants, mountains and rivers. At the age of nine, he could already make large paintings. His father taught him very strictly. Except for family members, he never showed them to others. At the age of fourteen, he came to Shanghai to join the Zhenqie school. There was no painting in the school. After school, he learned charcoal and oil painting from a Russian old man. After five years, he stayed in France and devoted himself to further study. He also traveled to Germany and Belgium, and returned to China after nine years.

He was naturally indifferent, not greedy for honor and profit. He did nothing else except hold a pen to conceive ideas every day. In the lane, he made large-scale oil paintings, advertising designs, architectural designs, women's clothing, with deep meaning and meticulous brushwork. He closed his studio in the west building, with mountains in view. The furnishings were quiet and ancient. When you entered his room, you almost forgot that you were a person of this century. The scenery was taken from Wulin Jigu, and he went to the ancient capital in person. The old residence was just right, and the masterpiece was completed. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he returned to Shanghai. After the August 13th battle, he knew that the war of resistance would be long. He fled the flames of war in a hurry and turned into the inland. The lane was occupied, the old residence was occupied, and everything was lost. What he regretted most was that he had collected no less than 10,000 volumes of books, handwritten by his ancestors, and the twenty years of effort of Xunqin were all gone, leaving not a single paper. He wandered in Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan and other provinces, deep in the area of the Miao Yi people. He browsed the ancient and modern times in the Central Research Institute and the Central Museum, collected ideas and broadened his horizons, and was able to integrate Chinese and Western art and culture into one furnace. After the victory, he returned east. There was no residence in Shanghai, and he was about to leave. Mr. Fu Nuan and his brother were friends, and he advocated the exhibition of paintings and personally organized them. His high righteousness is admirable.

### The Finishing Touch

— Wu Jiren

Mr. Zhang Yuguang, an old painter, has been famous in the art world for forty years. He has a deep friendship with revolutionary pioneers such as Niu Yongjian and Jing Hengyi. Mr. Zhang Bao can also be called a revolutionary in the art world. His brushwork melts Chinese and Western styles into one furnace, so he named his forehead "Zhi Ou Lu". Last month, he held an exhibition of paintings of returning from the rear in the Ningbo Township Association in Shanghai, exhibiting the paintings he collected during his travels in the southwest. The paintings of clouds, hills, mountains, birds and animals were sold out. The flying price of art is obvious to all. I used to work with him in the Mingxing Film Company for more than ten years. Yesterday, I met him in Caohejing "Guan Nong". After ten years of separation, Mr. Zhang's hair was all white, but his spirit was radiant and he looked healthier. So I had dinner in the garden. The owners of the garden, Guan Shengguang and Shengsheng, recuperated their spirits and lived here for a long time, and asked Zhang Shengguang to correct the layout, and the "Guan Nong" was reorganized in the sound of recovery, and it has been opened, serving as an embellishment to the western suburbs of Shanghai, which is very popular among small and middle schools in the city. Mr. Xian often engages in garden construction during his spare time, and even transplants every grass and tree himself, and his humble style is admirable. All the points pointed out by Mr. Zhang Guang were changed accordingly. I feel that the "Guan Nong" has been corrected by Zhang Guang, and has the elegance and tranquility of literati and poets, which is enough for ordinary scholars and poets to travel through. So the finishing touch of Zhang Yuguang is not meaningless.

### Visiting Wanfo Lou

— Zheng Yimei

In the history of Chinese painting, the development of figure painting was still in the Liu and Han Dynasties, such as Cai Yong's "Small Biographies of Women" and Mao Yanshou's "Paintings of Ladies", which showed signs of progress. Until the Ming Dynasty, Buddhism was introduced to China, and Buddhist culture and Chinese culture exchanged, opening up a new situation in art. The painter's brush also manifested the golden body and real image. The so-called "Samma Sambodhi, every Buddha is a Tathagata" is expressed in painting. This harvest is indeed very rich.

In terms of recent masters of painting Buddhas, there are Wang Yiting, the hermit of Bailong Mountain, and Qian Huafu, the master of Wanfo Lou. Yiting has passed away a few years ago, and the only surviving one is Qian Huafu. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he did not sniff at fashion, but worked hard at his own position, even cutting off his food. He would rather tighten his belt and endure it without bowing his head or kneeling. Therefore, some people call him Qian Luohan, which he truly deserves. He lives in a narrow and cramped alley behind the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road. There is almost no room to turn around when guests come. Moreover, there is a situation where people in the slums cannot bear his worries, but he does not care at all. Recently, he moved to a new residence at No. 1 Feng Deli, Jinxian Road. I went to visit his new residence and took the opportunity to talk to him.

The new residence is much wider, and it is upstairs, high and refreshing, which is suitable for work. On the day of the visit, he was painting a picture of a wall-facing Bodhidharma, with green and blue colors, and it was eighty-nine percent complete. When he saw me, he stopped painting and greeted me. Looking up, the walls were full of beautiful things, with inscriptions by Sun Yat-sen, Wu Zhihui, and Yu Youren, and Liang Zizhen's writing, "Blessings are boundless, longevity and health", this kind of auspicious sign can indeed make people excited, especially in the midst of troubles and sorrows, it is enough to eliminate everything.

His great work "Yu the Great Taming the Flood" is prepared as an international gift to U.S. President Truman, and it has now been successfully completed. This picture uses four-foot Xuan paper in 26 sheets, forming a large roll, which is more than ten feet long. Among the figures, there are dignified ones, strange ones, enchanting women, majestic armored soldiers, and bull-headed demons, rushing and soaking each other. He instructed me to write a preface-style short essay on it, preparing to ask Wu Zhihui to write it. I wrote a few sentences in a scribbled manner: "Yu's taming of the flood is a great achievement for thousands of years, and Mencius recorded it. The so-called digging the ground and pouring it into the sea, driving the snakes and releasing them, that's it. Layman Huafu can respond to things, shape images, and follow the class to give colors, creating this great structure, vitality, power, charm and interest, all embedded in the width of the Zhang. Combining Zhang Sengyao and Gu Hutou in one hand, the exquisite attainment is unparalleled in the world. Now, the floods are rampant, and the people cannot live in peace, which is no less than what happened hundreds of years ago. However, those who have the power to turn the tide and lay the foundation are more worthy of praise than the God Yu. Huafu Layman made this, and that's what he meant!" Fortunately, he asked Master Wu to write it, and I would like to ask Master Wu to cut my clumsy essay, and I don't have to modify it myself. According to him, the motive for this painting was still during the War of Resistance. According to the Chongqing news, Zhang Daqian painted a picture of a hundred doves and gave it to the United States. Until the news of victory came, in the excitement, he adjusted the Danqing ink and drew this "Yu the Great Taming the Flood", stipulating that he would work for several hours every day, and it was only recently that he was able to complete the entire work. After spending more than a year of time and achieving such considerable results, he couldn't help but be complacent when he occasionally exhibited it!

He has an ancient zither hanging on the wall. Most interestingly, his name is Qian Huafu, and there are several copper coins embedded in the mirror frame, marked with the words "Buddha Transforms Money". It is said that the Xiangguo Temple in Kaifeng, Henan, was built in the Tang Dynasty, with 500 copper arhats inside, each two feet six inches tall. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, during the Zhili-Feng War, General Ji Jian led the army in Henan and recast the copper arhats into copper coins, divided into five types: two hundred, one hundred, fifty, twenty, and ten. The copper coins in the mirror frame are the recast products of the copper arhats. His friend specially gave them to him. Thus, Qian Huafu and Buddha Transforms Money have become interesting patterns.

Before the restoration of the Republic of China, he participated in underground work, so he can also be called the first daredevil. During the enemy-puppet period, he risked his life to tear off the announcements of the Japanese military and political authorities and the puppet organization, one by one. After eight years, he became a complete set, which he plans to exhibit publicly in the future. If this kind of action were discovered by the enemy and puppets at that time, he might be executed. He often took advantage of the late night, especially when the weather was stormy and rainy, and there were few people, so he held a broken umbrella and acted according to the opportunity. Fortunately, he did not encounter a raid. He still has lingering fears when he recalls it.

He and I co-authored two notes, "Nianhua Smiling" and "Blooming Flowers", each with dozens of articles. He cut and pasted them into a book, actually two thick volumes. He said, "This snow-mud-goose-print-style thing can be printed into a single book, and many copperplate photos are added to it. Isn't it very interesting?"

Drinking is his only pastime. He doesn't care about appetizers when he drinks. Any peanuts, dried tofu, green vegetables, and radishes can be eaten. He said that drinking should be based on the wine, and choosing appetizers would lose the meaning of drinking. Today, I am happy, and drinking a glass of wine will add to the fun; today, I am depressed, and drinking a glass of wine will use it to anesthetize. Therefore, for many years, I have unknowingly formed an inextricable bond with alcohol. At this time, he took out a bottle of white rose wine from the table and wanted to drink with me. I declined and said goodbye to him.

### Poetic Words

— Tian Su

Poetry should be the most beautiful thing. Whether a poem is passionate and vigorous or sorrowful and beautiful, if it lacks the element of beauty, it is like a dying patient.

It is not an overstatement to say that poetry is the highest expression of literary art because it can be as sharp as a famous sword, like the prose of Sui Wen; it can also be like a painting, with the clarity of prose; and sometimes, it can even tell us a novel-like story.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 122

— Ye Jingfeng

"These two people who came are more considerate of you than we are." Chrysanthemum's voice trembled a little, not out of jealousy, but an impulse of affection.

"Two people?" Tsurumi was a little surprised.

"Yes." Chrysanthemum answered, "One came at six o'clock in the afternoon. She is a 'sweet lady,' only the beauties in paintings are so sweet. Hearing that you were resting, she immediately lowered her voice, fearing to disturb you. She wrote this little note and repeatedly instructed me to hand it over to you at the most appropriate time." Chrysanthemum said, handing the note to Tsurumi. (The words "sweet lady" were a secret code used by Chrysanthemum and Tsurumi in their childhood, representing a beauty.)

"Elder Brother—thinking that you must have many things to ask me, I followed your footsteps and came here to visit. If you are unhappy or unwilling to see this annoying person, I will naturally quietly leave. Later, whenever you want, just make a phone call to the 'Club,' and I will rush over like a bird, at your disposal. I swear on my life, I will never do anything deceitful to you. Wishing Elder Brother good health… Furthermore, my telephone numbers are in the 'Club' list, a total of four, I won’t list them here… Furthermore, I am staying at the Binhai Society tonight, my younger sister knows its telephone number and location… Furthermore, younger sister is a lovely person, I would like to befriend her, as long as she doesn’t dislike me—From Liu Shi’s hand."

After reading it, Tsurumi suddenly raised his head and asked Chrysanthemum, "Chrysanthemum, do you like this 'sweet lady'?"

"I do!" Chrysanthemum smiled very innocently, "I would like to have an autographed photo of her…"

"Ha…she is a thorny rose!...You have to be careful…You just said two people, what about the other person, is it a young man, my car driver?"

"That's right." Chrysanthemum answered, glancing at her mother. The mother and daughter smiled at each other, indicating that Tsurumi guessed correctly. "He came a little after seven o'clock, he said he would come again a little after ten o'clock."

Half an hour later, the crescent moon gradually rose from the horizon, the boundless ocean rippling with patches of rosy light, like the bejeweled pond in a fantasy with golden lotus flowers blooming. The pine trees on the hillside seemed to be covered with a layer of deep blue tulle, and the beach also reflected a patch of glittering silver light. In such a scene, Tsurumi and Pingzi walked side by side along the edge of the beach.

Tsurumi—"What method does that one-eyed Fifth Column guy use to collect our actions and conversations?"

Ping—"It's my fault for being too careless. I also know that trick. No matter how far away, as long as you can see the person's lips moving, you can know what they are saying."

Tsurumi—"That's lip reading. How long does it take to learn the method of using eyes instead of ears?"

Ping—"Two or three months, I have this manuscript, I am afraid it will only take you two or three hours to learn."

Tsurumi—"Can I borrow it to take a look?"

Ping—"I can offer it to you at any time."

Tsurumi—"How many Fifth Column members are there in Tokyo?"

Ping—"There are only three or four thousand now, possibly more and more. They have all kinds of specialized skills and have infiltrated our various top secret agencies."

### Casual Talk About Female Writers

— Tan Yi

Bai Wei, Impoverished and Ill

Recently, someone asked me if it was true that Bai Wei was so poor in Chongqing that she had lice on her body and lived under other people's eaves?

It is a recognized fact that literati are poor, especially in the wartime rear, especially a literatus who is open, upright, and steadfast in his position. However, although poor, it should not be so poor as to be covered in lice, sleeping on the stone steps like a beggar begging from door to door. However, Bai Wei's poverty has led to such rumors, and it has spread to Shanghai, which is really surprising. However, Bai Wei was indeed poorer than the average literatus in Chongqing, not only poor, but also often sick. She did not have a fixed residence in Chongqing, often living in the countryside near the Laijia Bridge Political Department. Occasionally, when she came to Chongqing, she could only carry a small cloth bag and "fight guerrilla warfare" at friends' places. Her friends were not rich either, living a "under the eaves of Chongqing" life. When Bai Wei visited, she could only be an "eaves guest." Perhaps this is the origin of the rumors? As for the lice on her body, although I have never seen it with my own eyes, I think it should not be so. Although she was too poor to buy new clothes, the Western suits she wore from her time studying in Tokyo ten years ago were still very neat. Especially in the summer, although she did not have a maid to wash and iron them for her, her clothes were always so smooth and clean. With such a neat appearance, there should not be lice inside, right?

There were many literati working or nominally working in the Third Department of the Political Department of the Military Commission. Such as Yang Hansheng, Tian Han, Feng Naichao and others. Later, it was reorganized into the Cultural Work Committee, and Guo Moruo, the former head of the Third Department, was transferred to be the chairman of the Cultural Work Committee, and the original staff were also transferred there. The Political Department is a military organization. Although the staff of the Cultural Work Committee were "literati," they were also given military ranks. For example, Chairman Guo was a lieutenant general, Tian Laoda was a major general, and the rest were colonels, lieutenant colonels, and even lieutenants, second lieutenants, and junior lieutenants. However, because Bai Wei was neither a military person nor a woman, and because the ranks of general and colonel were national titles and could not be casually given to a non-military woman, she had to be a clerk.

A clerk is certainly not an official, which was insignificant to Bai Wei, who did not aspire to be ennobled. However, there was a practical problem in this. Because only "officials" could enjoy the welfare of officers and soldiers in addition to their fixed salaries. Clerks were extra personnel and were not included in the national budget, so she could only watch others enjoy this welfare. And the worst thing was that the welfare at that time was actually much larger than the regular salary, almost all of life depended on the welfare. Bai Wei could not get the welfare, so she was more miserable than other military literati.

Although miserable, she wanted to fight against misery, she wanted to survive in misery. She would never betray others, be jealous of others, or beg for pity from others, or complain to others. She had a pair of hands. In addition to being able to write articles, she could also do what other laborers could do. So she grew her own vegetables, drew water, washed clothes, cooked, and even did the most dirty housework. In this way, she conquered misery and earned her seat. But her writing life was sacrificed because there are only twenty-four hours in a day!

Prose and novels, although limited by time, prevented her from having time to write, but poetry was relatively less restricted. She could meditate while washing vegetables, and hum while fanning the stove with a palm-leaf fan. She would write them down in her spare time from work. So her only product during the Anti-Japanese War was poetry.

She was not afraid of poverty alone. What was more frightening was the illness that followed. And it was a serious illness. She was staying in the Chongqing Municipal Hospital, not only could she not afford the hospitalization fee, but she also did not have money for medicine. Fortunately, several friends helped her to get through this difficult time. At this time, someone launched a campaign to help impoverished and sick writers, dancing, acting, charity sales, fundraising, raising several million yuan in funds. But when the Writers' Association allocated her 20,000 yuan in relief money, she resolutely refused. She did not explain the reason for refusing. But from this, we can also see her backbone, she is a tough guy who would never take money for no reason.

Perhaps life and human relationships have persecuted her, she is now more calm and indifferent. We often see her carrying a small cloth bag, walking slowly alone, never taking military cars. Her haggard face, with a pair of gold-rimmed round glasses, never has any expression. When talking to people, it is so subtle that the other person does not dare to take a deep breath. She has never shouted loudly about "peace" or "democracy" with a red face! But her tone is always so peaceful, and her energy always expresses people's rights.

The Anti-Japanese War has become profitable, many villains have changed their environment, have new jobs, and have changed their attitudes. Only she remains the same. At most, she has changed from a guest under the eaves of Chongqing to a guest under the eaves of Shanghai.

### Hot Money

— Shao Fu

Nanjing is making a fuss about establishing the capital, Nanjing, Beiping, there will still be a while of clamor.

Shanghai is clamoring for year-end bonuses, and also creating a new term—“lazy labor.” In a gust of wind, gold broke the three million mark, the US dollar reached six thousand three, and Chinese stocks all hit the daily limit. So lively!

It looks like this year we are really going to have to spend a lot, we can’t just muddle through, what should we do? It’s really nerve-wracking!

There’s no need to talk about any profound economic theories, common sense can tell us that gold and US dollars flying together, firewood, rice, oil, and salt all jumping, rising prices, is an inevitable result. And how can Shanghai’s soaring prices not affect other parts of the country?

Some people say that this whirlwind is due to the release of hot money. Please think about it, where are the reasons for the release of a large amount of hot money?

The government’s financial policy can no longer waver. If it is to tighten the currency and tighten credit, it should stick to it. If it wavers, it will create opportunities for speculators to make huge profits. Taking clothes off the dead, this society is all about profit, what can’t they do!

### Taking a Honesty Test by Observing Society and People's Hearts

— Yu Qiang

How honest are the people around you? This is a difficult question to answer, but also a question that should be answered to understand the level of social morality. A Canadian named Alexander Taylor has come up with a clever way to answer this question. He wrote his address on twenty-four envelopes and enclosed a folded piece of newspaper inside each envelope. The sealed flaps were marked with indelible pencil, so that if the flaps were opened and resealed, these marks would reveal the act.

After putting stamps on each envelope, Taylor scattered them evenly on the streets of Toronto and Hamilton. Each letter was numbered, and after scattering them, Taylor himself hid to the side to watch how the passersby handled these "lost" letters.

His first experiment was done on the streets of Hamilton. It was four-thirty in the afternoon, and the streets were crowded.

A woman stopped and picked up the first letter. She looked at it indifferently and walked into a department store. A few minutes later, a young woman picked up the second letter, looked at the address, and dropped it into the mailbox on the corner.

On another street, he saw a man pick up the third letter. He read the address, folded the envelope, and put it in his pocket. This letter never returned to Taylor's hands.

Another letter was placed in the same spot for a long time. Some people stepped over it, while others detoured around it. A strong girl came over, wanting to kick it, but didn't. She took a step forward, then stopped, looking back at the letter, but couldn't decide whether to walk back. Suddenly, she hurried on her way.

At the entrance of the train station, a man picked up a letter and said to his friend, "This letter must be mailed, I wonder who lost it!" He walked to the mailbox and dropped the letter in.

As a result, of the twelve letters Taylor scattered in Hamilton, all but two were picked up and mailed back to him.

Taylor did the same experiment in Toronto. Coincidentally, also two went missing, and ten were mailed back.

All the letters that were picked up and mailed had never been opened. In Hamilton, seventy people walked past the twelve letters before they were picked up. In Toronto, eighty passersby ignored them. Those who picked up the scattered letters in Toronto were ten men and two women, and those who picked up the twelve letters scattered in Hamilton were half men and half women. This small experiment proved that: if someone lost a letter in these two cities, the chances of the finder mailing it for them are 80 percent.

Of course, the results of this experiment cannot represent the extent of honesty in general, but at least it can give us a glimpse.

Readers, if you also want to imitate Taylor and do such an experiment, I dare to guarantee that the results you get will be much lower than the results Taylor got, it's not that I'm "inferior" here.

### Beware of the Chamber Pot Thief

— Wu Shujiang

The term chamber pot thief is what the author heard from the natives of Shanghai. The period of activity of the chamber pot thief is in the recent two or three months, and the colder the weather, the more energetic they are.

However, the chamber pot thief's tricks are limited to large families with deep courtyards.

Just as the sky is beginning to dawn, the "chamber pot pouring" maids and elder sisters are drowsy, opening the back door, and bringing out the chamber pot. In that instant, the chamber pot thief slips in and hides in a remote place, lying still during the day and moving around at night. Whenever it is late at night and everyone is quiet, they go out to scout around, eavesdropping on conversations, and looking for valuables. When the time is ripe, they leave fully loaded, truly with the cleverness that no one knows and no ghost notices.

The chamber pot thief carries dry food with them, and also has a leather bag for urination and defecation. It is said that those who are experienced in this way can hide for five or seven days without difficulty, and even the worst can hide for two or three days.

Winter is approaching, which is the time for these guys to show off their skills. I can't help but remind everyone!

Scientific Knowledge

### New Fur

— Yu

With a cold snap, ladies' fur coats are coming onto the market one after another.

Maybe you don't have a fur coat, go to the fur shop to take a look, want to buy one. Those made for tens of millions are unaffordable; you also feel "embarrassed by a poor purse" for sable and otter skins that cost several million, and you feel that cheap sheepskins and rat skins are "not up to your standards"!

Even if you are lucky enough to have a noble sable or otter skin coat, you also have many troubles at the same time, how to maintain its luster? How to avoid the invasion of rain and snow? Even how to keep it clean is a big problem.

These troubles and difficulties have been solved by a diligent Mexican scientist, Dr. J.B. Calva. He launched a "fur-making revolution," providing cheap, imitation, but practical fur goods, and also providing "fur insurance."

Calva was born in Puebla, Mexico forty-eight years ago, and graduated from the University of Mexico. In 1928, he obtained a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. The following year, he was hired by the school to do research work.

That year—the winter of 1929 was particularly cold, and Calva bought an otter skin coat to keep warm. In fact, this otter skin coat was a counterfeit, and it revealed its sheepskin origins after only a few days of wearing. Although Calva was fooled, it inspired him to launch a "fur-making revolution." After fifteen years of continuous research, Calva finally invented the "plastic method," which can transform a raw sheepskin into a noble fur that can resist snow erosion, is durable, and can be imitated in 36 hours.

Calva and his six assistants coordinate their own chemicals and design their own automatic machines. After a series of chemical washing, drying, trimming, polishing, and dyeing, two-thirds of the length of the wool fibers becomes permanent hairlike strands, and the remaining unchanged wool near the skin can increase the warmth of the fur.

After Calva succeeded, he submitted his "plastic fur" to the "Better Fabrics Testing Bureau" for testing. The bureau's report was: "These fibers can withstand the changes made to them and are durable for wearing." "The color, luster, softness, and texture of the plastic fur are not affected by rain, snow, or dry cleaning. It can be trampled on and completely soiled, and afterwards, it can be refreshed with a damp cloth."

Another feature of this "plastic fur" is that it can be dyed into various special colors. Red and wine colors are already on the market, and each coat sells for only 170 US dollars.

Calva said that with his fur-making method, he can also turn Chinese rat skins and Australian kangaroo skins, which some people "look down on," into sable-like furs. He also said that it is difficult to modify furs with unstable hair roots, so be careful when choosing raw skins, and the manufacturing process must also be careful. Applying Calva's "plastic method" can also make straight hair permanently curly. Genuine, noble furs such as sable and otter skins can be made more durable, retain their luster longer, and resist the erosion of rain and snow after being processed by this "plastic method." I hope that the people in our country who are engaged in the fur business can also rise up and pursue it, research and develop better fur manufacturing methods, so that fur becomes a common and durable winter product, and not just a noble decoration!

### Statistics

— Gan

According to statistics from the Department of Civil Affairs of the Guangdong Provincial Government, in the year from the beginning of September last year to the end of August this year, a total of 29 county magistrates and 166 township heads in the province were accused of crimes, with corruption cases being the most numerous. Although there are still victims who dare not report, which cannot be statistically counted, this officially published figure is quite considerable.

I wonder about other provinces? I hope there is also a statistical figure.

### Yang Chuo'an by the Songhua River

— Jinxia

Harbin Mayor is a famous city in Northeast China for cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union, and has long had the title of "International City". Harbin is located on the Songhua River, with beautiful and pleasant scenery.

The current mayor of Harbin, Mr. Yang Chuo'an, is a model figure of a young man who overcomes hardship and achieves his goals. Mr. Yang visited Shanghai in June this year and met with reporters to answer their questions about the Northeast issue. Mr. Yang is middle-aged, with sparse hair, a full face, wearing glasses, and thin lips. His conversation shows his decisiveness and determination everywhere.

He is most opposed to the rigid official documents used in the Chinese bureaucracy. He said: "The so-called official document format is unprecedented in the world." He also criticized the ambiguous language in official documents, such as "conditionally approved" and "still feasible," believing that this is shirking responsibility.

Mr. Yang is from Hejian, 45 years old this year, and graduated from Beijing China-Russia College. During the war, he served as a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department.

It is said that in the 15th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Yang was only a "mail sorter" in the post office. His daily job was to sort and organize thousands of letters according to their destination. At that time, he was not very familiar with Western languages, so it took a lot of time to sort out the mail sent abroad, so he worked hard to study and used his spare time to tutor himself in English. Later, when a foreign postmaster asked him questions in English, he was able to answer fluently, which won him the favor of his superiors and he was sent abroad to study postal administration. After returning to China, he joined the party and entered politics, and everything went smoothly, creating his current position.

The current Harbin has been occupied by the Chinese Communist Party, which makes people wonder where the whereabouts of this mayor by the Songhua River are?

Shanghai Cross-Section

### The Organization of Beggars 15

— Huang Jiamo

"Drawing Swords and Rising Up" Types

"Bao Xiang Da" (roughly translates to "Guaranteed Fighters") was originally a specialty of Shanghai "Baixiang Ren" (roughly translates to "White Elephant People," a term for local toughs or gangsters). During the rise of the Green and Red Gangs, the low-level members of these gangs were most fond of engaging in "righteous hero" acts of intervening in situations they perceived as unjust. They were fascinated by ancient knight-errant stories, and readily drew their swords to help, based on hearing only one side of the story. Although they disregarded the law, their intentions were not originally bad. However, the members of the Laodi Yuanxin Gang, seeing an opportunity, admired the demeanor of the Baixiang Ren for a long time and actually wanted to learn their ways. But they lacked the gang background of the Baixiang Ren. Coupled with the pressure of life, they had no choice but to take a crooked path to seek money. Thus, the "Baihu Shi" (roughly translates to "Displaying Tiger Power," a bluffing tactic) beggar gangs appeared. In their extreme boredom, they specialized in wandering the streets and alleys. Whenever trouble arose, they always aimed to profit from it. They gradually formed an organization of "Bao Xiang Da." As a result, they would fight on behalf of others as long as they were paid. Their actions were vastly different from the chivalrous Baixiang Ren. However, not just anyone could do this; they had to be "established" and have strong influence. Therefore, internally, they had to have a status of being "familiar faces" and "veterans." Externally, they had to be familiar with the authentic "Baixiang Ren" of various sections and gangs in order to be considered "well-connected" and be able to start this "Bao Xiang Da" business.

Taking Up Injustices on Behalf of Others

Shanghai originally had people from all over, making it difficult to manage, with good and bad mixed together. Especially in the lower classes, disputes and feuds arose daily, numbering dozens or hundreds. The beggar gangs had a network of informants spread throughout the streets and alleys. Once an alarm was raised, they would mobilize to participate, seeing it as a business opportunity. When disputes first arose, both sides would always try to assert their power, each going to extremes. These people would then intervene, taking up injustices on behalf of one side, strongly advocating for a tough stance, and volunteering to draw their swords to help. They would "zha tai xing" (roughly translates to "build a platform," meaning to save face) for the party involved. The party involved would naturally be deeply grateful. Thus, tensions would escalate, and the two sides would inevitably break apart. It would be necessary to "chi jiang cha" (roughly translates to "eat talking tea," a mediation session) and "jiang jin tou" (roughly translates to "discuss the details"). If the mediation resolved the dispute, the beggar gang members would get some benefit. If the negotiations broke down, a fierce fight would inevitably begin, and the "heroes" would be needed to risk their lives.

Before the prelude to the fighting, the beggar gang would gather troops for the party involved, determining the number based on the strength of the other side, ranging from dozens to hundreds. The gang had plenty of manpower anyway, and they could gather them with a single call. Before the fighting started, these people would make a verbal agreement with the party involved. They would stipulate how much "che fan pa" (roughly translates to "meal money") each person would receive, and how much compensation would be paid for each person who was "gua cai" (injured), "dao zhao" (killed), or "zhai zhan lao" (arrested) after the fighting started. All of this had to be stated in advance. The leader of the beggar gang would often take more than half of this meal money and compensation. After a fight, the police would definitely search everywhere, so the beggars who had been involved would have to temporarily "avoid the limelight." This expense also had to be demanded from the party involved.

Profiting from the Situation

However, "the world is getting more sophisticated," and the "Bao Xiang Da" of the beggar gangs became increasingly cunning. They often "xu zhang hu shi" (roughly translates to "feign tiger power") to win the favor of the party involved. They would see that the two sides were full of murderous intent and that a war was about to break out, but in the end, it often didn't break out. Only one in ten cases would actually result in a full-scale fight, because the beggar gangs were focused on money, not fighting. After all, no one wants to risk their life for someone else. Therefore, during the mediation, if the other party was a brother from the same gang, it would naturally be easy to resolve the dispute with a few words. If the other party was an authentic "Baixiang Ren" with more influence, they could also bring out a "old friend" with face to mediate and resolve the matter peacefully as a last resort. But the party involved would still be fiercely assertive and unwilling to back down, so the reward money would be overdrawn. After the money they could get was in hand, they would suddenly withdraw their troops without ever having fought. "Generals abroad are not bound by the orders of the sovereign," leaving the party involved with financial loss and resentment, regretting their initial decision. But they couldn't report it to the authorities or complain, truly making it a grievance that could not be redressed!

### University Entrance Exam Questions

I happened to hear a few friends talking about the Chinese language test questions for this year's Nanjing Higher Civil Service Examination and the Zhejiang Provincial County Magistrate Examination. I really feel sorry for the test takers who are transitioning from school to society. We will leave aside whether the topics such as "Explaining 'Good Teaching Gains the People' and 'Seeing Quality and Thinking of Qi'" and "Expand on the Meaning of 'Duke Zhou's Six Affairs, Only Integrity is Tested'" still have some elements of the "eight-legged essay" style. However, the disconnect between the current examination system and the education system is worth criticizing. Nowadays, middle school students' energy is completely consumed in the balanced development of social sciences and natural sciences, and in university, they have to cope with many complex and novel specialized academic studies. The improvement of Chinese studies is fundamentally a matter of having the will but lacking the strength. Therefore, testing by forcing them to write about the classics and historical schools is no different from making fun of young people. If the examination system is merely a tool for decorating education or merely covers new souls with a layer of old shells, this is the tragedy of our generation and a loss for the country. What does the authorities think?

### Times Have Changed

I heard that ××× has already bought a foreign house and a car in the United States and is preparing to live his remaining years in leisure, not caring about promotions or demotions. General × spent half his life in the military, starting with cotton-padded clothes and straw sandals, and earned this little bit of a foreign house and a car today. Compared to those corrupt officials who suck the people's blood and enjoy themselves, this path of retiring after success and enjoying his old age is really worthy of our praise. However, we have some feelings about this: ××× is known as a Christian General. Christianity is originally a religion that is "salvation of the world" oriented; but looking at the current situation of war and chaos, it seems that Christianity has become "salvation of oneself" first. The Jing'an Temple's dispute over temple property and the Baiyun Temple's burning of the Taoist priests, all religions have fallen into the "Small Vehicle." It's no wonder that the general converted to Christianity, and of course, laid down his butcher knife, moved his house to the west, saving himself from the sea of suffering before the people.

### "Prices Are Crawling Down, Business Is Rising Up."

I happened to pass by Linsen Middle Road and saw a department store with a large sign that said: "Prices are crawling down, business is rising up." I couldn't help but feel happy, thinking that we would soon be able to restore the old peaceful days.

I went inside and looked around for a week. American goods accounted for more than 95% of the items on display. Turning around and going out the door, I saw the huge red sign again and was shocked.
