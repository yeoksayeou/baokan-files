### Chairman Chiang Invites Marshall to a Banquet; Marshall Begins Discussions on the Northeast Problem

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 19th] Special Envoy Marshall paid respects to Chairman Chiang and held substantive discussions with the representatives of both the Nationalist and Communist parties attending the three-person meeting regarding the Northeast ceasefire issue.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] Before Marshall's return to China, the situation in North China was greatly turbulent. The situation in Suiyuan and Shanxi was critical. After frank negotiations between the Government and Communist parties in the Executive Headquarters, the tense situation began to ease.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 19th] Special Envoy Marshall went to the American Embassy at 10:00 AM on the 19th to speak with staff members. At 4:30 PM, he visited Executive Yuan President Soong Tzu-wen. In the evening, Special Envoy Marshall and his wife were invited by Chairman Chiang and his wife to dinner.

[United Press Chongqing, 19th] General Marshall is cautiously working to prevent civil war in the Northeast. Today, he consulted with officials at the American Embassy. According to various reports, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall dined with Chairman Chiang today, and afterwards, they likely discussed the Northeast situation in some detail. Today, Mr. Marshall, accompanied by Brigadier General Brink, Chief of Staff of the American Military Advisory Group, consulted with President Soong to discuss some of the reorganization plans previously drafted by Lieutenant General Wedemeyer. At the same time, observers are cautiously optimistic about Mr. Marshall's ability to resolve the Northeast problem, because many believe that the Communist Party, due to its occupation of several strategically important locations, is in an advantageous position in bargaining, and the Nationalist army's advance northward has made its flanks vulnerable to attack.

### Yesterday's Aerial Reconnaissance Report: Changchun City Ablaze

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th] Changchun fell into misfortune last night at 11:00 PM amidst raging flames and the desperate cries of innocent civilians. Approximately 20,000 Communist troops poured into the city from the west, south, and north, setting fire to any tall buildings they saw. According to a report from the pilot who flew to Changchun yesterday morning to drop food and orders to the besieged troops at Datong Square, the northwest corner of Changchun has become a sea of fire with approximately thirty fires burning. The Communist troops have begun a massacre in the city and are threatening residents to hand over security forces hidden in their homes. Furthermore, in the past two days, aircraft flying over Changchun to drop food have seen long columns on the Harbin-Changchun line rapidly advancing towards Changchun, all of which are Communist reinforcements. It is reported that these troops have recently acquired tanks, heavy artillery, and rocket launchers near Harbin, and their artillery targeting techniques closely resemble those of the Japanese.

[Central News Agency Shenyang, 19th] (1) All radio stations in Changchun lost contact after 6:00 PM on the 18th. The situation is unclear. (2) Reconnaissance flights were dispatched on the 19th, but the city was silent, and the police station in Datong Square was burning. (3) In addition to our defending troops, there are still over a hundred Central Government takeover personnel in Changchun.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] The security forces defending Datong Square in Changchun today may have ceased their unequal resistance, as reconnaissance flights to Changchun this morning found the city extremely silent with no activity, suggesting that the war has ended. However, a major battle is brewing in Gongzhuling, between Sipingjie to the south of Changchun, because this location is a range of hills running east-west, higher in elevation than Changchun. It is a place that military strategists must contend for. The Communist troops have concentrated a large force there to secure this southern gateway to Changchun. The Nationalist army is also rapidly advancing from Sipingjie towards Gongzhuling to reinforce Changchun. Who will ultimately control Changchun will be decided in the battle of Gongzhuling. Official sources indicate that the Nationalist army suffered considerable losses due to an unexpected encounter with superior enemy artillery before entering Sipingjie, but they ultimately captured Sipingjie and captured a foreign artillery battalion commander.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 18th] Recently, three to four aircraft have been flying to Changchun daily to drop food. Deputy Director of the Aviation Affairs Commission, Wang Shuming, is currently in Shenyang awaiting orders and coordinating everything.

[United Press Nanjing, 19th] The Nationalist army in Shenyang stated that the Nationalist troops defending the central district of Changchun have had their occupied area reduced to within six reinforced concrete buildings surrounding Datong Square. Although external radio communication has been completely cut off, the besieged troops continue to put up a valiant resistance against overwhelming odds. It was also revealed that the Northeast Nationalist Army Headquarters has moved to Sipingjie. It is said that the main force of the New First Army is now only forty miles north of Changchun.

[United Press Beiping, 19th] Semi-official sources say that the fighting in Changchun is intensifying, with the Nationalist troops in the city being attacked by Communist artillery and confined to a few buildings in the city center. The Soviet army is scheduled to withdraw from Harbin on the 26th, just one week from now. Because there are no Nationalist troops in Harbin, many believe that fighting will not break out there as it has in Changchun. After capturing Sipingjie this week, the New First Army is advancing north towards Changchun, reportedly advancing only twelve li northward in three days.

[United Press Yan'an, 19th] Today, the Yan'an radio station broadcast that the Japanese and Nationalist troops inside Changchun City have been completely "eliminated."

### Japanese Nationals in North and Northeast China Actively Being Repatriated

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] Hiroshi Nemoto, the chief of the Liaison Department for Post-War Affairs of Japanese Officers and Soldiers in North China, and other Japanese military leaders will be treated as war criminals and detained after their mission ends. According to orders from the Army Headquarters, the Japanese prisoners of war and expatriates under the jurisdiction of the 11th War Zone will be completely repatriated within this month.

[United Press Beiping, 19th] Lieutenant Colonel Bellina, who is in charge of repatriation work at the Executive Headquarters, announced that the repatriation of Japanese military and civilians within Shanxi will be accelerated, with 3,000 people scheduled per day. According to a public announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation, there are now sufficient train cars and locomotives on the railway between Taiyuan and Beiping to transport Japanese military and civilians eastward. In addition, the situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has also improved. The railway and telephone lines on the section from Jinan north to Yucheng, about sixty li, have been repaired, which is of great benefit to the repatriation work.

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 18th, United Press] Allied Headquarters announced that preparations for the repatriation of Japanese nationals in Northeast China are underway. Many reception centers for Japanese nationals will be established. The one established on Huludao in Liaodong Bay has already been established. It is estimated that there are 1,603,000 Japanese nationals in the Northeast.

### Jiangsu High Court Releases Political Prisoners

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 19th] The Jiangsu High Court previously received orders to release political prisoners in order to demonstrate the government's implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, granting equal and legal status to all parties and factions. Therefore, the High Court released a large number of political prisoners imprisoned for crimes against the Republic of China in open court on the afternoon of the 19th, totaling 51 people. The prisoners were excited beyond words upon their release. The list of their names is recorded as follows: Zhuang Tanjin, Ye Jinxiang, Shen Kou Nan, Wang Lei Er, Chen Desheng, Xu Junfa, Zhou Lingen, Ding Kuanqi, Li Jiashan, Xu Hanjie, Zhu Taoxian, Li Zhengrui, Hua Shanh Han, Huang Bingding, Li Tanlin, Li Yinnan, Pei Xiang, Wang Guangshan, Zhang A, Tao Jie, Gao Bin, Zhai Shengchang, Li Adi, Xie Zhiqiao, Wu Zuxing, Jin Bi, Qian Guosheng, Zhang Jinghua, Wu Ada, Wang Yinwen, Wang Ziyue, Xiao Axing, Li Shaopeng, Feng Peiwen (female), Song Santou, Chen Guifang, Huang Liankang, Feng Yungeng, Lu Atao, Wang Yongxing, Zhu Fuyuan, Zhang Biliang, Lu Aao, Zhu Laigen, Zheng Quanbao, Zhou Hongsheng, Zhang Yongbing, Chen Juncai, Wang Jinwan, Pan Bingshan, Wang Caisu. When the reporter inquired with the person in charge of the High Court, they stated that although political prisoners were on the list for release, those who had committed crimes under ordinary criminal law would still be punished according to their crimes.

### Military Mediation Department Expands Organization; Separate Agency Established to Specialize in Military Reorganization

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 19th] The Government side of the Executive Headquarters proposed yesterday to send an Executive Group to Changchun. The Communist side refused, arguing that a full ceasefire and cessation of transportation in the Northeast were necessary before considering sending a group.

[United Press Beiping, 19th] Two teams from the Northeast Executive Group were summoned to Shenyang earlier this week to provide reports to the Acting Three-Person Group, and have now returned to Kaiyuan and Fushun. The Executive Headquarters has also dispatched a third Executive Group to Chaoyang in order to implement the ceasefire agreement within the borders of Jehol. Two other Executive Groups are stationed in Chifeng and Chengde.

[Central News Agency Beiping, 19th] In order to strengthen work efficiency, the Executive Headquarters has long had plans to expand its internal organization. After several discussions, it has been agreed by all three parties that, starting on the 20th, the existing Planning, Transportation, General Affairs, and News Sections will all be expanded into Departments, with Sections established under the Departments. In addition, a Translation Department will be established, and personnel have also been assigned. It is also learned that a separate agency will soon be established to specialize in military reorganization.

### Progress in the Arduous Eastward Repair Work on the Jiaoji Railway Line

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 19th] Repair work east of Xindian on the Jiaoji Railway Line continues to make progress. It has now been repaired to 3 kilometers and 420 meters from Putong Station.

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 18th] According to people from Zichuan: After the Communist troops occupied Zichuan County, they immediately sealed up the properties of township and village chiefs and those who participated in the war of resistance. As of now, in the 213th district alone, this has affected more than 2,000 households. Tens of thousands of people have been driven out of the territory. Villagers whose properties have been sealed have their citizenship revoked, and any slight carelessness in speech is met with slaughter. As a result, strong young men flee together, and the land is barren and untended, creating a desolate scene.

[Central News Agency Jinan, 19th] Colonel Lake, the American representative of the Jinan Group, has been recalled to the United States. The Beiping Military Mediation Department has announced the appointment of Colonel Davis as his successor. Mr. Davis arrived in Jinan from Qingdao on the 19th and assumed his duties immediately.

### Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Break Faith; Mediation Group Returns to Xuzhou

### Listening to the Sound of Cannons in the Snow

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in Liaoyang, Guan Rongqin

Three weeks of wandering life have come to an end. Various scenes, figures, and the sound of cannons that once shook my soul still linger in my mind. It was on the morning of March 9th. Although I had heard that spring had arrived long ago, the vast expanse of white snow stubbornly sealed the earth. In Xinmin, only the chimneys, either square or round, hadn't completely lost their original shape. Everything else was dressed in white, and the cold air was charging and stabbing from all directions. However, it couldn't stop the people who had been huddling indoors by the stoves. People, both young and old, came out of their houses to watch the National Army, with whom they had lived for over a month, depart. Trucks, jeeps, carriages, and groups of armed soldiers were hurrying back and forth, making the already narrow streets seem even more cramped.

Outside the city, we traveled along a highway. The white snow covered it so densely that if someone hadn't walked ahead, no one would have known they were on a road. Because of the heavy equipment and the dazzling snow, trucks, carriages, and pedestrians would accidentally fall into the ditches beside the road. The truck I was riding in got stuck once, but it slowly climbed out after a few minutes. The vast white wilderness had little to break it up besides sparse, withered grasses trembling in the wind. Villages were hard to find. In the forty *li* from Xinmin to Damin Village, only two or three villages were visible.

Damin Village was a small town. There were many shops on both sides of the T-shaped street, and some businesses were quite large. We stayed at a bean oil mill. Soybeans were piled up like small hills. The shopkeeper even said they were out of beans, which shows the scale of the business. Although the territory had been recovered, the owner's conversation was still gloomy. He said that because of the war, business in the surrounding areas was difficult, and there were few goods coming in. The Communist army had been there a month ago and spent 400,000 to 500,000 on entertainment in the small town. His shop had to contribute 3,000 to 4,000. This talkative shopkeeper, who slept on the *kang* bed opposite me, would catch lice by the candlelight at night and talk to me about the experiences of the Northeastern people over the past fourteen years. They ate *gaoliang* husks, bran, and acorn flour—acorn flour that even livestock would get diarrhea from. If they occasionally bought a pound or two of rice or a piece of new cloth and the eagle-like puppet police and secret agents noticed, they would be threatened in various ways. If the other party "forgave" you, they would "confiscate" it and let you go. If they didn't "forgive" you (usually in a public setting), they would drag you to the police station and punish you as an economic criminal. Everyone had to suffer, except for these eagles and dogs themselves. They were well-fed and had full bellies, and their wives and children were also well-fed and bright. In fact, it was less about the odiousness of these eagles and dogs and more about the success of the merchants' manipulation.

On the way from Damin Village to Liaoyang, I stopped in no fewer than ten villages and towns. Sometimes I walked on snow, sometimes on muddy fields after the snow melted. It was difficult for heavy vehicles to roll on such muddy roads, and it was even more difficult for the heavily laden soldiers to walk. Pairs of felt shoes were wrapped in thick mud, which seemed heavier than their legs. Some soldiers had broken shoes and were hobbling through the mud in socks that had been patched many times. It would be better if there were no war ahead. Sometimes, when the sound of cannons and gunfire rang out ahead, it was even more difficult to walk. The result of the gunfire was scarlet blood. In Li Daren Village, ten *li* away on the south bank of the Hun River, I saw several National Army officers and soldiers lying on stretchers. I heard they had been injured a few hours earlier. Also in Li Daren Village, I saw more than ten Eighth Route Army soldiers lying in front of a farmer's house and in the corridors. Several had already died, and the others were seriously injured. The dead lay silently, some curled up, lying on wooden boards or sorghum stalks, and some lying straight on the ground. The wounded were also lying in one place, either using sorghum stalks or tattered cotton military uniforms as pillows. One was using the upper leg of his dead companion as a pillow. Reddish-brown blood seeped through the thick yellow cotton military uniform. I wanted to take a picture, but my trembling hands prevented me from doing so. A soldier with a leg injury, shaking all over, looked at me expectantly, as if he had thousands of words to say. I walked over and spoke to him. I asked him how he joined the Eighth Route Army. He said he had been dragged in near the train station. In the months after joining the army, he had tried to desert twice, but both times he failed. He told me with tears in his eyes that his brother was still in the Central Army. Looking at his contorted, painful face, I cursed everyone involved.

The most deafening and heart-wrenching cannon fire came from the Dongguang Mountain Village and Dahuang Village area, seven or eight *li* south of Li Daren Village. "Bang, bang..." It lasted for two full hours. During these two hours, I couldn't sit or stand still and could only wander around on the frozen river. A National Army officer named Jiang told me that the Eighth Route Army in this area had already collapsed, but a few days ago, two hundred cannons were transported from somewhere, allowing them to continue to hold out. He got this information from villagers who knew nothing about military matters. I don't know if it's reliable.

When the cannons fire, both the National Army and the Communist Army are busy, and the civilians are both busy and scared. Villagers in two small villages told me that the men had been taken by the Eighth Route Army to carry the wounded. Women and children were silent as cicadas in winter, trembling and hiding. Innocent children, not to mention losing their schooling, were threatened by terror day and night. The people most closely linked to the army were the cart drivers. Carts were needed not only to transport supplies and luggage but also to carry wounded officers and soldiers. Yang Shuyuan, the Eighth Route Army brigade commander who was wounded near Dahuang Village, was transported to the rear by cart (a vehicle with two cartwheels supporting a thick wooden board, which the locals call a flatbed cart). Several cart drivers who transported luggage and supplies for the Eighth Route Army told me that they received no pay for working for the Eighth Route Army. If they weren't forced, no one would want to go. Cart drivers who worked for the National Army received 100 yuan a day, plus the military provided food for them and fodder for the horses. They rarely got to eat hot rice during the New Year, but they actually got to eat it with the National Army. One cart driver said that he had been pulled by the Eighth Route Army to carry a stretcher. During marches, the Eighth Route Army made them walk in front, and when the cannons fired, the Eighth Route Army bent over or lay on the ground, crawling, but the civilians in the stretcher teams walking in front of them were still forced to hold their heads high and move forward. The stretcher team walking in front of the troops, and not allowed to lower their heads when fighting, I don't know what kind of tactic that is, probably another use of the "human wave tactic"?

The Eighth Route Army here mostly calls themselves the "People's Autonomous Army," which is as intriguing as the "Northeast Manchuria Democratic Allied Army." In any village or town where the Eighth Route Army has stayed, you will always see a large pile of slogans written in white ash. They love to use their own invented simplified characters. "Support" is written as "grab." Slogans like "Support the Northeast People's Autonomous Government," "Support the Northeast People's Autonomous Army in Maintaining Local Security," and "Support Chairman Chiang's Four Promises" (they are so clever) are displayed. In fact, the Eighth Route Army has a fairly close relationship with the Northeastern people. First, conscription (the people call it "taking Eighth Route Army soldiers"). Several to a dozen people are conscripted from a village or town. If they can't find enough, the village or town head is questioned. Second, sending grain. Twenty-eight *jin* of *gaoliang* rice must be sent from one *mu* of land. If you don't have it, you have to find a way yourself. Third, and most cleverly, "take from the rich to help the poor." Every time they arrive in a place, they investigate the local wealthy families, put them on a blacklist, and take the grain and rice from them to "distribute" to the poor, which can gain the approval of some poor people and attract the participation of some unemployed workers and desperate puppet police. Although, when they leave, the villagers stare blankly as bags of rice and white flour are transported away, and they don't care. Families with money or real estate are usually labeled with some kind of crime and fined tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. In Dazhifang, a small village of more than 300 households ten *li* north of Liaoyang, there were 58 wealthy families on the blacklist. The most was 120,000. It's also a coincidence that the National Army arrived on the eve of the payment. In order to get money, I heard two dramas: In Shacunpu, more than 30 *li* west of Shenyang, an old man in his sixties was taken away by the Eighth Route Army passing by. It's been more than twenty days, and there's been no news. The old man's nephew told me that if they could have scraped together the 80,000 yuan ransom, this unfortunate experience wouldn't have happened. Hong Xuru, the director of Hong Xuru Hospital in Liaoyang City, was charged by the Eighth Route Army with buying medicine from the South Manchuria Hospital and was asked for 500,000 yuan. This doctor, who was not wealthy to begin with, fainted upon hearing this huge number. After waking up, he told the Eighth Route Army representative that he would sell his house for as much as he could. The sudden stimulus was too great, and Dr. Hong died a few days later. The Eighth Route Army has withdrawn from Liaoyang. The Liaoyang City community held a grand welcome rally for the National Army the day before yesterday. Before the meeting, a welcome speech was printed, and there were a few sentences in the middle that said: "They always sing high-sounding words for the country and the people, deceiving the public, but the fox's tail is difficult to hide. As time goes on, the truth is revealed. Today, they arrest Zhang, and tomorrow, they kidnap Li. They always reach out their dirty hands to ask the people for money. Their behavior is even more despicable and shameless than bandits who kidnap people for ransom. The pain they give to the people is deeper than during the Japanese occupation. We, who are destined to suffer alive, after fourteen years of slave life, still have to endure the brutal levies and plunder of the Eighth Route Army bandits." A 71-year-old man, in the welcoming crowd, walked to the podium after the enthusiastic speeches of the representatives of various groups, unfolded a letter, and read it to Long Tianwu, the commander of the New Sixth Army, who was being welcomed. After reading it, he handed it to General Long. A passage in the letter was written like this: "...and pray that the commander conveys the immeasurable merit of Chairman Chiang to the Northeastern people for recovering our territory and restoring our freedom, and we will never forget it." After the old man finished reading, some elementary school students also presented the letters of appreciation they brought, one by one, to General Long and bowed. Also sharing this honor was Luo Ying, the commander of the New Shao Second Division.

The Eighth Route Army occupied Liaoyang for half a year. The citizens said that they came in three batches: The first batch was driven away by the second batch, and the second batch was driven away by the third batch. The third batch stayed for three months in a row until the New Sixth Army advanced to the front before retreating.

As Qingming Festival approaches, Liaoyang is getting warmer day by day. The white snow in the suburbs is gradually disappearing. Occasionally, a few sounds of spring thunder are heard outside the window, which at first sounds a bit like the sound of cannons coming from afar. The people of Liaoyang are not startled and hiding. They are gathering on the streets and roads, waiting to see the Eighth Route Army soldiers who have surrendered to the National Army walk by.

Editorial

### A Plea for the People of the Northeast! – Please Don't Plant Another Landmine in the Northeast –

When Special Envoy Marshall returned to Chongqing, the so-called "Democratic Allied Forces" of the Chinese Communist Party were intensifying their attack on Changchun. Telegraph communications with Changchun and Harbin were cut off yesterday, and last night it was reported that the Communist army was about to occupy Changchun. The Chinese Communist Party, which chanted "democracy, peace, unity, and unification," began to besiege Changchun within an hour of the withdrawal of Soviet troops, apparently wanting to seize the Northeast by force, which runs counter to the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference. Moreover, the weapons used by the Communist army to attack were the weapons surrendered by the enemy, and at the same time, Soviet planes flew low over Changchun as if on patrol. The international nature of the situation in Northeast China has gradually been shrouded in the smoke of war. According to the talk of General Du Yuming, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Forces, when the Communist army entered Changchun, the government had only two or three thousand security guards in Changchun, who could only hold on to corners and resist in self-defense. How the Communist army's 500,000 troops, possessing various light and heavy weapons, were transferred from the Japanese army to the Communist army is unknown. From General Du's remarks, it can be seen that the key to the reason why the people of the Northeast are suffering from artillery fire again after victory and why the national army cannot take over sovereignty in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance lies entirely in the Communist army's deliberate attempt to partition the Northeast and plant a huge landmine for future world peace!

To understand the situation in the Northeast today, we must frankly point out that the important key lies in international relations. After Japan's surrender, the entire Northeast was under the control and rule of the Soviet army. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance opened a new page in Sino-Soviet relations on the one hand, and set a standard for the situation in the Northeast on the other. According to the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Soviet troops stationed in the Northeast should hand over the entire Northeast to the Chinese National Government for takeover. It was only natural for the Chinese government to send troops to recover the territory and take over the Northeast. Unexpectedly, the Communist troops encountered numerous obstacles, and the seaports in the Northeast could not be used. They had to advance along the Beining Railway from Qinhuangdao, while at the same time, the so-called Communist army could enter from Rehe or land in the area of Lushun and Dalian from the Shandong Peninsula. If there were no troops in the Northeast that did not obey the orders of the Central Army, there would be no artillery fire today. The national army's dispatch to the Northeast was based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance; what was the need for the Communist army to enter? Why didn't the Soviet army effectively stop this? The Soviet army had the obligation to assist the Chinese National Government in taking over the Northeast in accordance with the treaty, so why did it allow the Communist army to enter the Northeast first, leading to the current situation? Now that the smell of gunpowder in the Northeast is getting stronger, the Chinese people cannot but recognize the international relations involved. We still sincerely pray today that the Northeast will not become an international powder keg again. However, the Communist Party has a different intention, and insists on "digging good meat to make sores," insisting on planting another landmine on the land of the Northeast where our compatriots have endured hardship for fourteen years before finally returning to the embrace of the motherland!

The mission of Marshal Marshall's visit to China is to assist China in finding a way to achieve peaceful unification, which indirectly means eliminating the seeds of future international conflict, at least in the Far East. However, the current situation in the Northeast is exactly the opposite of Marshal Marshall's efforts. From the time Marshal Marshall arrived in China until now, the ruling authorities in China and other parties and factions, including the Communist Party, have all claimed that they advocate solving the current domestic situation through political means, which coincides with President Truman's advocacy of a strong, united, and democratic China. Therefore, since Marshal Marshall's arrival, we have seen the successful progress of the "Political Consultative Conference," the dispatch of military mediation executive groups, and the preparations for reorganizing the National Government and convening the National Assembly. All these efforts are aimed at promoting the stability of the situation in China and the realization of unified democracy. However, when the situation is gradually improving, in addition to the sporadic battles in various places, the Communist army still launches large-scale attacks on Changchun in the Northeast, hindering the national army's takeover. If the international community does not distinguish right from wrong today, but only knows how to call for a ceasefire, without clearly pointing out which side should be responsible for destroying the spirit of coordination since the "Political Consultative Conference," then how can we be sure that the fighting behavior that is appearing in the Northeast today will not appear in North China tomorrow, and how can we be sure that it will not appear in Central China the day after tomorrow? Because the Communist Party takes advantage of everyone's confused mentality of "no right or wrong" to first create the fact of demarcating territory, and then bargain and ask for mediation. I ask, what kind of country will the country become, and what kind of army will the army become? To be honest, if this continues, not only will Special Envoy Marshall be fooled, the American ally will be deceived by the CCP, but the people of China will one day suffer the great pain of the landmines buried by the CCP.

We are very ashamed that in the current situation, our compatriots cannot put national interests first, disregard the good intentions of the Allied mediation, and are willing to be puppets, doing things that harm the country and the people. But this is not something that can be solved by shame alone. Now that Marshal Marshall has returned to China and resumed his post, he is extremely concerned about the situation in the Northeast, just like the Chinese people, who do not want the Northeast to be buried in the ground again, and do not want the Northeast to become an international powder keg again. The situation in the Northeast is not only related to China's safety, stability, and chaos, but also to the peace of the entire world. Now it is clear that someone is playing with fire in the Northeast, and we should quickly extinguish this fire. It is clear that someone is burying landmines in the Northeast, and we should quickly excavate these landmines. The Chinese people have the following general understanding of the current situation in the Northeast: (1) The Northeast is a part of China's territory. According to the principle of territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, no form of division of the Northeast is allowed. (2) In order to maintain the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, no obstruction is allowed to the national army's takeover work. (3) All attempts to divide and dualize the situation in the Northeast will absolutely not be recognized by the real Chinese people. Therefore, the activities of the Communist army in the Northeast violate the common psychology of the Chinese people. In order to resolve the current situation, we advocate: (1) The military mediation executive group should immediately rush to the Northeast to strictly stop the Communist army's attack; (2) Regarding the takeover of the Northeast, the national army should complete its assigned tasks, and the Communist army should not obstruct it; (3) All national and Communist troops in the Northeast should wait for treatment in accordance with the reorganization and unified compilation plan. Whichever side violates the agreement should disband the troops on that side.

This is the most basic solution. In order to take into account the facts, there is no need to talk about many great principles of law and reason. We should quickly eliminate this seemingly right but actually wrong "internal dispute" situation. We should use the spirit of firefighters fighting fire to quickly extinguish the fire in the Northeast and quickly dig up the landmines in the Northeast. We make another sincere appeal to the CCP, and we once again plead for the people of the Northeast!

### Security Council Discusses Spanish Question: A Debate with No Result: Australian Representative Suggests Sending Subcommittee to Investigate: General Assembly Adjourns Until Next Tuesday

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council will meet next Tuesday to first discuss the report of the committee of experts on the Iranian question. As for the Spanish question, the Security Council will appoint a subcommittee to study whether Franco threatens world peace before discussing it.

The Security Council met on the evening of the 18th to discuss the Iranian and Spanish questions, but no results were achieved. At the request of Soviet representative Gromyko, it was decided to hold another meeting next Tuesday, at which time the Iranian question will be discussed.

When the Spanish question was discussed, a heated debate broke out. British representative Jebb accused the discussion of the existence of the Franco regime in Spain of interfering in Spain's internal affairs. Soviet representative Gromyko supported Poland's proposal to sever diplomatic relations with Franco, saying: The whole problem can be summed up in one sentence, that is, "The Fascist Party has launched a war for six years, and the blood has flowed into rivers and the corpses have piled up like mountains. Can Fascism still be allowed to exist?"

Australian representative Hodgson made a compromise proposal that has been supported by the representatives. Hodgson proposed to amend Poland's motion on Spain, proposing to appoint a five-member subcommittee to investigate the Spanish question and report back to the Security Council before May 17. Most representatives have not stated whether they support it, but they generally expressed interest and said that the proposal is likely to be accepted.

According to an informal survey of the Security Council representatives by the Associated Press, only Mexico, France, and the Soviet Union supported the Polish proposal to sever diplomatic relations with the Spanish Franco government. Soviet representative Gromyko declared that the proposal was worth considering, while Britain, Austria, and the Netherlands opposed it. The United States is still waiting for Poland to prove the charges before deciding, while Brazil, China, Egypt, and Australia have not yet expressed their positions.

[United Press, New York, 18th] The United Nations Security Council Rules of Procedure Expert Committee today submitted a report that the parties to the Iranian question have applied for withdrawal, and opinions could not agree on whether it should still be on the agenda in terms of legality. Therefore, the question will be returned to the Security Council for further discussion next Tuesday.

British Representative Opposes Collective Severance of Relations with Spain

[United Press, New York, 18th] British representative Jebb declared in the Security Council today: "I cannot admit that the case that the Spanish government threatens peace, undermines peace, or has aggressive actions has been established. Therefore, it cannot be considered proper to ask to sever ties with the Spanish government now." The British embassy in Spain reported in January that there was no evidence to support the claim that German scientists were engaged in scientific research on new tactics in Spain, and no information has been obtained to confirm this rumor. According to the official British report, all assets of Germans in Spain, both in the East and in many semi-East areas, have been transferred to the Spanish government or the United Nations delegation in Madrid. There are now about 10,000 to 12,000 Germans in Spain, most of whom are in private capacities, and only about 2,500 officials, spies, and members of the National Socialist Party who have been found should be sent back to their countries. There are only about 150 former German soldiers in Spain. The UK has not received any information about National Socialist leaders hiding in Spain.

Stettinius Reiterates U.S. Position

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 18th] U.S. Representative Stettinius immediately reiterated the U.S. position, stating: "The position taken by the United States has been repeatedly stated. The late President Roosevelt wrote to the U.S. Ambassador to Spain a year ago, solemnly declaring that the United States cannot agree to the Franco regime's contact with the Axis powers), but we share the great friendship with the Spanish people. At the same time, we are happy to support the resolutions of the San Francisco Conference and the Potsdam Conference, believing that as long as the current regime in Spain exists, the country will not be able to become a member of the United Nations, which is a well-known fact. In short, the United States will sympathetically consider any action that is in accordance with the United Nations Charter, or any independent domestic action, that can reasonably achieve this goal, so as to eliminate the Franco regime and restore a democratic regime without causing civil war."

Guo Taiqi Points Out That We Have Not Recognized the Four Countries

Chinese representative Guo Taiqi spoke, expressing sympathy for the Spanish people and hoping that the country would soon join the United Nations as a member. Regarding the Polish representative's request to sever relations with Spain, Guo pointed out that China has never recognized the regime, so there is no diplomatic relationship at all, but the Security Council should not take any action unless it clearly proves that the current regime in Spain poses a threat to international security.

### New Security Council President Does Not Meet Expectations: Disorder in the Meeting Hall

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th Special Dispatch] The new President of the Security Council, Yassin Bey, used a gavel to maintain order in the meeting hall today.

Yassin Bey's assumption of the presidency is in contrast to Guo Taiqi. Yassin always speaks in an unusually low voice, which has caused resentment from reporters. Moreover, Yassin was obviously unable to decide when to adjourn and when to resume the meeting, which caused confusion in the last few minutes.

### Atomic Energy Commission: Guo Taiqi Appointed as China's Representative

The United Nations had previously forced German companies in Spain to accept United Nations personnel or those close to the United Nations to serve as directors in order to carry out the takeover. Today's order from the Foreign Ministry is aimed at this, and this action is tantamount to secretly undermining the United Nations' takeover method. In addition, the Foreign Ministry has ordered the unsealing of several Spanish trading companies, two of which have minority stakes held by the German Krupp arms factory.

### Spain Trains Troops to Invade Four Nations

The Chinese representative, Liang Long, declared before the closing that the League of Nations' failure to mediate the Manchurian Incident was a fatal blow to the League's life. The chief British representative, Baker, also said, "We also know that this World War began with the Manchurian Incident fifteen years ago." Regarding

Trusteeship System

the Assembly passed the following resolution: The member states of the League of Nations, out of concern for the welfare of the population, shall continue to fulfill their obligations of administering the trust territories in accordance with the regulations, pending the decision of the United Nations and the trust territories on other methods of transfer. The chief Egyptian representative, Pei, individually refused to vote in favor of this resolution, saying that since the League of Nations has been dissolved, Palestine should no longer be under trusteeship. The President replied that the Egyptian representative's statement would be submitted for study when the United Nations authorities meet in September. The final task of the League of Nations is to transfer the original texts of thousands of treaties and assets worth 50 million Swiss francs to the United Nations agencies. After the League's debts are paid, the remaining cash will be distributed to the members according to percentages, or deposited in the accounts of various countries under the United Nations agencies.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 18th, United Press] The old League of Nations building will belong to the United Nations, but the League will retain important staff of less than 200 people until the end of the year.

### The Emperor Smiled at the News that the U.S. and the Soviet Union Will Not Go to War! And He Wants to Become a Disciple of Jesus; A Conversation Between This Newspaper's Special Correspondent and Prince Takamatsu

[This Newspaper's Special Correspondent, Zhang Zhongren, Tokyo, 19th] Prince Takamatsu, the younger brother of Emperor Hirohito, told reporters today that the Emperor was very happy yesterday because he heard good news from the President of the Information Bureau, Okumura. According to Okumura, relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union have greatly improved. The reporter asked Takamatsu: What exactly was the good news that Okumura reported to the Emperor? Takamatsu replied: Do you remember the rumors a month ago that the U.S. and the Soviet Union were about to go to war? The reporter said yes, and there were even more graphic rumors than that. To give you an example: a month ago, many American fighter planes and bombers were flying over Tokyo, and 90% of the Japanese were whispering that

aboard those planes were "Japanese kamikaze pilots" in American uniforms, who were going to China and then Manchuria to fight the Russians. After hearing this, Takamatsu smiled and said: "Okumura's report to the Emperor was very simple. He said that there would be no war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union now because the Soviet Union was not ready. The Emperor was overjoyed to hear this, and Japan can enjoy peace."

Takamatsu has recently invited Watanabe, a famous Japanese Christian, to tell him about the teachings of Jesus. It is now widely rumored in Tokyo that Emperor Hirohito will soon become a disciple of Jesus.

### Four-Party Coalition Launches Movement to Overthrow Cabinet; Political Turmoil in Japan; Prime Minister Shidehara Still Tries to Hang On; Minister of Health and Welfare Ashida Has Resigned

[This Newspaper's Tokyo Special Dispatch, 19th] "Mainichi Shimbun" will invite the newly elected representatives of the Japanese Diet to give speeches at Hibiya Park, explaining their future policies.

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prime Minister Shidehara today rejected the resolution of the joint committee of the Socialist, Liberal, Cooperative, and Communist parties demanding the immediate resignation of the Japanese cabinet.

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] After the Chief Cabinet Secretary and major opposition leaders stated that the current cabinet should resign en masse, the Shidehara cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss countermeasures. The parties that won the general election last week are now scheming and holding secret meetings to gain political positions. Therefore, the future of the cabinet and the parties is still volatile and unpredictable. Chief Cabinet Secretary Narahashi suddenly issued a statement, urging the three parties to unite, and said: "The Shidehara cabinet must resign and negotiate with the three parties to stabilize the political situation." Liberal Party President Hatoyama said, "It is absolutely impossible to support the current cabinet. It is inconceivable for the cabinet to cope with the special session of the Diet in its current form." Shidehara tried today to become the president of the Progressive Party, using it as the core to absorb the votes of independent and small parties to consolidate the government's position, but the situation has expanded due to Narahashi's sudden and explicit statement. Narahashi also said, "If, after discussions with the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party, it is decided to nominate Hatoyama as Prime Minister, Shidehara will serve as Foreign Minister and cooperate with him." However, some Japanese

She continued, Tojo told her not to bother sending food because living would be very difficult under the current monetary restriction regulations. Tojo's daughter added that her mother is currently living near Mount Fuji and does not plan to come to Tokyo for Tojo's trial because everything has been entrusted to the lawyers.

### Allied Council for Japan; Motion to Limit Speech

Failed Due to U.S. Representative's Opposition

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] According to sources close to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, at today's meeting of the Four-Power Allied Council for Japan, the representatives of China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union proposed a procedure to limit the time and materials of speakers attending the committee. However, the U.S. representative, Marquette, strongly opposed it, arguing that those invited to report should be allowed to provide as much information as possible. Limiting them would be tantamount to limiting the activities of the committee itself. The purpose of the U.S. representative's proposal is to allow MacArthur to fully provide opinions in the Four-Power Allied Council. Although the U.S. representative was isolated, he was able to prevent the passage of the motion because the committee has no voting procedure and cannot force representatives to agree. As a result, the Four-Power representatives could not reach an agreement on this matter.

### Pan Yangyao and Others Transferred; Faces Covered with Beards, Haggard; Carry Luggage into Prison Gates

[This Newspaper] The large number of major traitors arrested in this city has been transferred to the High Procuratorate in four batches over the past half month by military agencies. At 9 o'clock yesterday, a large canvas-covered ten-wheeled jeep truck drove to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, carrying five "VIPs" who were escorted from a detention center in the suburbs by a military agency. They are Pan Yangyao, Yang Guangzheng, Ji Genming, Tang Derong, and Liu Qinyi. The prisoners had beards on their faces and were mentally exhausted. After getting off the bus, under the supervision of armed personnel, each person carried their luggage and walked into Zhongzi Street.

On the same day, another four people were transferred to the Military Law Supervision Department of the Nanjing Army Headquarters for trial. The list includes Shao Zhongnan, Yuan Qingguang, Dong Xiutian, and Cai Wenshi (who is Taiwanese and is being treated as a war criminal).

Yuan Lvdeng and Wu Songping, two of the "Three Old Men," and Chuan Shishuo, and others have been prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on the 16th. The indictment was delivered to the Tilanqiao High Court by the High Procuratorate yesterday. Personnel were dispatched to the prison to read it to each prisoner and send it to their families so that the lawyers hired by the defendants could prepare their defense based on this. It is predicted that several people will be publicly tried within the next week.

Recently, the High Procuratorate has been busy day and night investigating the prisoners in custody. The previous two days also saw Chen Jicheng, Zhang Songtao, Zhou Ding, Xu Zuiren, Wen Shisong, Yang Yongrui, Ye Yaoxian, Yang Cui, Hu Zhanggen, Lu Xihou, Zhao Ziqian, Huang Chuqi, Zhao Yuntai, and many others interrogated.

Tilanqiao Prison stipulates that from the 15th, food must be purchased from Sincere and Wing On and delivered by the companies. However, the traitors in the prison refused to accept it. Yesterday morning, family members still flocked to bring food themselves. The prison side then adopted a flexible approach, that is, rice and bread could still be delivered by family members, while fruits and other items had to be ordered from the two major companies.

### Ling Tianpeng's Wife and Sister-in-Law Arrested Together in Bed

[This Newspaper] Ling Tianpeng, the former chief inspector of the puppet police station and manager of the Dasheng gambling den, was very arrogant at the time and committed many evils.

The court believes that they dare to disregard the law and continue to smoke, which is unforgivable. After trial, they are always sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year as a warning.

### City Health Bureau Promotes Epidemic Prevention Movement: Smallpox Patients in the City Have Decreased

[Our Dispatch] Due to warmer weather and the active prevention efforts of the City Health Bureau, the number of smallpox patients in the city has decreased this month. According to statistics from municipal hospitals, there were 179 patients last month, while this month, up to the 17th, there were 75.

The Bureau, recognizing the importance of epidemic prevention work as summer approaches, has drafted a summer epidemic investigation plan through the Epidemic Prevention Department and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, funds will be allocated immediately to promote the work. The main points of the plan can be divided into four areas: (1) Cleaning up earth wells to prevent insect breeding. All earth wells within the city will be filled in. In the suburbs, personnel will be sent to conduct on-site investigations and inspections. Those not deemed essential will also be filled in. Wherever possible, connections to the city water supply will be requested from the water company. Otherwise, residents will be supervised to clean and maintain the wells. (2) Administering vaccinations. The Bureau is actively producing vaccines, expecting to provide enough for four million people, and will begin serving citizens on May 1st. (3) Spraying DDT. The main use of DDT is to kill insects such as lice, mosquitoes, and flies. Powdered DDT is particularly effective against lice. One quart of a 5% DDT solution can be applied to 250 square feet, with a lasting effect of two to three months. If needed to eliminate mosquitoes and insects, applications may be submitted to the City Health Bureau. However, due to the limited quantity of DDT received by the Bureau, it is currently unable to provide a large supply and is requesting further allocation from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Regarding releasing DDT in suburban rivers and streams, the Bureau plans to conduct local trials first because DDT contains toxins, and villagers drink and wash vegetables from these water sources, which poses a potential danger. Therefore, releasing DDT in flowing streams is not planned. (4) Public health education to citizens. Citizens must not consume raw water or raw vegetables, and should especially avoid buying food from street vendors. The Bureau will request the cooperation of the Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to jointly crack down on summer fruit stalls.

### Tram and Bus Fares Increase Today: Relevant Authorities Announce Reasons for Fare Increase; Companies' Heavy Losses Must Be Remedied

[Our Dispatch] Tram and bus fares in the city are adjusted starting today (the 20th): Tram first class minimum $90, maximum $200; third class minimum $60, maximum $120. Bus minimum $100, maximum $300. According to the relevant authorities of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, public transport fares in the city are determined based on the necessary expenses of each company as the standard. As employee wages have increased repeatedly in accordance with the cost of living index, operating costs have also increased sharply. Furthermore, due to skyrocketing material prices, damaged vehicles cannot be repaired, especially tires, which are unaffordable, leading to a reduction in the number of vehicles in service. For example, the British-owned trolleybus company originally had 130 trolleybuses, but now only 42 are in service. The British tram company has accumulated losses of $960 million; the French company has accumulated losses of $787 million, so it is imperative to remedy the situation quickly. To take into account the reduction of transportation costs for administrative organ staff, engineers and workers, and students in the city, the Bureau has specifically instructed each company to issue half-price monthly tram passes starting in May to show preferential treatment.

Train Fares Have Not Increased Yet

Hu, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department of the Two Roads Administration, told a reporter from the East China News Agency yesterday: The rumor that train tickets will increase fourfold is a misunderstanding based on the new fares for the Shanghai-Hangzhou special express train of the Bureau. In view of the upcoming Easter holiday, the Bureau has specially opened a Shanghai-Hangzhou special express train yesterday to facilitate various agencies and organizations. This train is limited to first and second class passengers and departs from the North Station every morning at 6:40 AM. To avoid crowding, the fare is four times higher than other special express trains, and seats must be reserved with tickets to limit the number of passengers. This fare is temporary and will be reduced to the original price after April 22. As for the general increase in fares on the two lines, the Bureau has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Communications to increase fares.

Restrictions on Installing Telephones

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is currently facing a shortage of materials at the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the equipment at each exchange is already full, and there is no spare capacity on the lines in each district. Applications for installation continue to pour into the company, and the company is unable to cope. In the future, in order to cooperate with the government's post-war reconstruction and to meet the urgent needs of military and government agencies, it is necessary to restrict telephone installation. Temporary restrictions on telephone installation by the Shanghai Telephone Company have been stipulated and implemented from the 15th of this month. It is reported that the regulations stipulate that applications for telephone installation to the Shanghai Telephone Company are limited to military and government aviation agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, military aviation agencies, state-owned industrial and commercial institutions, and public utilities, and whose telephone needs are essential for public service and of an urgent nature. It is also reported that each agency must issue an official letter, signed by the highest official, before applying directly to the Shanghai Telephone Company.

### Assisting Post-War Reconstruction, Several Ships Set Sail to Hankou on Assignment

[Our Dispatch] The return to the capital and post-war reconstruction have begun, but there is a great shortage of transportation means such as railways, highways, air transport, and ships. The Ministry of Communications is making every effort to allocate resources, but the transport capacity is still limited. According to relevant sources, under the current circumstances, the reconstruction transportation can handle "up to 50,000 people. If the transportation means can be adjusted, the transport capacity can be increased." Some of the city's river ships have been ordered to go to Hankou on assignment. The Changxing ship of the Sanbei Company is scheduled to sail to Hankou today, without carrying cargo or passengers. The ship's power has been enhanced after this repair. During this flood season, the ship's body is large and has a large capacity, which is very suitable for post-war reconstruction transportation on the Beijing-Hankou section. The Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Group has already been assigned, and the Jianghua ship will also be transferred to Hankou next week. The Jiangde ship of the Dada Datong Joint Venture left the port on the morning of the 17th to sail to Hankou for assignment, but was withdrawn due to wind and damage to the ship's body, so it stopped sailing to Hankou. This time, it carried more than ten tons of goods. Yesterday it was wrongly published as more than a thousand tons. Also, the Hongda ship of the same company was also ordered to sail to Hankou and is scheduled to set sail next Monday morning. The Dafeng ship is also scheduled to sail to Hankou next week on assignment.

### Case of Murder of American Pilots in Hankou: Five War Criminals Sentenced to Death Next Monday; Execution by Hanging in Secret

The five Japanese war criminals who murdered three American pilots in Hankou previously, including Major General Kaburaki Masao, were sentenced to death by hanging by a U.S. military court at the end of March.

All were sentenced to death by hanging as principal offenders and are now held in Tilanqiao Prison. The three American pilots they killed were tortured until they were covered in wounds, and then strangled to death with thick hemp ropes. After the victims died, the Japanese burned them, thinking that no one would know on a dark and windy night, but they did not expect that they would have to pay with their lives today.

### Readers' Response – Legal Queries

Zhou Dexing asks: Mr. Jia lost his wife two years ago and has not remarried. He now intends to marry the widow Ms. [Surname] (outside of the five degrees of mourning) of Mr. Yi, a nephew in the same clan. Is this legally permissible? Kindly advise.

Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies: Collateral relatives by marriage of different generations, if outside the fifth degree of kinship, are not restricted and can marry.

Hui Yiqing asks: I have several questions regarding the enemy and dare to ask your column for guidance: (1) Do any documents have a validity period? (2) If all the parties related to writing a document have passed away, is the document still valid? (3) A, B, and C jointly own a plot of public land. This land happens to be adjacent to A's house foundation, so A has been planting vegetables on it for decades, and B and C have never objected. Recently, A and B have become estranged, and B now forbids A from planting. Can A consider this a fait accompli and ignore it, or is there an appropriate way to deal with it? (4) A has ancestral land that was seized by B relying on his power more than ten years ago. Now A wants to reclaim it, how should he do so? (5) Tian has a piece of ancestral land with an area double the size of the document he holds. Can this become a reason for others to encroach upon it?

Lawyer Duanmu Kai replies: (1) It depends on the nature of the right. For example, ordinary debt instruments expire if not exercised within fifteen years. (2) Even if the person who wrote the document or the scribe has passed away, the document is still valid, but other handwriting or the seal affixed must be found to prove it. (3) Only those who possess another person's unregistered real estate with the intention of ownership, peacefully and continuously for twenty years, can request registration as the owner.

### The First Shanghai Municipal Councilor Election is Approaching – Voters Must Not Give Up Their Rights

— Our Reporter Canglong

Sowing the Seeds of Democracy

In today's world where the call for "democracy" resounds through the clouds, the upcoming election of the first Shanghai Municipal Councilors on April 28th cannot be said to lack profound significance. However, from all perspectives, the preparation time for this election is relatively tight. At the same time, citizens still lack an understanding of the importance of the Municipal Council and the election of Municipal Councilors. The reporter would like to briefly introduce the information collected on this aspect:

Council Powers are Related to the City

First, we might as well first understand the powers of the Municipal Council. According to Article 2 of the Municipal Council Organization Regulations: The Council shall deliberate on (1) matters related to completing local autonomy, (2) municipal single regulations, (3) municipal budget review and municipal final accounts, (4) municipal taxes, public bonds, and other increases in municipal treasury burden, (5) management and disposal of municipal property, (6) matters submitted by the mayor. In addition, it can also suggest matters for the improvement of municipal administration, listen to the government's policy reports and submit inquiries to the government, accept citizens' petitions, and other matters granted by law. In other words, the Municipal Council is the representative body of the people of the entire city. Looking at the ten tasks of the above duties, it can be said that none is not closely related to the interests of the citizens themselves. Since we do not allow our own interests to be harmed, we must do our best to elect municipal councilors who can represent the interests of the citizens!

Voter Registration is Like Phoenix Feathers and Unicorn Horns

Some say that in the dark ages when the enemy and puppets occupied the area, good talents all hid away. Then, now that the sky has been re-lit, and after eight years of bitter waiting, it should be a golden opportunity to stand up and serve the people. However, it is said that many citizens in the district and bao have the intention to shirk their duties after being elected. And this time, those applying for qualification as candidates for public office are only over a thousand people. In addition, voter registration, in principle, anyone over the age of 20 who holds a national identity card or receives a receipt for the national identity card can register at the nearest bao office to obtain voter qualification. But in fact, those who can personally go to the bao office to register are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, as a temporary solution, the Civil Affairs Bureau will issue the voter list to the bao offices to compile the voter registration list on their behalf. This will enable citizens of this city who have voter qualifications (estimated to be around 2.04 million) to participate in the election in a timely manner.

Quota for Election Specifies the Standard for Production

The quota for regional elections of municipal councilors in this city is based on Article 4 of the Municipal Council Organization Law, which stipulates that the selected basic number is nineteen, and for every 30,000 people exceeding 100,000, one is added. According to the population census statistics in February of this year, the total population is 3,345,875 people, so it should be 108 people, so the total quota for regional elections is 127 people. This city is now divided into 32 districts, of which Districts 27 and 28 have not yet been delineated, and the election in District 32 is temporarily postponed. In addition, the distribution of quotas for each electoral district is based on Article 9 of the Municipal Council Election Regulations, which is produced in proportion. That is to say, anyone with a population of 2,345 people will produce one person. The remainder will be assigned to the districts with the most zeros in the remaining numbers. In this way, Taishan District has the largest population and is allocated 13 seats, Xincheng District is the next largest and is allocated 10 seats, and so on. As for the number of municipal councilors to be elected by vocational groups, the regulations stipulate that they account for three-tenths of the total number of councilors. Then three-tenths of 127 is 54, so the total number of councilors in this city is 181. Councilors in each electoral district are directly elected by voters in their respective districts, while vocational groups must determine their election system based on the number of member units to which they belong. For example, the elections of the Fishermen's Association and the Education Association adopt a direct election system, where members directly elect. The Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Union, the Farmers' Association, and the Freelancers' Association, because they have more member units, adopt a two-stage election system. First, each unit elects three people as primary electors, and then they jointly re-elect.

Not Much Interest in Running for Public Office

We might as well try again to observe the regulations for the qualifications of candidates for public office. So-called candidates for public office can be divided into two types, A and B, both of which must pass an examination. Those who pass the Type A public office candidate examination can be candidates for municipal councilors and district heads and deputy district heads. Those who pass the Type B public office candidate examination can be candidates for district representatives and bao heads and deputy bao heads. The examination method is divided into two types: examination and qualification review. Qualification review only requires submitting documents and reviewing qualifications. Those who pass the qualification review will obtain candidate qualifications without having to take the examination again. This city is now conducting qualification reviews first, which are reviewed by the Municipal Government's Shanghai Public Office Candidate Qualification Review Committee. Applicants for both Type A and Type B public office candidate qualifications must be citizens of 25 years of age. Now, apart from the Type B qualification regulations, which are more common and will not be discussed, let us first discuss the Type A qualifications. According to the regulations, they must have one of the following qualifications, namely: (1) former county councilors, (2) former township representatives or township chiefs for more than two years, (3) those with appointment qualifications for commissioned positions, (4) those with general examination qualifications and more than three years of social service experience, (5) those who have passed autonomous training and have more than three years of social service experience, (6) those who have handled local public welfare affairs for more than three years, (7) those who have held key positions in vocational groups or other people's organizations for more than three years, (8) those who have been engaged in freelance professions for more than three years. Question: Among the more than 3.3 million people in this city, is it possible that only the thousand or so people mentioned in the newspaper can apply for Type A public office candidates with one of the above qualifications? This is another strong proof that citizens of this city lack interest in running for elections.

A Powerful Test of Promoting Democracy

Now the deadline for applying to register as a candidate for public office has passed. We have given up the qualification to be a candidate for public office in the first place, but we must never give up the right to vote in the second place, because the right to vote is a basic right of the people. Looking at the countries that have been modernized and the advanced nations after this war, who is not burning the torch of democracy vigorously? Now that the government is determined to implement universal suffrage, it is to sow a seed for the implementation of true democracy and the principle of returning power to the people, and to raise a torch. This seed can only grow stronger, and this torch can only shine brightly. This election of municipal councilors in Shanghai is a most powerful test!

### Qingming Festival · A Corner of Wei Yuan – Visiting the Hu Mulian Group

— Chongqing Airlines Dispatch on the 10th, Dispatched by Our Special Reporter Zhao Haosheng

During the Qingming Festival, Chongqing has good weather that makes people unable to restrain their laughter from bursting out from the bottom of their hearts. The People's Political Council, which had been in session for half a month, has just closed, and I feel infinitely light in spirit. Taking advantage of this rare leisure time, the reporter made a pleasant visit that was completely free of annoying "politics."

Originally, during the half month that the People's Political Council was in session, Hu Senator could often be seen in the meeting place and in the car. However, every time was rushed and there was no time for a leisurely conversation. After the meeting, Hu Senator was also relatively free, so the reporter made a special visit on the second day after the closing – March 4th, which was the Qingming Festival.

Miss Hu Mulian! From here on, I will use this title – the senators in the People's Political Council all call her that. "Miss Hu" seems to contain more meaning than "Senator Hu," so "Miss Hu" is a louder title than "Senator Hu."

Simple and Elegant

Miss Hu's residence in Chongqing is on Chuandong Normal Street. On the wooden plaque above the door, two faint characters are written: "Wei Yuan."

Walking through the bamboo door, there is a courtyard built on the hillside, like many "gardens" in Chongqing. Inside are rows of unconnected houses, each family living separately, surrounded by bamboo fences, forming a general name "× Yuan." This is a very common type of residence for the upper-middle class in Chongqing.

Miss Hu's home is a square bungalow. In front of the door, there is a green flower stand. The weak branches of morning glories have just stretched up from the ground. In the height of summer, there may be a lush canopy on the flower stand. In front of the door, a flat piece of concrete. A small, clean-haired black dog is lying there sunbathing. Looking around, it is a scene of tranquility. This has more of a simple and elegant flavor than the Hu Mansion I imagined.

Preparing to Return to Guangzhou First – Many Things to Deal With

Just as everyone has heard, Miss Hu loves to wear monochrome clothes. That day, she was dressed in all black, a black cheongsam, and a pair of embroidered black satin shoes, simple and homely. She greeted the reporter with a happy face. The first sentence was to say that she shared the fatigue of the closing of the People's Political Council, and then she greeted the maid who came out in Cantonese: "Pour some tea!"

Miss Hu speaks Mandarin very well. Her conversation is practical and kind, and there is absolutely no air of a "women's rights activist." The reporter first asked: The People's Political Council has closed. When does Miss Hu plan to leave? Back to Guangzhou or to Shanghai or Nanjing? She said that she would probably have to leave in a week or two. She would have to go back to Guangzhou first, and then go to Shanghai and Nanjing to see. When the reporter mentioned that if, as suggested by the People's Political Council, the number of National Assembly representatives increased, I am afraid that Miss Hu would have to rush to Nanjing before May 5th, she smiled. She said that the matter of increasing the number of National Assembly representatives has not yet been decided, but she has many things to deal with in Guangzhou.

Speaking of Guangzhou, the reporter remembered what everyone was most concerned about, the situation of Mr. Hu Zhantang's Jiyuan after the disaster. Regarding this matter, Miss Hu also had a lot to say, so she picked up a cup of black tea handed by the maid and began to listen to Miss Hu's narrative.

Miss Hu said that Mr. Zhantang's cemetery is in Longyandong, outside Guangzhou City. Construction began in the year the Anti-Japanese War began, but it was interrupted because she was afraid that the enemy would use it as a military target to bomb it. In order to explain the cemetery situation in more detail, Miss Hu went back to the bedroom and took out two large thick books, which were the entire plan for the construction of Mr. Zhantang's cemetery.

Unveiling the first page of the "Hu Former Chairman Cemetery Project Plan" made by the Jintai Construction Company, there is an aerial view of the entire cemetery plan. Miss Hu pointed and explained in great detail.

Visiting Mr. Zhantang's Tomb and Planning to Resume Work

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Miss Hu missed the safety of the cemetery from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, Guilin, and Chongqing all the time, so the first thing she did after the victory was to rush back to Guangzhou to "visit my father's tomb."

This time Miss Hu came from Guangzhou, in addition to attending the People's Political Council, and to make a request to the government regarding the reconstruction of the cemetery. Fortunately, the entire engineering plan was still there during the eight years of relocation, and everything had old rules to follow. Miss Hu had already spoken with President Song and could resume work according to the original plan.

Miss Hu has two copies of the engineering plan, which were made by Jintai Construction Company after three months of surveying. In January of the 26th year, the Central Government approved it. Construction began in June of the same year, followed by the "July 7th" Incident. This nationally commemorative project was interrupted due to the country's Anti-Japanese War, and it will be resumed after the victory of the war, which really increases its lofty significance.

After Miss Hu returns to Guangdong, she will begin to prepare for the resumption of work. A few months ago, General Zhang Fakui ordered Japanese prisoners in Guangzhou to work and restore the earthwork of the cemetery.

Mentioning the Coffin of Madam Hu, she was Saddened

The reporter asked about Madam Hu, which aroused Miss Hu's memories of the sighing life of relocation during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. Madam Hu passed away in Chongqing in the 25th year, which is her saddest memory in eight years. Madam Hu's coffin has been returned to Guangzhou by road after the victory. In addition, Mr. Zhantang's relics, manuscripts, etc., have not been lost at all due to Miss Hu's cherishment and preservation during the eight years of relocation, and have now been transported back to Guangzhou. The national treasure is safe, which is really not just Miss Hu's joy!

Due to Miss Hu's extremely homely conversation, the reporter asked more about Miss Hu's family affairs, which is also what the people of the country are extremely concerned about. Mr. Zhantang has many brothers, but his only dear and beloved is Miss Hu. Mr. Zhantang carried his only beloved daughter with him in all his activities during his lifetime. Mr. Zhantang's revolutionary life is closely linked to his beloved daughter. Mr. Zhantang's historical achievements were also written by this only beloved daughter. After Mr. Zhantang passed away, Miss Hu did not interrupt her political life. After Madam Hu passed away, Miss Hu lived even more bravely on her own. All of this can be clearly seen from Miss Hu's treatment of people and conversation.

Hu Mansion May Be Sold – Words Contain Humor

The visit, which lasted about two hours, finally brought the conversation back to the question of when to leave Chongqing. This time, Miss Hu asked the reporter where she was going. The reporter told her that she planned to go to Shanghai around the 20th. She talked about her memories of Shen Bao, so the reporter asked her to give a recent photo to the newspaper and asked her to sign a business card, which she readily agreed to.

Leaving, under the flower stand, the reporter asked Miss Hu whether this house was rented or built by herself? She said that it was built after she came from Guilin to Chongqing, and now she plans to sell it. Then, she humorously added: "This time I leave, I probably won't be coming back."

She very politely sent the reporter to the door, and in the voice of "See you in Shanghai!", she stepped out of "Wei Yuan."

Hoover Plans to Relieve World Famine

Former US President and World War I Food Administrator Hoover (left), with Secretary of Agriculture Anderson (center), and Famine Relief Committee Chairman Davis (right), held talks on food issues in Washington, D.C. President Truman specially appointed Hoover to organize a committee to reduce domestic food and relieve famine victims in Europe and the Far East. Hoover will go to Europe and the Far East to inspect the famine situation.

### Shanghai Municipal Government Sets Voter Precautions

As the date of the Municipal Councilor election in this city is approaching, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has specially printed various colored small slogans in order to expand publicity and encourage all citizens to participate enthusiastically. The slogans include "Voting is a Basic Right of the People, Do Not Abandon Your Right to Elect Municipal Councilors," and eight other slogans for distribution everywhere. It also plans to consult with the aviation authorities in Shanghai to use airplanes to spread them. In addition, it has notified all cinemas in the city to display the slogans as slides to expand publicity. Mayor Qian Dajun, Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and social celebrities will give broadcast speeches to explain the meaning of elections, election ethics, and to lecture on election and lecture matters. In order to awaken the attention of the citizens in the urban area, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has decided to sound a long whistle at 6:00 AM on Election Day (the 28th of this month) and notify factories in the suburbs to also sound a long whistle at that time to awaken the people in the suburbs to participate in the election.

The district elections for the municipal councilors of this city adopt a universal suffrage system. The general public is not fully aware of the voting order and voting methods, and is prone to errors. The Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has specially formulated voter precautions for participating in district elections for voters to follow.

(1) Voters should arrive at the polling place at the prescribed time and wait in line in the order of arrival, and must not rush to be first.

(2) Voters should abide by order and follow the guidance of the election officials when voting.

(1) After entering, voters should first go to the document verification office to submit and read the documents, and sign the voter registration list.

(2) After signing, go to the ballot receiving office to collect the ballot.

(3) Go to the ballot writing area to fill out the ballot. When writing the ballot, pay attention to the following two points:

### Save Guangxi: 300 Li of No Man's Land on the Guibei Highway, 13 Million People Crying for Food

— A special airmail dispatch of the day, sent by our special correspondent Liang Xiaozhong

As I pick up my pen, I cannot help but feel a pang of sadness. With tears in my eyes, I want my compatriots to also see this human hell that is Guangxi Province!

The disaster in Guangxi, when no one mentions it, seems like a calm curtain. Once it is lifted, inside are refugees struggling for their last breath, mixed in piles of corpses, crying to the heavens and dying with resentment. Along the 300 kilometers of highway from Quan County to Lingchuan in northern Guangxi, there is no trace of human life. On the plateau from Yishan to Xiuren, the death rate is extremely high. Who could see it without shedding tears or hear of it without feeling heartbroken? Save us! Save the lives of millions! What internal war are you fighting? What benevolence and righteousness are you pretending? Let the government use military funds to save the innocent people who should not die! God!

More Than a Year of Major Battles, Civilian Food Completely Plundered

This is how the great famine came about: During the occupation, this was a military stronghold for major battles, so the enemy often had one or two divisions stationed here for more than a year. Civilian food was completely plundered. In addition, the heroic resistance of the self-defense forces increased the enemy's hatred, so they plundered everything down to the last blade of grass. By the time of the counter-offensive, the large army entered Guangxi and gathered in northern Guangxi. The logistical supply was enormous, coupled with the back-and-forth battles, the terrible drought, and the epidemic, so when the province was liberated, northern Guangxi was completely devastated.

Making Battered Cakes from Bran and Husks, Resulting in One Death Per Cake

Refugees who had fled to the mountains returned to their hometowns. From the moment they stepped into the county, they became acquainted with eleven things that even dogs wouldn't eat: fern roots, kudzu roots, Smilax glabra, hay vegetables, scissor vegetables, earth mushrooms, banana roots, palm tree tops, wild taro roots, grass roots, and rice bran. Initially, they dug out the starch in the fern roots to satisfy their hunger. Later, they even used bark to grind into flour and mixed it with bran to make "battered cakes" to fill their stomachs. Alas, this is not food for humans! So, eating one results in one death. This has continued until today, and it is almost over. There are even villages that appear complete on the outside, but inside, the entire village has either died or fled. Villages that had been battlefields are lucky to have even four-tenths of their population remaining. Every day before dawn, the undead form teams and go up the mountain to collect the above-mentioned food, leaving the old, weak, and children at home. It is often heard that by the time they return home with the wild vegetables, several members of the family have already died stiff.

Starving People Lie in Tatters, Eating Straw from Pillows to Survive

Let me cite some more common tragedies. For example, in Xianshui Che Tian Village in Quan County, a man named Wang, unable to eat after exhausting his food supply, lay in tattered cotton wadding, eating straw from his pillow to fill his hunger, but still died. Another incident occurred in Zhuwan Village, Huangsha River. A woman named Huang had two young children. Because they had been hungry for two days and had nothing to eat, they cried and cried for food. The mother, unable to find a solution, made two mud cakes and哄骗了小孩子说，便用泥做成粑粑兩個, saying to the children, "Put them in the fire to bake, and you can eat them when they're cooked." The two children were overjoyed and squatted together by the brazier, waiting for the mud cakes to cook. But their mother hanged herself before the mud cakes were cooked! The mud cakes will never cook! Writing this, I can't hold back my tears any longer!

Petitioning in Guilin, People Surround the Mayor and Plead

The people of Lingchuan County went to Guilin to petition because the mayor of Guilin was from Lingchuan County. So the representatives surrounded Mayor Su all day long, crying and asking him to find a solution. Mayor Su sighed and said to the representatives of Lingchuan, "I know you are suffering, but you should also look at the people of Guilin!" Indeed, three or two corpses are found in the outskirts of Guilin every day. People who have suffered extreme hunger hear that people who died during the Battle of Guilin had a lot of money on them, so they rush to dig up graves and exhume corpses. The threat of the death penalty is too common for them. Any way of dying is the same; it is enough to live one more day.

The Deputy Director Suffers

Xie Guanyi, the deputy director of the relief sub-office, and Wei Jingchu, the director of the joint management office of the provincial government, had inspected the vast disaster area and brought back two "battered cakes" made of kudzu roots and bran. They were green and black in color and had a fishy and pungent smell that made people want to vomit. It is hard to believe that the disaster victims fill their stomachs with these things. Alas, what era is this? Why do our compatriots have to suffer so much? Deputy Director Xie and others had personally tasted a bite of these "battered cakes" but immediately spat them out.

Even Though Land Prices Plummet, Who Wants This Barren Land?

There is also such a tragic thing: because spring has come, fern roots are starting to sprout. Once they sprout, there is nothing left to eat, not even ferns. What do refugees want spring for?

In the disaster area, there were initially some unscrupulous people offering unprecedentedly high-interest loans. For every 10,000 yuan borrowed, two dan of grain had to be paid in interest in addition to the principal at harvest time. Many tenant farmers gritted their teeth and borrowed, preparing to cut flesh to heal sores in the fall. But now, no one is willing to lend even such blood money. So, people with land are selling an acre of land for one dan of grain, or even half a dan. But who wants this barren land?

Two Thousand Tons of Flour, Less Than Six Liang Distributed to Each Person

The call for relief with blood and tears is weakly echoing in all directions. When the deputy director of the relief sub-office arrived in the disaster area, a starving farmer looked痴痴 at the deputy director, pointed to his belly, and tears flowed like rain. Everyone who went with him cried. Then the farmer quietly rested in peace.

A small portion of the 2,000 tons of flour has been shipped to Guilin, but all 13 million people in Guangxi are starving. 2,000 tons is not even six liang per person. Besides the 2,000 tons, there is nothing else. We want to protest to the Relief Administration and beg the Relief Administration for help with tears!

The people of Guangxi have done nothing wrong. They did not destroy the railways, nor did they attack cities. They do not put on a show. On the contrary, they have exerted much effort and suffered much misery in many wars. Today, they have only reaped an unprecedented great death. Everyone's heart is filled with indescribable grievance. To win back people's hearts, do not be biased, and even more so, do not be indifferent. Because the children of Guangxi are also the flesh and blood of China, please reach out and save Guangxi! (April 1)

### Shen Honglie Discusses Zhejiang's Policies: Emphasis on Primary and Secondary Education; Criticizes Students for Knowing Only Theory and Not Application

[Our Hangzhou Special Dispatch] The newly appointed Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Shen Honglie, discussing Zhejiang's policies, emphasized the importance of education, especially primary and secondary education. He stated that national education within education is even more important. He emphasized both quality and quantity; quality and quantity must be given equal importance. The intellectual level of the people of Zhejiang is relatively high. This is the result of the Zhejiang authorities' past emphasis on education and the achievement of their educational efforts. Adult remedial education and social education are equally important and are essential conditions for consolidating grassroots politics. In addition, there is training, because those who come out of school only know theory and do not know how to apply it. Therefore, they must be trained before they can use what they have learned, and learning and application must be connected so that they can contribute practically to society. The importance of training lies here. (Butterfly)

### Zhang Boling Undergoing Medical Treatment in the United States, Will Celebrate His Seventieth Birthday

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th Dispatch] Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University, underwent surgery at a hospital here this afternoon. It is said that the procedure went very well. Zhang originally hoped to arrive here on April 5 to celebrate his seventieth birthday, but due to transportation difficulties, he was unable to arrive as scheduled.

### Issues Regarding the Resumption of Classes by Teachers in Peiping: Actively Seeking a Reasonable Solution; Teachers Insist on Supplementary Salary

[Dahua News Agency, Peiping] The全体请假事发生事 of all teachers in Peiping's municipal primary and secondary schools has lasted for many days. Although the municipal government is seeking a reasonable solution, due to the real financial difficulties of the local government, it must find a way to obtain funds from the central government. Therefore, Director Ying of the Education Bureau reported the situation to Mayor Xiong. The main points of the report were: (1) Teachers really cannot make a living; (2) Peiping's educational funds have historically been subsidized by the central government, which has precedents; (3) Why is the treatment of central government agencies in the same city several times different? (4) Diligent and pure; (5) This is the lowest reasonable demand. Xiong immediately telegraphed the central government accordingly and hoped that the teachers could take a broader view, prioritize education, and resume classes first. A few days ago, Xiong took the opportunity of the municipal administration meeting to invite Director Wu of the Municipal Party Committee and others to attend the discussion of solutions. The results were divided into two methods: symptomatic treatment and fundamental treatment. The symptomatic treatment involves requesting the Good and Save General Administration to distribute a bag of flour to each person first. The fundamental solution is for the municipal government and the Education Bureau to send personnel to the central government for instructions. If necessary, teacher representatives will also participate, requesting three points: (1) Increase the base salary; (2) Equal treatment for public school personnel; (3) Determine Peiping's educational funds, hoping to resume classes as soon as possible. The executive committee of the Teachers' Association stated that if the salaries currently paid by primary and secondary schools are in accordance with central standards, each person should be supplemented with more than 50,000 yuan for February and March. If the authorities can find a way to issue this amount, they can consider resuming classes. For salaries after April, they asked the central government to guarantee that they would be issued in accordance with the promulgated standards. If each person only receives a bag of flour, it is absolutely impossible to resume classes.

### Three Thousand Pictographs, Only Six Hundred Recognized

American Educators Criticize the Japanese

[United States Information Service, St. Louis, 17th Dispatch] Recently, 28 American educators were invited by General MacArthur to examine education in Japan in March. Two of these 28 people were Minister Stanley of the Department of Education and Professor Lian Zhi of Columbia Teachers College.

Wartime Losses

The direct and indirect losses of education and culture in Jiangxi Province during the war amounted to 970 billion yuan. The losses were severe. Now, when rehabilitation is underway and national education is being promoted, the repair and equipment of primary school buildings are particularly urgent. The Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has approved an allocation of 200 billion yuan for the construction of more than 200 primary school buildings in various parts of Jiangxi Province and the addition of desks and chairs, with funds allocated in three phases.

Education at All Levels

In Jiangxi Province, there were more than 18,000 primary schools before the war. Now there are more than 19,000 schools, and the number of students has increased from 860,000 to more than 1.1 million. There were 73 secondary, normal, and vocational schools before the war, with more than 15,000 students. Now there are 245 schools, with more than 64,000 students. Most of the independent mass schools in "Social Education" before the war have now been changed to affiliates of the National Schools' Ministry of People's Education. There are now 5,934 purely social education institutions and mass schools. There were three colleges and universities before the war, which has now increased to five. The province has also specially appropriated 100 million yuan as a study fund, preparing to send students to study in Europe and the United States this year.

Discussion Opinions

The schools in Jiangxi Province were moved inland and changed to national schools. There are now four schools that have returned to the provincial level.

[Our City News] The National Textbook Joint Supply Office stated that as transportation to various recovered areas is gradually restored, the demand for books for the autumn semester of this year is huge, and it is urgent to rush to print and transport them to reduce the severe shortage of national books.

### Sichuan University: Growing Up in the War of Resistance

— Jing Ming

Before the War of Resistance, the situation in Sichuan's education sector was as chaotic as Sichuan's political situation. Apart from the West China University, founded by the church, higher education in Sichuan really could not be said to have any standing in the domestic education scene. However, we must know that Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," has a population of over sixty million, with abundant agricultural products and mineral resources, making it our bulwark against imperialist aggression. Under the heavy pressure of Japanese aggression, the National Government recognized that aggression could not be stopped without national defense construction, and there could be no national defense without the construction of the Southwest. Thus, in the 23rd year, the Staff Corps entered Sichuan, and there was officer training in Emei. Sichuan University had already been formed at this time through the merger of Normal University, Chengdu University, Public Sichuan University, and the Chinese Academy. It was established in 1931, with Mr. Wang Zhaorong as the president at the time. President Wang maintained the university's affairs during the defense zone era, and although he put in a lot of effort, the university's foundation was still very fragile and could not withstand any storms. The year after the Staff Corps entered Sichuan, the situation in Sichuan was unified under the leadership of Liu Fucheng. The central government decided to carry out development, building Sichuan into the final base for national defense. To cooperate with this construction, the urgent need for talent gave Sichuan University an opportunity to develop. In August of that year, President Wang resigned, and the central government appointed Mr. Ren Hongjun, a renowned domestic educator, to succeed him, and also merged the Sichuan Provincial College of Education into Sichuan University. President Ren can be said to be the second great contributor to Sichuan University. With foresight, he recognized that the Imperial City was located in the city center, which was not suitable for running a school. He reached an agreement with the Sichuan Provincial Government to give the Imperial City campus to the provincial government, which in turn allocated 2,000 mu of land near Wangjianglou to Sichuan University in exchange as a new campus. This plan received strong support from the central government, which further allocated 2.63 million national currency as a special fund for the construction of new school buildings, and appointed Weng Wenhao, Zhou Yichun, Tingfu, Li Ji, and Ren Hongjun to form the Construction Committee.

Anyone who has been to Chengdu knows that Wangjianglou is a scenic area in Chengdu. The Jinjiang River encloses this area into a semi-circular shape. Standing on the magnificent and sturdy Jiuyan Bridge, one can see sailboats like , willow trees lining the road, and green trees and white clouds reflecting each other. There are relics of the famous Tang Dynasty courtesan , and the Wangjianglou is covered with glazed tiles. According to local historians, Zhang Xianzhong buried hundreds of millions of taels of silver in the Zhuojin River during his rebellion in Sichuan.

The first phase of the school building project started in July 1937, just before the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Magnificent buildings were built one after another amidst the nationwide artillery fire. Unfortunately, shortly after the construction of the school buildings began, President Ren resigned for some reason. Mr. Zhang Yi acted as the agent for school affairs until Mr. Cheng Tianfang was sent by the central government to take over in the winter of 1938. By the spring of 1939, prices began to rise, and the construction project was invisibly brought to a standstill. In addition, the bombing range of enemy planes had penetrated deep into Chengdu. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, President Cheng decided to move the school to Emei in the summer of that year. At this time, the completed school buildings included a library building, a mathematics and physics building, a chemistry building, one completed student dormitory building, one foundation laid, and five exquisite faculty residences, less than one-fifth of the original construction plan.

The ending price was slightly lower than yesterday's by 300 to 500 yuan. Bean cake was the same. Farmers were firm at noon, and prices rose by 100 yuan. Bran was flat. Soybeans also rose by 500 to 600 yuan. Raw peanuts were slightly soft, and corn was scarce, adding 500 yuan. According to information from the rice market, yesterday, the city received over 6,000 shi of six types of rice, including white梗. The types and shi numbers are as follows: White粳3,642 shi, Du秈930 shi, Sheep油300 shi, Early rice 944 shi, 薄rice 969 shi, White元20 shi. Also, it is reported that the price of grain in Shanghai has risen by about 8,000 yuan per market stone in recent days. The special commissioner's office of the grain administration sent special commissioners to the rice and grain market to investigate the truth. It is claimed that the source of grain has not decreased in recent days. The main reason for this rebound is that speculators, seeing that there is no opportunity to enter the gold and silver market, have mostly turned to grain greed, believing that when grain is released, grain merchants will surely rush to buy, so they compete to buy in团 and sell at a high profit. It is heard that after reporting to the department, the grain administration has consulted with the authorities　to severely punish this type of speculation. In summary, since the 12th of this month, there has been no significant change in the source of rice and grain, but the price of grain has actually risen by as much as 30%. It is very obvious that this is投机捣乱. The daily grain price and the number of rice arrivals for the week from the 12th to the 18th are listed below: (Rice price is based on white粳)

Date Rice Price Rice Arrivals (Shi)

12 26,000 8,673

13 27,000 6,402

15 29,000 8,344

16 29,500 5,716

17 33,000 6,384

18 33,500 6,322

Also, it is reported that Mayor　 convened a meeting of relevant parties yesterday to discuss ways to suppress rice prices and crack down on speculation. It is heard that concrete decisions have been made on both治本and治標, and a strict investigation has been conducted on whether rice merchants who have obtained loans have gone to production areas to purchase. At the same time, in order to facilitate transportation, the two railway bureaus have been negotiated to allocate篷車specifically for the purpose of transporting rice. A monitoring method will be adopted for rice market transactions. If outsiders or中人are found to be raising prices or hoarding, they will be severely punished. The Social Affairs Bureau also held a meeting at 3 pm yesterday (the 19th) at the bureau's conference room, convened by Director Wu Kaixian, with sixteen rice merchants introduced by the American Chamber of Commerce, including Wan Chang Wan　Lin, Xin Chang Zhu Yongming, San Tai Wu Rongsheng, Yong Shun　Yisheng, Tong Cheng Fu Changyu, Xie Daheng Feng Yongsheng, Qian 鉬 Yu Yu Liangji, and the loan election merchants introduced by the Bean and Rice Industry Association, including Heng Tai Feng Zhang Chao, Wan Chang Zhai Yang Shunyu, Xie Chang Tai Zhu Shilu, Jiangbei Company Xing　Wen, Hui Feng Company Wang Wangzhen, Changjiang Company Wang Xunzhi, Tong Yi Company Lu　Xun, Guangye Company Jin Zhifeng, and Wang Daren, acting special commissioner of the Grain Administration Special Commissioner's Office, and Ren Xingya, director of the coordination department, were also present to discuss emergency measures and resolutions, both治本and治標, and actively治本. According to the decision of the first batch of loan grain merchants,分　解运to the northern帮rice-producing areas of Changzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, etc., and the southern帮Songjiang　　Zhujiabo　, etc., to enrich the people's food supply, and淸　治標 to青驢米市塲, who use illegal "kicking the rice ball" style sales, and pay attention to grain merchants四业中引　, and attract游资from outsiders to engage in rice and grain speculation.

### Asphalt Sales Sluggish: 客货 Ask Prices Often Do Not Follow Official Market

Asphalt has not seen whole transactions for two weeks. The sluggishness of the market can be imagined, because the candle sales market is now in the off-season, and soap production is also delayed due to the unpredictable weather. Manufacturers are観望and rarely have buying intent. However,客货continues to arrive. The negotiated prices of both parties do not match. Although there are many who wait for the time to sell, there are also quite a few who are eager to sell, so even if there are prices offered recently, they do not follow the official market. The selling prices of each line have gradually decreased, with Heben at 56,000 yuan, Neiping at 47,000 to 48,000 yuan, Duzhu at 40,000 yuan, and Lanyou at 37,000 yuan.

### South China Overseas Chinese Company Procures: Large Quantities of Industrial Raw Materials

Shanghai South China Overseas Chinese Co., Ltd. was founded in 1931 with investment from overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Since the victory, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, it has expanded its organization and established branches in Singapore, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Tianjin, Taiwan, etc., with strong賽本, specializing in trade with European and American countries and the South Pacific Islands. Recently, it has received a large number of various major industrial raw materials and food types from the United States and Nanyang. It spares no effort to promote domestic North-South goods abroad. The company has a huge task of facilitating trade between domestic and overseas markets.

### Medium Sand White Tightens

Yesterday's sugar market saw a shortage of medium sand white spot goods, so the price continued to tighten. The association's drawing price was initially 48,000 yuan, then slightly fluctuated, eventually reaching 50,000 yuan, rising by 4,000 yuan. A small amount of客货 initially opened at 46,000 yuan, and later also reached 49,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. Other goods were also tightened.

### New Tea Market Firm: Old Tea Still Has No Buyers

After inspecting four or five batches of new Longjing tea, the arrivals from the Wenhang production areas are still coming in an endless stream. However, the sellers are unwilling to easily part with their goods, so the underlying market is strongly supported. For old tea花色, some sellers are eager for cash and are still loosening their grip, while buyers are still looking down on the future of selling prices. Furthermore, due to the sluggish digestion in Tianjin and other places, their appetite is even worse. The situation is in a state of more spitting and less absorbing, with no improvement to speak of. Top Qimen and other teas are even fatigued with no buyers.

### United Nations to Convene: World Food Conference

Food panic is prevalent in Europe and Asia.

It is reported that our government has received the notification and will send Yang Xizhi, special commissioner of the Executive Yuan, to represent our country in attending the conference.

### Fake Currency Registration Problem

Special Commissioner Cables Department for Instructions: Difficult to Start on Monday

Regarding the problem of registering fake currencies after the deadline for exchange, the Central Bank of China's Issuance Bureau originally intended to start handling this matter on下呈期一, with registration at various locations. Now it is learned that this matter will be temporarily suspended because the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance is still　requesting the Ministry of Finance to review the following four issues, the crux of which is: (1) The number of exchanges in the past is very close to the total amount of发行发行by the fake "Central Reserve Bank of China"; (2) For one type of fake currency, such as 5,000 yuan or 1,000 yuan, the number of exchanges often exceeds the total number of发行发行; (3) Although the Ministry of Finance cabled instructions on the method of registering fake currencies, there are only about ten days left before the end of the month, and it is difficult to complete the registration thoroughly; (4) Most of the fake currencies that have not yet been exchanged in various places are in remote rural areas, and if the exchange institutions are limited to four banks and two bureaus, the villagers will inevitably lose money on transportation costs in order to register, and holders of small amounts of僑券will feel that it is not worth the loss. In summary, if it is desired to register and exchange all of the fake currencies, the only feasible way is to not set a deadline and exchange them forever. The Special Commissioner's Office is currently submitting this matter to the Ministry for review, and it will be handled in accordance with the instructions as soon as a reply is received.

### Economic Briefs

According to Jianghan Customs news, a large batch of tung oil was exported from the mainland for the first time. It has been shipped from Xiangxi to Hankou and then transferred to Shanghai for export to the United States.

Hong Kong Airlines News: The trade relationship between Hong Kong and Fujian has always been close, and there are many merchants from Fujian Province traveling to Hong Kong. Therefore, the amount of remittances from Hong Kong to Fujian by overseas Chinese is considerable. According to estimates by relevant parties, the daily remittances from Hong Kong to Fujian by overseas Chinese are about 50 million to 100 million national currency.

### Diamonds: The United States Has a Strong Appetite

[Reuters London 19th] According to The Times, the diamond market may be entering a new stage. Inventories have been cleared, and future sales will depend solely on new goods. Also, due to a shortage of skilled workers, the price of fine diamonds has increased more than that of rough gems. At the same time, the price increase of small diamonds is even more significant. Since the diamond industry in Antwerp and Amsterdam resumed operations at the beginning of last year, the number of diamond workers worldwide has more than doubled. Since October of last year, the average production volume of fine diamonds has exceeded a value of one million pounds and is continuing to increase. The majority of processed gems produced worldwide are shipped to the United States, where appetite remains strong. However, due to abundant supply, especially small diamonds, prices are tending to fall. As a result, the appetite for fine diamonds may stagnate. At the same time, the United States has abundant inventories of rough gems, and the quantity of purchases for组gems will inevitably decrease accordingly.

### Reading "A New Theory of the Chinese Nation"

— Mu Lei

Publisher: The Commercial Press Author: Zang Bojing

The Chinese nation, after eight years of arduous struggle, has defeated the leading aggressor in East Asia and honorably ranks among the world's five great powers. Through this long-term resistance, the Chinese nation has experienced countless hardships, but ultimately achieved the fruits of final victory. The resilience and greatness of the Chinese nation have long been evident to the world. Every Chinese son and daughter, filled with joy, feels that their national spirit is truly precious.

Today, many citizens hope to clearly understand the greatness of their own national character and to comprehend the characteristics of their own nationality. However, specialized books discussing national issues are still scarce. Recently, I spent two evenings reading Zang Bojing's "A New Theory of the Chinese Nation," and I deeply feel that this book is urgently needed at this time. This is a popular book discussing the essential issues of the Chinese nation. Every citizen who hopes to have a correct understanding of this important issue, which is closely related to national issues, should read it.

This book takes a biological perspective and incorporates various modern thoughts, national philosophy, and educational philosophy as its basis. Although, as the author says, it is not a creation or an invention, the thorough collection of materials and the unique elaboration of national issues show the author's efforts. In this book, the author systematically explains why the Chinese nation suffered this serious foreign invasion, from the weaknesses of the nation to the latent great national spirit, which is the main factor for the victory of the war of resistance, and determines the future path of the Chinese nation's revival.

Reading the first chapter, "Introduction," makes us understand that this Sino-Japanese War is the largest, longest, and most extensive foreign invasion war in the five-thousand-year history of our Chinese nation. What distinguishes it from past foreign wars is that the foreign races that invaded in the past were culturally inferior to us, and over time, they were gradually assimilated by our country. However, this time, the strong enemy Japan has more developed education and culture than us, more abundant military equipment, and is cunning and insidious, using all means. To defeat them, we must first restore national self-confidence, seek regeneration through our own efforts, and not only hope for the prosperity and revival of China, but also share the responsibility of building a new world in the future. The author emphasizes that this war is a positive turning point for our country, encouraging the people to strive for strength and revive what has declined. It also explains from historical examples that national character is by no means immutable. Our nation certainly has its greatness, and as long as it can transform the weaknesses of national character, it can occupy a pivotal position in the large group war against aggression.

Chapter Two, "The Meaning of Nation," explains that the fate of the nation determines the fate of the individual, and also describes the relationship between nation and race, language, land, country, and history. All ethnic groups belonging to the Chinese nation must uphold the principle of mutual dependence, unite in spirit, defend the independence of the nation, and promote and maintain excellent national traditions, support the leader who led the war of resistance, and inspire the national spirit of the workers.

Chapter Three, "The Formation of a Nation," discusses the formation of personal character, the formation of national character, and the quality and quantity of the nation, believing that the quality of a nation's talents does affect its rise and fall, but excellence without numbers is also a flaw, which is a general discussion. In Chapter Four, "The Formation of the Chinese Nation," it is necessary to further describe the inheritance of the Chinese nation from the perspective of eugenics, and to analyze the rich natural resources of the Chinese nation from the natural environment and the man-made environment, but unfortunately, scientific methods have not been used to fully utilize them. Finally, it also talks about the current decline of the Chinese nation, and the result of poor education and the decline of national character, and believes that only by vigorously implementing national education can the Chinese nation be revived.

Then, in Chapter Five, "The National Character of the Chinese Nation," it explains the relationship between national destiny and national character, and the formation of national character. It also speaks in detail about the characteristics of the Chinese nation. The author quotes the American missionary Arthur Smith's analysis of fifteen points of our national character: (1) Chinese people who are easy to live and difficult to die. (2) Chinese people without nerves. (3) Chinese people with too much patience. (4) Chinese people who do not seek accuracy. (5) Chinese people who do not compete for every inch of time. (6) Industrious Chinese people. (7) Frugal Chinese people. (8) Chinese people who are content and happy. (9) Selfish and self-interested Chinese people. (10) Chinese people without compassion. (11) Chinese people who do not keep their word. (12) Chinese people who deceive each other. (13) Chinese people who love face. (14) Evasive Chinese people. (15) Polite Chinese people. This observation is purely the subjective view of foreigners, and is written by comparing the character of our people with that of foreigners, especially Americans, and at most, it can show the obvious differences in the character of our people and Americans. We must adopt the attitude of learning from others' strengths to make up for our weaknesses. The author also proposes the point of spiritual transformation, hoping that the social pioneers who change customs and habits will rise up and advocate it.

In order to emphasize the reform of the nation, the author takes the example of the Franco-Prussian War, and in Chapter Six, "How to Reform National Character," discusses it in detail, explaining the fact that Fichte's fourteen public speeches awakened the national spirit and self-confidence of all Germans, and compares it with this Sino-Japanese War, to boost our entire nation's confidence in the victory of the war of resistance, which is a very powerful chapter.

The author believes that strengthening national consciousness and promoting national spirit must start from education. The education of a country determines the rise and fall of a nation. The author proposes three stages of national spirit development: the first stage is formed by elements such as race, environment, and population, which is the national character of ancient times. The second stage is the reaction of politics, religious thought, and literature created by the nation to the nation itself, which creates a national character, and the national character of modern times mostly belongs to this stage. The third stage is to use the ideal of freedom, free choice, and establish an education system suitable for the survival of the nation within the social organization, and then create an ideal national character, national spirit, and integrity based on the education system, which is the goal that all countries in the modern world are moving towards. Regarding these issues, the author specially lists a chapter on "The Chinese Nation and New Education" to elaborate on the theory of national education. Education cannot transcend time and space and be built on abstract theory, but must take into account the needs of the nation and the country. The author also reviews the shortcomings of our past education, and expresses his opinions on political education, personality education, military education, normal school education, and genius education. One section is "National Revival and Women's Education," and the points raised are extremely pertinent. From the relationship between women and national survival, the types of women in various countries around the world, and the source of the diseases of new women in our country, it indicates the awakening that women in our country should have in the future.

When writing this book, the enemy was launching its final violent attack, because it was on the eve of surrender, and when it was at the end of its rope, it did not hesitate to use its full strength to launch an offensive in an attempt to make a last-ditch effort. The author then took the real-world examples in Chapter Eight, "The Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Nation," to analyze the political and military situation of the authorities, and also touched on factors such as education and construction that could affect the war situation. The author believes that the greatest impact of this war on the nature of the nation is two: (1) National self-renewal. (2) A great mixture of national cultures. There is also a discussion of the improvement of the international status of the Chinese nation due to the war. From the Sino-Japanese War, it goes on to discuss the contribution of the Chinese nation to this world war. The Chinese nation has made indelible achievements for all mankind in this world war. In Chapter Nine, "The Chinese Nation and the World War," the author discusses in detail the power exerted by the Chinese nation from September 18th to the war against aggression, and finally states the understanding and efforts that the Chinese nation should have towards the world war. One section talks about the Three Principles of the People and the World Federation, explaining the world view of the Three Principles of the People and its great contribution to the future of world peace. The realization of the world of great harmony is the completion of the highest ideal of the Three Principles of the People.

Finally, in Chapter Ten, "Conclusion," it summarizes that the Chinese nation should grasp history, carry it forward, and use combat, self-confidence, and survival to wash away the great shame and humiliation of the nation, and then seek the completion of the world federal organization. The author recognizes that although there are many ways to revive the nation, it is necessary to practice it personally and strive from practice, so he loudly calls: "Practice first!"

"A New Theory of the Chinese Nation" is a new book that has been published not long ago, but when the manuscript was completed, the Japanese army had not yet surrendered, so it especially emphasized stimulating national self-confidence and promoting national spirit, with the purpose of strengthening the determination of the entire nation to strive for final victory. Now that the entire nation's war of resistance has achieved final victory, this book still has its value. In the process of nation-building, we also need to have a deep understanding of our own nation. I hope that readers can get powerful enlightenment about their own nation from this book.

Reading one foot is not as good as walking one inch. Being able to walk is being able to read. — Cheng Yi Chuan

When reading a book, be sure to summarize its words and seek the author's meaning. — Zhang Hong

Scholars reading books must put their minds to where it is tasteless. When doubts arise together, even forgetting sleep and food, then they can "advance suddenly." Therefore, I sigh that the two words "advance suddenly" are used best. It must be like this. If you only advance a little, or advance or retreat, as if existing or as if not, it will not help. It is like using soldiers to kill each other, fighting for some small territory, ten or twenty miles, it will not help. It must be a big fight to win well. The key to learning is also like this.

Now people read the text on one side and think about external matters on the other side, it is just a waste of effort. It is better to put down the text, wait until the mind is quiet, and then look at it. — Zhu Xi

### About "Collection of Chinese Famous Painters"

— Wen Zhaotong

The several volumes of "Collection of Chinese Famous Painters" written in the year before the victory of the War of Resistance have recently been printed by the World Bookstore into three types: "Six Great Painters of the Early Qing Dynasty," "Four Great Painters of the Late Yuan Dynasty," and "Two Great Painters of the Jin and Tang Dynasties," and the new books have already arrived, which makes me feel infinitely gratified.

When I started writing this book, it was the summer vacation of the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934). At first, I just wanted to make a critical biography and chronology of the famous painter Wang Shigu from my hometown. Because during the War of Resistance, the research and promotion of local cultural relics could indirectly enhance national consciousness. However, in some ways, research and exploration of ancient culture is not necessarily an unprogressive escape from reality.

What are the lives and art of the great painters in history like? What are the inheritance, transmission, or influence of their styles? In many Chinese art history or painting history books, we are only given a rough outline. However, since they are called masters of a generation, how can their lives and art be so brief? …This idea has been lingering in my mind for a long time. The art system occupies an extremely important part. And it is really necessary to sort out the historical sites and art studies of the representative writers in a system. So after I completed "Wang Shigu," with the encouragement and sponsorship of friends, I continued to write the critical biographies and chronologies of fifteen masters of the early Qing Dynasty, the Ming Dynasty, the late Yuan Dynasty, and the Jin and Tang Dynasties.

The most difficult thing in studying Chinese painters is the problem of their birth and death years. For example, in Yuan Kaizhi's "Biography of Literary Garden in the Book of Jin," there is only "Died in office at the age of sixty-two." What year was he born? What year did he die? It became a problem. Another example is Huang Gongwang, Li Rihua said of him: "Over ninety years old, with blue eyes and red cheeks, …believing him to have become an immortal." Mei Shaoshu said: "Eighty-six years old, whereabouts unknown." Wang Chideng said: "Still alive during the Hongwu reign (1368–1398)." Furthermore, for Wang Meng, Qiu Ying, and other families, they did not write the date on their surviving works at all, and the years of birth and death are even more unclear.

The second difficulty is the lack of surviving works, and the evaluation of the art of each family can only rely on later generations' writings on painting. However, these writings, such as "Records of Famous Paintings of All Dynasties," "Illustrated Records of Paintings and Calligraphy," "Xuanhe Painting Catalogue," "National Dynasty Painting Records," etc., are very simple.

I did not stop working because of the difficulties. On the contrary, I gained an understanding of the doubts about the years of birth and death from circumstantial evidence, and after the commentary on the life deeds, I clearly listed the individual chronologies. Although there are bound to be errors in it, it can indeed unfold the life trajectory of each master, and at least we can get a possibly correct historical concept from it.

Regarding the discussion of the artistic styles of each family, my central theory still does not deviate from the established saying of "valuing the South and belittling the North." Because, literati art is the art of the scholar-official class, then the scholar-official art theories of Mo Yunqing, Dong Qichang and others are still applicable after all. As far as possible, I tried to avoid subjective, narrow, and extreme criticisms, and adopted objective and eclectic statements.

Artistic propositions and theories are often the center of a writer's style, so I introduced as much as possible a writer's painting theory and poetry as possible to help understand the writer's artistic style.

I hope that friends who read these books of mine will understand the difficulties in my writing, point out the places that should be revised, and correct them, so that they can reach a beautiful and good realm.
