### Government Organization Principles Agreed Upon; Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to be Held Next Month; Zhou Enlai Returned to Yan'an Yesterday to Report

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 27th] Most of the agreements for the Political Consultative Conference have been reached. The Government Organization Group and the National Assembly Group are discussing the next steps, such as the selection of ministers. It is generally speculated that since the major principles have been resolved, the secondary issues can also be completed smoothly. Regarding the issue of the old representatives of the National Assembly, as long as the government provides guarantees regarding the amendment of the draft constitution and other important matters, an agreement can be reached. As for the reorganization of the government, because it is still in the period of political tutelage, the government will hold the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in February, and implement it after it is passed in the plenary session. According to Wu Guozhen, the publication law will also be revised starting on February 1st.

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 27th] Zhou Enlai, the CCP representative attending the Political Consultative Conference, flew back to Yan'an at 9:00 AM on the 27th and will return to Chongqing on the afternoon of the 28th to attend the closing ceremony on the 29th. It is understood that Mr. Zhou returned to Yan'an to report on the progress of the Consultative Conference, and to seek instructions on the issues of the reorganization of the CCP army and the cessation of military conflict, which were discussed by the Military Affairs Three-Person Group.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The Government Organization Group and the National Assembly Group of the Political Consultative Conference did not hold meetings today and are scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 28th to continue consultations.

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Although the representatives of the Democratic League of the Political Consultative Conference temporarily withdrew, it was announced today that an inland cabinet system is currently planned for the government organization case, allowing participation from all parties and factions. With this news, there is renewed hope for a satisfactory conclusion to the conference. It has been decided that the new Chinese constitution will stipulate a two-chamber cabinet system, rather than a presidential system. The Political Consultative Conference has made sufficient progress, leading observers to believe that while a true coalition government will only be established after the National Assembly formulates the constitution and holds general elections, a provisional government will soon be organized with the participation of all parties and factions.

[United Press, Yan'an, 27th] CCP Commander-in-Chief Zhu De told reporters today that there was peace on all front lines, and neither the KMT nor the CCP armies had launched attacks.

### Starting Next Month, Every Sunday Morning, National Air Raid Drills Will Be Conducted; So That Our Military and People May Be Vigilant and Work Hard to Build the Nation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] In our country's War of Resistance against Japan, we relied on the unity of the military and the people and the cooperation of allied nations to achieve today's final victory. In order not to forget the suffering, displacement, and tragic sacrifices of wartime, the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan have specially stipulated three methods for issuing air raid alarms, and have ordered all provinces and cities across the country to uniformly implement them every Sunday morning at 9:00 AM starting in February of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], so that our military and people may be vigilant and work hard to build the great cause of national reconstruction. The methods for issuing air raid alarms are recorded as follows: (1) Electric and hand-cranked air raid sirens, factory-owned steam whistles, etc., shall sound a long tone for three minutes, and alarms and gongs shall be struck slowly for three minutes. Existing alarms and gongs should be utilized. (2) All provinces, cities, counties, townships, and towns that have the above-mentioned tools can issue alarms at the same time. If townships and towns do not have air raid alarm equipment, they should prepare alarms or gongs to implement this. (3) The issuance time shall be based on the time of the Central Broadcasting Station.

### Police Search Representatives' Residences; Democratic League Withdraws from Conference

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] The subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference were originally scheduled to meet today to discuss the National Assembly and the reorganization of the government, but were temporarily canceled due to the withdrawal of the Democratic League from the conference. The withdrawal of the Democratic League was a protest against the illegal search of the residences of some members of the party by the police. It also expressed dissatisfaction with the central government's failure to fulfill the four promises announced on the tenth of this month: to guarantee the right to bodily integrity, to grant legal rights to political parties, to support local autonomous governments, and to release purely political prisoners. According to Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji: The party has submitted a written protest to Chairman Chiang last night and is awaiting a reply. If a satisfactory guarantee can be obtained regarding the illegal search of party members' residences by the police, and if Chairman Chiang can determine a date to explain his position on the four promises, then the Democratic League can immediately cease its withdrawal. Government representative Zhang Qun visited the Democratic League headquarters this morning, presumably to prevent its withdrawal, but found no one inside. At the same time, it is generally felt here that if the issue of withdrawal cannot be resolved immediately, the consultative conference, originally scheduled to close on the 29th, may need to extend its session.

[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Democratic League representative Luo Longji made explosive remarks at the Political Consultative Conference today. He stated that the residence of Democratic League representative Huang Yanpei was actually searched by the police. If the government fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for this matter, the Democratic League will withdraw from the Political Consultative Conference. According to Luo Longji, CCP representative Zhou Enlai delivered a speech this morning demanding that the government provide full protection to all representatives. The Chongqing CCP office was also visited by the police under the pretext of investigating household registrations. The residences of Shi Liang and Zhang Shenfu were also visited by the police. As for the results of the discussions of the various subcommittees, Luo said that it has been agreed that future orders issued by the President must be approved by the State Council. The President has no veto power over resolutions passed by a three-fifths majority of the State Council. Regarding this, the KMT originally requested a two-thirds majority. The number of State Council members is set at forty, with the KMT occupying half and other parties and factions occupying half. Zhou Enlai has obtained Yan'an's approval for this reorganization plan. How to organize the National Assembly has not yet been resolved.

### Harriman Quietly Arrives in Chongqing; To Meet with Chairman Chiang and Marshall

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] It is not uncommon for famous foreign figures to arrive quietly in Chongqing to avoid attracting attention, but U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman inadvertently completed this feat today. Harriman arrived at the Chongqing airport on his way back to the United States from Moscow, 24 hours earlier than scheduled, resulting in no one at the airport to greet him. However, this situation was immediately remedied. After Mr. Harriman spoke to Ambassador Marshall's residence, a servant rushed to the airport. At the same time, Chairman Chiang, upon hearing the news, temporarily put aside other matters to receive Mr. Harriman. Marshall's original plans were also changed, and the Chairman sent someone to invite him to dinner and to stay overnight at the Chairman's residence. Marshall drove to the residence to meet with Mr. Harriman. The three spoke together. Mr. Harriman is scheduled to leave Chongqing on the morning of the 29th and will travel to Korea and Japan before returning to the United States.

[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman, returning to the United States from the Soviet Union, flew to Chongqing this afternoon and stayed overnight at Chairman Chiang's summer villa, fifteen miles outside the city. US Special Envoy to China General Marshall is scheduled to dine with Mr. Harriman and plans to stay overnight there. No news has been released about whether Mr. Harriman has any mission during his stay in Chongqing and his meeting with Chairman Chiang.

### Hurley Accuses Gauss of Obstructing US Foreign Policy

[United Press, Baltimore, 27th] Former US Ambassador to China Major General Hurley, who served from November 1944 to November 27, 1945, had criticized State Department diplomats for undermining US Far East foreign policy before his resignation. He repeated his previous remarks in a speech to the Maryland Bar Association tonight, and specifically pointed out that his predecessor as US Ambassador to China, Gauss, had predicted that the National Government led by Chairman Chiang would collapse in 1944, accusing Gauss of being pro-communist and anti-Chiang, and obstructing US foreign policy. Hurley reiterated his resignation statement, saying that all the facts have not yet been made public. Gauss commented in Washington that Hurley's statement was incorrect and that he did not wish to say more at this time.

### Army Assault Brigade Performs Parachute Show; Breaking Months of Silence at Kunming Airport

[From Our Kunming Correspondent, 26th] Today, the first-ever Chinese paratrooper combat parachute show, a groundbreaking event in the history of China's construction of a new army, was held at Kunming Airport. Although the Kunming citizens are not used to getting up early, by around 9:00 AM, the Wujiaba Airport had more than a thousand spectators. Cars and carriages shuttled back and forth on the sidewalks, enlivening the large airport that had been silent for months. In the specially set up guest seats in the field, the first to arrive was General Chennault, followed by Commander-in-Chief Huo Kuizhang, Principal Mei Yiqi, Commander Yan Yucong, and hundreds of others. Reporters from Kunming newspapers were also invited to sit in. Among the most noteworthy, besides the Kong sisters, were Commander Ma Shigong, who personally served as a greeter, and Deputy Commander Zhang Xuzi, who took the stage to perform, collaborating quite well.

Major Qian Spot Landing

The Assault Brigade performed three subjects today, the first being spot landing. Controlling the parachute in the air at 2,000 feet, trying to make it fall within a fixed point, is not an easy task. The first parachutist at the time was Major Qian Mingnian, a 21-year-old Beiping youth. After graduating from the artillery department of the 17th class of the military academy, he was selected by the Military Training Department to go to the United States, where he entered the Parachute School in Georgia for training. In September of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he returned to China after completing his studies and is now the director of the parachute training department of the team. It is said that he was the first person in China to receive parachute training in the United States, and he performed very well at school, so he won praise from the audience in today's performance. After he landed, his 42-year-old mother went to support and embrace him, and kissed his dusty cheeks wildly for half a minute, which amazed the audience. The second parachutist was a general who participated temporarily. He had not sought his wife's consent beforehand. After he landed, she followed the audience and rushed to greet him. Upon closer inspection, it was her husband, former Commander Zhang. Surprised, she replied with comforting smiles. According to Mr. Zhang, this parachute performance was a maiden work. Before leaving the plane, he had hesitated for half a second. When he first opened the parachute, his mind was quite blurred, and it took about a minute to regain consciousness, so he was able to control the speed freely and land within the target circle.

Wonderful Combat Parachute

Following was delayed parachute opening, free-falling from 6,000 feet in the air until the parachute was opened below 1,500 feet. It took about three minutes from leaving the cloud to landing. The performer this time was Captain Zhu Zongquan, a student in the Department of Geology at Southwest Associated University. He initially served as an interpreter for the Assault Brigade, then received parachute training in the brigade, and became an instructor after graduation. After he finished parachuting, the Kong sisters, nieces of a certain important official, expressed their admiration, Principal Mei Yiqi nodded and smiled, and General Chennault shook his hand tightly and praised him endlessly. After this subject was performed, it was the turn of the most exciting paratrooper platoon combat parachute jump. The participants were 24 officers and soldiers of the parachute training department. Personnel and weapons landed at a low altitude of 800 feet. Within fifteen minutes, they assembled into a combat formation and used rocket launchers, flamethrowers, etc. to launch live ammunition attacks on assumed targets. The American soldiers who watched the performance praised and cheered because their marksmanship was good.

General Chennault's Comments

At 11:50 AM, after the performance was over, Commander Ma of the team summoned the officers and soldiers who had returned from the exercise to ask General Chennault for his comments. Chen briefly said: "I was very interested in this visit and exercise. China had a plan to train paratroopers two years ago, but at that time, I felt that various equipment was lacking. Later, thanks to everyone's strong struggle, there are today's results. Today's performance was fast and disciplined, which proves that your usual training is very good. Afterwards, under the command of Commander Ma, we will work hard and move forward, and the future will be boundless." After the comments, Major Qian's mother distributed slices of oranges to comfort the paratroopers, which can be called a small scene of entertainment.

### Termination of Dismantling the Jiangnan Railway

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] The transportation authorities had previously decided to dismantle the Jiangnan Railway section by section to expedite repairs on the Jinpu Railway. Sixty miles of steel rails between Nanjing and Dangtu have already been removed. It is now learned that the steel rails of the Jiangnan Railway are not suitable for the Jinpu Railway, and other solutions have been found for the Jinpu Railway's steel rails. Therefore, the dismantling of the Jiangnan Railway has been suspended as of today.

### Corrupt Officials in Guangxi Province Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 26th] Leng Tikun, the former head of the East Suburb District and commander of the Self-Defense Force in Guilin, abused his authority by committing murder and robbery. After being arrested by Bai Pengfei, a member of the Military Discipline Fourth Inspection Group, and investigated by the local court, the charges were found to be true. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. This is the first case of punishing corrupt officials in Guangxi Province after the restoration of governance.

### Conflict Arises as British Resume Construction of Pingshan Airfield

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th] After a temporary halt in the construction of the Pingshan Airfield in Hong Kong, it was found that the work stoppage was merely a break. Construction has recently resumed. On the 21st, foreign engineers burned farmland in the area, and local villagers went to stop them. Due to language barriers, misunderstandings arose, leading to conflict and scuffles. British troops were then dispatched to reinforce the area and set up machine guns in front of the village, creating an extremely tense situation. The situation was eventually mediated by Magistrate Butler, preventing a tragedy. However, the villagers still insist on maintaining the status quo and temporarily halting construction until negotiations between us and the British side yield results.

### Northern Snippets

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] (1) Chairman Chiang sternly telegraphed all departments, forbidding public servants in recovered areas from engaging in commerce. (2) As the situation in the North remains uncertain, the headquarters of the First, Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth War Zones will not be closed for the time being. The Hebei Provincial Government has decided to move to Baoding for the convenience of work. (3) Sun Lianzhong's trip to Tianjin is to inspect the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and residents. (4) The book censorship in Beiping has been ordered to be canceled. (5) The method of distributing flour by the Hebei-Tianjin branch of the Post-War Relief Administration has received a poor response from the public. People believe that the price of 150 yuan per catty is too high, negating the meaning of relief. The quantity of only 10 catties distributed per household is too small, and the procedure for receiving it is too complicated. Some people have been queuing for two days and still haven't received the 10 catties of flour.

### Hubei Province Plans to Establish Enterprise Companies to Develop Industry

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 27th] To develop industry, the Hubei Provincial Government has decided to follow the example of the Guizhou Provincial Enterprise Company and establish a large company with factories for alcohol refining, oil refining, and textiles. Preparations have already begun.

### Gu Zhengzhi Escorted to Beijing for Investigation by the Army Headquarters

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Gu Zhengzhi, the former Japanese ambassador to the puppet regime in Jiangning, surrendered himself to the Japanese Resident Management Office in this city after being declared a war criminal by the United States. The Management Office then handed him over to the Japanese Resident Self-Government Association for custody. It has been found that Gu Zhengzhi committed numerous evil deeds during his time in China and was listed as one of the main war criminals on our side's blacklist long ago. The Japanese Resident Management Office has received an order from the highest authorities to escort him to the Nanjing Army Headquarters for investigation. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, the Management Office dispatched two military police officers to the Japanese Resident Self-Government Association to take Gu into custody. Gu was wearing a leather overcoat and a top hat, and his attitude was arrogant. When a photojournalist took a close-up shot of him, Gu's face showed a hint of embarrassment. The prisoner was escorted to Beijing by personnel from the Management Bureau at 9 o'clock last night and transferred to the Army Headquarters.

### Fields Connected, Villages Scattered: A Bird's-Eye View of Chifeng After the Recovery, Our Reporter Flew to Inspect Yesterday

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Our reporter flew to Chifeng this afternoon on an airplane from the Mediation Department. This place, located far away, had been occupied with the three eastern provinces for thirteen years, and today, not long after its recovery, it has attracted the attention of the entire country due to the handover of defense between the Chinese and Soviet armies and the conflicts between the government and communist forces. After the American plane number 7153 landed at the airport 20 miles outside Chifeng this afternoon, the first report received from nearby farmers was that the Soviet army in Chifeng had indeed retreated by car to the Linxi area on January 23. Order within the city is maintained by the local security team, seemingly under the leadership of the Communist Party, while the security team leader guarding the airport, surnamed Liu, claimed that they were purely a local self-defense organization after the retreat of the Japanese army and were not the Eighth Route Army. There is also the Eighth Route Army not far from Chifeng. The current distance between the Eighth Route Army and the government forces is 20 miles, and there have been no recent conflicts. Today, we only saw the security team, the representative figures there, who walked on foot to the airport from the southeast half an hour after the plane landed, totaling more than 20 people. They were all wearing leather overcoats seized from the Japanese army, and one officer even had the edge star cap badge on his military cap still in place. Their weapons included both the Type 38 and Han Lanchun types. The leader of the team, Captain Liu, was a medium-sized, thin, and modest soldier who claimed to have served in the Northeast Army before the September 18 Incident and then engaged in business in the Rehe area. Another young officer, whose name is unknown, claimed to be from Pingyao, Shanxi, and was forced to work as a coal miner in Rehe after the occupation. He inspected the items carried by the personnel from the Mediation Department but stopped after the reporter explained and dissuaded him. We invited the two to the plane to share the pastries and candies brought by the American army, and they were flattered and embarrassed to the point of being unable to swallow. Today, after the plane arrived at the Chifeng Airport, which is about 900 miles from Beiping, at 11:40 am, a enthusiastic reporter from the Associated Press and two American pilots eagerly wanted to go to Chifeng City to meet with the peace group personnel. Nearby farmers provided three donkeys for them to ride, but they were stopped by a patrolling security team before they had traveled two miles. The telephone between the airport and Chifeng City was damaged, so the security team sent someone on horseback to deliver a letter to the city on our behalf, requesting the peace group to send a car to pick us up as soon as possible. Until 3:30 pm, when the sun was setting in the west, and we were still looking into the distance with binoculars, we did not see any sign of a car. Therefore, amidst the security team officers and soldiers staring blankly and at a loss, we took off and returned to Beiping. However, the people's love for the country there will be forever imprinted in the reporter's mind. Among the farmers who flocked to see the plane and the new visitors, one person, upon learning that we had arrived there from Beiping in just one and a half hours, exclaimed with excitement: "The motherland has been restored, it's really working!" Looking down at Chifeng from the plane, it is a plain surrounded by mountains, with fields connected and villages scattered, not a desolate desert as imagined. A railway running straight through the interior, even with only three or five broken carriages, brings a lot of modernity to this semi-primitive area. There are few trees, and the climate is not much different from Beiping's, with only a thin layer of snow on the mountaintops. The children running to the airport were only wearing cotton-padded jackets and pants, and the farmers in the fields had already started to collect fertilizer in preparation for spring plowing. The main crops in the fields are sorghum, soybeans, and millet, and there was a 50-60% harvest last year. The Japanese did not have time to collect grain before they were defeated, and the villages still have reserves. The security team has now started to borrow grain from households, and the people have been ordered to apportion meat and vegetables to comfort the army as the old year draws to a close. Currently, the puppet Manchurian currency is still in circulation there, as is the Soviet military currency, and the market can hardly use it.

### Iranian Representative Submits New Note, Accuses Soviet Union of Violating Agreement, New Iranian Prime Minister Expresses Willingness to Negotiate Directly with Soviet Union, It is Reported that the Security Council Will Announce Suspension of Discussion

[Our Dispatch] According to a London broadcast on the 28th, informed sources claim that the Security Council, scheduled to convene at 3:00 PM tomorrow, will discuss the complaints of Iran and the Soviet Union, which has attracted worldwide attention. However, according to the latest news, in view of Iran's expression of willingness to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union, the Security Council will suspend discussions for the time being and make a decision after considering the results of the negotiations. This matter is expected to be announced at tomorrow's Security Council meeting.

[United Press, London, 26th] The Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly today submitted another 2,000-word note to the Security Council, claiming that it could provide sufficient evidence of Soviet interference in Iranian internal affairs. The Security Council is now scheduled to discuss the Iranian issue on Monday. However, because the new Iranian Prime Minister, Sadana, is known to be friendly with the Soviet Union, representatives of various countries to the United Nations General Assembly speculate that Iran may automatically withdraw its complaints against the Soviet Union and engage in direct negotiations. Unexpectedly, the Iranian representative submitted a new note at this time to respond to the Soviet Union's memorandum, which stated that the Soviet Union's position in Iran was legal under the 1921 treaty and that all Iranian accusations were untrue. The Iranian note stated that the Soviet government's refusal to allow Iranian troops to pass through Iranian territory was a clear violation of the 1942 Tripartite Agreement and the Tehran Declaration, which states that all United Nations should respect Iran's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. Earlier, Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Hassin Ala, stated in Washington that he hoped the new Prime Minister would not give up requesting the Security Council to resolve the Iranian issue, as direct negotiations with the Soviet Union would only waste time and lose the opportunity to appeal to the Security Council.

[Reuters, Tehran, 27th] Iranian Prime Minister Sandana, in an exclusive interview with a reporter from this agency, stated, "I believe that the complaints submitted to the United Nations by the previous cabinet have already become a *fait accompli*. As the complaint has reached its current stage, I do not intend to withdraw it. However, I will still negotiate directly with the Soviet government, which is not incompatible with the United Nations Charter. I believe that if possible, Iran should negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to avoid increasing the burden on the United Nations."

### UN General Assembly Passes Amendment to Election Procedures, Elections Should Have Open Nominations

[Central News Agency, London, 26th Dispatch] After a lengthy three-hour debate, the 18th session of the United Nations General Assembly passed an important amendment to the United Nations General Assembly election procedures by a vote of 25 to 18. According to the United Nations Preparatory Committee's rules on election procedures, elections should be conducted by secret ballot, but there is no provision regarding the nomination of candidates. After the first meeting to elect the President of the General Assembly, the Ukrainian delegation proposed an amendment to the procedures, arguing that all candidates for the General Assembly and various council officers should be nominated publicly, although voting should be done in secret. After important discussions by the Legal Subcommittee last week, Ukraine's proposal was rejected. On the other hand, the Lebanese delegation also proposed another amendment, clearly advocating that there should be no nominations. This proposal was passed by the Legal Subcommittee by only 22 votes to 21, with 8 abstentions. Therefore, when the Legal Subcommittee submitted this proposal to the General Assembly for approval today, it again sparked a heated debate on its merits and demerits. Those who expressed opposition to this amendment included Ukraine, Norway, the United States, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Poland. Those who supported it included the United Kingdom, Lebanon, and Uruguay. Today, in addition to the countries that spoke above, China, France, New Zealand, and India also supported open nominations for elections. Our representative, Gu Weijun, as President of the General Assembly, asked the General Assembly to decide whether the vote on this amendment should be passed by a two-thirds majority or only by a majority. It was unanimously decided that it could be passed by only a majority, and as a result, the amendment was passed by a vote of 25 to 18.

### Nine US Political Groups Advocate for the Liberation of Oppressed Nationalities, Jointly Send Memorandum to UN General Assembly

[United Press, London, 26th] Nine US political groups today sent a memorandum to United Nations General Assembly President Spaak, urging the United Nations to grant independence to non-self-governing nations around the world. The memorandum arrived at the General Assembly on the eve of the Security Council's discussion of disputes involving Iran, Indonesia, and Greece, and contained three main points: namely, the independence of mandated territories and colonies, equal economic opportunities for all countries, and balanced immigration for all nationalities. The memorandum specifically mentioned Indonesia, Greece, Palestine, Vietnam, India, Korea, Puerto Rico, and the British West Indies, and advocated for the disarmament of Japanese forces to prevent civil war in China, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain.

### March and Demonstration in London to Uphold Justice for Oppressed Nationalities, British and Dutch Sailors and American Pilots Participate

[Our Dispatch] According to a London broadcast on the 28th, a surprising demonstration took place here today, with more than 2,000 participants, including British members of parliament, British and Dutch sailors, and American pilots.

(2) Opposing British interference in Indonesian internal affairs, demanding that British troops immediately cease combat and withdraw from Indonesia.

### United Nations Headquarters May be Temporarily Located in New York

[Reuters, New York, 27th] New York may become the temporary location of the United Nations, as the design of necessary buildings will take several years after the selection of a permanent headquarters. The chairman of the group surveying possible locations for a permanent headquarters in the United States, Yugoslav representative Gavrilovic, has already been informed by New York Mayor O'Dwyer of the necessary facilities, including a land area of 135,000 square feet for the construction of the Secretariat building. This year, the Secretariat will have 1,356 personnel, and by 1949, that number will increase to 2,210, requiring 221,000 square feet of space. For the facilities where the various councils and special committees hold meetings from time to time, including two conference rooms accommodating 600 people each, three conference rooms accommodating 300 people each, and twelve small committee rooms of about 1,500 square feet each, there is also a need for a library with 400,000 volumes, a press room, a document storage room, a cafe, a bar, and a recreation room. The General Assembly, which meets once a year from the beginning of September to October, needs an assembly hall accommodating 3,000 people, committee rooms, a press room accommodating 1,500 journalists, a document room attached to the assembly hall, and at least sufficient living space for 3,000 representatives, advisors, and staff. The required hotel accommodations include 150 suites, 1,000 first-class rooms, and 1,350 second-class rooms. Given the current situation in New York, this is a difficult problem, as reservations for hotel rooms in New York must be made several weeks in advance.

### US Asks Britain for Cooperation to Ban Opium, Taking Action at the Source is the Best Solution, Britain Has Proposed a Counterproposal

[United Press, Washington, 26th] According to authoritative sources, the United States has asked Britain to ban the production and consumption of opium in India and Burma (excluding legitimate medicinal uses). Britain has proposed a counterproposal, advocating that the United Nations handle the entire issue of opium production and private sales. Britain proposed that the United Nations Economic and Social Council establish a committee to be responsible for handling this issue. Britain apparently wants to create an organization similar to the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee to handle all issues related to opium. US officials will certainly agree with Britain's proposal, but still believe that taking action at the source is the best solution. The US estimates that India produces 500 tons of opium per year and says that India only needs 100 tons of opium for medical use, with the rest being smuggled for export. According to informed sources, the opium problem in Burma is also very thorny. The British pointed out that the residents of northern Burma are heavily addicted to opium and often use it in religious ceremonies, so the British are unwilling to interfere. Iran and India are the two major opium-producing areas. In 1934, the British allowed the abolition of the opium state monopoly and the banning of opium consumption in the areas recaptured from Japanese occupation. For the British, this matter has the greatest impact on Hong Kong and Malaya, and it is expected that the British will implement their promise there. The situation in the Dutch East Indies before the war was not serious, as it did not produce opium, and there were less than 40,000 indigenous opium users and about 40,000 overseas Chinese. India has not been occupied by the Japanese army, and the promises made by Britain do not seem to apply, so the British have not made a clear statement on the Indian opium problem.

### Eleanor Roosevelt Advocates Learning Esperanto to Eliminate Barriers Between Nationalities

[United Press, London, 26th] Eleanor Roosevelt stated in a speech to 400 US troops at a theater in London today that she intends to propose within the United Nations that schools around the world should be forced to teach a common international language. Language barriers are most likely to hinder world peace, so she hopes that the United Nations can stipulate that children around the world, in addition to their native language, must also learn a world language. The United States is economically and politically inseparable from other countries, and we should understand the needs of the people of all countries and think about them. Americans have embraced isolationism, but they do not know that if we cannot understand the rest of the world, a third sacrifice may be unavoidable.

### Kerr Flees to Java to Mediate the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute

[United Press, Batavia, 27th] Acting Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, returned here today after visiting the Netherlands and repeatedly meeting with Dutch and British leaders.

### Soviet-Turkish Relations Unlikely to Change for the Time Being

[French News Agency, Ankara, 26th] Political observers here believe that if there are changes within the Turkish government, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Turkey may change. If the Turkish cabinet can express greater understanding of the Kars and Ardahan regions, it is believed that the Soviet Union's trust in Turkey will also increase. The Turkish government does not seem to intend to change the current government, believing that in fact, President İsmet and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu have consistent support. Observers believe that Soviet-Turkish relations are unlikely to change before the close of the United Nations General Assembly's current session and the resolution of the Iranian-Soviet issue.

### Mysterious Figure on the Korean Political Stage, Kim Il-sung Led Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan for Fifteen Years

[United Press, Seoul, 26th] Another mysterious figure has appeared on the Korean political stage, whose life and experiences are full of legends, just as described in legends. This is General Kim Il-sung, a hero of the Korean Communist Party, whose name is known to thousands of Koreans. It is said that this person led guerrilla warfare in northeastern China against the Japanese army for fifteen years. Although most of the reports about this person are close to mythology and are difficult to verify, there is no doubt that his name has been deeply imprinted in the minds of countless Koreans. Korean children play soldiers, competing to dress up as Kim Il-sung's army as an honor. The Japanese wanted to arrest him, spending nearly one million yuan. This person has received the Soviet Order of Military Merit twice since 1931. According to recent unconfirmed reports, he has arrived in Seoul, North Korea, under Soviet occupation, from Yan'an, accompanied by thousands of guerrillas. Locals have heard that he will come to Seoul and have organized welcoming groups, but the right wing has publicly ridiculed his return. A spokesperson for the Kim Gu Provisional Government claimed that this person has long been dead and that the hero who came to Korea is an imposter. It is said that the Kim Il-sung in Seoul is still young, about 33 to 37 years old. Skeptics say that Kim's age is so young that it proves that the claim that he led guerrilla warfare in 1931 is untrue. A Korean leftist journalist claimed today that he had met with Kim four times in Seoul and said that Kim is now the secretary of the Korean Communist Party in North Korea, planning to engage in political activities. Kim has an extraordinary appearance and is tall, which is rare among ordinary 35-year-old Koreans. When Kim's guerrilla team arrived in Korea, they were disarmed by the Soviet army, but they were allowed to recruit an army of 200,000 people. It is now certain that the leftist elements in North Korea unanimously support Kim. Whether he is real or fake, a soldier or a politician, he will eventually become a powerful figure in Korea.

### Faint Sounds of Oars on the Qinhuai, Dim Lights: Scenes of Fuzimiao After the Calamity

— Our Newspaper Nanjing, 21st Dispatch, Zhou Feng

When Nanjing is mentioned, it's as if people can't forget Fuzimiao, especially Fuzimiao after the Japanese burnt it, which has aroused the concern of many outsiders. In fact, Fuzimiao is indeed memorable, with its colorful and chaotic patterns dividing the day into several segments: In the morning, most Nanjing people go to teahouses to drink tea, order a bowl of soy milk, a few duck oil pastries, or a cup of sweet fermented rice balls with two eggs, sitting there for two or three hours. Business negotiations, casual chats with friends, as long as it's morning, one can't forget the teahouses of Fuzimiao.

Good Business for Restaurants

Besides teahouses, there are even more large restaurants and small eateries. At noon, especially in the evening, they are filled with diners, as if they don't have to pay. Fortunately, Nanjing is a political center, with many adults and gentlemen. Today you invite guests, tomorrow I'll return the favor, which indeed brings good business to the restaurants. Cars lined up imposingly in front of the restaurants, with passes from certain agencies displayed in the windows, as if asking in the cold wind: "Visiting here often, is it for office work? It's such a dark day!" Restoration, restoration, the achievements in Fuzimiao after the calamity are remarkable and impressive!

The Qinhuai River Ages

In front of Fuzimiao is the Qinhuai River, which holds countless stories of intimacy and romance. Now, only the section from Wende Bridge to Huaiqing Bridge can be used for boating. The river water is still murky, and the dilapidated houses on both sides further accentuate the aging of the Qinhuai River. Those charming painted boats, badly damaged and covered with a layer of dust, are forlornly moored on the riverbank, hibernating for the winter in the cold weather. The river surface is quiet, and occasionally in the morning sunlight, there are a few wisps of mist-like water vapor, which ultimately cannot conceal the cold desolation. Compared to the light smiles and soft songs of summer nights, it is bound to evoke many sighs.

Elegant Descendants Still Exist Today

"When will the spring flowers and autumn moon end?" It can't sing the sad songs of the world. Generation after generation, there will always be days when people have clothes but can't keep warm, and food but can't eat their fill. The songs by the Qinhuai River are always so melancholic. The youth of young girls is constantly consumed here, watching the falling flowers and flowing water, without thinking about their own heaven and earth? The courting of elegant descendants requires them to exhaust their smiles. How much of life is there? Is it just consumed by beauties and money?

Why Must There Be Strife?

Fuzimiao after the calamity quickly restored its original chaotic state. There are singing venues, teahouses, restaurants, and all kinds of shops. After the victory, many dance halls were added. The long-absent neon lights flashed dazzlingly, and the soul-stirring jazz music deliberately夺走了 the old琴声 of "依依拉拉". We are all fellow sufferers in this world, why must there be strife?

Kuiguang Pavilion's Precious Pearl Robbed

Previously, there was a teahouse in the Qinhuai River called Kuiguang Pavilion. It is said that there was a crystal clear pearl on the top of the pavilion, shining like a star. When the Japanese soldiers burned Fuzimiao, they plundered this pearl. When Nanjing people mention Kuiguang Pavilion, they feel sorry for that pearl. It is said that it was bestowed by an emperor from an unknown dynasty. In short, the pavilion in the river where Kuiguang Pavilion was located was destroyed, which is an ironclad fact!

Overview of the Four Major Shopping Malls

There is a Yong'an Shopping Mall in Fuzimiao, which was newly built after being destroyed in the calamity. Its appearance resembles a large company. Tall buildings, crystal clear display windows, bring together all kinds of shops, as if everyone is joining hands, each managing their own business. (Like Shanghai's "Jing'an Shopping Mall" and "Xinshi Market," etc.) However, it is built more exquisitely than those in Shanghai, and even the corridors are covered with entire pieces of glass windows. Nanjing now has four major shopping malls (Central Market, Fuxing Shopping Mall, Jiankang Shopping Mall, Yong'an Shopping Mall), with relatively good architectural facilities and quite magnificent appearances. Its scope and appearance are comparable to Shanghai's four major companies.

The Necessities of the Nine Streams and Three Religions

One corner of Fuzimiao is extravagant and seductive, tinged with too much licentiousness, and is a playground for the wealthy. However, who would have thought that the situation in the other corner is the opposite? The former Confucius Temple was destroyed in this fire, with broken walls and tiles, and the surrounding low bungalows cannot be restored. This Confucius Temple, with only a circle of walls, has become the arena for the "heroes" of the nine streams and three religions. During the day, there are various杂要of the square, erecting flagpoles, storytellers, ballad singers, crosstalk performers, peep shows, ointment sellers, and wanting knives and guns... Those people have crude smiles on their faces, and as long as you offend them a little, they are guaranteed to burst into abuse.

What Does the Jianghu Taste Know?

At night, the "heroes" of the daytime watch the others enjoy themselves. In the dark, there is a dim oil lamp. A fortune teller holds the hand of a tourist, looking at the light, looking at his face, looking at his clothes, looking at... Then he calls him "brother," and then talks incessantly about the past and the future, coaxing everyone to laugh. Some leave with their legs dragging, muttering in their mouths, "Jianghu taste, what does it know?" However, only with everything Jianghu, is everyone willing to surround these stalls every day, laughing.

Girls Shuttle Back and Forth

In front of the square of the former Martial Temple, it is the playground for ordinary "disgraced heroes." They tease the young girls when they see them walking back and forth in this area, coarsely and loudly, and sometimes even put their arms around their shoulders.

In front of Pan Palace, in the square, there used to be the lowest-grade prostitutes soliciting customers. As long as you are willing to "take the risk," alas, it is pitiful to say, how many coolies find comfort here. Although it is now prohibited by the police, occasionally there are still two or three looking for their "pleasure," muttering: "Let's go play at my house..." In this corner, alas, life is wasted!

Nanjing, Nanjing is a magnificent capital, but Fuzimiao, Fuzimiao is the most bustling district in Nanjing. Calamity, calamity cannot destroy Nanjing, cannot destroy this pitiful and lovely Fuzimiao!

Morning in Jiangnan (Small Town Market Day)

Three Representatives in Beiping (Photo) Taking off the Plane Together (From right to left)

Government Representative: Shen Yi and Amiable General Zheng Jiemin

US Representative: Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy General Robertson

Communist Representative: Unruly and Unrestrained General Ye Jianying

### Mediation Department Launches Work, Three Representatives in Beiping, Our Newspaper 18th Dispatch, Wen Yong from the Old Capital

The three representatives who were sent to Beiping to implement the ceasefire order jointly decided and promulgated by the National Government and the Communist Party arrived here by plane on the 14th. At present, the Ceasefire Committee has officially established an executive department, and a large rectangular plaque with white characters on a black background is hung at the entrance of the Xiehe Hospital, which is enough to attract the attention of the people of the old capital.

These three representatives can be said to be the VIPs in the Beijing Hotel at present, and everyone places unlimited hope on them. The Communist representative lives on the first floor, the government representative lives on the second floor, and the US representative lives on the third floor. The lights are on all night, which shows the intensity of their work.

At the joint reception of reporters in Ping City by the three representatives, US Representative General Robertson said from the position of "a friendly and neutral 家家" (that's what Robertson said): "What I want to work hard for is to implement the agreement that has already been reached between the National Government and the Communist Party." This is similar to General Li Zongren's tone, who said: Our internal strife is like two brothers in a family who have lost their harmony. There is no need for neighbors to persuade them from the side. After a long time, they will naturally return to good terms. However, after the persuasion of neighbors, it is much easier to get better. General Ye Jianying expressed gratitude and shame for this, because the United States has given us too much help in the persuasion aspect.

Government Representative General Zheng Jiemin, after reviewing the written questions raised by the reporters, gave us a very satisfactory answer in a continuous stream. At a glance, you can tell that he is a calm, dignified, amiable, and approachable general, with a well-thought-out plan, skilled and lively. General Zheng has a round face and is full of energy. His body is also very strong. He succeeded Yang Xuancheng as the Director of the Second Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, specializing in military propaganda work, and is a talent admired by all parties. He and General Ye Jianying are fellow villagers in Guangdong. The only difference is that General Ye has a black beard and is a Russian returnee. When he was talking to reporters, Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi was sitting beside him, silent and smiling. In addition, those who came to Ping with him included personnel dispatched from the Second Department, the Foreign Affairs Bureau, the Military Statistics Bureau, and the Military Police Headquarters. Among them, the one who impressed the reporters the most was General Ji Zejin, who was responsible for publicity. He represents the government's views on news propaganda, and his position is equivalent to that of Ms. Gong Peng, who represents the Communist Party.

Now we want to talk about Communist Representative General Ye Jianying. As soon as he arrived in Beijing, he stayed at the Beijing Hotel and immediately met with reporters in Ping City. He told reporters that as a Communist representative, I flew here from Chongqing, just like we were sent to Chongqing from Yan'an, in order to "stop fighting," in order to realize peaceful reunification, in order to stop the civil war. Everyone should take the wind in our sails at this time, and take the wind in our sails together with foreigners. When answering reporters' questions, Ms. Gong Peng was always by his side. She is the wife of the famous Communist political commentator Qiao Mu. Her English proficiency is said to be quite high. She was very active in Chongqing, serving as a reporter for Xinhua Daily and engaging in Communist international propaganda work, and was once famous. Now her job is one of the Communist representatives of the News Group of the Mediation Department. Attached is a brief biography of General Ye:

### A Cry from the People of Northern Jiangsu

Mr. Editor,

Enclosed please find a manuscript. I wrote this piece out of righteous indignation. Please publish it in your newspaper, and I will take full responsibility for its content. Even if the "New Fourth Army" marches into Yangzhou tomorrow, I will still stand by these words! Respectfully, Wang Han, Yangzhou, late on January 23rd.

After liberation, the people of Northern Jiangsu never imagined that cities such as Qingjiang, Huai'an, Baoying, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Rugao, and Dongtai would once again suffer the ravages of artillery fire and the calamities of war. Yangzhou, which was fortunate enough not to be captured by the "New Fourth Army," and places like Zhenjiang, are filled with refugees wandering the streets, as in a famine year. Even more unexpectedly, during the glorious war of resistance against Japan, people never knew that the "New Fourth Army" had attacked Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai... Now that the war of resistance is over, the "New Fourth Army" has come to attack these cities, displaying their most valiant combat behaviors! The "warriors" are said to have sacrificed themselves heroically, with casualties often numbering in the thousands. And each time, ships loaded with "stacked salted fish" (dead bodies packed haphazardly) are prepared in advance. It is difficult to find similar records of such grand scenes in the history of the resistance against Japan in Northern Jiangsu.

"Often numbering in the thousands"? How many people does the "New Fourth Army" in Northern Jiangsu actually have?

Yes, this is something that needs to be seriously clarified.

The "warriors" who sacrifice themselves in each city assault are not the regular troops of the "New Fourth Army," but rather strong young men and ordinary people forcibly conscripted from the countryside, including merchants and peddlers. Whoever gets caught is destined to die, and they must be reliable in dying. Driven to the front lines, they face machine guns spewing fire, and behind them are more machine guns waiting, used by the "New Fourth Army" to deal with those who "unheroically" retreat.

These people, because they are completely untrained, don't even have a rifle. But their assigned task is to be the vanguard—charging and scaling the city walls! Each person has two hand grenades. To say that this is the "New Fourth Army's" weapon for those scaling the walls is not as accurate as saying it's something to give them courage to hold in their hands. This is similar to another tactic: using several cotton quilts, soaking them in water, covering a square table with them, and covering the surroundings. They then force several people to push it forward, telling them it's a "tank" that can deflect bullets. When batches of them are sacrificed, they no longer care whether they live or die. And each time they fight, they sacrifice batches of innocent people to intimidate the enemy, reduce their morale, and make the enemy soldiers unwilling to shoot at these innocent people. This is precisely a tactic that the "New Fourth Army" has been using since liberation.

Although the commanders of the "New Fourth Army" boast: "One burst from a machine gun is fifty bullets. We'll use fifty-one human bombs to fight you. After fifty human bombs are sacrificed and your burst of bullets is finished, our fifty-first human bomb will seize your machine gun!"

Such boasting is probably more magnificent than the boasting of any military strategist in the world!

But let us consider: What about those innocent people who are sacrificed in batches? I think that anyone who understands this situation will be at a loss for words for a moment, but their hearts will be filled with infinite sorrow and indignation! And opposing the civil war, opposing the "New Fourth Army," is the loudest cry from the bottom of their hearts.

Therefore, people often hate the "New Fourth Army's" "disruptive" behavior so much that they even hate the National Army for not being able to resolutely use force to eliminate the "New Fourth Army." People know that the National Army in Northern Jiangsu now has enough forces to annihilate the "New Fourth Army." At the very least, capturing the several neighboring counties of Jiangdu is not a problem.

The Political Consultative Conference's most precious product! The "Ceasefire Order" clearly states that "at 1:00 AM on the 13th" (?), all conflicts nationwide should cease. Yet on the evening of the 14th, there was a small, amusing incident on the front lines of Shaobo (I must admit that I am suffering from hysteria when I use the word "amusing" here!). That morning, the "New Fourth Army" erected a sign with the words "Ceasefire Ordered" on a tall tree, and the National Army, seeing this, was left in peace. However, that evening, without warning, the "New Fourth Army" launched a surprise attack. The result: over a hundred National Army soldiers were killed or wounded. In the past few days, the "New Fourth Army" has been besieging Luhe County on a large scale. Today (please note: today is exactly ten days after the "Ceasefire Order" took effect), the news is that the "New Fourth Army" is attacking the neighboring county of Taizhou (i.e., Taixian). Because the "New Fourth Army" does not abide by the law, to prevent them from sending plainclothes soldiers to engage in "city infiltration" again (as happened before), Yangzhou is busy organizing the baojia system and strictly checking household registrations. The "residence permit" will once again be the passport that people must carry when traveling. The new name is "resident certificate," which of course must be re-applied for at the police station. The cost of the photograph, around 300 yuan, and the 25 yuan fee for buying the "application form" is of course not a problem for the wealthy, but for ordinary families with six members, an unexpected expense of over 2,000 yuan, at a time when the end of the lunar year is approaching and expenses are numerous, makes people resentful! The phrase "the New Fourth Army is really killing people" is on everyone's lips!

Every night, there is a street curfew at 10 PM. Military and government personnel are not allowed to pass through unless on official business. Furthermore, military and government agencies and any residents are not allowed to let outsiders stay overnight, except for those reporting to the household registration. These are the latest measures taken by the authorities to prevent the "New Fourth Army" from infiltrating the city.

In the homes of relatives and friends, you can often meet refugees from Xinghua, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Qingjiang, and other places. Naturally, this is also true of hotels. There is also a "Refugee Youth Reception Center of [X] County," which is full of young people who fled to Yangzhou because the New Fourth Army captured their hometowns and because they have difficulty living. When you chat with them, you have no choice but to believe that the "New Fourth Army's" disruptive and sinful acts are all true. Most obviously, you will immediately feel that their indignation towards the "New Fourth Army" is greater and more profound than anything else. For example, they believe that since the "New Fourth Army" is still attacking the National Army after the "Ceasefire Order" was issued, the Nationalist government could very well refuse to recognize the credentials of the Communist Party representatives, such as Zhou Enlai, who participated in the Political Consultative Conference, and that at the very least, Mr. Mao Zedong should be held responsible! They have this understanding: many of the members of the "New Fourth Army" in Northern Jiangsu were originally local bullies and ruffians, and even former puppet troops reorganized. The orders of the "Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" cannot be universally disseminated. And these elements often "elope" with a gang after capturing a town. The "New Fourth Army" then has no choice but to supplement its numbers by adding some undesirable elements, so the common people are in terrible trouble! The most fiery indignation can be summed up as: "Let us use the 'Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors' to accuse them. Is there any reason to defend the New Fourth Army's actions as anything other than traitorous behavior? Resisting the government, expanding the army without authorization, engaging in militarism, colluding with the enemy, incorporating puppet troops, forcibly conscripting young men, issuing 'resistance currency,' establishing governments without authorization, and harming the people..." This stands in stark contrast to yesterday's (22nd) report: the Shanghai journalists' inspection team sent a telegram to the government representatives and Communist Party representatives at the Political Consultative Conference, stating, "...Peace has been achieved, unity has been successful, and the people of the whole country are overjoyed..."

People are wondering why some newspapers in Shanghai are still helping the Communist Party make many sophistical arguments, while the commentaries in many newspapers rarely thoroughly criticize the facts of the Communist Party's extremely wicked behavior, and there are very few fair and factual reports. Furthermore, you can't see any articles in many supplements that reflect or comment on the Communist Party's behavior. I must say that this dissatisfaction of theirs is somewhat narrow-minded, only thinking of their own side. As Dale Carnegie said, "A sore on one's own neck is more concerning than an earthquake in Africa." They haven't considered that: first, Shanghai and Northern Jiangsu are two worlds, like comparing a 14-story building to a thatched hut; second, Shanghai is an international city, and the problems that people pay attention to are broad, progressive, and international, because people's vision is broad, progressive, and international!

However, when they see the news that a Shanghai journalists' inspection team is coming to inspect Northern Jiangsu, they are overjoyed! They are eagerly anticipating the early arrival of the inspection team and are holding attitudes of great welcome and boundless gratitude!

### Understanding the Current Political Situation

— Yang Youjiong

The implementation of democratic politics has become the shared goal of our entire nation. However, we know that democratic politics should be based on reason. Only when the government and the people are based on reason can constitutional democracy proceed along a fixed track, and can normal and appropriate relations develop within domestic politics. Given this premise, I hope that the people of our country will use reason to correctly understand the truth of future domestic political changes.

The multi-party political system is about to begin again in China. Multi-party politics is not something new in the eyes of the Chinese people; from the first year of the Republic of China to the tenth year, China also implemented a multi-party political system similar to that of Europe and the United States. In the declaration issued in Beijing in the first year of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang stated: "The rise of political parties in a country should be characterized by the confrontation of two major parties, not the separation of small factions." The Kuomintang has never failed to advocate for party politics, but because there were no fewer than dozens of large and small political groups in the ten years after the founding of the Republic of China, the result was detrimental to national politics, and they eventually disappeared invisibly. We trace the cause to the fact that the various political groups were only vying for immediate power, without permanent political programs, and failed to gain the support of the broad masses of the people. The political parties of Britain and the United States follow a set constitutional path, sharing the same principle—liberalism—and only engage in intellectual competition on policies to seek the support of the people and gain power. Since the establishment of the legal path of alternating governance between the two parties, the situation of using force to seize power has been permanently eliminated. Based on this, we express our infinite hope that future party politics can work towards the promotion of democratic politics under the guidance of the nation's founding father's established nation-building program and the supreme nation-building principle unanimously supported by the entire nation—the Three Principles of the People.

However, when we look back at the history of party struggles twenty years ago, we cannot but awaken the people, raise vigilance, and pay close attention to future party politics. The existence of political parties must be based on the combination of political views, not on the combination of personal issues. The history of the corruption of political parties twenty years ago should not be forgotten by the people of our country. Forming parties based on personal connections is not the proper path for political parties; and those who form a party today and establish a society tomorrow, only for the sake of seizing power, will also not be tolerated by the people of our country. What we hope for from future political parties is that they must have clear positions, genuine sincerity in building the nation, and indeed a large number of party members. Only in this way can they promote democracy. The debate over one-party versus multi-party rule has also occurred many times on the Chinese political stage, but the nation-building tradition, the spirit of the times, and the tendency of the people cannot be ignored. Today, those who discuss politics often criticize the Kuomintang's one-party rule, and even foreigners who scratch an itch from afar often do not understand. We are willing to briefly narrate the nation-building tradition of the Republic of China from the objective standpoint of the people, and we hope that those who discuss politics at home and abroad will not ignore the history of the founding of the Republic of China, which was exchanged for the blood of our revolutionary predecessors. The Kuomintang of China is the revolutionary party that built the Republic of China. The Republic of China over the past fifty years, directly and indirectly, has been nurtured and created under the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, just as the Soviet Union was created and governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Since we agree that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has long implemented its one-party dictatorship due to the needs of the revolutionary environment, we have no reason to criticize the Kuomintang of China for gradually realizing its grand vision of returning power to the people based on the nation-building program. As for the "tutelage by the party" level, it is only a transitional period in the nation-building path. If we examine in detail the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, and the documents of the Kuomintang of China over the past fifty years, none of them contain the claim of permanently holding power without implementing the return of power to the people. Therefore, those who discuss one-party dictatorship today should have some understanding of this point. Even in terms of "tutelage," the Kuomintang's "tutelage" is different from the Soviet Communist Party's "dictatorship." The spirit and purpose of the so-called "class dictatorship" and "one-party dictatorship" is to ultimately concentrate political power in one class or one party; while the spirit and purpose of the Kuomintang's tutelage is to ultimately transfer political power to the people, its purpose and destination are exactly the opposite of dictatorship. In 1935, Professor Holcombe of Harvard University in the United States came to China to lecture and gave an accurate explanation of the Kuomintang's tutelage. He believed that "after the military administration period and before the constitutional administration period, there is a tutelage period, which is very suitable for China's needs. During this period, many political habits can be developed, and many precedents regarding the basic national system can be accumulated, becoming the constitution of the new China, and the result is workable and suitable for national conditions." Mr. Holcombe's words best represent the objective views of Western political scholars. We hope that people at home and abroad will no longer use this as an excuse to attack the Kuomintang. For fifteen years, the National Government has solemnly declared that it will eventually return power to the people, only the long-term invasion of the Japanese pirates and domestic unrest have prolonged the deadline. The convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of this year will fulfill the Kuomintang's grand vision of returning power to the people, and the original intention of building the nation can be announced to China and the world. I hope that the people of the country have a correct understanding of this nation-building argument, and that the Kuomintang members should adhere to the consistent nation-building vows of their party and not abandon what they believe in. This is the first.

Secondly, the Three Principles of the People are not the principles of the Kuomintang alone, but the highest principles of nation-building in the Republic of China. The "Program for Political Tutelage" and the "Organization Law of the National Government" promulgated in 1928 officially announced the beginning of "building the Republic of China with the Three Principles of the People of this revolution and the Five-Power Constitution" in documents. Since then, the "Laws of the Tutelage Period," the "Outline for Resistance War and Nation Building," and the "Draft Constitution of the Republic of China" that are yet to be implemented all stipulate that the Three Principles of the People are the highest standards for nation building. Since then, the Three Principles of the People have legally constituted the principles of nation building and are the original driving force behind the political power of the Republic of China. The people of the country have already formed a relationship of obedience to the aforementioned basic laws that have been promulgated, and they have a legal obligation to believe in and obey the Three Principles of the People. In terms of the various parties, they have all clearly stated in the past and present that they follow the Three Principles of the People as the principles of nation building. Therefore, the various parties should engage in activities under the highest principles of nation building of the Three Principles of the People, just as the political parties of Britain and the United States engage in activities under the great principle of democracy. In other words, the activities of the various parties must not violate the Three Principles of the People or attempt to overthrow the Three Principles of the People, just as the main political parties in Britain and the United States must not oppose liberalism, which is the founding principle of Britain and the United States. Therefore, whether in Britain, the United States, or in our country, there is only one founding principle, and no country has two parallel founding principles. This is a characteristic shared by modern countries. In the past, most of China's political parties did not recognize this basic principle, so various ideologies flocked to China, leading to long-term chaos in Chinese politics. Today, the various parties have expressed their adherence to the Three Principles of the People as a common principle, which is a major step forward. I hope that the people of our country will use this as a touchstone to judge the right and wrong of the activities of the various parties. Only under the nation-building principle of the Three Principles of the People can the various parties have a legitimate status. This is the second.

As for the future of China, regardless of whether it implements a one-party system or a multi-party system, after the implementation of the constitution, the Kuomintang will return power to the people. Although it will be an ordinary political party, it will still not lose its primary position in leading the nation. Because the various parties all follow the Three Principles of the People, the Kuomintang, which created the Republic of China, should still lead the people and urge the realization of the Three Principles of the People, whether in power or in opposition, based on its consistent nation-building aspirations. What should be discussed is whether China should adopt a two-party confrontation or a multi-party coalition in the future. This is an issue that should be valued by the people. The system of the Five-Power Constitution is very different from the British and American systems. It is neither a responsible cabinet system nor a presidential system, but a system of popularly elected government with the National Assembly as its center and the separation of political and governing powers. Although the various parties are very active in the National Assembly, it seems unlikely that one party can monopolize power. The author believes that after the situation of separate parties is created in the future, there will be only two trends: one is that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be at the center, and each will absorb other parties to form two major opposing parties; the other is that various parties will be separated, and there will be calls for unity today and breakups tomorrow. The development of all these trends depends on the evolution of the situation in the future, but in any case, the entire nation must be the decision-maker of future political trends. I hope that the people will first recognize the truth of the political situation, and then exert the power of the people to urge the various parties to adhere to the normal path of the constitution and not engage in any acts of destroying the law or disrupting discipline. Only in this way can the foundation of a century of constitutionalism be laid on the shoulders of the people of the country.

### Minister Chen Cheng and General Xue Yue Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday on the Yong Sui Warship: Chen Will Seek Treatment for Duodenal Disease

[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Military Affairs and concurrently Chief of Naval Affairs Chen Cheng arrived in Shanghai on the Yong Sui warship after departing from Nanjing at 8 AM yesterday morning. This reporter went to the Naval Affairs Office pier on Huangpu Road in the city at approximately 3 PM yesterday afternoon to await their arrival. At nearly 4 PM, the Yong Sui warship was faintly visible in the distance. At 4:05 PM, it docked at the pier. This reporter, along with those welcoming them, boarded the ship successively. General Chen, wearing a light-colored cape, with slightly graying temples but in high spirits and with a welcoming smile, shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with each of those welcoming him. Accompanying General Chen were his wife, Ms. Tan Xiang, along with their six sons and daughters, who disembarked from the ship in an orderly fashion.

Chen's Remarks

General Chen told this reporter: His arrival was to seek treatment for duodenal disease and dental ailments. The reorganization of troops and the adjustment of various levels of the former Naval Department had also been considered for some time, but there was nothing to announce at present. However, he plans to hold a public reception for the press in the near future to speak freely. He then took his family by car to their residence on Linsen West Road to rest.

Welcoming Personnel

Those who went to the pier yesterday to welcome them included Mayor Qian, Special Commissioner Zhao Zhiyao of the Military Affairs Ministry's Nanjing-Shanghai Area, Deputy Chief Zhou Xianzhang of the Naval Affairs Office, Director Wei Jimin of the Naval Affairs Office's Shanghai Office, Commander Luo Youlun of the Youth Army 207th Division, Commander Rong Youlue of the Shanghai Municipal Defense General Corps, Deputy Commander Li Jilan of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Director Sun Qinchi of the Municipal Government's General Affairs Office, and Director Chen Shiquan of the Land Administration Bureau, among others.

Xue Yue Arrives Too

Xue Yue, the famous anti-Japanese general who fought bloody battles in Changsha, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Yong Sui warship with Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng. General Xue's demeanor was undiminished from those years, wearing a long robe and a dark jacket. Accompanied by his three sons and daughters, he smiled and shook hands with each of the welcoming personnel before taking a car to his private residence to rest.

### Inventory of Seized Enemy Property Should Be Created

Upon investigating enemy and puppet properties, according to the Executive Yuan's regulations, they should be handled uniformly by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. Before the establishment of the Bureau's Enemy Property Division, many properties were sealed off and occupied by various parties, often leading to disputes over issues such as housing. At the same time, the families of traitors were also able to take advantage of this chaotic situation to conceal and evade their property. Furthermore, unscrupulous individuals, taking advantage of their influence, forcibly occupied or shielded enemy property, thereby pursuing their attempts to fish in troubled waters, making investigation and handling extremely difficult. It is understood that the Administration Bureau, in order to comply with regulations, unify authority, improve efficiency, and eliminate malfeasance, has formally issued a public announcement as of today and has sent letters to relevant authorities stating that if there is any enemy property that has been previously seized, sealed off, or occupied, a detailed inventory must be created and transferred to the Bureau for handling by February 10th. However, if the previous handling agencies truly need the property for official purposes, they may still complete the procedures to temporarily borrow it. If the inventory is not transferred by the deadline, or if any unauthorized seizure, sealing off, or occupation occurs after the Bureau's approval has not been obtained, it will be considered a crime of forcibly occupying enemy property.

### Central Textile Construction Company Receives Factories, Totaling Sixteen

The China Textile Construction Company will, starting today, take over another sixteen factories related to the textile industry. Among them are six woolen mills: Hongkang, Yongdian, Huaxing, Zhonghe, Gongda, and Shanghai Factory No. 6; seven dyeing and weaving factories: Yida, Zhonghua, Huimei, Huaqiang, Xinghua, Guizhou, and Meihua; and three hemp factories: Rihua Factory No. 1 and 2, Shanghai Factory No. 1 and 2, and Dongya. The transfer will be carried out by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, most personnel will not be changed, only the factories will be reorganized under the Textile Construction Company system for unified management. In addition, there are more than twenty enemy and puppet hosiery factories that the company can take over. However, most of these hosiery factories are small in scale, which makes management inconvenient. Therefore, whether to take them over is under consideration, and it is expected that a part will be transferred to private operation.

### Foreigners Requesting Soviet Citizenship Increase Sharply; Soviet Ship Reported to Arrive in Shanghai

[Our Report] The Soviet Consulate General in this city has been busy processing passport applications recently. Most of those applying for Soviet citizenship are White Russians in this city, with some people from Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. In the past seventeen days alone, the number of applicants has exceeded six thousand, while the total number of applicants during the war was only about two thousand, a significant increase. According to the consulate staff, they will speed up the registration process so that passports can be issued as soon as possible. There is no deadline for registration. The registration process only started three weeks ago. It is said that an average of about five hundred people register every day, and it is rumored that a Soviet ship named "Shanfu" will soon arrive in this city, the first Soviet ship to arrive in Shanghai in several years.

### Power Company Officials State: Reasonable Demands Will Be Considered; Labor Refuses to Insist on Negotiations at the Factory

[Our Report] The labor dispute at the power company has been deadlocked for five days. Yesterday, because the workers' representatives no longer insisted that the management come to the factory for negotiations, there was a turnaround in resolving the strike. However, the workers' representatives insisted on no longer negotiating with the original representatives, Luo Gen (British) and Tao Yingjie, because the workers believed that the two were deceiving the general manager, Faires. Yesterday, the factory invited reporters and asked them to convey this message to Faires so that direct negotiations could proceed quickly.

**Labor and Management to Meet Soon**

The reporter visited Mr. Hopkins, the general manager of the company, yesterday. According to him, he is willing to represent the company and announce that any reasonable demands from the workers will be considered and accepted, such as the reinstatement of dismissed workers and the adjustment of salaries. However, he has only seen these conditions in the newspaper and has not received any formal request from the workers, so he feels confused and puzzled. This point can be clarified after a direct meeting between the two parties today or tomorrow.

**Workers' Representatives Offer Explanation**

The workers' representatives also said yesterday that they do not have any excessive demands, so they hope that the management will not reduce them using the usual bargaining tactics. The reason they insisted that the negotiation location must be inside the factory is because they have negotiated outside the factory with the management many times, but without gaining a key understanding. Therefore, everyone is demanding that the management come to the factory so that they can understand the progress of the negotiations and know whether the representatives are doing their best. If there are any disputes, they can convene a general meeting at any time to discuss and decide whether to accept or reject them. They also solemnly stated that Shen Han, a director of the union, was not stealing electricity. The reason was that Shen's neighbor, the Ouya Barber Shop, had damaged wires and connected them to Shen's meter without permission. In fact, even if Shen agreed, they would still pay according to the rules, so the charge of stealing electricity is simply unfounded.

**Hope for Understanding from the Mediator**

Regarding the ten dismissed workers, none of them are temporary workers, and two of them have been serving for more than twenty years, and another has been serving for ten years. Therefore, at this time of work shortage, the management has no reason to dismiss them casually on the pretext of "not needing" them. Regarding Wang Xianqing, a member of the Municipal Party Committee who is responsible for mediation, they are deeply satisfied with him. They said that they can guarantee with their lives that they did not kidnap Wang and obstruct his freedom. However, because they did not follow Wang's advice to resume work before negotiating, it may have made Wang feel unhappy, and they hope Wang will understand.

**Department Stores Still Awaiting Mediation**

More than 3,000 employees of nine major department stores in this city, such as Yong'an and Sincere, have been on strike since the 23rd due to failed salary increase requests. Although the authorities have mediated many times, no resolution has been reached. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Zhang Zhenyuan, the chief of the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau, invited representatives of both labor and management to discuss the matter again. The labor side reduced their minimum salary requirement from 34,500 yuan (with meals provided), while the management, based on the decision of the Wage Assessment Committee, set the minimum salary at 30,000 yuan, with employees providing their own meals. If meals are still provided by the company, the food cost of 7,500 yuan will be deducted, so the minimum salary is 22,500 yuan. After Chief Zhang's separate persuasion, the management agreed to raise it to 25,000 yuan (with meals provided), while the labor side still insisted on 34,500 yuan (with meals provided). As no agreement was reached, it was decided to mediate again at 1:00 p.m. today.

**US Military Drivers Resumed Work Yesterday**

The strike of drivers and workers in the US military transportation department has come to an end. The US military authorities made some concessions and agreed to issue salaries in advance today so that they can spend the lunar New Year. At the same time, starting on the first of next month, the salaries of all drivers and workers will be doubled. As a result, more than 1,500 Chinese drivers and workers officially resumed work yesterday.

### Wu Kaixian Takes Office as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau This Morning

The newly appointed Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mr. Wu Kaixian, will hold an inauguration ceremony at 9:00 a.m. this morning at the memorial week in the Municipal Auditorium and will soon take office at the bureau. Yesterday morning, all the staff of the bureau held a farewell party for Deputy Director Ge Guxin on the 9th floor of the Youth Association, with more than 100 people including Wu Shaoshu and Ge Kexin, the heads of various departments, attending. A brief biography of Wu is recorded below:

Mr. Wu is 47 years old this year, a native of Songjiang, Jiangsu. He graduated from the Department of Economics of Shanghai University and served as a standing member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, a supervisory commissioner, and a member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government. After the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the leader of the first group of the sixth department of the Military Affairs Commission, the deputy director of the Central Organization Department. In the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he was ordered by the Chairman to come to Shanghai to preside over the work behind enemy lines, and served as a standing member and secretary-general of the Shanghai Unified Committee.

The newly appointed Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Tong Xingbai, also took office this morning. A brief biography of Tong is recorded below. Mr. Tong is 48 years old, a native of Chongming County, Jiangsu. He graduated from the Department of Political Science of Shanghai College of Political Science and Law and served as the Minister of Training of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department for two years, a standing member for four years, and a director for one year. He was the Chief Secretary of the Central Overseas Department for two years and a party affairs instructor stationed in the Philippines for four years. In the cultural work, he served as the Director of Student Affairs of China Public School for two years, a member of the Student Affairs Committee of Jinan University for one year, the President of the Philippine Dahua Daily, the President of the Newcomer Weekly, and the principal of the Minli Girls' Middle School for many years. He has written various works such as "Analysis of Historical Materialism and the History of People's Livelihood" and "Outline of Confucius' Philosophy Research Party".

### Today is the 14th Anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident; Sun Yuanliang Expresses Thoughts

Today is the 14th anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War in the 21st year of the Republic [1932]. General Sun Yuanliang, the current Director of the Jinghu Relief Work Supervision Group of the Third Theater, was a general in the Anti-Japanese War at that time. At that time, Mr. Sun was the brigade commander of the 259th Brigade and defeated the Japanese army in the Battle of Miaoxing Town. Mr. Sun especially issued a statement saying, "The 'January 28th' Songhu Anti-Japanese War in the 21st year of the Republic is the most glorious manifestation of the Chinese nation's perseverance and unyielding resistance to aggression. Among them, the Battle of Miaoxing Town is internationally recognized as 'the first time the Chinese army fought against the Japanese army and defeated the Japanese army on the battlefield.'

### Youth Rich in Scientific Interest, Suffering from Lack of Practical Research Facilities

Editor: I, being aware of the importance of science, have developed a great interest in it. I have designed a prime mover in my mind that doesn't use fuel but relies on air power, and based on my understanding, it can be successful. However, without practical experimentation, I still lack confidence. There are also more than ten kinds of materials waiting to be researched, but experimentation is financially impossible, and the environment I'm in doesn't suit my interests, nor can I fully find the materials. Therefore, my problem is not easily solved, which also affects my willingness to do other things. To put it simply, I feel very distressed. Now I want to invest in an environment suitable for my interests to research and experiment, but I can't find a way. I respectfully ask you, sir, to guide and introduce me to open my mind so that I can speed up the research. At the same time, I also think that I am definitely not the only one suffering from this same distress, and there must be many others. It would be great if you, sir, could make a strong appeal for us ambitious scientists who are forced to sit in worry due to economic and environmental constraints. Please ask the authorities to establish a scientific experiment and research institute with books containing scientific reference materials and providing experimental instruments, so that our imaginations and diagrams can be used for research and experimentation. This is what we desire most. I specially entrust this to you, and wish you good health. Gao Chenggong

(Editor's Note) Mr. Gao: I am twelve points admirable of youths like you who have scientific minds and enterprising spirits. What you said about not having the economic means and not having a laboratory is indeed not easy to develop your aspirations. China is a country with backward science, but now is the beginning of national construction, and we need a large number of persevering and hardworking youths to work towards science. The original academic equipment was almost completely destroyed by the enemy during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War—I believe it will be slowly built up in the future, so don't be impatient or passive. As for the "prime mover" in your ideal, it is best to first draw a diagram, explain it in detail, and send it to me to introduce it to physicists for review. If it can really become a reality, there is no need to worry about finding a place for experimental production. What do you think?

### Tight Year-End Money Supply, Gold and Paper Money Fell Last Week, But Silver Bullion Reached a New High Price

The daily rate for 1,000 yuan of interbank lending in the money industry, although nominally at 3%, the actual interest rate has risen to 1.3%, and the year-end rate is as high as 1.5%. The local money industry is still prohibited from mortgaging. The customs limit the amount of gold jewelry transported to the Northeast to 37.7994 grams, only about 7.6 qian. Northern gangs and securities gangs sold 900,000 yuan at the end of the week, a decrease of 27,000 yuan from the previous week. Foreign banks and money houses sold US dollars in kind.

The Shantou gang dumped Hong Kong dollars, and both old and new goods fell 10 yuan. The silver market saw a new high price of 800 yuan per tael of silver bullion due to the demand for jewelry from silver shops at the end of the year, the purchase from the Jiangbei gang, and news of Japan raising silver prices. Silver coins were 500 yuan each, and Mexican silver dollars were even more expensive.

### Speculative Funds Are at Work, Public Bonds Fall and Chinese Stocks Rise

The talk of repaying Unified Bonds with Sun Yat-sen banknotes and customs gold gradually revealed an extravagant expectation that was not in line with public opinion. The Sichuan gang banks and securities gangs continued to sell gradually before the end of the year. Grade C bonds hit a low of 1,000 yuan, half of the peak of 2,000 yuan ten days ago. Finally, a major player pushed it up, and it rebounded to 1,300 yuan, a decrease of 400 yuan from the previous week. The remaining Grades A, B, D, and E each fell by 470 to 80 yuan. Chinese stocks rose because of the air of the resumption of trading in the Securities Exchange and the distribution of dividends by textile factories. The Guangdong gang bought 50,000 to 60,000 shares of Wing On Textile Factory, reaching 1,630 yuan at the end of the week, an increase of 200 yuan from the previous week. The remaining large and small popular and unpopular stocks all looked up. Foreign stocks saw a new high price at the beginning of the week. Finally, the lane trading was intervened by the authorities, and the bullish turned to sell before the end of the year, and the Jewish gangs waited and watched. Ewo Silk Factory fell 600 yuan, and Wheelock fell 2,000 yuan, most of which were 100 to 500 yuan less than the previous week.

### Overview of Silk and Satin This Week, Silk Goods Market Was Active Yesterday

Last week, rayon fell back on Tuesday due to the implementation of raw material rationing, and both spot goods and warehouse warrants were announced to fall back. Afterwards, it gradually eased. Spot goods for 120 Tianqiao fluctuated between 1.12 million and 150,000 yuan, which was 20,000 yuan weaker than last Saturday. The warehouse warrants fell in a straight line, which was more than 300,000 yuan less than last Saturday. The factory price was very stable last week, with very little fluctuation, and each grade rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Silk and satin were mediocre. Although there were ups and downs in the middle, the difference was very small compared with last Saturday. Meiya quilt cover was up to 775,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and a minimum of 730,000 yuan. Dacheng Gebi crepe was up to 2,470 yuan per yard, and a minimum of 2,220 yuan. Minsheng brocade fluctuated by 500 yuan, and finally was the same as last Saturday. Only Huajin crepe fell by 150 yuan per yard. Yesterday, on Sunday, the silk goods market was very active. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 820,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Dacheng Gebi crepe was the most popular, with a transaction price of 2,660 yuan per yard. Minsheng Shi brocade was priced at 11,000 yuan per piece according to the original board, and Huajin crepe was sold at a miserable price of 850 yuan per yard due to many people seeking to sell.

### Authorities Dumped Stored Goods, Price Increase Was Slightly Suppressed

Rice and food were first bought by street food households at the end of the year, and speculative big players participated, and thick japonica and indica rice rose above the 10,000 yuan mark. Then, the Grain Administration Office dumped a large number of Wuhu indica rice, asking for 7,500 yuan per dan, and each grade of rice was leveled by it. As a result, it was 200 to 300 yuan up and down from the previous week. What is strange is that each rice store in the market did not have this Wuhu indica rice from the Grain Administration Office, which shows that there are hoarders who have taken it all. Among miscellaneous grains, beans rose by 100 to 200 yuan due to the need for the New Year, peanuts were stable, bean cakes were weak by 50 yuan, and edible oil rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per dan following the rise of soybean raw materials. Cotton yarn first fell to 1 million yuan for 42 counts and 700,000 yuan for 20 counts due to the continuous sale of cotton yarn by the textile and construction company. Then, due to the prevalence of wage and salary strikes in the yarn factory, the cloth factory and the Xichang guest gang bought back and rose. As a result, only 42 counts rose by 30,000 yuan compared with the previous week, and the rest were flat. Cotton spinning, Shenxin, Rongfeng, Anda, and Tongyi bought it, and the cotton industry was busy closing at the end of the year. Fine lint fell by 5,000 yuan per dan, and seed cotton fell by 500 yuan. Cotton cloth dyeing and weaving factories searched for white blank fine cloth, and each piece rose by 2,000 yuan. Colored cloth and 16-pound coarse cloth had few outlets, and were weak by 1,000 yuan. The arrival of fuel coal blocks has increased slightly, and each ton fell by 10,000 yuan. Coal dust is slightly firm due to wage relations, and coal balls are popular for high-quality goods and weak for inferior goods. Firewood hawkers cross the year to sell, and the price has dropped slightly by 100 yuan. Tea is sold well for New Year gifts, and the Yingkou gang also bought it. Medium flag guns and jasmine green tea each reached 140,000 to 50,000 yuan per dan. Sugar from Taiwan has arrived, and the price of medium sand sold at 440 yuan per catty has softened the hearts of the people. Matches and soap are being searched for by the North China gang and are trending up. Cigarettes are sold well on this street, and the Unified Tax Bureau has increased the tax rate. British and American Yizhong cigarettes have risen by 10%, and the Great Britain brand is particularly popular. Chinese cigarettes have only risen by 50%. The paper industry has been investing in goods by the guest gang. Although it is said that foreign goods have arrived, the market price has reached another peak. White paper has risen to 26,000 yuan per ream. Western medicines are firm, and industrial raw materials are generally flat due to cheap overseas orders. American caustic soda is 220,000 yuan per barrel of 600 catties, which is 50,000 yuan less than the previous week.

### Tinplate Rises Again, Wire Nails Have Fallen Back

There was once a rumor that tinplate had arrived, and the price had also returned slightly. After confirming that it was not true, the market returned to prosperity. For example, 200-pound double-linked tinplate was sold from 75,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per box, and yesterday a certain number sold it for 100,000 yuan, setting a new record.

The smooth sales of wire nails in the past two or three months were the best in the big hardware industry. Until recently, transactions have gradually become light, and there is a tendency for prosperity to be difficult to continue. The green factory has been producing an endless stream, and customers' stomachs have been full, and they have temporarily stopped purchasing. Therefore, the market is hovering and there is a slight return wind.

### Economic Briefing

Commercial money houses and banks, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, should pay 20% of their deposit balance to the Central Bank as a reserve. According to the Central Bank's banking bureau, as of now, the Shanghai side has received a deposit reserve of 5 billion yuan, which is still increasing.

The Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau has gradually taken over the enemy and puppet import and export trade and business. Among them, the materials that can be exported, such as raw silk, tung oil, leather, etc., are worth hundreds of millions. It is planned to sort out, transport and export them separately, and set up a fifth group in the bureau to be responsible for this.

The Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the cigarette tax rate for machine-made cigarettes was 100%, and the tax rate for handmade cigarettes was 60%. Now, in order to promote the improvement of handmade cigarettes, the tax authorities have revised the tax rate for handmade cigarettes to 100% from this month.

The latest tax regulations of the Guangdong Customs are that all goods imported from Hong Kong must be taxed, even if they are domestic products. Only domestic products shipped to the province by the original ship and not loaded and unloaded in Hong Kong can be granted tax-free treatment. Therefore, Shanghai and Guangdong merchants plan to transport them directly internally to avoid trouble.

The Guangdong Customs' tax revenue in September last year was more than 4 million yuan, more than 16 million in October, four times more than in September, 150 million in November, and more than 300 million in December.

The Jing'an Temple Office of the Postal Savings Bureau is located at No. 9 Haige Road and will open on the 28th.

The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will put a large number of kerosene on sale from now on.

The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will sell a large number of steel pipes, which were recently shipped from the United States. The inner diameter is about 6 inches, about 9 tons, a total of 400, about 10,000 feet in total length, but the pipe has no attachments and reducing sections, and there are no threads at both ends. Those who want to buy can contact the finance department of the department from now on.

The China National Federation of Industries suggested to the National Bank that since most of the equipment of factories and mines is old, and there has been little opportunity to supplement and replace them during the Anti-Japanese War, when factories and mines order foreign equipment, they should separately collect a percentage of the payment for the goods, issue letters of credit or provide guarantees, and pay for the goods on behalf of the equipment upon arrival, and recover the money in installments. It is heard that the National Bank is forwarding the letter to the relevant parties for review.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the small machinery factories established in the accompanying capital were all shut down. The authorities recently approved the closure of the fourth, fifth and sixth batches and purchased their equipment, so that a total of 89 factories could dismiss their employees. Most of them are machinery factories, and the rest are electrical appliance factories. Thirteen factories have partially suspended operations, and the rest have completely suspended operations.

### An Example of Filling in Book Capital

[Our newspaper] Since the implementation of industrial and commercial registration, the issue of filling in the amount of capital has been a problem because the instructions of the Ministry have not yet been issued. Recently, Sun Rui and others from the Shanghai Paint and Wood Industry Rectification Committee have proposed that the industry is similar to contracting and has no fixed capital. It is planned to fill in the value of the existing surplus materials and the property in the store according to the current currency. It has been approved.

### The Exchange Rate Has Not Been Determined, It Is Difficult for the Import and Export Industry to Develop, It Is Said That White Paper Will Arrive Next Month

[Our newspaper] All the importers and exporters in Shanghai are waiting for the publication of the exchange rate.

The first to receive foreign orders were Chinese medicinal materials stores. After the victory, the prices in Shanghai generally fell, but the so-called "Yingkou goods" among Chinese medicines were an exception because there was a way to Australia. The so-called "Yingkou goods" are named after the transshipment in Yingkou. Most of them are produced in the northeastern provinces. Unexpectedly, the order in the Northeast has not been restored after the victory, and Yingkou has become an important military stronghold. Therefore, the source of goods is cut off, and even the needs of this street cannot be supplied, let alone exports. However, medicinal material merchants said that they are unwilling to take the extremely high risk to do export business before the exchange rate is determined.

Among the American import and export firms, Haining Foreign Company can be a representative. Their Beauty brand candy, which was produced before the war, has long been famous in Shanghai, but their search for eggs in various parts of our country and transportation to Europe and the United States (especially the United Kingdom) has a longer history and a larger scale. Recently, they have ordered a large number of white paper from the United States, and the first batch can arrive in Shanghai next month. Now, the firm has resumed business, and Mr. Haining, the American person in charge, has also arrived in Shanghai, but it is still not easy to promote business. The largest source of eggs is the Jinpu Line area, and it is currently impossible to send people to purchase them in the Jinpu Line area. Although paper will be available soon, they also find it difficult to determine the most accurate price before the exchange rate is published.

Before the war, Jardine Matheson was a company that specialized in "producing" the director-general of the Public Concession Public Bureau. In the era when foreigners held consular jurisdiction, their power was really hot. Now the second branch in Chongqing has moved to Shanghai, but first, like Swire, the right to navigate inland rivers has been cancelled, and the previously popular "Swire ship" and "Jardine ship" will become historical terms. They said, "We have ships and people, and China is currently feeling the lack of transportation and talent. We always hope to give us a chance." Among the export departments of Jardine Matheson, silk is a very important department. Some have been shipped out after the war, but after they get a US dollar, they can only "borrow" 500 yuan in legal currency from the Shanghai Bank of China, and the procedures are quite troublesome. If you look at it purely from the perspective of profit, it is more profitable to sell silk in Shanghai than to transport it to the United States, because the price of silk in Shanghai is already quite high, and after the transaction, you can receive all the goods to provide for turnover. Ordinary people may think that after domestic goods are sold in foreign countries, they may be able to use this money to buy foreign goods back, so not only can they avoid the impact of the delayed publication of the exchange rate, but also the profit can be more abundant. However, that senior official of Jardine Matheson told me that this is not allowed by the government. He also said that import transactions are also extremely difficult. The first is that foreign ships are currently also subject to control, and the second is that the funds in British and American banks are still frozen, and you can't buy anything without money.

The association has sent letters to municipal government agencies such as the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting assistance.

### City Elementary School Teachers Hold a Living Security Meeting

[New Shanghai News] Since the soaring of prices, the number of out-of-school children in Shanghai has increased year by year. Schools cannot unreasonably increase tuition fees to make up for the shortfall, and thus their finances are in a precarious situation. In addition, some school administrators only seek personal gain and lack a deep interest in education or a true understanding of educational principles. Seeing that the education business is no longer as profitable as it once was, and unwilling to reduce their own comfortable lifestyles, they resort to changing their approach, considering salary cuts and layoffs. Recently, some private elementary school principals in Shanghai have been using capitalist tactics to oppress teachers, resulting in the innocent dismissal and unemployment of teachers who work for a sacred cause. Furthermore, meager salaries that cannot sustain personal livelihoods have become almost universal. If this situation continues, where will the living security of teachers be? The Shanghai Elementary School Teachers Joint Advancement Association, in view of this, held the first board meeting of the Elementary School Teachers Living Security Promotion Association yesterday (the 27th) at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road, to draft documents and make a general appeal to all sectors of society.

### Guangdong Province Orders Private Middle Schools to Develop Resumption Plans; Failure to Resume Classes Before Autumn Will Be Considered Automatic Closure

[Dahua News Agency, Guangzhou] The Guangdong Provincial Government, in light of the large number of private middle schools that have not yet resumed classes since the victory, has formulated measures for handling private middle schools that have not resumed classes. They are required to develop resumption plans by the end of February of the 35th year (1946) through the school board, send personnel to prepare for resumption, and report for record. They are also required to resume classes before the autumn of the 35th year (1946). Those who fail to comply will be considered to have automatically closed, and their school board registration and school registration will be revoked, and they will not be allowed to use the school name to enroll students in the future. The original students of the schools that have not resumed classes may carry their academic certificates to other schools for auditing. As for private middle schools that have automatically closed, their school properties will be liquidated by local county and city governments in conjunction with the school board, and reported for approval. The school board and school seals should be cut off and handed over for cancellation. The original students should be issued transfer certificates by the school for transfer purposes, and a list must be submitted to the provincial government. Schools that accept the above-mentioned auditing students should conduct placement exams and assign them to appropriate classes according to their level.

### Lixin Accounting School Actively Planning Expansion

[Our Newspaper] The Lixin Accounting School in this city was founded by Mr. Pan Xulun. When the Pacific War broke out, it moved to Beibei, Sichuan, and was approved by the Ministry of Education to open classes. It also established an evening accounting school in downtown Chongqing to facilitate the studies of working youth, and the school's operations were quite vigorous. Now, after a resolution by the school board, it will cease enrolling new students from this spring and return to Shanghai. However, in order to take care of the educational needs of young people in Sichuan, the current senior vocational courses will be expanded into a senior accounting vocational school to continue cultivating accounting talents in the southwest. On the Shanghai side, after the decision to return to school, it is also actively planning expansion. It is reported that this spring, it plans to recruit 100 new students with high school diplomas or equivalent qualifications, divided into day and night classes. The duration of study is set at two years for the day class and two and a half years for the night class. There is also an attached accounting training course that graduates in one and a half years. Originally, there were 80 public-funded students subsidized by the Ministry of Education, with full tuition and board fees waived. It is now planned to apply to the Ministry of Education in Shanghai this spring to recruit a number of such students. However, the school's existing campus on Henan Road is insufficient to accommodate them, so Mr. Pan Xulun has donated five of his private houses on Rue Poussin to the school as part of its campus. It is also reported that the school plans to be renamed a business school in the near future and add a five-year accounting specialization program. It is currently working on raising a construction fund of 500 million yuan in stages. The first phase plans to raise about 200 million yuan first, and then gradually build school buildings on the Hongqiao Road campus purchased before the war, so as to last forever.

### Yesterday's Football League: Qingbai Beats Hequn, Score is Five to One

Yesterday morning's football league was not held due to venue issues. In the afternoon, the Class A match between Qingbai and Hequn was held as scheduled. Qingbai was even stronger yesterday with the help of Cao Qiuting, but the absence of Li Yichen and Fei Chunhua was a mixed blessing. As a result, Qingbai defeated Jinqun by a score of five to one.

Special Issue on Production and Construction

### Editorial Purpose

— Editor

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, various construction projects need to be actively launched. In the past few months, because everything needs considerable time to return to normal, there has been no concrete result to date.

However, we must not wait, we must not delay, we must step up our work and move forward. Among the various construction projects, economic construction is the focus of all construction, and it is the priority of all construction. If we want to promote economic construction, then engaging in production is imperative. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said in the Supreme Economic Committee: "In carrying out this important construction and development work, this committee must recognize the problems of our country and must not only hope that other countries will help solve them. We must help ourselves." The so-called helping ourselves is nothing more than "self-reliance." If we want to be "self-reliant," then the most reasonable way is to work hard to produce, and then enter the stage of construction through production.

At present, there are many difficulties and problems in engaging in production. But because of this, we need to discuss and study together, so that we can open up a path in the midst of thousands of hardships; and sort out a thread in the midst of thousands of things. Therefore, at this time, publishing a special issue on production and construction once a week can enable the industrial sector engaged in production to express their opinions and provide research and reference for all parties; describe difficulties and enable the government to provide assistance; and introduce world trends so as to encourage progress. The mission of this publication lies in these three points: but to complete the mission of this publication, we also need the cooperation and correction of readers.

### Mr. Qian Changzhao Talks About: The Style of Industrial Construction

— Fei Wen

Recently, Mr. Qian Changzhao, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, gave a speech saying that the style of industrial construction should be "large, fast, and early." He explained the "large" point, saying that in the past, China's construction was too scattered, and in the future, we should build the new China on a large scale. Only with grand strokes can we meet the great era. We should use people when we should use them, and we should use money when we should use it. Regarding the "fast" point, China's construction in the past was too slow. The environment was certainly not good, but the general fear of taking responsibility and not seeking merit, but seeking no fault, was also a very important reason. In the future, people who are responsible for economic construction must have the courage to take responsibility and move forward. Even if there are some mistakes in the process of economic construction, the government and society should forgive them. Regarding the "early" point, China's construction in the past was often pushed too late, looking left and right, and not daring to start. Therefore, we missed the time. In the future, construction must have a spirit of experimentation. If a thing has a 60-70% chance of success, it must be promoted. The perfect environment will never come.

The three points of large, fast, and early that Mr. Qian said are in fact a whole planning problem. With a plan, it can be easily implemented. The biggest mistake Chinese people make in doing things is that they do not have concrete plans. At this time, planning should be more in line with the environment. With a plan, it can be implemented in the three ways of large, fast, and early.

Regarding the whole plan, we can refer to the written opinion recently issued by President Song for the China Textile Construction Company on the situation of Japanese yarn and cloth in foreign markets. The original text said: "Before this war, Japan's yarn and cloth market in foreign countries was about 300 million US dollars per year. Most of the raw materials used were obtained from our country. Each group of Japanese textile industry must have competition among themselves in their own country, but in foreign countries, they take unified action. Whether in transportation, finance, or insurance, the government and various enterprise organizations form a whole. Thus, the profit and loss belong to the whole calculation, so they can have such success?"

The situation described by President Song is exactly what the Chinese industrial sector should do now. If we implement it according to that situation, we can adopt the "large, fast, and early" style and achieve success.

### Building Light Industry and Wood Thread Industry

— Luo Liqun

In order to make readers understand the situation of each factory, this publication will introduce the past efforts and future direction of a factory in each issue. This issue is specially invited Mr. Luo Liqun, the person in charge of China Flying Wheel Thread Factory, to write an article to explain the situation of the wood thread industry — Editor

1. Building a Country and National Industrialization

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the work that should be done head-on is to industrialize the country. In advanced countries, high-speed industrial equipment has advanced to the atomic age, but in our country, because of the war, even a little bit of weak industrial foundation has been destroyed. For the sake of the next hundred years, we really should immediately start to work hard on the task of national industrialization.

2. Heavy Industry and Light Industry

The construction of national industrialization can be divided into two aspects: national defense industry and people's livelihood industry. National defense industry is heavy industry, such as shipbuilding, railways, aviation, automobiles, steelmaking, etc., which requires huge capital, abundant resources, and outstanding talents, and needs the promotion of the government and the assistance of allied countries. People's livelihood industry is light industry, such as textiles, thread making, paper making, etc., which is relatively easy to achieve with the strength of our national capital. Therefore, from the standpoint of those of us engaged in industry, the most important work is to first work hard on the construction of light industry in our own position. With the large population and large consumption of our country, we can first achieve self-sufficiency, and then develop outwards. Therefore, if we work hard, the future of China's light industry is unlimited.

3. From the Textile Industry, Discuss the Importance of the Wood Thread Industry

Among the general people's livelihood industries, the textile industry can be said to be the most important, because the textile industry can solve one of the four major elements of life—clothing. To make or a piece of clothing, there must be thread. In the handicraft era, we had domestic silk thread and native yarn available, so wood thread was not valued. However, the technology of making clothes has progressed to using sewing machines instead of hand-making. At the same time, because of the development of urban industry, Western-style clothes have gradually become popular, and wood thread has become a necessity for making clothes. Its use has reached every household from the clothing industry, and the sales are wide. Therefore, the British-made Lien Tiao brand and the Russian-made Earth brand were sold all over the world before the war, and were imported in large quantities. Even in poor rural areas, they were household names.

4. The Budding of National Products

Around 1925-26, because of the wide sales of the Lien Tiao brand, it gradually attracted the attention of Chinese people, who started to manufacture it. However, because the capital, equipment, and raw materials of the domestic wood thread industry were not as good as imported products, they failed one after another.

The China Flying Wheel Thread Factory happened to be established in 1927 to compete with foreign goods. At that time, the Flying Wheel brand was highly trusted in the market, and gradually reversed the decline of the domestic wood thread industry. Unexpectedly, the Cotton & Hua Yang Company used the special rights of foreigners in China to set up a factory in Shanghai to manufacture the Fortune Peach brand wood thread, competing with the Flying Wheel. It used its strong capital to adopt a sales policy of buying one ro and giving two dozen as a means to plunder the market, giving the domestic Flying Wheel industry serious pressure. At that time, although the Flying Wheel Factory was at a disadvantage in terms of capital disparity, it did not retreat. At the same time, the author went to North China, Northeast China, Guangzhou and Hong Kong and other places to investigate, and opened up another sales channel to maintain production, while constantly improving the technology and making various preparations.

5. The Rise of National Products

After a period of silence, the domestic wood thread industry saw the increasingly tense situation in the European War in 1938, and foreign goods gradually became scarce in China. When the war broke out, overseas Chinese businessmen in Nanyang were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and came to Shanghai to purchase domestic goods one after another, giving the domestic wood thread industry a chance to revive. The Flying Wheel Factory, after more than ten years of hard work and research, had improved its production technology to be no less than that of foreign goods, and its production equipment was also becoming more and more complete. Because of the achievements in production equipment work, it was greatly welcomed by overseas Chinese businessmen, and the sales in Singapore, Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Siam, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other islands in Nanyang, and even as far as South America, had a tendency to exceed demand, and its reputation was comparable to that of the Lien Tiao brand. At that time, not only the Flying Wheel Factory, but also other thread factories, benefited from the overseas Chinese businessmen and showed a significant flourishing atmosphere.

6. Surviving in Difficulties

Just when the domestic wood thread industry was thriving, the Pacific War broke out, and sales in various parts of Nanyang were suddenly cut off. At that time, because the war zone in the country was expanding, the Japanese invaders vigorously implemented a blockade policy, followed by the puppet government's purchase of yarn and cloth. The domestic wood thread industry was subjected to the dual devastation of sales and raw materials. They all held a negative attitude, thinking that they had fallen into a desperate situation, and closed down or switched to other industries one after another. At that time, the Flying Wheel Factory was of course unavoidable from the same encounter and the same misfortune, but it was never pessimistic. On the one hand, it reduced production, and on the other hand, it launched and developed in this city, and worked hard to promote sales. Finally, because of its excellent quality, it first advanced to Yong'an, Sincere, New New China National Goods and other companies, and then expanded to various Chinese and foreign department stores. In less than a year, the Flying Wheel brand wood thread could be seen everywhere in the city. Although it could not be as prosperous as the period when it was exported to Nanyang, it could also occupy the top spot in the city.

At the same time, in addition to painstakingly maintaining its inherent position, it also silently expanded production preparations, purchased factory sites, added self-made wood thread machines, self-prepared dyeing, and pre-set splicing thread bobbins, cone bobbins, and automatic machines and other precision machinery, hoping to become the only thread factory in the country with perfect equipment after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

7. Future Work and Tasks

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the standard of living will inevitably be considerably improved. In the past, in order to live and save materials, we wore broken yellow clothes, and now it is time for us to change our clothes. At the same time, the construction of the country also needs the efforts of the thread making industry, so the prospects for thread making can be said to be just beginning to flourish.

8. Export Trade and Competition with Foreign Goods

Our construction of light industry should not be satisfied with self-sufficiency. We should win back the money that has been lost for the country and lay a strong foundation for the country. Therefore, we must pay attention to export trade. Nanyang is the best target for us to strive for export trade, because overseas Chinese in Nanyang are more enthusiastic about patriotism than those in the country, and Nanyang has a vast territory and a large population, and needs are urgent, so as long as the quality is excellent, it will not be difficult to develop.

In the country, we have two hopes. On the one hand, we must pay attention to the re-import of foreign countries. We must work hard to improve the quality so that it can be comparable to foreign countries. On the other hand, we hope that Chinese people will cherish the products of manufacturers operated by Chinese people, so that domestic products can be widely sold and promoted, and the result is still that Chinese people benefit themselves.

### The Merits of the TVA Organization

— Wang Ying

TVA is the abbreviation for the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. Established twelve years ago, it is one of the outstanding achievements of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a visionary American statesman. It not only revitalized a vast, undeveloped region of America and rescued the American economy from panic, but also contributed greatly to the democratic arsenal during this great war.

China's Yangtze River Three Gorges hydropower project is already underway. Its future is of great importance to China's future industrialization and the fate of the people's lives and wealth.

Regarding the TVA's organization, two points are worth highlighting and can serve as a reference for general industries. These are that the authority has advisors, a secretary, and a general manager under the board of directors, and under the general manager, there are a director-general of publicity and a director-general of budget. Below these are various working departments.

The fact that the authority has specifically established directors-general for publicity and budget demonstrates the importance it places on these areas. This is precisely what the Chinese industrial sector generally neglects.

The Chinese industrial sector has always overlooked publicity, believing that it is not important. This is evident in the general practice of factories refusing visitors, which illustrates the neglect of publicity work. No factory has any secrets that need to be kept. The strengths of a factory can be used as a reference for outsiders or fellow businesses, which will lead to progress. Furthermore, the need for transparency necessitates proper and organized management. Therefore, the industrial sector should welcome visits and accept external criticism.

At the same time, publicity work can be divided into two aspects: external and internal. External publicity involves explaining the need and value of a particular industry, attracting social attention and sympathy. Internal publicity can make employees understand that the work they are participating in is meaningful and valuable. With internal and external consistency, rapid development can be achieved. Furthermore, publicity should be based entirely on facts, and good publicity requires good factual performance. Good factual performance is progress.

Regarding the budget, it is closely related to the success or failure of an enterprise. However, Chinese industries generally only have estimations, not budgets. Even if there is a budget, it is a partial budget. Therefore, it is impossible to study the difference between the final accounts and the budget.

With a budget, a concrete plan can be formulated. For example, if a project is to be completed in five years, it becomes a five-year plan. This five-year plan is part of the budgeting work.

Moreover, budgeting and publicity can complement each other. Based on the budget, facts can be communicated through publicity. The budget and publicity become the soul of the entire organization. With the division of labor and cooperation among various departments, progress can naturally be smooth. Therefore, the merits of the TVA are worth emulating.

### The Budding Underwear Industry

— Fu Liangjun

Speaking of the underwear industry, its history is not long. It is only in the last decade or so that Chinese people have started wearing Western clothing, which has gradually become popular. When wearing Chinese clothing, underwear was not particularly important, and sewing machines were not needed. The start of the underwear industry, like other industries, gradually expanded from a very humble position. In the beginning, only one or two people were needed to buy raw materials and engage in cutting and sewing to produce goods. There was no talk of quality or standards at all. Therefore, those engaged in underwear manufacturing did not have long-term vision or sufficient knowledge.

However, times are progressing. Due to the increasing demand from all aspects, the production volume of underwear has gradually increased. As the public's ability to discern quality gradually strengthens, underwear manufacturing must gradually pay attention to technology and standards.

Recalling the establishment of the Xinguang Standard Underwear Factory more than ten years ago, it was simply because there was a need for better shirts on the market. We operated it in our spare time. Because the demand increased day by day, and because we focused on quality, the organization gradually expanded, and sales gradually became widespread. As a result, the underwear sector became an industry in itself. At its peak, there were more than one hundred companies in the same industry.

The underwear business has now reached a point where it is recognized by all sectors as a novel and promising enterprise. From its inception to the present, it has gone through many difficulties and setbacks. However, each difficulty has strengthened the determination to move forward because no business can develop in a straight line.

Taking the Xinguang Standard Underwear Factory as an example, at the beginning of the war of resistance against Japan, it had already been selling to various parts of Southeast Asia, where it occupied an excellent position. However, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation was cut off, and it had to be sold domestically. Although the impact on the industry was not as great as on Xinguang, the situation was the same. What followed was the government monopoly of cotton cloth, which brought production to a near standstill.

Originally, there are two ways to run a business: one is to adapt to the environment, and the other is to create the environment. When the future is uncertain, the only way to overcome all difficulties is to create the environment. After the government monopoly of cotton cloth was implemented, in order to achieve the expected goals, we spared no effort to build the Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing and Weaving Factory, so that raw materials could be self-supplied. Therefore, the quality was more guaranteed, the output was no longer a problem, and society had a deeper understanding of the underwear industry. The efforts of the industry are also an important factor in this.

As for the future of the underwear industry, I believe it is just beginning to flourish. As the number of people wearing Western clothing will increase day by day, as long as both quality and quantity can be taken into account and progress is made together, domestic sales will definitely increase day by day. At the same time, there is great potential for exports because "clothing" is one of the four essential elements of life. Recently, President Song published a written statement in Shanghai, saying that the government has instructed the China Textile Construction Corporation to lead the textile industry in a short period of time. At the same time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other Chinese shipping companies' foreign routes, the state bank's foreign exchange bank, and China's insurance companies will jointly assist in order to obtain the 300 million US dollars worth of Japanese yarn that used to be on the market abroad every year.

Manufacturing underwear not only requires yarn and cloth as raw materials, but also the price of underwear includes the labor wages of workers who make the underwear. Therefore, if underwear is exported, it can not only obtain the profits that should be obtained on yarn and cloth, but also obtain the wages needed by Chinese workers from abroad. Therefore, if the underwear business can be coordinated with all aspects, the future is quite bright. On the occasion of the founding of the Shen Bao Production and Construction Weekly, the editor asked me to contribute an article, so I have described the general situation to encourage my colleagues in the industry.

### Mr. Hu Xiyuan Talks About the Situation in the Industrial Sector

— Xu Baiyi

In order to let all parties know about the situation in the industrial sector, this publication intends to maintain regular contact with the industrial sector and listen to opinions. Recently, we interviewed Mr. Hu Xiyuan, who had just arrived in Shanghai from the rear. Mr. Hu moved his factory to Sichuan when the war started in 1937. He only arrived in Shanghai two weeks ago. He really was the first to leave and the last to return. Therefore, he has personally experienced all the hardships of the industrial sector in the rear during the War of Resistance and knows them in the most detail.

We used a conversational approach, from the industrial sector in the rear during the War of Resistance to the prospects of the industrial sector in the future, as well as the expectations of the industrial sector for people from all walks of life. Now, we have summarized Mr. Hu's opinions into the following points.

The Industrial Sector in the Rear During the War of Resistance

During the War of Resistance, many factories moved to the rear with the government. The general idea was to contribute their strength to the government to enhance the power of resistance. Therefore, many talented people went to the rear and buried themselves in hard work. Some directly participated in the work of resisting Japan, such as manufacturing military supplies. Some indirectly participated in the work of resisting Japan, such as making extensive use of substitutes (for example, the copper used in light bulbs could be used to make cartridge cases, so magnetic lamp holders were used). At the same time, due to the lack of materials, everything was ten times more difficult than usual. For example, due to the lack of coal, several factories had to gather together and go directly to the coal-producing areas to dig coal. Many projects originally required the use of metal products, but had to be replaced with wood, and they went to forests hundreds of miles away to select wood. All substitutes that could be used were used. For example, turpentine oil was used to replace rosin, and synthetic gasoline was used to replace gas. There are countless examples like this. Therefore, the industrial sector only sought to cope with the environment and could no longer seek progress in technology. However, this kind of environmental control broke the unbreakable bad habit of generally sticking to old methods. Previously, many engineers who manufactured goods would not use anything other than a specified product. Even if it was the same British product, they would not use it if the brand was changed. However, during the War of Resistance, there were no foreign goods available at all, so they turned their attention to all the materials available in China and utilized them.

Industrial Bankruptcy After Victory

In the early days of the War of Resistance, most factories operated according to the right track, hoping to obtain legitimate profits in addition to operating. However, due to the decreasing use of materials and inflation, prices rose day by day, so the figures on the books became increasingly large, but the actual inventory of the factory became increasingly weak. Originally, one hundred kinds of goods could be manufactured, but after the goods were sold, only the raw materials for eighty goods could be replenished. After several turns, the numbers became larger and larger, and the foundation of the factory became more and more dangerous. At the same time, due to the large numbers, the profits were very substantial on the surface, and the government's tax revenue also became a very large amount. Many factories, in order to pay taxes, even borrowed from the financial sector and then paid taxes, or sold machinery to raise money to cope with the situation. This situation of "virtual profit and actual tax" lasted for several years, and by the end of the War of Resistance, the industrial sector in the rear was already very dangerous. After the victory came, the price of goods plummeted, and it became unmanageable. Most factories could not survive and could not die. To survive, they really had no strength. To die, they could not even raise money for liquidation fees. In this situation, they only hoped that the government could sympathize with those factories and the contributions they made to the government during the War of Resistance. They moved to the rear because they really wanted to fulfill a little of their national responsibility. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, their businesses have reached a point where they cannot survive. If the government does not provide assistance, then the industrial sector will have to sacrifice many hardworking members, and many hardworking specialized talents will be displaced. Therefore, helping the industrial sector in the rear is closely related to the future of the country.

Future Industrial Development Should Be Balanced

Regarding the future of industry, it should be distributed evenly throughout the country. Concentrating it in one place is not a good idea. The industrial sector in Shanghai can distribute their businesses to at least the Yangtze River basin. This will gradually improve land prices and living standards in various places, and prevent the formation of prosperity in one place due to the distorted development of one area.

Regarding the management of industry, as long as you work hard and bury yourself in hard work, the future is promising. Because regarding capital, if it is not enough, you can attract idle funds in the market. As long as the factory is run effectively, people are willing to invest. Regarding technology, you may wish to adopt the latest methods from advanced countries. You can hire foreign technicians and send specialized talents abroad to study, training talents in batches. Then, although we cannot compete with foreign factories, we will at least not lag behind to what extent. Therefore, the industrial sector in the future must hold on to their positions and work hard, but this fake position should be a new type of position. They must use a farsighted attitude to absorb the new knowledge of advanced countries and use it as much as possible in the country. At the same time, they must continue to work hard to catch up.

At present, labor-management disputes in Shanghai are occurring several times a day, and strikes are everywhere. At a time when Chinese industry is awakening and starting to move forward, in addition to various other issues, if labor issues cannot be resolved, then it will have a great impact on the future of the industrial sector. For the sake of survival in the future, labor and management should understand each other and coordinate with each other. Management must not exploit labor, and labor must not coerce management. Both sides should understand that they are interdependent and cannot be in an adversarial position. If there is no background, they may as well have a calm and rational dialogue. If there is a background, then do not be used by others.

Living Standards Should Match the Environment

Finally, we must talk about the issue of imported goods. This issue is indeed the most serious issue facing the industrial sector at present. Because foreign factories have new equipment and many talents, new inventions emerge one after another, and they are changing with each passing day. Moreover, because they produce in large quantities, their costs are reduced, and when they are sold in China, the price is even lower than that of domestic goods. In this situation, even if the Chinese industrial sector uses all its strength, it will not be able to compete. The only hope is that the general public should understand the situation of their own country. Because the target of the industrial sector's production is the general public, if the general public abandons the products of Chinese factories, then the Chinese industrial sector might as well be completely destroyed. But after the destruction, it is still the Chinese public who will suffer the consequences. Therefore, the general public must really take a long-term view. At this moment, they cannot simply seek enjoyment in life. They must take into account the situation of the Chinese industrial sector everywhere and try their best to support the Chinese industrial sector and use the products of the Chinese industrial sector. Then, the Chinese industrial sector can grow and prosper, and then the people's livelihood will be stable, and naturally they can enjoy a life of peace and prosperity. If they blindly believe in imported goods and raise their living standards higher than those of the United States, then by the time it is appropriate, the national economy will be completely bankrupt, and the general public will not have a stable life to live.
