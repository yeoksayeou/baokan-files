### Departure Location Still to be Determined; Northeast Mediation Work Difficult; Chen Cheng to Participate in Three Military Groups

[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] Regarding the allocation of locations for the Northeast Executive Headquarters' groups, the government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have not yet reached an agreement. However, the general consensus is that, in addition to the Jiyang Central Group, Liaoyang, Sipingjie, and Yingkou are all likely locations for dispatching groups.

[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] The Northeast mediation work faces numerous difficulties. Government personnel believe that the only solution is to assist the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) in taking over [territory], which should not affect the NRA's takeover. Rao Rushishi, the CCP's leader in the Northeast Executive Headquarters, stated that both sides' troops must cease troop movements.

[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] The Military Three-Person Group may come to the North soon, and together with Executive Headquarters members Zheng Jiemin, Ye Jianying, and Robertson, will go to the Northeast to give instructions on mediation work.

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen announced today that Minister of Military Affairs Chen Cheng has been appointed by General Zhang Zhizhong as the government representative of the "Military Three-Person Group." The group will hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today to discuss going to the Northeast as soon as possible. However, Wu expressed doubt about Chen Cheng's ability to go to the Northeast due to his poor health. General Zhou Enlai attended the meeting today, accompanied by General Ye Ting, the former commander of the New Fourth Army.

[United Press, Shenyang, 3rd] The four teams of the Executive Group of the Mediation Executive Headquarters are currently awaiting the definition of their powers in the Northeast. Both the Nationalist and Communist sides seem quite indifferent to them. According to reliable sources, General G. R. Bair, the director of the Executive Group of the Mediation Executive Headquarters, may fly to Changchun to discuss with the Soviet authorities the dispute between the Nationalists and Communists over taking over Changchun after the Soviet troops withdraw. It is believed that the Military Three-Person Group will arrive here next week to give instructions to the local commanders in the Northeast because, as of now, they have not received any instructions on how to treat the Executive Groups going to the Northeast.

[United Press, Shenyang, 2nd] A small misunderstanding occurred at the airport here today. When the Communist delegation arrived, it was stopped by the NRA and detained for four hours before being cleared up. NRA generals and American representatives repeatedly apologized to the Communist personnel. The misunderstanding was caused by unclear translation of official orders. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, all plainclothes teams on the streets of Changchun, seemingly with New Fourth Army insignia, have now been ordered to withdraw by the Soviet army. The four senior government representatives of the Stop Conflict Group are reported to have arrived in Jinzhou and can arrive here at any time.

### Yingkou, Niuzhuang, Anshan and Four Other Locations; NRA Took Over Successively Yesterday; There are Battles Near Changchun and Qiqihar

[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] The highest authorities have sent a stern telegram to the Northeast Headquarters, ordering responsible officials of the provinces and cities that have been taken over in the Northeast to remain loyal to their duties under any circumstances and not to retreat without authorization. However, if the situation is absolutely unavoidable, they may retreat with the Soviet army. Currently, the outskirts of Changchun have become chaotic, and Harbin and Qiqihar are also extremely tense. Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province, and Guan Jiyu, Chairman of Songjiang Province, have repeatedly telegraphed the Northeast Headquarters for emergency assistance.

[Our Beiping (Beijing) Office, 3rd] Personnel from the provinces and cities taken over in Northeast China are now ordered to concentrate in Jinzhou for work. Personnel from various provincial governments remaining in Beiping have departed one after another.

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 3rd] In the Liaodong Peninsula, the NRA, overcoming the obstruction of the Communist army, has successively taken over Anshan, Haicheng, Niuzhuang, and Yingkou today.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] The NRA moving north to take over defense yesterday crossed Changtu and reached the vicinity of Sipingjie.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] The Communist army, which occupied Datun, 19 kilometers south of Changchun, on the morning of the 1st, continued to advance 11 kilometers north and occupied Mengjiatun at 10:00 PM on the 2nd. Thus, the vanguard of the Communist army advancing north along the Chinese Changchun Railway (later part of the Chinese Eastern Railway) was only 8 kilometers away from the Changchun Railway Station. At around 8:00 PM on the 3rd, the Communist army came to the vicinity of the airport again, and battles were ongoing.

[Another Dispatch] It is learned that, in addition to the Chinese Changchun Railway, 1,900 kilometers of railways in the Northeast have been dismantled, almost equivalent to two Tianjin-Pukou Railways or five Jiaoji Railways. Bridges and warehouses along the routes have also been blown up. Furthermore, it is reported that most of the ships in the Songhua River are missing, totaling about 200 vessels.

### Terentiy Fomich Shtykov Notifies [Date of] Soviet Troop Withdrawal

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] When Dong Yanping met with Terentiy Fomich Shtykov at 1:00 PM on the 3rd, Shtykov informed Dong in detail of the dates for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from various parts of the Northeast, including Changchun, Harbin, Bei'an, and Jiamusi. None of these dates have been officially announced. However, it is learned that the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from Changchun may be after the 10th, and the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from the last location will be April 30th. Today's meeting failed to completely resolve all outstanding issues, so the two agreed to talk again on the 5th. Also, Qiqihar is currently under siege by the Communist army, which is very urgent. Today, Dong informed Shtykov of this matter, and Shtykov still stated that he would be responsible for its safety before the Soviet troops withdraw. It is also learned that Marshal Rodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky is still in Changchun and may leave before all his troops are withdrawn.

[United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Kai declared that the Sino-Soviet Agreement stipulates that the Soviet army should withdraw from the major ports, but there is no information on whether the Soviet army is actually withdrawing. He also said that economic negotiations have not resumed. Liu also admitted that the area currently under the control of the central government in the Northeast is a small part of that vast and important region.

### Wedemeyer Returns to America Today

[Central News Agency, this city] General Wedemeyer, who has been in China for two years, is scheduled to leave China this morning to return to America. Wedemeyer did not want to be ostentatious, so he told his subordinates not to come to the airport to see him off. Wedemeyer has been fighting alongside the National Army, leading the Allied forces in China, for two years and has made great achievements. In Shanghai in April, he presided over the U.S. Army Headquarters, assisting China's rehabilitation work, which was well received.

### Number of Committee Members Still Under Discussion; Government Reorganization Will Be Delayed; Communist Army Has Not Yet Submitted Registration Forms for Reorganization

[Our Chongqing Office, 3rd] Regarding the reorganization of the government, because the various parties have not finished discussing the number of government committee members, there is no progress yet. However, it is rumored that in the future government, Zeng Qi and Fu Sinian will be appointed as the ministers of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education, respectively. [United Press, Chongqing, 3rd] When talking about the three major points of contention between the Nationalists and Communists, Minister of Propaganda Wu Guozhen said: If the Communists can value their promises, then the Nationalist-Communist disputes may not be resolved. He said: Regarding the reorganization of the National Government, the Communist Party has so far refused to publish a list of members of the National Government Committee. Regarding the Northeast issue, he insisted on the original agreement, that is, the government army can freely enter the Northeast. Regarding the reorganization of the army, Wu said that the government had sent the reorganization numbers to the Communist army for verification on March 25. When asked how the government reacted to the Communist Party's protest against the National Army entering the Northeast on American warships, Wu said: The military commission spokesperson formally denied that the government had sent the 5th Army to the Northeast, and said that the Communist Party distorted the facts to destroy the reorganization agreement and hinder the takeover work. He said that the Communist Party agreed from the beginning, so they are now destroying the agreement. The reorganization plan stipulates that there should be five government armies and one communist army in the Northeast within twelve months. A total of 241,500 National Army troops have arrived in the Northeast or are on their way, while the Communist Party claims to have 300,000 troops, which is ridiculous.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] According to Article 4 of the military reorganization plan, within the specified time limit, the government should prepare a list of the 90 divisions to be retained and the order of demobilization of the troops in the first two months. During the same period, the CCP should prepare a detailed list of its troops, stating their nature, strength, weapons, the names of the commanders above the brigade level, and the locations of each unit, and must include a list of the 18 divisions to be retained and the order of demobilization of the troops in the first two months, etc., and submit them to the military committee. However, despite repeated requests from the committee, the CCP has not yet submitted them. All parties are extremely concerned about this and believe that this is a major test of whether the CCP is sincere in implementing the reorganization plan.

### The First Public Trial of the Major Traitor, Miao Bin, Equivocates, Claiming to Have Been Engaged in "Counter-Espionage Work Against Japan"; Court Orders Sentencing on April 8th

[Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 10 PM on the 3rd] Miao Di, the pseudo-Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, was awaiting trial in the First Criminal Court of the Jiangsu High Court on the afternoon of the 3rd. At 2 PM, six armed bailiffs dispatched by the High Court went to the Sishiqian Street Detention Center to escort the traitor Miao to the High Court's Third Criminal Defendant Waiting Room. The High Court was heavily guarded that day, with two armed bailiffs stationed at the gate. Outside the courtroom door, there were four armed bailiffs, two unarmed, on guard. Inside the courtroom, there were two armed bailiffs and two unarmed attendants. At 2:30 PM, Presiding Judge Shi Meiyu also took his seat, along with Judges Lu Jiarui and Yu Yue, and Court Clerk Zhu Mingqiu, who also took their seats. Prosecutor Li Shudong also attended the court to perform his duties. Soon after, the traitor Miao was brought into the court for questioning. That day, Miao Bin was wearing a drab-colored striped gown, dark blue gabardine trousers, and black leather shoes, and his head was shaved and without a hat. Presiding Judge Shi interrogated him until 4:40 PM, after which Miao was ordered to sit on a chair and rest. Then, Zhou Wei, a member of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan, was called as a witness. Because of his old age, the traitor Zhou was granted a seat for questioning. Following this, Prosecutor Li delivered his opinion. Then, the three defense lawyers, Xie Shuqiang, Zhang Zhu, and Li Fusheng, made their respective defenses. At 5:20 PM, the arguments were concluded. Miao requested that Court Clerk Zhu read aloud his confession. After Miao corrected some errors, he signed the record. The court rejected Miao's and his defense lawyers' request to have the Military Statistics Bureau investigate the evidence. At 6:30 PM, Presiding Judge Shi announced the end of the arguments and ordered that the sentence be pronounced at 2 PM on the afternoon of April 8th. The traitor Miao was returned to custody, and the court was adjourned. That day, reporters and photographers from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai came to Suzhou to cover the event. A large crowd gathered in front of the High Court and the Detention Center, vying to see the true face of the traitor Miao. While the trial was in session, Miao's wife, Xiang Xiujin, also stood outside the courtroom to listen. The newspaper photographers were particularly active. When Miao was brought out of the Detention Center, photographers followed him along the way. During the trial, they were also extremely busy, with the sound of cameras clicking incessantly.

Miao's Confession

According to Miao's confession, he was 44 years old and from Wuxi. When asked about his occupation in court, he replied, "I have always been engaged in politics." He joined the Kuomintang in the 11th year of the Republic [1922] and was never expelled from the party. The presiding judge informed the defendant that he had been prosecuted by the prosecutor under Articles 2, Section 1, and 12 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and asked if he had anything to say. Miao then launched into a grand speech, as if delivering an address. He stated that he was released from the Military Statistics Bureau (Juntongju) and had written a voluminous book entitled "My Work Against Japan" and a defense brief, and that he very much wanted to take this opportunity to publicize the secrets of his ten years of counter-espionage against Japan.

He returned to China from the United States in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], intending to engage in industry.

But witnessing the "Japanese bandits advancing," he sought ways to strengthen the country. Therefore, in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], he wrote "On Military Virtue," published by the Kaiming Bookstore, advocating morality. Later, in Beiping, he met Commander-in-Chief He [Yingqin], and deeply understood that "full-scale resistance was inevitable." Because he knew that there were uprisings within Japan, he wanted to instigate revolution within Japan. In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], he went to Japan, arriving in Tokyo on the eve of the February 26th Incident. The leaders of the incident were also familiar with him. After returning to China, he reported in detail to Commander-in-Chief He, seeking ways to "use the enemy to control the enemy." General Yang Xuancheng, director of the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission, had accompanied him to Japan.

He claimed to advocate "protecting the group with wisdom" rather than "protecting oneself with wisdom." He deeply admired the leader's [Chiang Kai-shek] advocacy of unified resistance, "regardless of north or south, regardless of men, women, old or young." Therefore, he engaged in resistance against Japan in the capacity of "one of the 400 million people." His organization, the "New People's Society," was also engaged in counter-espionage. The New People's Society changed "On Military Virtue" to "New People's Spirit," and "On Military Virtue" had already been publicly sold before the war. At that time, Miao was talking incessantly, oblivious to those around him, and was stopped by the presiding judge, who changed the proceedings to a question-and-answer format.

His reason for not going to the interior to engage in resistance work was "to continue counter-espionage work." However, his "work" had not been reported to the central government before August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943].

In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], Miao, introduced by Xu Xiuzhi, went to Beiping to meet Japanese special agent Yoshino Hiromi and Yoshimura Torao. In January of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], he joined the New People's Society and became its vice-president. The president was Wang Kemin. The New People's Society and the "Great People's Society" and the "Concordia Association" of the puppet Manchukuo had roughly the same purpose, advocating cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and economic promotion. The presiding judge then asked, "Was it to overthrow the Chongqing government?" Miao initially claimed that it was a people's organization, but after being pressed, he replied, "Of course it was." He looked extremely embarrassed.

Miao also joined the so-called "East Asia League." He said that this organization was actually led by Ishiwara Kanji, a Japanese soldier who opposed the July 7th Incident, and that Ishiwara was extremely opposed to Tojo.

Japanese special agents Hideki Tojo, Kai Kaku, and Nemoto Hiroshi, who were Wang Kemin's backers, invited him to participate. "I seized the opportunity," which was in May of the 28th year of the Republic [1939].

Miao claimed to have gone to Japan several times, meeting Japanese military and political figures such as Konoe, Koiso, Itagaki, Araki, and Yamamoto, among others. Although he was a student who studied in the United States, he was proficient in Japanese and did not need an interpreter. In June of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], he met Wang Jingwei and Zhou Fohai at the home of a Japanese man named Koga in Tokyo through Japanese man Imai. It was extremely confidential and they discussed organizing the puppet government. After returning to China, he met Ishiwara Kanji and Prince Higashikuni in Beiping.

In October of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], he left Beiping to see Wang in Nanjing. In the 30th year of the Republic [1941], he served as the vice president of the puppet Legislative Yuan. During this time, he had close contact with Li Changjiang and helped Li to contact Wang to surrender, because Li was originally Miao's subordinate, but Li Mingyang can prove that this was a scheme. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Wang secretly dismissed him for some reason, but on the surface, he was reassigned to another position.

After Wang's death in January of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], Miao claimed that he advocated taking the opportunity to abolish the puppet government and had discussed it with Zhou Fohai and Matsui Iwane. In March of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], "under secret orders from the central government, I discussed with Colonel Yamagata, the secret representative of Koiso, to form a 'Residency' to replace the He [Yingqin] government." At that time, Koiso and Higashikuni were both in favor of peace, but it was abandoned due to opposition from the Japanese field army.

Miao claimed that starting in August of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he joined the Military Statistics Bureau through Station Chief Gu and a female comrade, and had received awards and commendations from Dai Li for his secret reports. At this time, the presiding judge produced a telegram from the Military Statistics Bureau, which, while acknowledging that Miao had made "some contributions," believed that his actions were launched when the Japanese army was already in full retreat, and could not be considered opportunistic. Therefore, they requested that he be prosecuted in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, the court rejected Miao's request to investigate the evidence. It also read aloud the leader's [Chiang Kai-shek] handwritten instructions, which also advocated that Miao be dealt with according to the law. Subsequently, the prosecutor rose to present his case, pointing out that there was no evidence to support any of Miao's defenses. The lawyers Xie Shuqiang, Zhang Zhu, and Ji Fusheng made their defenses one after another, stating that at the very least, consideration should be given to the "Regulations for Traitors' Self-Confession," and expressed regret that Li Mingyang was not investigated. Miao Bin also said, "The contradictions are too sharp in the records, I request an investigation of the evidence, this is too unfair."

[Dispatch from Reuters, Athens, 3rd] The Minister of the Interior announced today that, according to the results of the elections at 3,205 polling stations nationwide, abstentions accounted for 47% of all voters, the People's Party received 53% of the vote, the Center Union received 33%, and the Liberal Party received 13%. Only 200 polling stations nationwide have yet to be announced.

[Dispatch from Associated Press, Athens, 2nd] The Greek People's Party has accepted the Regent's invitation to form a new cabinet. It is heard that many Greeks support the return of King George II. At the same time, the Communist Party and other left-wing groups have protested the election, saying that the vote was invalid.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 3rd] People's Party leader Tsaldaris said yesterday that the plebiscite to decide the King's return should be held as soon as possible, according to popular opinion.

[Another Dispatch] Sources here believe that the statement by Tsaldaris, one of the leaders of the Greek People's Party, that a plebiscite should be held as soon as possible to decide the issue of the monarchy has a significant impact on British-Greek relations. British officials have stated that the policy announced last November, namely that Britain supports postponing the vote until 1948, has not changed. There is no doubt that the British side opposes holding the vote early.

[News from US Information Service, Washington, 2nd] The leaders of the Allied mission observing the Greek elections, US Ambassador Grady, French General de Baral, and British Winterton, issued a statement to the Athens press yesterday: "Whether the Greek elections were fair and free can only be judged after the report prepared by the observation team has been received and evaluated.

[News from US Information Service, Chongqing, 2nd] The New York Times correspondent Stirling stated that China's accusation against Japanese war criminals in Tokyo is progressing well. However, the matter is very complicated. The Chinese government is actively cooperating, but the public does not feel very interested, so it is very difficult to find witnesses to testify in Tokyo. China can provide a lot of physical evidence, but very few witnesses. A Chinese official said, "The Chinese people dare not testify in court because they fear harassment from Japanese underground operatives." Americans, including Morrow, have arrived in China to help China collect evidence, so China's accusation in Tokyo can be prepared.

### A Plea for Children!

Today is the first Children's Day after the victory of the War of Resistance. Since we have had Children's Day, fifteen years have passed in a blink of an eye. For most of these fifteen years, we have lived through the flames of war, and tens of thousands of children have suffered the pain of being poisoned and ravaged. Now that the sky is bright again, and our country is returned to us, our dear children no longer have to leave their homes, no longer have to swallow their anger, and will no longer be forced to undergo enslaving education under the coercion of brutal enemies. They can all return to the embrace of their hometowns and bask in the warmth of the sun. On this auspicious festival, the children must be able to put away their bitter tears and join hands to sing and dance together to celebrate.

However, things turned out unexpectedly. Yesterday, on the eve of Children's Day, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Youchang, a middle school student who had just arrived in Shanghai from the interior. He expressed his disappointment and appealed for the transformation of the current schools, which truly moved us. Let us first excerpt the most important part of his letter below:

"When I first returned to Shanghai, how happy I was! I saw my hometown, the hometown where my footprints had been a few years ago. Last winter when I first arrived in Shanghai, I entered a school with a fairly good reputation. Then I entered this school that is not of the 20th century, and I began to be disappointed! Why? The reason is very simple. Because I have already seen progressive schools. Is its equipment perfect? No! In the great rear area during the War of Resistance, that was out of the question. And the nutrition was just as bad. But at that time, we fully utilized it, making every part of it become a part of our body, and even increasing the health of each of us. But now? Although I can eat food that seems to be very nutritious, it seems that my expectations are further away from me because of this. What I expect is just health. What I am learning is to prepare to compete in the world of the 20th century. But when I arrived in Shanghai, I was disappointed! I can't see the playing fields! I can't see the tents for camping! I can't see volleyball or basketball! Instead, there are pale and thin faces, with an extra pair of glasses on the bridge of the nose. I am confused! I am confused whether the people appearing in front of me are a group of young people! I wonder if I have entered a nursing home! I can't see the spirit of sports, I can't see the spirit of 'work when you work, play when you play,' but instead there is skipping classes, gambling, and dating! Is this their fault? No! This is not their fault, this is the fault of our old predecessors in education! They have deprived the students of every bit of time. But often there are people who praise them, sing their praises, and agree with their whips that exploit students. But this is not entirely their fault either, because they blindly follow some 19th-century ancients who support them. Now we have eight hours of class every day, sometimes even nine hours, which almost drains every drop of our brains. Do we have any extra time for extracurricular activities? Therefore, we have developed a lack of unity and cooperation. I think the reason why foreigners call us a heap of loose sand is because of this. Now I want to talk about what I have experienced. Because the students do not have enough mental and physical strength, they cannot understand what the teacher is saying. Because they cannot understand and because of the tight schedule, the preparation after class is very inadequate, so they fall further behind. Over time, due to both physical and mental factors, they simply stop studying. But what about his extra energy? He uses it for improper entertainment! It leads to the degeneration of young people and blurs the meaning of their lives. As a result, this 19th-century old machine produces two typical types of young people: One, the stooped and hunched, wearing deep glasses, the so-called excellent elements in the style of old scholars from the late Qing Dynasty (but only in the view of some people). They only know how to recite and write from memory, and they receive rewards and praise from some people. But they are just relics of the past and cannot be fighters of the 20th century. They can only be eliminated. Two, the degenerated youth. Sometimes they even utter words like democracy, but their democracy has neither theory nor practice!"

Although Mr. Wang is only a student at a certain middle school, and his letter is written in haste, we can hardly bear to read it after reading this paragraph. It is as if a group of sallow and thin "old mature youths" are making strange faces with their stooped and hunched backs in front of us, and at the same time, it is as if another group of gorgeously dressed young men in suits are chasing after objects, competing with each other in wealth. Indeed, it would be truly terrible if the future masters of China were entirely created from these models! Every Children's Day, I hear about competitions, meetings, and awards. The excitement is exciting, but may I ask how many parents and teachers spend how much energy and time on weekdays to think about children? Speaking of physique, the child mortality rate is as high as 260 to 270 per thousand. Due to the lack of protein, vitamin C, and iron in food, anemia in children has become a general phenomenon. Speaking of knowledge, out-of-school children still account for more than half of the school-age children. Speaking of morality, the poor families who wander and scavenge cannot be talked about, but even in so-called wealthy families, drinking, gambling, listening to books, and watching plays have long become common practices. How can we expect them to cultivate honest and strong young people in these environments of extravagance, luxury, snobbery, and acrimony? When we think about it, if our nation only cares about giving birth to sons and raising daughters, but does not know how to raise them, let alone teach them, and lets them go, we are really sorry to the children and sorry to our ancestors!

The world has now entered the era of atomic energy. Even if mankind is aware and the world is at peace, a person must have a healthy body to enjoy peace and happiness, and a country must have a healthy nation to enjoy peace and happiness. Moreover, peace still depends on the efforts of mankind, and peace must still be maintained by force. We want to study science. To enrich national defense, which one does not need to start with a strong physique? Mr. Wang said that every time he sees the strong foreigners in newsreels or sports films, he is afraid, afraid of the fate of China entrusted to these sick young men! What a shocking appeal!

Therefore, instead of just adding some embellishments to children's happiness on Children's Day, we should all seriously do a few things that are beneficial to children and promote the health of the nation. Without delving into lofty theories, let us put forward the following points to plead for children:

First, we demand that there be absolutely no street children in the city, especially that child beggars not be tolerated. How to organize vocational training centers and the like in the shortest possible time to accommodate and educate all street children, so that they can acquire a skill that is enough to support themselves, is a business that local self-government should have, and it is also the responsibility of the government and all citizens.

Second, we demand that there be no out-of-school children in the city. Popularizing education and eliminating illiteracy are old tunes that have been heard for decades, but unfortunately they have not really been achieved to this day. Assuming that one-tenth of Shanghai's 3.4 million people are school-age children, how to accommodate 340,000 elementary school students into school so that they can really attend classes for free is really a major event for the municipal government. We do not necessarily have to demand that every elementary school student attend six hours of classes a day. If they can attend school for half a day and spend half a day on self-study or sports, it would really be more beneficial.

Third, we demand that the city open up more parks, open spaces, or sports fields, swimming pools, and the like as much as possible, so that children have the opportunity to practice fitness and engage in proper entertainment.

Fourth, we demand that the curricula of primary and secondary schools should be revised as soon as possible, and that we should no longer blindly believe in experts in various subjects, who only care about injecting more knowledge and making the course time excessively heavy, so that students cannot bear the burden and harm their bodies. We believe that it is better to "eat less and savor more" than to "be greedy and not be able to chew." Primary and secondary schools should make music and physical education compulsory subjects for cultivating students' character and physique. On weekends and holidays, we should especially promote hiking and exercise the body and mind. If the physical strength of primary and secondary school students is weak and sickly, even if they have great knowledge, they will still be useless after they grow up!

Fifth, we ask the government and society to establish more physics and chemistry laboratories, children's libraries, and produce and import a large number of educational films, while strictly prohibiting all obscene and criminal books and films, etc., so that children can grow up in a purified society. They have scientific minds and strong bodies, and can stand in the future world trend.

[Our Newspaper] The government has ultimately not disappointed the people's expectations. Since Chen Gongbo has been scheduled to be publicly tried in Suzhou on April 5, many of the major traitors detained in Shanghai have finally been escorted by the military authorities to the judicial organs for handling since yesterday morning.

Early in the morning, the reporter rushed to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison to wait. At 8:35 AM, five large canvas-covered Qingpu trucks successively drove in. Each truck carried about ten people, and each truck had several fully armed soldiers guarding them. Seeing them, their faces were ruddy, they were talking and laughing freely in the car, they were not wearing any shackles or handcuffs, and some were leisurely smoking cigarettes and looking out, and even waving to acquaintances outside the car. After these trucks drove into the gate one by one, they drove into the second gate in sequence, and the prosecutors interrogated them one by one to determine their age and place of origin before detaining them. Around 10:00 AM, three more trucks drove in. In total, eight trucks drove in yesterday morning, escorting seventy-one people. And two of the eight trucks were filled with quilts and bedding.

Several prosecutors from the High Procuratorate were extremely busy, running in and out. Because they knew that there were not enough people, they specially transferred two prosecutors from the District Procuratorate to help. Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, and Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, both came to inspect in person. Prison Director Jiang Gongliang was also extraordinarily busy. These seventy-one prisoners are now detained in the Zhongzi Prison.

Complete list

Among these seventy-one people, in addition to the Shanghai "Three Olds" Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, there are Liang Hongzhi (puppet president of the Legislative Yuan), Qian Daqi (puppet vice president of the Central Reserve Bank), Wu Songbi (puppet minister of Justice Administration), Chen Chuner (puppet chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government), Chuan Shishuo (puppet minister of Construction), Zhao Zunyue (puppet minister of Propaganda), Zheng Hongnian (puppet president of the China Fiber Corporation), Xie Baosheng (puppet deputy police chief of Jiangsu Province), Xu Weizhen (puppet president of the Shanghai High Court), Zhao Zhengdang (puppet president of the Shanghai District Court), Tang Shoumin (puppet president of the Chamber of Commerce), Wu Kaisheng (puppet deputy minister of Justice Administration), Chen Guoquan (puppet director of the Rice Control Commission), Cai Pei (puppet ambassador to Japan), Zhang Tao (puppet president of the Nanjing Supreme Court), Liu Yangshan (puppet director of the Youth League Training), Jin Xiongbai (puppet president of the Ping Bao), Dai Yingfu (puppet director of the Shanghai Education Bureau), Liu Xingchen (puppet director of the Shanghai Economic Bureau), as well as Zhou Bangjun, Pan Sansheng, Xie Xiaochu, Wu Zhai, Sun Yaodong, Cheng Zhiliang, Zhu Boquan, Liu Yusheng, Xu Jiang, Chen Shaokui, Wang Yongkang, Huang Xianggu, Feng Jie, Zhou Yuying, Xu Jianping, Li Zuyu, Liang Shi, Zou Shanbao, Mai Jingming, Li Hongfei, Dai Ailu, Liu Weijun, Xia Qifeng, Tang Huimin, Fang Lixiang, Gao Jimin, Li Haoju, Fan Yongzeng, Zhang Zeng, Huang Tiansuo, Xu Xiqing, Li Dingshi, Tang Liangli, Ye Xuesong, Zhang Sumin, Huang Qingzhong, Xu Jidun, Yu Hualong, Ge Liangchou, Zhang Haoran, Jiang Shangda, Yan Jiachi, Zhou Wenrui, Hu Zewu, He Zhuoxian, Wu Jiyun, Shao Shuhua, Xie Zhongfu, Chen Huabai, and others, totaling seventy-one people.

Yesterday, the first batch of the above seventy-one people was handed over to the court. On the same day, six people were escorted to the Military Law Execution and Supervision Department. These six people are Wen Zongyao (puppet president of the Control Yuan), Sheng Youlan, Xu (i.e., Xu Tieshan), as well as Gong Jinqin, Tang Mang, and Luo Hongyi.

Can Be Completed in Half a Month

There are a total of four or five hundred traitors arrested by the military organs in Shanghai. After the decision to hand them over to the judicial organs for handling, they will be escorted in batches in the coming days, and it is estimated that it can be completed in half a month. After these traitors are investigated by the prosecutors, they can be prosecuted and publicly tried.

Chief Prosecutor's Remarks

Yesterday, Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Procuratorate, told reporters that he would definitely punish these traitors in accordance with national law and would never be lenient. Otherwise, if there is another war against foreign countries, it is truly unimaginable.

Then let us all wait and see!

### Fake Secretary-General of the 米統會 (Rice Control Commission) Zhou Chunyu Summoned Yesterday
### Claims He Was Framed Due to Personal Grudges
### Defendant's Lawyer Detained in Chongqing Awaiting Further Interrogation

[Our Report] The following is a special record of the traitor cases heard by the High Court yesterday:

Zhou Chunyu

43 years old, from Ningbo. Formerly served as Secretary-General of the puppet Rice Grain Compilation Committee. In November of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), while in office, he was accused of corruption and dereliction of duty, arrested by the enemy constabulary, and transferred to the puppet court, where he was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, which he served. After the victory, the case was investigated by the current High Procuratorate Office on March 13th, which deemed it to be a violation of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and filed a public prosecution. During the court session yesterday morning, the defendant readily admitted to having held a puppet position. He stated that he had been hired for the position by Yuan Ludeng, the Director of the puppet Rice Control Commission, due to their long-standing family friendship and common hometown. However, he claimed that even though he held a puppet position, he never forgot his country. He claimed that he was being framed due to personal grudges and requested the court to investigate the matter clearly. Because his defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, was still in Chongqing, the defendant requested a postponement of the hearing. The court reviewed the statement and ordered that the case be held for further interrogation.

Zhang Suxing

The third son of Zhang Taozhi, a former official of the puppet Supreme Court, 30 years old, from Hangzhou. He was formerly employed as the Director of the Nanshi Tobacco Inspection Office of the puppet Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau, and as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee of the puppet Shanghai East First District Public Office. He also associated with the traitor Sheng Youzhi (i.e., Sheng Lao San). In Sheng's drug trafficking organization, "Hongji Weitang," he assisted with stamping and subcontracting work. After the victory, he was arrested by the police and transferred to the High Procuratorate Office, which filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, the defendant strongly denied all the charges against him. The court, having Sheng's confession as evidence, reviewed the statement and ordered that the case be rescheduled for further interrogation.

Two Puppet Officials Sentenced Separately

Yesterday afternoon, two more traitor cases were pronounced. They are: (1) Song Guiren and Wang Yaoting, employees of the puppet Shanghai Finance Bureau Nanshi Tax Collection Office, were found to have conspired with the enemy to resist our country. They were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of public rights for two years. All their property was confiscated, except for what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of their families. (2) Huang Zhongliang, the Director of the puppet Minhang Rice Grain Office, was found to have conspired with the enemy to supply grain and rice. He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, with deprivation of public rights for five years. All his property was confiscated, except for what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of his family.

### Japanese War Criminals in China to be Publicly Tried Within the Week

### Military Tribunal Ready

[Our Report] Since its establishment in mid-last month, the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone Command of the Military Affairs Commission has been arresting Japanese war criminals who committed atrocities in China based on people's accusations. A total of sixty-four people have been arrested by the military authorities of this city. The prosecutor has completed the preliminary investigation, and they are currently being held at the Tilanqiao Detention Center. Most of these war criminals are former officers of the Japanese Kempeitai (military police). Two of them will be interrogated again within the next few days, after which they may be publicly tried this week. However, due to the limited space in the courtroom, only a limited number of requests from the public to attend the hearing will be granted. Our reporter, accompanied by Deputy Adjutant He Huaqiang, visited the fully arranged military tribunal yesterday. The setting is simple yet solemn. A large national flag hangs in the center, with five seats for judges beneath it. To the left are seats for the prosecutor and the interpreter, and to the right are seats for the clerk. A semi-circular wooden railing surrounds the area. The first row outside the railing is for news reporters, and behind them are five rows of seats for the audience, accommodating approximately fifty people. Furthermore, the U.S. military in this city has requested to send personnel to attend the hearing as observers, which has been approved. However, the request from the officers of the Japanese prisoner-of-war concentration camp to attend the hearing is still under consideration.

### Rickshaws Almost Disappeared Yesterday
### Opposition to Sharp Increase in Rental Fees Prompts Full Strike
### Over Ten Thousand Silk Weaving Workers March and Petition in the Rain

[Our Report] The citywide labor unrest, which had subsided for a while, re-emerged yesterday with the full strike launched by rickshaw pullers and the march and petition of over ten thousand male and female silk weaving workers. The rickshaw pullers' strike was triggered by the sudden increase in rental fees. It is reported that the rental fee was originally 600 yuan per day, but it has risen to over 2,000 yuan in less than a few days. As a result, over three thousand rickshaw pullers launched a strike yesterday morning, spreading the word to other rickshaw pullers on various roads. By evening, the strike had become citywide.

It is reported that there are currently over one hundred and twenty rickshaw companies in the city, with over thirty-seven thousand rickshaws and over fifty thousand rickshaw pullers. Once a full strike occurs, it will have a significant impact on the city's transportation. It is reported that the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association is currently negotiating a resolution. The Social Affairs Bureau is also paying close attention to this matter.

Also, at 8:00 AM yesterday, over ten thousand male and female workers from the silk weaving industry unions of Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4 gathered at the Bund Park and then marched in formation past the City Hall and along Hankou Road to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition for the implementation of the eight measures decided upon during the mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau on March 29th. Halfway through the march, a heavy rain suddenly fell. The ten thousand male and female workers looked miserable. The procession blocked traffic for half an hour.

### A Tour of the North Station: The Newly Opened Restaurant's Exterior
### Full of Tropical Flair
### UNRRA Ships Hundreds of Freight Cars

— By Our Reporter Xingwu

Whether in peacetime or wartime, railway transportation always occupies an important position. Not only can it not be interrupted for a moment, but it also needs to be constantly improved to meet the needs. China after the victory, of course, cannot ignore the railway transportation. You only need to take a tour of the North Station to know the authorities' emphasis on the railway.

Although the transportation capacity of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines is extremely lacking, it is still impossible to avoid the crowding of passengers, but the "black hats", "scalpers", extortion... of the enemy puppet period have long been swept away.

The short and capable Chief of the North Station—one of the actual persons in charge of the North Station, I met him yesterday. He took time out of his busy schedule to accompany me to visit the North Station restaurant, which will open on the 4th. The red roof, the brightly colored walls, and especially the palm trees and banana trees in front of the door, are full of tropical flair. This was originally the box office, and it took more than ten million yuan and three months of renovation to make it a success. There are special express meals for 3,000 yuan each, curry chicken rice for 1,000 yuan each, coffee for 600 yuan a cup, beer for 900 yuan a bottle, sandwiches, toast, milk, cocoa, mixed rice, fried rice, and all kinds of Chinese and Western pastries. The waitresses have all received rigorous training, and the bad habit of petty charges has been abolished. The problem of passenger corruption has been solved from now on.

Passengers dragging heavy luggage is very inconvenient, so the North Station has set up a luggage storage area. You can safely hand over your luggage to them. You can slowly send someone to pick it up. It only costs 100 yuan for every 24 hours.

The station chief said: "The gasoline train will soon be extended to the route from Shanghai to Nanjing. A special express train requires seven and a half hours for the Jinghu trip. A gasoline train only takes five and a half hours to take you from Shanghai to Nanjing. This plan will probably be implemented within half a month. As for the name, fare, and stopping stations of the 'Taihu' train, they are still under discussion." Because of the increase in train services, the running time of all trains on the two lines will be changed. The night train to Nanjing may depart at 10:00 PM.

Chief Tong also told reporters the latest news. He said that he just heard from Section Chief Ouyang Zhi, which is a real piece of good news: UNRRA has delivered 382 freight cars, including flat cars, high-side cars, and covered cars. These freight cars have been sent to the Qiqi Weir Factory for repairs and can be used after repair. In the future, the freight of the two lines will undoubtedly increase greatly. In addition, UNRRA has also provided fourteen wood-burning locomotives, which have arrived in Shanghai and will be allocated and assigned by the Ministry of Communications. The Jinghu and Huhang lines are close to the water tower and will definitely be able to allocate a considerable number. Therefore, Station Chief Tong is absolutely optimistic about the passenger and freight transport of the two lines in the future.

There are many passengers during the spring break, so since yesterday, an additional special express train has been added to the Huhang line, running up and down once a day, departing from Hangzhou at 10:45 AM and departing from Shanghai at 2:55 PM. This is of course good news for passengers, especially for those who are going on spring outings.

### One of the "Five Tiger Generals"
### Bandit Chief Pretends to Be a Young Master
### Pretending to be Agency Personnel, Committing Numerous Crimes
### Many Arrested, Various Weapons Confiscated

[Our Report] Lu Bihu, the Director of the North Station Police Sub-bureau, received information on the 21st of last month that a well-known bandit leader, Shen Zhixiong, a local resident, 23 years old, was hiding at No. 39 Fuyi Lane, Shengping Street, Muir Road. It was found that the suspect had been engaged in pickpocketing at the North Railway Station since he was 14 years old and was known as one of the "Five Tiger Generals" among the pickpocketing community. He usually wore suits and leather shoes, entering and leaving song and dance halls, looking like a profligate young master. Recently, Shen has become even more extreme, impersonating personnel of the Garrison Headquarters, forming gangs and robbing, committing many crimes. Finally, Li Jiachu, the Chief of the Judicial Section of the Sub-bureau, led officers Liu Zichang, Inspector Deng Shu, plainclothes police chiefs Kang Zengxiang, Zhao Zenggui, Lu Yixin, policemen Zhang Shide, Zhang Yuzhen, Li Xianwen, Liu Changhua, and others to the above-mentioned location, where they arrested him at the entrance of his residence. They also found military uniforms, armed belts, a Japanese military sword, a U.S. latest-style Thompson submachine gun, an old-style light machine gun, a Mauser pistol, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition of various sizes in his home. Subsequently, they successively arrested accomplices Lu Kongbiao, Lu's wife Lu Yazhen (who was responsible for transporting guns in a hand tube), Shen's wife Shen Wangshi, Xu Chuncheng, Sun Chaxiang, and Shen Xiagen, a porter at the Central Hotel (who was responsible for storing guns), in Shanghai. They also went to a hotel in Suzhou and arrested Lu Wei and Liu Fengxiang, and recovered some of the stolen goods. According to their confessions: at 6:00 or 7:00 PM on October 27th of last year, Shen and his gang went to Hongxing Iron Factory at No. 835 Suzhou Road, impersonating personnel of the Third War Zone Command investigating enemy property to arrest traitors. As a result, they robbed 470,000 legal tender. At 7:00 PM on November 27th, they went to the home of a certain Yu at No. 4 Songshan Road, pretending to deliver ducks to open the gate. They fired a shot as a warning and robbed twelve gold bars, two small bars, and a large number of gold, diamond, and emerald ornaments, as well as suits and bicycles, estimated to be worth 11.77 million legal tender. At 5:00 PM on January 1st, they went to the home of a certain Cai at No. 1, Lane 181, Xiaoshadu Road, and robbed three diamond rings, each about 60 points, along with clothes, worth 210,000 legal tender. At 7:00 PM on the 12th of the same month, they went to the home of a certain Zhou at No. 16, Lane 356, Route Ghisi, and robbed whiskey, diamond rings, gold watches, clothes, emerald rings, and 200 U.S. dollars, worth 6.33 million legal tender. At a certain number in Henry Lane, Shili Road, they robbed gold watch chains and a large number of counterfeit currency, etc., but the date has been forgotten. They also went to rob at Guba Road, Northwest Shanxi Road, and Fook Hing Road, etc., but were unsuccessful. It was also confessed that they often divided the spoils in the long rooms No. 424 and 438 on the fourth floor of the Central Hotel on Fifth Horse Road. According to Chief Li, when they committed robberies, they wore military uniforms and were well-organized, with ranks such as adjutants and grooms. Shen's residence was luxuriously decorated and well-arranged, and equipped with wireless telephones. All rooms upstairs and downstairs could communicate, like a big family. The tenants living in the same house sometimes glimpsed them going out with guns and handcuffs, fully equipped as soldiers, so they did not suspect anything else.

### Uniform Military Attire to be Implemented on May 1st

### The Enemy and Puppets Forcibly Occupied Property Should Be Returned Immediately; The Time Limit for Land Registration Is Deemed Too Short; City Councilors Raised Questions at the Sixth General Meeting

(Report from this Newspaper) The City Council's Review Committee held its first group review meeting yesterday morning, and the sixth general meeting was held at 3:20 PM, with 27 councilors present, and 10 proposals received.

Report from the Land Administration Bureau

After Chairman Xu Jiqing's speech, Chen Shiquan, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the work done in the past six months. He stated briefly: This city is the economic hub of the country. Due to the extraterritoriality of the concessions in the past, the situation of foreign business real estate companies and foreign property ownership was complicated. After eight years of enemy and puppet occupation, land administration became even more chaotic. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau paid special attention to clearing land rights and reorganizing land registration. The core work can be divided into six items: (1) Compiling atlases of various districts and redrawing the boundaries of Huangpu District (i.e., the former Public Concession and French Concession) according to natural topography, totaling 40,000 perpetual lease deeds. (2) The city governs 31 districts, with a total area of 1,334.049 municipal acres. The complete survey work is expected to be completed within this year. (3) During the enemy and puppet period, land rights were confused and boundaries were unclear due to coercion and seizure. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau actively handled land ownership and transfer registration, land reclamation, perpetual lease land registration, and the clearing of land rights registration by enemy and puppet organizations. (4) Huangpu and other six districts conducted group surveys, collected data, and divided land price sections. Charts were drawn, and a standard land price evaluation committee was organized, which decided to temporarily use the valuation of the 30th year of the Republic of China as the standard, increasing it by a multiple (currently 400 times) to match land registration. (5) The land forcibly requisitioned and occupied by enemy and puppet real estate companies, airfields, farms, etc., reached more than 161,970 acres. These lands can be returned upon application by the owners, or the requisition price can be compensated. (6) According to preliminary statistics and surveys by the Land Administration Bureau, the publicly owned land has a total of 1.186 hills and 5.776 acres, which is three and a half times more than before. However, there must still be omissions, so it has been decided to continue the investigation, especially the properties of the former French Concession's Board of Directors, many of which were concealed by the French Consulate. The municipal government is currently negotiating to recover them and has requested instructions from the central government to recover them through diplomatic channels. In addition to the above six points, Director Chen also reported on the completion of the clearing of perpetual lease title deeds, the complicated property rights issues during the enemy and puppet period, and the most difficult issues such as land registration for owners not in Shanghai.

How to Overcome Difficulties in Foreign Property Ownership

After Director Chen finished his report, the councilors raised questions one after another. Xu Shihao first raised four points: 1. The time limit for land registration is too short. Instead of extending it repeatedly, it is better to make accurate estimates in advance and extend the registration period. 2. The receipt for registration should preferably indicate the title deed number and acreage to show solemnity and to enable citizens to use it for economic purposes. 3. Land right documents should be returned quickly or replaced with photos or copies during registration. 4. The registration public announcement period in the Land Law is too long. The local bureau has requested the central government to approve a shorter period, which is convenient for citizens, but it is not known whether it has been approved by the legislative body. Ye Fenghu also inquired about the future methods of handling foreign property ownership, enemy and puppet real estate, and how to overcome the various difficulties in the public land investigation. Cao Jun asked two points: (1) The airfields and farms built by the enemy occupying citizens' land have now been taken over by the Aviation Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. What should be done? The Land Administration Bureau should immediately investigate the owners and return the land separately or formulate appropriate disposal measures. (2) Is there a plan to complete the land survey in the short term?

The Standard for Land Valuation Is Inevitably Uneven

Pan Xulun suggested that land registration should preferably be completed by district and within a time limit, and that the registration fee previously collected beyond that stipulated in the Land Law should preferably be refunded. The valuation used to be based on the 30th year of the Republic of China, increased to 200 times, and recently adjusted to 400 times, while the rent is based on the 26th year of the Republic of China, only 60 times or 40 times, which is inevitably uneven. Zhou Xuexiang, Zhao Banfu, Ji Hao, Xu Yongzuo, Lu Huimin and others inquired about the handling of housing disputes by the Housing Rental Management Committee and the return of more than 800 houses occupied by the enemy and puppets. Shui Xiangyun, Chuan Tongxian, Li Bojia, Fan Caiji, Tao Guangchuan and others all inquired about land policies, land registration procedures, registration fees, land valuation, and the investigation of public land.

Answers to Each Point

Director Chen then answered each point one by one: (1) Regarding registration, it has already been extended for six months, and those who are late are being supplemented. Phased registration can achieve the effect of urging. (2) Measures have also been taken to improve the receipt to indicate the acreage. (3) Land right documents can be reviewed in half a month. (4) As for valuation, it will be handled carefully. (5) Foreign property ownership will await instructions from the central government. According to the new Sino-American regulations, foreigners can also have property rights, and the central government will have a complete method. (6) The land occupied by the enemy and puppets is now being discussed with the Aviation Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. As for airfields and farms, the requisition price will be compensated. (7) Due to various difficulties, the overcharged registration fee will not be refunded. (8) The housing shortage problem is that the Rental Committee is only an agency for mediating disputes and reducing housing litigation. Due to economic constraints, it cannot be expanded further. (9) Regarding the real estate of the former French Concession's Board of Directors, there are now Sino-French schools, French barracks, patrol hospitals, and the French Consulate, etc. It is hoped that the Council, as a public opinion organ, will urge the French Board to return them in a friendly manner. After Director Chen finished his reply, Speaker Xu announced that the deadline for receiving proposals, originally scheduled for Thursday, has now been extended to Saturday, and the meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM.

Group Review Committee Reviews Various Proposals

The Provisional Council held its first group review meeting yesterday morning, reviewing a total of 40 proposals.

The first group reviewed proposals related to civil affairs, autonomy, and security matters, reviewing eight proposals. Five cases were discussed together. The four cases proposed by Councilor Hou Junren and others, proposing that the government should quickly take over the enemy's shrines and convert them into loyalty shrines to enshrine the military and civilians who died in the war of resistance or sacrificed due to unyielding, so as to publicize loyalty, were passed and submitted to the general meeting for reconsideration. The second group reviewed proposals related to finance, economy, construction, etc., reviewing 27 proposals. Two cases were reserved, four cases were discussed together, and were eventually passed. The twenty-one cases proposed by Councilor Pan Xulun and others, proposing that the general meeting should suggest that the central government promptly promulgate the "Urban Housing Rental Acceptance Regulations" to regulate urban housing rentals and reduce disputes and difficulties, were passed and submitted to the general meeting for reconsideration. The third group reviewed proposals related to education and culture, reviewing five proposals. The four cases proposed by Councilor Zhou Feicheng and others, proposing that all organs and troops occupying school buildings should be ordered to move out quickly to maintain the city's education, were passed and submitted to the general meeting for reconsideration.

### Suppressing Prices and Stabilizing People's Livelihood; Ye Fenghu and Others Proposed Seven Principles

[Report from this Newspaper] Among the proposals yesterday were Ye Fenghu, Hou Junren, Shen Chunhui, Feng Youzhen, Lu Tan, Xu Yongzuo, and Zhu Su'e, proposing emergency measures to suppress the city's prices and stabilize people's livelihood. The specific methods include seven items: (1) Prioritize the allocation of transportation to speed up the purchase and transportation from abroad. (2) Relief and enemy and puppet industry food should be released in full and distributed to the city's residents according to a per capita rationing system. (3) China Textile Corporation should provide a considerable amount of gauze and cloth for fair distribution. (4) The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs should fully supply and allocate coal to households. (5) The entrusted companies' methods of selling coal and cloth at fair prices should be thoroughly reformed, and a new system should be established using the baojia system and household registration certificates to distribute fair-priced grain, coal, cloth, and daily necessities. (6) Please the Municipal Government to organize an agency for the fair distribution of daily necessities to be responsible for sourcing and distribution, and to organize a review committee to be responsible for review and supervision. (7) The detailed distribution methods shall be carefully formulated by the above committee. The proposals were greatly valued by the General Meeting.

### Answering Readers

Qing from Jinze, Zhang Guochang asks: (1) In the 15th year of the Republic of China, my friend Wang sold his house to the Li family with a mortgage, specifying a term of five years in the contract. Now he intends to redeem it, but the Li family refuses, saying that mortgage of farmland and houses with a term of more than ten years is not allowed for redemption. Is there actually a legal regulation within ten years? (2) Cao bought several acres of farmland from the Wu family in the 27th year of the Republic of China, with a contract specifying an absolute sale. Now, because the former owner Wu wants to redeem it at the original price, claiming that absolute sales during the war of resistance can also be redeemed after ten years, is it actually legal? (3) Before and during the war of resistance, mortgage sales of farmland and houses were priced at only a few hundred yuan. If one wants to redeem it now, according to the law, how many times the original price should be used for redemption?

Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers: (1) According to Article 8 of the Regulations on the Management of Real Estate Mortgages, redemption is allowed within ten years from the date of establishment. (2) If the sales contract is legally established, of course it cannot be redeemed. (3) According to Article 11 of the revised Civil Procedure Law, the court may moderately increase the redemption amount.

Wang Shixun asks: I am twenty-two years old this year. When I was nineteen, I got engaged to Miss Yi. Although there was a so-called meeting at that time, and my parents also asked me, I always had no reason to object because I was younger. A lot of jewelry was brought over by my family at the time of the engagement. Now, because Miss Yi and I are not very harmonious, we have privately agreed to cancel the engagement, but Yi suddenly regrets saying that we did not agree. Therefore, I have several undecided matters, (1) Yi refuses to cancel the engagement, how can I legally cancel it? (2) Can the jewelry and other gifts given at the time of the engagement be recovered by the introducer?

Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers: (1) The marriage contract should be made by the parties themselves. If you did not agree to the engagement at the beginning, it is not effective. (2) If the man is not at fault, he can request recovery.

### Thoughts on Children's Day

— Qian Dajun

Children are the cells of national reproduction and the future masters of the country. They are directly related to the continuation of national life and indirectly related to the rise and fall of the country's destiny. Former US President Hoover once said, "World progress revolves around the heels of children." Indeed, "The twentieth century is the century of children."

This city has a large population. According to recent survey results, there are more than 3.345 million people, of which children under the age of fourteen account for 10%. Therefore, the children's problem in this city is extremely important. How to strengthen children's education and maintain children's health is an urgent matter. The government should do its best, and all citizens and parents in our city should also deeply understand this and cooperate together for easier results.

Taking children's education as an example, school education and family education must be equally emphasized. If children have a good family environment, they will naturally become good children. Conversely, proximity to vermilion makes one red, proximity to ink makes one black. The bad habits of adults can easily have a profound impact on children. In this way, not only will family education not be able to cooperate with school education, but the bad family environment will reduce the effectiveness of school education. As for children's health, parents must pay attention to it. First, they must focus on nutrition. In terms of diet, they must consider the child's age and physique and provide appropriate supplies. Secondly, special attention must be paid to children's diseases. For example, trachoma, otitis media, and tonsils are common diseases in children, but most parents ignore them, which is wrong. In addition, clothing, food, housing, and transportation must also be reasonable. Things like irregular breastfeeding, clothes that are too tight or too thick, closing windows tightly to prevent air circulation, and fearing that children will catch a cold are all harmful to children's health. The infant mortality rate in our country is high among people, reaching 200 to 275 or more per year, which is unmatched by other countries. This is caused by neglecting children's health.

This city is at the beginning of recovery, and there are many things to be done. Due to limited funds, children's welfare undertakings have not been as ideal as possible. How to make practical efforts in the future depends on the consistent assistance of people from all walks of life and the automatic attention of children's parents. This year's Children's Day, the Health Bureau held a children's health competition, the purpose of which is to awaken society's attention to children's health, attach importance to children's status, and then seek the expansion of children's welfare undertakings. I sincerely hope that citizens of the whole city will pay attention to it, widely publicize it, and that children's health in our country will become more and more advanced and their physique will become stronger and stronger, which is the great fortune of the country.

### How are We Responsible to Children?

— Yu Songjun

A celebrity once said: "The twentieth century is the century of children." That's right, in the past few decades, the idea of ​​"child-centered" has indeed been very popular in education, especially in the one or two decades after the end of the First World War. Unfortunately, within these short decades, two world wars broke out one after another. War is most harmful to people's lives. Many children sacrificed their lives in the artillery fire. Many children were displaced because their homes were destroyed. Many children do not receive care. And many children, although they still have the care of parents and teachers, cannot develop very well in terms of physical or psychological aspects due to the lack of various conditions.

During the war, children who had families to rely on and schools to attend could be said to be extremely lucky. However, according to the research of several experts in Shanghai and Chongqing, the nutrients supplied daily in the diet of children in wartime China, such as cooked energy, fats and oils, protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamins A, C, and D, are all insufficient; among them, the degree of protein deficiency is enough to make the protein content in plasma 22% below the minimum limit of normal plasma protein. Due to the simultaneous lack of protein, vitamin C, and iron, the general children show signs of anemia. The impact of this malnutrition can make children develop one year slower than usual. (According to Wang Chengfa's report). Just this point can show how wronged children are and how much loss the country has suffered!

Here we deeply feel the evil and horror of the aggressive ideology that caused the war. In the era of Wilhelm II and Hitler's rule in Germany, the children in the country were regarded as a capital for external development, and cultivating children meant cultivating the power of aggression. Japan is the same. In the past 100 years, Japan has paid great attention to children's education; but the motive for paying attention is only to create batches of tools to die for Japanese imperialism. The result of the development of aggressive ideology is not only that the children of the aggressor countries are poisoned, but also that the vitality of children all over the world is harmed.

Now the war is over. On the one hand, of course, we must seek relief as soon as possible so that children in hunger and cold can obtain food and clothing; so that children who are out of school can receive education. Moreover, further, we should use scientific knowledge, according to the natural requirements of children, to make children grow completely. On the other hand, for the future of children and for the future of mankind, we must actively promote our Chinese peace ideology that has been passed down for generations. Our peace ideology is reflected in the legacy of ancient sages and sages. The "Li Yun" chapter of the Book of Rites requires "the young to be cared for." We must care for children in this way so that the vitality of the nation will not be blocked. Mencius said: "Love my young and extend it to the young of others." We must have this spirit of universal love so that children can truly be happy and avoid future disasters.

Today is the first Children's Day after the victory. We feel heartbroken when we think of the lack of care for children in the past and the many destructive behaviors. From now on, we will seek permanent happiness for children. We want to make the saying "The 20th century is the century of children" not just an ideal or hope, but a definite and unswerving fact.

### The Meaning and Responsibility of the First Children's Day After Victory

— Kong Xiangxi

This year today marks the first Children's Day after the victory against Japan, which can also be said to be a Children's Day celebrated uniformly across the country. Commemorating this festive day for children, which is closely related to the rise and fall of the nation, amidst the nationwide cheers of victory, brings immeasurable joy and satisfaction.

Recalling the origin of Children's Day, it was initiated by myself in the 20th year of the Republic of China as the president of the China Child Welfare Association, and submitted to the government for adoption and promulgation, reaching its fifteenth anniversary this year. At that time, foreign aggression was increasingly urgent, and the nation was facing a crisis. The Chinese nation was in a difficult and dangerous situation. People at that time deeply felt that to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the people, and to strengthen the people, we must start with children. The slogan at that time was: To revive the nation, we must first nurture children. Since the July 7th Incident, our entire nation has resisted the Japanese invaders with blood and flesh, and fought for survival. Therefore, for the past eight years, every Children's Day has been spent in painful and arduous days, and could not be celebrated uniformly across the country. Looking at the children on that day and gazing at the future of the nation, one could not help but feel comforted and excited. However, the mood was never as joyful and happy as it is today after victory.

Eight years of hardship have won the final victory. Domestic unity has laid the foundation for national reconstruction. The future of the new China is full of light and hope. Today, as we commemorate this great Children's Day, after finally washing away a century of shame, with the recovery of our territory and the restoration of freedom, it has a special meaning and value. As the president of the China Child Welfare Association, I would like to express my thoughts to my compatriots:

(1) Commemorating Children's Day Requires Completing the Great Task of National Reconstruction

With the victory against Japan, national reconstruction has begun. Although the cause of resisting Japan was extremely difficult, the task of national reconstruction is even more arduous. The completion of this complex and great undertaking requires not only our generation to strive for it, but also the next generation of citizens to continue their efforts. Children are the new blood of the nation and the inheritors of culture. Whether they will be able to shoulder the great responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future depends on the education and nurturing they receive today. In our imagination, there is a vision of a strong, prosperous, and happy new China. But we must not neglect the future masters who will build and support this new China. If we want to maintain the victory won with countless heads and blood, and ensure the long-term preservation of the freedom we have gained, we must make the next generation and future generations of citizens healthy, strong, and promising. On this Children's Day, we must raise social awareness, value children, protect children, educate children, and nurture children, so that they can achieve healthy growth, become national leaders, and complete the great task of national reconstruction.

(2) Commemorating Children's Day Requires Permanently Maintaining World Peace

In today's world, where the flames of war have just subsided and devastation is everywhere, what all humanity seeks is lasting world peace. The painful experience of the past eight years tells us that only peace brings hope and happiness. Otherwise, there will only be pain and destruction. How can lasting peace be achieved? And how can it be guaranteed after it is achieved? We believe that the most thorough and fundamental way is to start with nurturing children. Use the power of education to eliminate their aggressive thoughts, and use the power of healthcare to enhance their self-defense capabilities, so that the entire nation can flourish. On the one hand, eradicate their aggressive, murderous, retaliatory, and destructive thoughts. On the other hand, cultivate their virtues of benevolence, peace, suppressing the strong, helping the weak, mutual assistance, and construction, so that all nations in the world can develop universally, coexist and prosper, and peace will be easily realized. It is hoped that from now on, all countries will educate children in this spirit, encourage each other, and eliminate the psychology of mutual slaughter and cyclical retaliation. The ideal world of universal harmony and the world as one family can be expected to be realized. On this Children's Day, it is hoped that all parents, teachers, and all those responsible for education and care should encourage themselves and each other with this.

Since we know the great significance of commemorating Children's Day this year, we should redouble our efforts in children's welfare. However, the scope of children's welfare is very broad. From which aspects should we strive to do it? I would like to point out the two most important points based on the current needs and elaborate on them as follows:

(A) Emphasize Children in Reconstruction Work. The first urgent and important task after victory is reconstruction, so that people who have suffered eight years of hardship can recuperate and restore the nation's vitality. However, in the reconstruction work, the reconstruction of children should be even more important, because today's children were still infants when the war against Japan began. For the past eight years, they have been separated from their homes, displaced, lost the love of their parents, and lacked normal education. The harm to their physical and mental well-being is far greater than that of ordinary adults. It is urgent to restore their normal lives, regain family warmth, and enable them to grow and develop in a harmonious and peaceful environment. Therefore, all reconstruction work should focus on children. The distribution of relief materials should also be given priority to children. Not only should children who have been displaced to the rear be given priority to return to their homes, reunite with their relatives, and obtain a normal and stable life, but also the relief, education, and rehabilitation of children in the recovered areas are important issues for children's welfare. Commemorating Children's Day is not just a formality of perfunctorily responding to the occasion every year, but also to address these important issues, come up with plans, find solutions, and implement them practically.

(B) Expand the Scope and Actively Promote Healthcare and Protection: After the war ends, many children's care homes, orphanages, and educational institutions will be closed due to the children's return home. However, this does not mean that the scope of children's welfare work will be reduced. On the contrary, the children's care work during the war has come to an end, and other children's welfare undertakings are waiting to be developed. We, the colleagues engaged in children's welfare work, are only afraid of lacking the enthusiasm and perseverance to serve, but not afraid of lacking opportunities for work. However, from now on, children's welfare work must start from the two aspects of active healthcare and protection. For example, healthcare work is not only to treat children's diseases, to run a few clinics and sanatoriums, which is enough to be satisfied, but should also prevent problems before they occur, establish common sense for parents on raising children, and improve the public health of the entire society, so that children are fundamentally not infected with any diseases. As for protection, all evil habits in society that abuse children, such as child labor, maids, and child brides, should be eradicated without exception and not allowed to exist. Furthermore, all unreasonable, unequal, and undesirable phenomena in society should be eradicated, so that the elderly can live out their years, the strong can be employed, the young can grow, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick can all be cared for, so that the entire society is filled with happiness, harmony, equality, freedom, and loving atmosphere, and becomes a perfect and ideal society. This is what those engaged in children's welfare and all social workers should strive for.

The wartime children's relief and education work has laid the foundation for China's children's welfare undertaking and has done its best to nurture the seedlings of the nation. This contribution to the country and the nation cannot be ignored. As the president of the China Child Welfare Association, I would like to express my deep respect and admiration to all child welfare comrades across the country. In the future, the development of children's welfare undertakings will be a hundred times more difficult than today. It is hoped that all compatriots across the country will clearly recognize the responsibility of this child welfare undertaking on this first Children's Day after the victory and enthusiastically support it, vigorously promote it, and complete the mission of nurturing children and restoring the nation.

Commercial News

### The Hong Kong Government Agrees to the Bank of China's Request to Recognize the New Hong Kong Notes, Totaling 87.5 Million Yuan

Reuters, Hong Kong, 3rd dispatch: The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) officially announced yesterday that it has obtained the consent of the Hong Kong government and has decided to recognize all banknotes bearing the name of HSBC as legal tender in Hong Kong. The British military government announced on September 13th of last year that all banknotes forcibly issued by the Japanese side were illegal. This declaration has now been revised.

United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd dispatch: The total amount of Hong Kong dollars issued under duress by the Japanese is 87.5 million yuan.

Yesterday, the US dollar in this city was stable, with narrow fluctuations. It strengthened slightly in the middle of the day, but the buying interest was weak. It soon became tired and fell, closing 25 yuan lower than the previous day. The arbitrage price against gold was squeezed to below 670 yuan. The exchange rate of the US dollar remained unchanged. Hong Kong notes were weak in the old notes but strong in the new notes. Because the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation considers all banknotes it issued to be valid, and the Hong Kong military authorities have also revised the September 13th ban on the circulation of new notes, the trend of exchanging old notes for new ones has become very popular. The new notes were initially quoted at 230 yuan, with more buyers than sellers, and could only be traded above 300 yuan. Guangbang received telegrams from that area stating that they were discounted at 98% or fully usable, reaching a maximum of 370 yuan. At this time, there was no distinction between the years 1936 and 1937, nor was there any distinction between the (1) and (2) prefixes. The old notes, due to the inflation component, fell back to the 400 yuan level. As a result, the old notes closed 25 yuan lower than the previous day, while the new notes rose 160 yuan. Robbie was 535 yuan, and Hong Kong telegrams were 435 yuan, all of which were selling orders.

### Government Bonds Improve

Yesterday, the buying interest in government bonds was strong again. People's hearts were restless. The C bonds opened in the morning and rose to above 2,600 yuan, once approaching the 3,000 yuan level. At noon, they hovered around 2,900 yuan, rising more than 400 yuan from the previous closing price. Miscellaneous bonds also improved by 150 to 200 yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Show Elegance Upon Entering the Market, Chinese Stocks Have More Twists and Turns

Chinese stocks initially opened flat and weak, but once recovered from weakness to strength after opening. Yongsha retreated from 4,950 yuan to 4,550 yuan, and Fuya retreated from 4,100 yuan to 3,700 yuan. The struggle was fierce, and the multi-party tried their best to maintain it, resulting in the concentration of Meiya and the inability to take care of Yongsha. Due to the relationship between the operators, Meiya's situation gradually improved. In the middle of the day, the police came to interfere, and trading was once suspended. It lingered until near noon, and the downward trend gradually changed. At noon, there was a trend of borrowing money to exchange for stocks, and all stocks closed at high prices, rising 150 yuan for Yongsha, 330 yuan for Meiya, and 15 to 20 yuan for Jingfu and other three small hot stocks compared with the previous closing price. The asking price was slightly lower in the afternoon, and the situation was uncertain. The old bulls were gradually emerging, but new bulls were joining from time to time. Foreign stocks showed elegance upon entering the market yesterday. After Xiangtai's continuous rise for many days, many parties have emerged yesterday. The situation also appeared uncertain in the middle of the day, and it briefly fell back from the high point in the morning, but it was still able to rebound at the noon closing. As a result, the paper industry rose by 20% alone compared with the previous closing price, Jardine Matheson remained unchanged, Xiangtai fell back by 10%, and the remaining stocks rose by 10% to 15%.

The Ministry of Economy Orders a Crackdown [Central News Agency, this city dispatch] The Ministry of Economy has ordered an investigation of the Shanghai stock market. All unregistered and unapproved companies and firms are not allowed to operate securities. If there are any secret transactions, they will be cracked down on according to law.

### Grain Prices Have Been Weak for Several Days, But They Started to Rebound Yesterday

Yesterday, the rice market turned firm due to rain. After several days of weakness, things reached an extreme and rebounded. The Spring Festival closure is approaching, and the stores are preparing for sales, so the demand is quite good. As a result, both japonica and indica increased by 500 to 600 yuan, but white yuan still lagged behind by a thousand yuan. The trend of removing yuan is flat. However, the market in the interior is sluggish. Although the Shanghai market is rising, it may not last long. The closing price has already shown signs of softening. After the continuous decline in flour, the store sales have become active, rising by 300 to 400 yuan. After the sharp drop in the oil market, the retail has become active, rising by more than 3,000 yuan. However, there are still many Qingdao oil coming, so it will not rise too much. Soybeans are slightly tight, and soybean cakes and wheat bran have increased by 200 to 300 yuan along with the turnaround of various commodities. Corn is slightly less than 100 yuan.

Another news, according to the rice market, yesterday this city received a total of 8,800 shih of white japonica etc., including 4,025 shih of white japonica, 1,872 shih of 　 rice, 1,470 shih of early indica, 310 shih of sheep indica, 641 shih of Du indica, 40 shih of Wu indica, 295 shih of white yuan, and 206 shih of Yin yuan.

### The Huge Price of Wenzhou Longjing Tea is Shocking

It is understood that the flag and gun green tea, commonly known as Longjing, which is sold exclusively to the domestic market and the surrounding areas, has had a good sales volume in recent years. According to the past practice, the new tea should appear on the market early, but unfortunately, this year, when the new tea was about to be produced, the weather was not mild, and it was entangled in continuous rain, so the output was greatly reduced, and all the payments were very large, so the cost of the tea farmers was quite expensive. It is now learned from the origin that the new Mingqian tea in Wenzhou has already been launched, and it can be shipped to Shanghai when the shipping schedule is close. However, the asking price is quite shocking. The Chao goods are priced at 30,000 yuan per dan. After roasting and shipping to Shanghai, the cost per dan must reach at least 260,000 to 270,000 yuan. As for the Yucha tea, Wenzhou, Hangzhou and other places will also gradually introduce new tea soon.

### Medium Sugar White Falls Weakly

Yesterday, the sugar market was still weak in medium sugar and white sugar. The public association's bid was only 47,000 yuan to 47,250 yuan. The city sold another 49,000 yuan for the 　 white sugar and 52,000 yuan to 52,500 yuan for the 　 white sugar. The Shang 　 Qinghao offered 52,000 yuan for the goods with tax slips, which was still stable. The ordinary 　 Qing was 50,000 yuan, and the Xinghua Qing was 45,000 to 46,000 yuan.

### Spinning and Construction Advance Delivery, Yarn Prices Rise and Fall Again

Yesterday, the yarn market wanted to rise but was unable to. In the early morning, the 20-count yarns of each brand once shouted up 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, but there were not many transactions. Later, due to the announcement by the Spinning and Construction Company that the auction would be advanced and listed yesterday afternoon, people's hearts suddenly softened, and the price could not be sustained and fell. The Min and Guangdong gangs handled it slightly. The closing price was similar to the previous day. The Spinning and Construction yesterday reduced the auction price by 20,000 to 150,000 compared to the previous period. The 60-count yarn was devalued the most.

### Spot Cotton Trading is Slack

Yesterday, New York US cotton rose 7 to 14 points, with the near-term US dollar at 27.86, the far-term at 27.93, and the Mitterling spot at 28.46. The spot cotton trading in this port is still not improving. The reason is that gold and stocks have not developed much, and the yarn and cloth market is also soft, so many parties are waiting and watching. The Spinning and Construction Company and private yarn mills are also waiting and watching. Only the flower shops have a little decoration transaction, with the opening price of Mitterling at 78,000 to 80,000 yuan, and the price of Yuyao flower at 80,000 yuan.

### Gold Prices Are Not Easy to Rise

After yesterday's lower buying by silver money, (gold is acceptable for mortgaging), yesterday's buying remained busy, but high prices were still difficult to sustain.

### Central Bank Seeks to Prevent Capital Flight; Foreign Banks to Periodically Halt Foreign Exchange Accounts; Various Countries to Assist in Suppressing Capital Flight Abroad

After the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, capital flight continues to occur. It is understood that there are two main channels for capital flight: one is opening foreign exchange accounts at various foreign banks, and the other is depositing foreign exchange funds in foreign banks abroad. According to the Central Bank authorities, the government has stipulated that all foreign exchange accounts opened at foreign banks in the city must be closed by September 30th of this year. At that time, all remaining balances in foreign exchange accounts must be transferred to the Central Bank and converted into legal tender at the official foreign exchange rate at that time, or converted into drafts for import settlement purposes. After September 30th, all Chinese and foreign banks will no longer be allowed to open foreign exchange deposit accounts. As for funds fleeing abroad, the central banks of various countries at the Bretton Woods Conference expressed their hope to cooperate and jointly curb foreign exchange speculation and capital flight. According to this international financial policy, various governments will assist our Central Bank to ensure that funds fleeing abroad are subject to the new foreign exchange measures stipulated by our government. Then, the only way for these fleeing funds is to be converted into commodities and flow back to the country.

### Hong Kong Gradually Returns to Normal

[Washington, 2nd (US News Agency)] According to a report received yesterday by the International Trade Office of the Department of Commerce, the financial, commercial, and travel situation in Hong Kong has gradually improved in recent months. Hong Kong Island is now open for normal trade, with the exception of daily necessities that are in short supply. Hong Kong government officials hope to further relax trade restrictions as soon as possible. Before the war, Hong Kong Island was a completely free trade port. Under the current regulations, goods must obtain two types of permits for import. First, importers must apply to the Hong Kong Island Finance Department for a permit to purchase foreign exchange. After the application is approved, they must then request a second permit from Hong Kong Customs. Currently, the most needed goods in Hong Kong are food, clothing, building materials, timber, and medicines. Applications for US dollar foreign exchange for the import of luxury goods are often rejected. Since last November, London has been considering the return of former employees of Hong Kong trading companies. Until then, only bankers and United Nations people related to industrial organizations such as public utilities were allowed to return to Hong Kong Island. A spokesman for the Hong Kong military government stated that the Hong Kong government will hand over to non-military authorities as soon as the situation permits. The legal tender used on Hong Kong Island is banknotes issued by HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank. Currently, one US dollar is equivalent to 9.252 Hong Kong dollars.

### Northern Jiangsu People Silently Pray for Peace; Eagerly Hope That Huaiyin Group Will Succeed Thoroughly

— Nantong, March 28th Communication, Yao Wei

Today, after a year of hard fighting, the people who have suffered enough all hope that the glory of victory can shine on every corner. The warmth of peace soothes everyone's heart. No more shadows of war, filling the beautiful landscape; no more gunshots and cannons, jarring the harmonious symphony of city sounds. Who doesn't yearn for this? Unless they are not human? Who wants civil strife? Unless they are man-eating beasts!

However, victory has come for more than seven months, and lamentations are everywhere. There are refugees who cannot return home. We want peace, and they want to live and work in peace. Therefore, after the news of the Peace Group of the Military Mediation Executive Department going to various places for inspection was released, everyone placed this hope, no, this ardent hope, on them.

The Xuzhou Group and the Huaiyin Group are one of the seventeen groups in the country. The composition of the group is the same as other groups. It is composed of representatives from the government, the Communist Party, and the United States. The US representative is Lieutenant Colonel Deng Ke, the government representatives are Colonel Xiao Fengqi, Colonel Yang Chao, and Major Wang Furong. The Communist Party representative is Colonel Han Nianlong, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Central China Region of the New Fourth Army, Lieutenant Colonel Yan Zhenheng, and Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Keding. There are also attached staff members, translators, etc., totaling more than ten people. Their itinerary is as follows: Except for the Communist Party representatives who were originally in Huaiyin, all personnel gathered in Huaiyin on March 8th, stayed for six days, and departed for Baoying and Gaoyou on the 11th, staying in Gaoyou. The next day, they went to Xinghua, the 13th to Dongtai, the 14th to Rubu stayed for two days, the 17th to Baibu, and the 18th to Nantong. As of today (March 28th) when the reporter is writing, they have not yet left Nantong.

Mediation Process

Starting from Huaiyin, the Communist Party first submitted Memorandum No. 1. Because it could not obtain the consent of the government side, the Baodi inspection began. Therefore, formal mediation talks and group meetings have not yet started. At the same time, because the principle of mediation is based on the ceasefire order of the Military Mediation Executive Department and Article 2 of Character No. 2, which stipulates that "the B side should be 60 li away from the city where the A side is stationed," although the Communist army's stationing locations are far from this provision, even if the government side repeatedly concedes, it is impossible to have a rapid approach to the talks. At the same time, based on the sincerity of the talks, the two sides have different compositions. There can be no satisfactory result. Naturally, the most important thing here belongs to the American representative, who is a compromiser, but according to what the reporter knows, he can only obtain the hope of one side separately from the government side or the Communist Party side, and the distance between these two hopes is often very far. If it is said that the mediation is absolutely based on principles, naturally this is easy for allies in the position of mediators to handle. The difficulty lies in the fact that principles are still principles, and facts are facts. Therefore, in terms of mediation, the reporter can only say that there has been such a process, but cannot say half a point of achievement. But up to Nantong, this is only the first difficulty encountered by the Huaiyin Group. After Nantong, there are still many places such as Haimen, not to mention Taixing, Jingjiang, Taixian, Yangzhou, etc. If they do not break through this first hurdle and reach the realm of peace, how will they continue this mediation work? According to representatives from both sides, "No one can take responsibility, and they have to ask their superiors for instructions"! Poor old people on the road to governance are praying for peace. How are they dedicating their hot hearts to the group? They are petitioning countless times, and the reality written in infinite blood, requesting a response from the group of peace angels, but is it possible? Does this continuous spring rain really forever bring us mourning faces, gloomy atmosphere, and muddy roads?

Memorandum Excerpts

In Huaiyin, the first memorandum was submitted by the Communist Party, with three articles regarding the stationing issue in Baibu Town, the midpoint of Rugao and Nantong. According to the current location of Baibu Town, which belongs to the government's stationed area, the Communist Party's hope is: "Please immediately order the national army that has advanced 50 li north and to Baibu Town to immediately withdraw north of Pingchao and Baibu Town and return to the original defense of Nantong," which means that the national army can only be stationed in the urban area of Nantong, which means that only one "point" of control can exist. Naturally, it is not easy for the government to accept.

To Rugao Station, the Rugao County Government submitted Memorandum No. 1. In addition to the description of the struggle for strongholds, there are approximately two requirements in the request items: (1) Rugao should be returned to the government for demobilization, (2) The former Rugao County Magistrate and county government staff should be released, (3) No more public grain should be collected, legal tender should not be rejected, and the use of anti-currency and self-made stamps should be stopped immediately. These requirements are based on certain facts. The following is a brief description of the process of Peng Fuzhong, the former Rugao County Magistrate, coming to Rugao to return to work and being captured: Since the arrival of victory, County Magistrate Peng went to Rugao on September 14th, 34th year of the Republic to return to work, and began to take over on the 16th, but gunshots were intensive in the suburbs and traffic was cut off, and the Communist army began shooting. The Rugao garrison troops were the county security regiment and the Independent First Brigade of the Second Route Army, which returned fire for self-defense. On the 21st, the Communist army reinforced again, and the troops and puppet army of the Japanese prisoners of war attacked fiercely, and broke into the city at about 1:00 p.m. Therefore, the county government staff below Peng, the former county magistrate, were mostly captured.

The second is the memorandum submitted by the government troops currently stationed in Nantong to the executive group, which is a report on the Communist troops' violation of the ceasefire order, occupying Lingdian Port, attacking and tying Baibu Town, blockading materials, and obstructing traffic. Its hopes are approximately as follows: (1) Restore the connection between Nantong and Haimen, because the Communist army is stationed along the Haitong Highway, harassing everywhere, so that traffic is cut off, (2) Eliminate material blockade, the Communist army freezes the materials in the occupied area, strictly prohibiting the people's materials from being transported out of the Communist army's defense zone, so that the prices of Nantong Haimen are soaring, and food and fuel are even more scarce, (3) Please order the Communist army to thoroughly obey the ceasefire order and not to attack Lingdian Port and other places guarded by local troops again, (4) The Communist army should withdraw from the encirclement of Nantong, Baibu Town, and Haimen, and the Communist army has long completed the encirclement posture of Haimen Nantong Baibu and other places, and is gradually approaching, (5) Return Lingdian Port, it was found that Lingdian Port was not a Communist-controlled area before the ceasefire agreement. This time, the Qidong County Government temporarily stationed at Lingdian Port on the border of Haimen because it was afraid of causing conflicts by stationing in the Qidong county seat for demobilization work, and the Communist army launched an attack and fiercely occupied it. This memorandum can be said to be largely based on the Communist army's failure to abide by the ceasefire order.

The first memorandum submitted by the Nantong County Government has requirements in the stationed area of the troops: (1) The Communist army should withdraw 60 li outside Nantong County, that is, the Communist army should abide by the ceasefire order and Word No. 2 to withdraw from Liuqiao, Shigang, Jinsha, Erjia Town, Zhangzhishan, Maozhen and other places, (2) Within 60 li outside Nantong City, it is the government army's activity area, and the Communist army should not come to harass again, (3) The junction of 60 li should be used as a buffer zone. Administrative security issues should be handled through consultation between the two parties. The central legal tender should be used for the currency system, and goods should be allowed to exchange in and out. Neither party should blockade. The second is to repair the Tonghai Highway and release government staff (according to the Communist army, more than ten village heads and village team leaders appointed by the government have been arrested).

People's Voices

The first item is the report of the Rugao County People's Organization, which lists: 1. The crimes of the Communist army against the people, 2. The process of County Magistrate Peng being captured when Rugao returned to office, 3. The return of Baibu, 4. The situation of the Communist army attacking Baibu after the ceasefire order was issued. 5. The situation of the Communist army disturbing the local area after the ceasefire order was issued. 6. Exposing the Communist Party's conspiracy to coerce the people to demand the "liberation of Baibu," etc., is extremely detailed, and it is impossible to write it out completely due to space limitations to fulfill the responsibility of reporting. Now, only their petitions and hopes are written as follows: Immediately release Peng Zhiben, the head of the county and county government staff who were arrested on September 21st of the 34th year of the Republic, 2. Immediately release the gentry of Rugao County who were arrested. 3. Immediately stop the Communist Party from confiscating the property of the Kuomintang between Matang and Juegang, and return the property of the people that has been confiscated and extorted. 4. No blockade of materials, forced collection of public grain. 5. Restore traffic immediately. 6. No rejection of legal tender. 7. Rugao must be demobilized. 8. The Communist army should withdraw from Rugao County. 9. Illegal arrests of people are not allowed.

The second is the petition memorandum signed and stamped by 4,000 representatives of the people in the first district of Nantong County, which contains more than ten main points, the main idea is to restore traffic, lift the blockade of food and grass in Nantong, and strictly implement the ceasefire order and Word No. 2, etc. In short, it is mainly to live and work in peace.

### The 18th Meeting of the Political Participation Council Passes Military Report Resolution

[Chongqing, 2nd (Central News Agency)] At the 18th meeting of the Political Participation Council on the 1st, a resolution on the military report was passed. The full text is as follows: This council reviewed the military and political aspects of the work report of the Executive Yuan, and listened to the oral report of the ministry. It was learned that the military and political authorities have planned and gradually implemented matters such as surrendering, capturing, demobilizing and reorganizing the army, and improving treatment. In addition to the joy of colleagues, there are still things that cannot be said, and special opinions are presented on the left:

### Expedite the Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners and Assess the Collected Materials

(1) Enemy prisoners should be sent back to their country as soon as possible. There are no less than one million enemy prisoners in China. Except for those who have been sent back to their country, there are still many. At this time of food panic, it is not appropriate to let these Japanese prisoners stay in the country for a long time and waste people's food. The government should be asked to send them back to their country as soon as possible. (2) There should be an assessment of the collection of enemy military materials. Since the surrender of the enemy army, the reception personnel dispatched by the government have not lacked those who are honest and law-abiding and have done their best, but the general phenomenon is that there are many malpractices and disturbances are rampant. Among them, military and political reception personnel are not all self-loving people, and there are many places that give people excuses. The military and political authorities should strictly assess the types and quantities of materials received by the various armies, as well as the situation of storage and use. Personnel involved in malpractice should also be punished according to law to clarify rewards and punishments. The rectification of military discipline is the key to rectifying and building the army. The military and political authorities should strive for performance in this.

### Simplify Military Institutions and Settle Redundant Officers and Soldiers

(5) Military administrative institutions should be further simplified. The division of agencies and different responsibilities are the diseases of administration. Military institutions also suffer from this problem. They are often not connected to relevant institutions, which affects efficiency. The government has already made some improvements in this regard, and it is especially appropriate to further simplify the overlapping military and political institutions to achieve the effect of unity and strengthening. (4) The demobilization of the army should be coordinated with national construction. After the war, how to settle the officers and soldiers of the army who will be demobilized and discharged in stages, which will be millions of people, should be coordinated with the national construction plan. For example, if a certain place is managing rivers and repairing roads, the redundant officers and soldiers in that place should be trained to engage in such work. It is not appropriate to recruit civilian laborers separately, so that the redundant officers and soldiers still have to find other settlements, and each does not conspire with each other. The fundamental plan lies in the rapid development of various construction undertakings and the simultaneous consideration of the livelihood of officers and soldiers, and social hidden dangers can also be eliminated immediately.

### Improve the Conscription System and Research Military Academics

(5) The standing army after the completion of the army reorganization should collect strong men for military service in accordance with the conscription law. The number of standing army after the army reorganization is small. It should be collected in accordance with the provisions of the conscription law as a demonstration of conscription. It should not be convenient for a while and still recruit, so that the conscription system can never be soundly established. (6) New weapons and military academics, research should strive for advancement. Not only is the equipment of the Chinese army incomplete, but weapons and academics are even more backward. Efforts should be made to advance in all aspects of education, training, and military industry in order to catch up with advanced countries. (7) Honored veterans should be properly resettled. Honored veterans sacrifice for the country and contribute to the country. The government should properly plan and improve methods for their rehabilitation, return to their hometowns for employment, and compensation, so that each can get what they deserve to show the country's intention to respect morality and reward merit.

### Build an Air Force and Navy and Stabilize Social Order

(8) The construction of the air force and navy should be prepared immediately. Modernized military land, sea, and air forces are equally important. The construction of the Chinese army has a certain scale. In the future, in addition to reorganizing the army and increasing its strength, efforts should be made to enrich the air force and establish the navy in order to promote the national defense construction at the same time. Moreover, this conference believes that military and political construction is almost due to the stability of the national and social order, the restoration of transportation, and the unification of the world. The cessation of conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communist armies is a prerequisite. Now the national army has obeyed the order to cease fire, but the Communist army is besieging cities and seizing land, and it is still not stopping. If this continues, it will affect the overall military and political construction plan. I sincerely hope that the government will quickly seek a proper solution to rescue the people from fire and water, so that the military and political construction plan can also be implemented smoothly. The country is very fortunate.

### Applying the Encouragement of Industry Through Spring Outings: The Grandeur of the Flower Fair in Chengdu in March at Qingyang Palace and Erxian Temple

— Chengdu, March 28th, Airmail Dispatch, Sent by Zhou Yangquan

Chengdu in March is a city of flowers. Plum blossoms have faded, peach blossoms have bloomed, peach blossoms have faded, and roses are in full bloom. Especially recently, it is the lively season for the flower fair in the west of the city.

Speaking of Chengdu's trade fairs, they have a history of thousands of years, passed down from the late Tang Dynasty and the Former and Later Shu kingdoms, continuing to this day. It wasn't until the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign that the local authorities renamed it the "Industrial Encouragement Fair" to promote industry and commerce. Following old customs, the government took charge, collecting products from various counties for display. At the end of the fair, they would assess and award prizes to encourage participation, making it a very meaningful gathering. During the War of Resistance, there were one or two large-scale events, but in other years, people gathered on their own, on a smaller scale. Last year was particularly lackluster, with most participating businesses losing money. This year, the Chengdu Municipal Government is supervising and managing the fair, so hopefully, it won't disappoint people again.

The fairgrounds are located inside and outside of Qingyang Palace and Erxian Temple, about a mile outside the New West Gate, covering an area of about fifty acres. The space is rented to merchants at a price of 8,600 yuan per square zhang (unit of area) at most and 4,000 yuan at least. They can rent as much as they need, and with an additional 10,000 yuan for erecting a temporary shed, they can do short-term business.

A Small Temporary Society

According to the person in charge's statistics, the various categories participating in this flower fair include over a hundred snack shops, fifty teahouses, seven theaters and amusement venues, fifty toy stores, over two hundred cigarette shops, over sixty wood and bamboo ware shops, over ten porcelain shops, over forty flower nurseries, and over a hundred other miscellaneous businesses. It's truly a small, temporary society here. They have come from hundreds or thousands of miles away to participate. Earning profit is only a small part of their purpose because in Chengdu, the custom is to enjoy leisure, and the element of leisure surpasses that of making money! In the center of the fairgrounds is the municipal government's reception area, which serves as the administrative hub of the Industrial Encouragement Fair. They are divided into hygiene, construction, site management, general affairs, and public relations groups, responsible for managing this large venue (which is actually a market). As for security and fire prevention, a joint military, police, and gendarmerie command has been established for overall management.

Touching the Green Goat Cures All Ills

The opening ceremony coincided with a pilgrimage period (mid-lunar month). Those devout men and women gathered in groups from all over. The two temples were filled with swirling incense smoke and warm candlelight. They scrambled to worship, especially crowding around the two bronze green goats, which have been touched until they gleam with gold. It is said that touching the green goat can cure all illnesses; touching the head for headaches, touching the leg for leg pain. What a laughable and pitiable foolish act!

The Effects of Industrial Encouragement are Still Slight

The weather is mild and sunny. At midday, tens of thousands of people, young and old, male and female, gather from all directions to join the fun and seek enjoyment. The narrow sidewalks are truly packed, with people flowing like a river, wave after wave. One can fully see Chengdu people's interest in leisure. They put on their New Year's attire and spend money without hesitation, seeking their own enjoyment. Although the municipal authorities have announced that they are applying the encouragement of industry through leisure, the effect on industrial encouragement seems too slight.

Flower Windmills Fly Through the Streets

The Chengdu Tap Water Company, in collaboration with the Provincial Experimental Elementary School, has created a set of models of the water supply process, which is the most distinctive exhibit at the fair. The local products from various counties in the Industrial Hall and the finished products exhibition of the Jiahua Cement Factory also add a lot of color to the event. Those "Wenjiang Douyou" (soybean oil), "Pixian Douban" (fermented broad bean paste), "Dongzikou Liangfen" (mung bean jelly), "Xindu Yierba" (glutinous rice cakes), and "Renshou Mabing" (sesame seed cakes), are everywhere, smiling at customers!

As the sun sets in the west, almost every tourist loves to go home with a paper flower windmill, dragging their tired bodies. As a result, flower windmills are flying everywhere in the streets and alleys, at the mercy of the spring breeze. This gathering will continue until the end of the lunar March before gradually dispersing. (28th)

### An Urgent Appeal for the Precarious Dike at Jinshanwei!

— Hou Wuji

Our Jinshanwei seawall in Songjiang has been quite sturdy since its construction in 1934. However, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Jinshanwei area was a landing site for enemy forces. Over the years, the dike body has eroded severely, and with the tidal water scouring it day and night, it now poses a serious threat. The last line of defense (the stone dike) is also exposed. The consequences are truly unthinkable!

Ever since the enemy surrendered, men of insight in Songjiang have been eager to make repairing the precarious dike at Jinshanwei a priority. However, given the nation's difficulties, they feared their wishes would not be fulfilled. Later, they heard that the Relief Administration's Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch had sent a letter to the Songjiang Relief Association, ordering swift repairs, with all expenses to be paid by the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch. Upon hearing this, they rejoiced repeatedly. However, they recently learned that the project consists of only "filling with soil"! Therefore, they cannot help but make an urgent appeal to all public figures and community leaders.

Upon investigation, the seawall constructed in 1934 used tilted-slope rock throwing, one-bridge-one-stone, two-pile-two-stone, and three-pile-three-stone methods, etc., depending on the severity of the threat, and never considered "filling with soil" as a permanent solution. Now, after surviving the calamity, repairing the seawall with only "filling with soil" to complete the task is something that no one can agree with. It cannot withstand even a day of tidal erosion! As for the repair costs, since they are paid by the Relief Administration Branch, this is the best opportunity. How to make the project sturdy and long-lasting is important, but "filling with soil" is merely a temporary fix! Considering the current critical situation at Jinshanwei, it is even more serious than in 1934. After an on-site inspection, one's hair stands on end in fear. It is sincerely hoped that all public figures will order the start of construction immediately to solidify the project and eliminate this great danger. Otherwise, once an accident occurs, it will be vastly different from the breach of the Haining dike.

Furthermore, the plum rain season is approaching. Judging from past years, there are often typhoons. The waves crash down, carrying everything with them. Life hangs by a thread, and nothing is more frightening than this. Therefore, the project must be completed before the plum rain season, so that Jinshanwei does not follow closely after the Haining accident. As for which type of construction should be chosen, it is the responsibility of the technicians. For the sake of the people's lives and local safety, it is necessary to urgently appeal for the sympathy of the Jiangsu-Nanjing Branch and community leaders so that the disaster prevention work can be completed as soon as possible.

### Children's Health Competition and Physical Examination

— Su Huixiang

Dr. Su Huixiang is a pediatric specialist who studied in Germany and has extensive experience in treating children's diseases. She has recently been appointed by the Municipal Health Bureau as the director of the Shanghai Municipal Children's Hospital, and will surely make new contributions to the health of children in this city. We are very honored that Director Su has written this article for our newspaper on Children's Day. —Editor

Everyone is especially happy on this first Children's Day after the victory, so the Municipal Government, Health Bureau, Municipal Party Department, Women's Movement Committee, and other organizations have jointly organized a children's health competition. The purpose is to promote public awareness of children's health and strengthen the foundation of the country, which is very meaningful.

Ten years ago, the Chinese Infant Education Association and the Xinxin Company both held children's health competitions. During the War of Resistance, the Young Women's Christian Association also held children's health competitions every Children's Day. As a pediatrician, Huixiang has been volunteering to examine and judge these competitions every year, which is a fulfilling and happy thing for me, so I have gained some experience in children's health competitions.

In my opinion, the purpose of holding health competitions and participating in them seems to be not entirely the same. Looking at the examination forms, they are detailed and comprehensive, examining everything from the skin to the internal organs, to check whether the child is sick or not, and not just to give awards. However, the parents participating in the competition are mostly aiming to win awards. It is common to see a family with four or five children, specifically picking out the ones with the hope of winning to participate in the competition, while those who really need a physical examination are left at home. A gentleman once said a few years ago at the Young Women's Christian Association that we should have an "unhealthy" competition. This was said because he felt that since so much time, energy, and money had been spent, it should be done in a way that could achieve the greatest results.

Therefore, I feel that health competitions and physical examinations are two different things. In the current situation, in addition to holding children's health competitions on Children's Day, all institutions across the country should be required to have all children in the country undergo thorough physical examinations by doctors within a certain period of time, and the state should provide partial or free diagnosis and treatment for those found to have diseases during this period in order to provide preferential treatment. If this can be done, then in five years, the health knowledge of the people across the country will surely be greatly improved, and the health of children across the country will surely be improved. In this way, in twenty years, we will not find it difficult to wash away the shame of being the "Sick Man of East Asia" and can permanently maintain this glorious victory!

### My Plea on Behalf of Children – A Word to Society on Children's Day –

— Yang Tongfang

For this first Children's Day after the victory, I don't want to write the usual timely pieces such as "The Meaning of Children's Day" or "Reflections on Children's Day." But I cannot suppress the emotions swelling in my heart, and I must make a plea to society on behalf of pure and innocent children.

I think no one can deny that our society's treatment of children is extremely unreasonable. At least more than half of the children in China live extremely miserable lives. They have no independent rights; they are merely appendages of adults. The long period after a child is born that requires education and nurturing is almost entirely entrusted to ignorant and incompetent parents who do not understand proper methods of education. Of course, we cannot say that there are no enlightened and virtuous parents who can shoulder the responsibility of raising their children, but they are ultimately very few. Except for the extremely fortunate children, most do not have the opportunity to receive appropriate education and nurturing. The most precious period of childhood is spent in the shadows, without sunlight.

Currently, all countries around the world have explicit laws regarding the protection of children, with the aim of safeguarding children's rights and ensuring that the future generations of nations receive reasonable care. Countries like England, America, and the Soviet Union operate their children's welfare programs through the state, and the enthusiastic efforts of the Prussian people in child welfare work are even more admirable. However, looking back at our country, although the rights of children are affirmed in law, the general public in society still treats children with indifference. Child abuse is commonplace. Parents can treat their children as outlets for venting frustration, arbitrarily beating and scolding them. Apprentices in shops are often subjected to the cruel and tyrannical power of their bosses. Children of fifteen or sixteen, whose development is not yet complete, engage in the profession of pulling carts for a living, without any prohibition from the authorities. Even in Shanghai, a city renowned for its education and culture, the evil practice of infanticide is still heard of from time to time, and it is not considered a crime. According to statistical reports, children account for the majority of cases involving the sale of human beings. Such deprivation of children's right to survival in society is truly chilling.

Now, advanced countries in Europe and America are making every effort to promote "parental education," hoping that every parent will possess the knowledge and skills to raise children, using an objective and scientific attitude to solve important issues in children's physical and psychological development. Although our country has also adopted this progressive idea in recent years, it is not yet widespread. Most parents still use traditional and unreasonable methods to educate their children (rather than educating children, it is more accurate to say that they are managing them). These ignorant and unknowing parents first and foremost do not have a correct understanding of the relationship between parents and children, treating their children as private property, unaware that they are individuals with a definite social status. While others train children based on the principles of mental hygiene, using positive suggestions and encouragement to correct children's bad habits, studying children's thoughts and behaviors from the perspective of their physical and mental development, heredity, and environment, most parents in our ancient country, which claims five thousand years of civilization, not only fail to give their children appropriate "love," but also harm their fragile hearts in various ways. Restraint, corporal punishment, scolding, and ridicule have become the main means of educating children. They never think that these are negative and ineffective methods, and at the same time, the most unreasonable and unenlightened methods. Important issues such as childcare hygiene, medicine, and health products are naturally beyond the understanding of those ignorant parents, and thus the happiness of their children is invisibly ruined. As for some who consider themselves new women, they entrust the task of raising their children to maids, and the children receive no good upbringing at all. On the other hand, in addition to strict restraints, corporal punishment, and scolding, there is also the phenomenon of excessive indulgence towards children. Children are spoiled and pampered, making it difficult for them to adapt to life later on.

The eight years of war have deprived many children of their means of living. It was reported the other day that there are currently millions of wandering children struggling on the brink of life and death, awaiting assistance and relief. This again makes us think of the extremely serious problem of juvenile delinquency. Children who do not receive good education and nurturing from society, families, and schools are bound to embark on a path of crime. However, our country treats juvenile offenders in the same way as adults, which greatly affects their physical and mental well-being. Countries such as Europe and America now have facilities called "juvenile delinquency reformatories," which are dedicated to providing active guidance to children who have committed crimes. However, our country does not have such a reasonable organization. Children who commit minor offenses are imprisoned and placed together with adult criminals, where they are subjected to their negative suggestions, leading to further degradation. Now that there are so many children facing death and exile, if effective relief methods are not quickly planned, these millions of children will either die out or become candidates for criminals. During this war, England always evacuated children to the suburbs before military operations began in various places, and the United States also implemented thorough measures to ensure the safety of children during wartime, but our country is not concerned about improving this situation. Most of the wandering children, if not handled properly, will have their young shoots of national life destroyed for no reason. Furthermore, if these children become criminals due to poor education and nurturing, then our conscience will be severely tested: Who caused these innocent children to commit crimes? Who is responsible for the moral degradation of these children?

Threats to children's safety and health are also very serious. Most schools cannot provide children with a reasonable living environment, allowing them to live in places with insufficient light and polluted air. The standards of health education and hygiene facilities are very poor, so that children's fragile bodies and minds are easily infected with diseases. Even in Shanghai alone, more than 60% of school children are physically weak, according to statistics from the health authorities, and the actual percentage is probably even higher. Going into the "alley schools" (弄堂學校) for a look, the equipment does not meet sanitary principles, which is simply unimaginable. As for life outside of school, children spend all day wandering on the streets or sitting on the curbs watching "little books," absorbing the toxic elements of the mystical and lewd from comics with impure ideas. This has a very bad effect on their physical and mental well-being. Society lacks places specifically for children to play. A healthy spiritual life (including cultural life) is lacking, and the issue of safety is also very serious. Looking at the children's parks, children's playgrounds, children's libraries, and various other children's welfare programs established everywhere else, what are our thoughts! For the urgent needs of children's physical and mental well-being, to save them from the suffering they are experiencing physically and mentally, I must make a plea for them here!

I first ask that society change its traditional attitude towards children and no longer ignore the education and nurturing of children, which is more important than anything else. We must respect children's independent personality and rights. "The 20th century is the century of the child." We should recognize the value of Aikey's (愛偷凱) words. Children are not miniature adults. They should have their own world of activities. We cannot hinder their normal physical and mental development with passive prohibitions, and we must not use beating, corporal punishment, scolding, and various other unreasonable methods of punishment to destroy their physical and mental health and deprive them of their innate rights. It is wrong to expect children to conform to adult judgments, habits, and thoughts.

We also hope that the legal protection of children will not become a mere formality, and that significant progress will be made in the advancement of children's welfare programs. We must completely correct the erroneous views that society has held about children in the past. At the same time, families and schools should establish close ties and jointly assume the responsibility of protecting and nurturing children. Enlightened people in society, virtuous parents, and progressive teachers can work together to cultivate future "members of society," irrigate the fresh cells of the nation, and then China's future will have hope of revival!

### Homemade Small Work Pants

— Nian Shufang

Loving beauty is a natural instinct, especially for girls. When they go to school, they always want their clothes to be more beautiful and special than those of other children. Wealthy people don't need to worry; they can buy whatever they want. But ordinary people can't do that. Why don't we take advantage of our free time to make them ourselves? Children will definitely especially love the artistic clothes made by their own mothers.

The dimensions (in feet) in the diagram are suitable for a five- or six-year-old girl.

Materials: It is best to use woolen material, which can be made from old cheongsams or skirts, or ordinary sturdy fabrics.

Instructions: Cut according to the dimensions in the diagram. First sew the pant legs, then attach the chest piece at the front. Add a wide elastic band at the back of the waistband to make them more fitted and eliminate the need to open and button on the side, making them easier to put on and take off. Then add a belt. The most important thing is to find some unique patterns and embroider them on the chest and pockets to make the whole pair of pants look brand new and different from those bought in the market.

### Using National Resources to Establish Nurseries: An Appeal from a Female Staff Member

— Yimo

A maid in my household, surnamed Xu, was in charge of taking care of my child. Some time ago, she left her job because her child died of smallpox. When she tearfully resigned from her job, I truly blamed heaven for being unfair. Accompanying her tears, I didn't know how to comfort her. Alas! Everyone cherishes their own children. "Abandoning one's own field to cultivate another's" resulted in this. How can people not feel sympathy?

It turned out that she had abandoned her child because of hunger, while I could not take care of my child because of my work. Forced by circumstances, each had their own difficulties. From this, I thought of the Soviet Union's nursery system, which is truly the source of its national strength. Consider that the Soviet revolution is only twenty-eight years old; yet many of its talents today are products of the nurseries of that time. Its importance today is no accident. Therefore, we should learn from others' strengths to make up for our own shortcomings, quickly grasp reality to create the future.

I am now the mother of two children – twins. Because I am a small clerk in the post office, I have eight hours of work every day. The children's affairs are simply entrusted to the maid. I ask, what is the impact on children who spend all day mingling with maids? "If dyed in indigo, it becomes indigo; if dyed in yellow, it becomes yellow." As a result, not only do they not make progress in knowledge, but they also learn many bad habits; they develop some bad tempers; care is even more out of the question. Everyone wants their children to be good, with their physical and mental strength increasing day by day. But in this situation, what can a mother do? Apart from "doing my utmost," I can only feel dejected. As we often say, children are the masters of tomorrow, and the nannies of our second-generation masters are indeed working hard to fulfill their responsibilities!

Today, the Chinese nation, which has the largest population but lacks substance, should change its course regarding national strength based on the painful experiences it has encountered over the years. Identify the center of gravity of the nation, "save the children." Otherwise, if we pursue the branch instead of the root, even if we of this generation can turn things around and become prosperous and strong, if the successors are unworthy, they will still not be able to carry on the past and open up the future. Wouldn't we be wasting our efforts?

It is said that there are only nurseries in Shanghai and Chongqing. This is only a temporary measure taken by local people, the happiness of a few children. What we hope for is to establish them with national resources. Of course, given the national strength after the war, there are many things to be done. We do not expect to establish them universally all at once. But as politics gradually gets back on track, military spending will inevitably decrease after the reorganization of the army. Why not transfer a small part of this savings to child welfare funds? In the future, the Ministry of Education can designate public schools to attach kindergartens and nurseries according to local conditions, or the Ministry of Social Affairs can handle them separately. Everything depends on human effort. It takes ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred years to cultivate a person. The children are fortunate! The mothers are fortunate! (Respectful salutation)

### Starting with Snot

Here, let me tell you a joke first.

Xiao Mi is already five years old, but he doesn't understand cleanliness at all. He constantly trails two lines of purulent snot, simply unwilling to wipe them. One day, his mother said:

"Xiao Mi, look how filthy you are! Quickly wipe off your snot, and I'll buy you candy in a little while!"

Xiao Mi is very "well-behaved" and immediately sucks the snot back into his nostrils. But in less than a minute, he starts pestering his mother for candy! Mom gently slapped him and said:

"You really want to eat candy! I was just teasing you!"

Xiao Mi doesn't make a fuss anymore, but immediately lets the snot flow down again and says with a smile:

"I'm teasing you too!"

Sir, you laughed, didn't you? That's right, this is a joke. However, rather than saying it's a "joke," I think it would be more accurate to call it a "crying joke"!

It cannot be denied that in Chinese society, there is a serious lack of mothers who truly understand and are willing to study how to educate their children! When ordinary mothers discover that their children have made mistakes, they either indulge them completely or beat and scold them desperately. Further, some mothers simply entrust their children entirely to servants, regardless of whether they go east or west, simply holding the principle of not caring! In fact, everyone knows that it is not advisable to indulge children with "my precious darlings" and let them do whatever they want. Similarly, constantly scolding them with "little devils! Dead people!" or even "slapping!" and exercising their fists is not the way. Furthermore, the policy of "you are you, I am me" is even more absurd! However, unfortunately, the facts will tell you that "knowing full well, still committing" is a common phenomenon; most mothers still adopt the policy that cannot escape the category of "beating," "scolding," or "not scolding and not asking"!

Although there are different policies from the above types, for example, isn't the "teasing you" technique quite remarkable? Human nature is greedy! By taking advantage of this "greed," you can trick people. It goes without saying that mothers tricking their children is even easier! Candy, money, making new clothes, buying foreign dolls... which one can't stir the child's heart? So mothers "tease you" today and "tease you" tomorrow, finally forging children, one by one, in a long-term deceptive environment, stimulating the innocent psychology and leading to "precocious adulthood"! Like Xiao Mi, they all know how to deal with other people's tricks and how to trick people! In other words, they are deeply knowledgeable! Sir, please think about it! Letting children discard their precious "innocence" and become "old" at the age of five, six, seven, or eight, is this a good phenomenon or a bad phenomenon? At least, I erroneously argue that this is contrary to nature! Is it? Then, are we still prepared to manufacture "deception" intentionally? Manufacture "jokes"?

No! Mothers of the world, for the sake of your second generation, for the sake of yourselves, stop thoughtlessly destroying your "products"! Adopt proper guiding methods to educate your children!

### Song of the Child Bride

— Baling

"Being a child bride is more bitter than anything; dragging slippers, the mother-in-law scolds every month; the eldest aunt next door couldn't bear it, made a pair of shoes to give me. I spin yarn day and night until past midnight, so hungry I can't stand it, stealing some pickled vegetables to fill my stomach; eagerly awaiting the New Year's Eve."

The above is a folk song about child brides. From this song, we can see what kind of life child brides generally live. How can we eradicate the bad habit of raising child brides in China for thousands of years? How can we improve the lives of child brides today? This is a question that those who pay attention to Chinese family problems should study.

### Psychological Obstacles for Women to Expand Social Work [Part 1]

— Xiao Cai

Those who generally study women's issues feel that women cannot expand into vast social work like men, and cannot take social undertakings as their lifelong careers. It's not that they can't get involved, but they give up halfway. There are very few who devote their lifelong energy to a certain career. Therefore, some people take a male-centered stance and hold a prejudice, thinking that women's intelligence and ability are not as good as men's, and that innate limitations mean that women can only raise children and manage the home, forever only being in a position dominated by men. Those who hold this view include the great 19th-century philosopher Schopenhauer. Even Aristotle thought that women were inferior to men. He said that one of the reasons for the destruction of Sparta was that women had the right to inherit property, because this gave them great independence, which led the people of Sparta into an unfortunate situation. Also, in modern times, Hitler strongly advocated that women return to the kitchen. Although this contained the political function of the Nazi Party, it was all based on the same mistake of despising women's opportunities and depriving women of their independent, free position and personality. These views have now been proven from the physiological and psychological aspects to prove that there is no difference in innate superiority between men and women, and we don't need to refute these arguments. Because the evidence of scientific facts naturally trumps any rhetoric. However, standing from the perspective of women, we cannot deny the fact that women cannot participate in social work like men, expand social work, and take social work as their lifelong careers. As far as the current situation in Chinese society is concerned, in recent years, it has been a very common phenomenon that higher education allows women to have the same opportunities as men, but the number of women who are truly able to take social service as their lifelong careers is compared to the number of educated women, although no one has conducted an objective survey on this matter yet, but according to our estimates, the proportion must be quite small. So, what other reasons are there for women's inability to keep pace with men in social work, besides denying that their intelligence and ability are inferior to men? Up until now, the forces of male-centered society have been preserved extremely powerfully, and all departments of society still give women various obstacles, preventing women from entering and leaving various departments of society as freely as men. This social resistance is sufficient to prevent women from expanding their work like men. However, in addition to social resistance, there are also psychological reasons for women's difficulty in expanding social work. This article puts aside social reasons and only explains why women cannot expand social work from the perspective of psychological reasons.

I believe that psychological reasons are one of the greatest obstacles for women to expand social work. Because if women themselves truly have the perseverance and courage to overcome social difficulties, then social resistance will not be enough to prevent women from participating in social undertakings, and even less to prevent women from taking social undertakings as their lifelong careers. Dr. Ellis, an expert in women's psychology, once believed that women are unable to overcome environmental difficulties to create an outstanding figure like Bacon and Ibsen, which also means that the reason why there are so few scientists and artists is still due to psychological reasons.
