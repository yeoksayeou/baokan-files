### Bai Chongxi Arrives in Shenyang by Plane to Inspect Northeast National Army Defenses

[Our Newspaper Beiping Seventeenth Dispatch] The Northeast problem is evolving at an accelerated pace. The people of North China largely foresee ominous developments due to frequent conflicts. The Communist side, citing the worsening Northeast conflicts, is actively sabotaging transportation. The people are watching Marshal Marshall's movements with hope for rescue. Mr. Bai Chongxi and his generals from the Ministry of National Defense arrived in Beiping simultaneously and transferred to the Northeast today. It is generally speculated that Mr. Bai's trip will significantly influence the Northeast military situation and the overall situation in the coming weeks. The siege of Siping has lasted for four weeks, and the Communist forces in Gongzhuling have reached 100,000. On the surface, a stalemate is forming regarding the war in Changchun. Under the instigation of the "Democratic Allied Army," the influence on resolving the Northeast issue is accelerating. Communist figures in Beiping, with an air of confident humility, express their confidence in stopping the National Army. According to a certain "middleman" who recently arrived in Beiping, the Communist army's capture of Changchun seems unlikely, as this move would significantly affect the perception of the Chinese Communist Party by American conservatives, and even force Marshall, who sympathizes with the government, to recover Changchun. This person also stated: "Zhou Baozhong and others, a part of the 'Democratic Allied Army,' may not fully accept the guidance of the CCP Central Committee, and Zhou Enlai himself is not confident in this, as Zhou Baozhong and others believe that the price demanded by the CCP is still too low." Zhou Enlai also personally indicated to this middleman that resolving the problem should shift to addressing the objective and practical responsibilities of the current issue. The recent five-to-one troop reduction plan proposed by the Central Committee further proves this. Finally, this person, based on general observations, stated that a ceasefire in the Northeast will still be agreed upon soon, perhaps within a month.

[Central News Agency Shenyang Seventeenth Dispatch] Vice Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Chief Li Houlong of the Political Department, arrived in Shenyang by plane from Beiping at 4:30 PM on the 17th. Director Xiong, Commander Du, and over a hundred others welcomed him. Mr. Bai met with Director Xiong at the guesthouse, received Commander Du, Chairman Xu, Mayor Dong, and others, and inquired about the situation. When reporters asked about his mission in Shenyang, he said: He had spent several months inspecting the troop training situation along the Tianjin-Pukou, Beiping-Hankou, and Longhai lines, as well as Qingdao and Jinan, and had largely completed his task. He had come to the Northeast specifically for inspection and planned to visit all locations where National Army troops were stationed. When reporters asked about the Northeast takeover issue, he replied: The Communist army's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement, attacking the National Army, and preventing the takeover is a great regret. In particular, the Communist army's reorganization situation has never been reported. He hoped that the CCP would realize this soon, especially the Northeast Communist army, using the name of the Democratic Allied Army, etc., to obstruct the National Army from taking over sovereignty. When reporters further asked about Marshal Marshall's proposal that the Communist army should withdraw from Changchun, Mr. Bai said: The CCP has not yet responded. Mr. Bai later said: The National Army in various parts of the country has complied with the order to reorganize, the first phase of the plan has been completed, and the training work has also made great progress.

[United Press Nanjing Seventeenth] Sources close to the government announced tonight: Elite National Army troops have reached the north of Sipingjie and have now completely surrounded the city. All signs indicate that the National Army will launch a general offensive against Sipingjie and Changchun in the middle of next week.

[United Press Beiping Seventeenth Dispatch] Government sources today quoted "reliable sources" as saying: The 130,000 Japanese soldiers who were captured by the Soviet army and transported from Changchun have now returned to Harbin and are gradually being sent south to assist the Communist Wehrmacht in combat. These sources also said: In the First and Second Divisions of the Communist army southeast of Sipingjie, there are eighty Japanese railway workers and approximately 180 Japanese officers and soldiers. When the Communist army occupied Changchun last month, more than 1,000 Japanese and Koreans participated in the fighting.

### Political Negotiations Underway: CCP Representatives Visit Shao, Zhang, and Marshall Separately; Comprehensive Group Meeting Scheduled for the 22nd

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] After arriving in Nanjing, CCP representative Dong Biwu met with Shao Lizi twice last night and this morning. This afternoon, Mr. Dong, accompanied by Lu Dingyi, the person in charge of CCP propaganda, visited Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng for over an hour. Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall at 10:00 AM and talked for two and a half hours, leaving at 12:30 PM. It is reported that the results of today's talks between CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu and Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, and Special Envoy Marshall were quite satisfactory. According to sources close to both the government and the CCP representatives, if no further issues arise before the Comprehensive Group meeting, allowing the Comprehensive Group meeting to proceed smoothly in a calm and harmonious atmosphere, resolving disputes through political negotiations first, after the parties concerned have the opportunity to fully understand and study the current situation, this will be extremely beneficial to future military mediation.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government and Acting Director of the Chongqing Military Headquarters Zhang Qun flew to Nanjing from Chongqing late last night. Mr. Zhang paid a visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the morning of the 17th.

[United Press Washington Seventeenth Dispatch] President Truman told reporters: Special Envoy Marshall's mission in China has not failed. Regarding external reports that Marshall's mediation of cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists has not been successful, the President declined to comment, only saying: If Marshall has the possibility of carrying out his mission in China, he will naturally remain in his post.

[Central News Agency Washington Sixteenth United Press] President Truman said: He is not currently considering appointing Pauley as the US Ambassador to China.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Reliable information: An agreement has been reached among the government representatives, the CCP representatives, and Special Envoy Marshall regarding convening a Comprehensive Group meeting of the Political Consultative Conference.

Chen Qitian, another representative of the Youth Party, will arrive in Nanjing in the next day or two. However, the social figures attending the Comprehensive Group meeting this time need to be separately nominated and will arrive in Nanjing around the 20th. The date of the meeting will be decided after all parties have arrived and submitted their opinions. It is rumored that it may be held on the 22nd.

### Dong Biwu and Lu Dingyi Answer Reporters' Questions; Zhou Enlai Cancels Trip to Northern Jiangsu

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] At 5:00 PM today, sixteen reporters from various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai visited the CCP office at No. 17 Meiyuan New Village after welcoming Director Yu, to interview Zhou Enlai. Zhou was unavailable due to pressing matters. Qi Xieming, Secretary-General of the CCP delegation, met with them instead. The reporters raised the following two questions, asking Qi to convey them: (1) When will Mr. Zhou Enlai depart for Northern Jiangsu with the government representatives and Colonel Koye? Can the reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai be given the convenience of accompanying them to Northern Jiangsu for a visit? (2) Can you tell us the results of Mr. Zhou Enlai's meetings with government representatives and Special Envoy Marshall in recent days? Qi went upstairs to convey the questions, and returned downstairs after about two minutes, answering: (1) The trip to Huaiyin, Northern Jiangsu, is still undecided. Once it is implemented, we will welcome reporters to visit. (2) Mr. Zhou has indeed been negotiating with various parties, but there is nothing to report at present. We will answer later. The reporters left disappointed. Dong Biwu and Lu Dingyi then arrived. The reporters went up to greet them and asked them for information. Dong replied: He had just arrived from Chongqing and was unaware of the situation. All he could say was: (1) Militarily, there must be an unconditional ceasefire in the Northeast. (2) Politically, the issue will be resolved by the Political Consultative Conference group meeting. Subsequently, at the request of the reporters, Dong and Lu re-entered the room together and answered the reporters' inquiries, mainly stating: (1) The Comprehensive Group meeting is indeed planned to be held after the representatives of the Democratic League and the Youth Party arrive in Nanjing. (2) The four representatives of the Democratic League will arrive in Nanjing on the 18th. (3) Mr. Zhou Enlai's trip to Northern Jiangsu has been canceled because the government believes there is no need for it at present.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Regarding the point in the reporters' inquiries about "whether they are satisfied with the reported merger of the Changchun Communist army with puppet Manchukuo officers and bandit leaders to form the so-called autonomous government," Dong Biwu and Lu Dingyi said that they were still unaware of it. They also said that the CCP office was not very clear about this matter. Yan'an was clearer. The extreme chaos of the current situation in Changchun can be imagined.

### Chongqing Municipal Council Discusses Reorganizing Finances

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Seventeenth Dispatch] The Chongqing Municipal Government held a municipal council meeting on the 15th, discussing in detail the reorganization and planning of Chongqing's finances after the National Government's return to the capital. According to Mr. Zhang Dulun's report, after the return to the capital, Chongqing's consumption has gradually decreased, and production has not increased. The sources of various tax losses will inevitably decline daily. This crisis is related to Chongqing's overall construction and development, which is of great importance. Therefore, the reorganization of municipal finances can no longer be delayed. In the past, municipal treasury advances for various expenses have reached 500 million yuan. In the future, except for emergency needs, advances should no longer be requested at every turn. As for collection operations, relevant units must strictly audit to prevent malfeasance. Furthermore, in order to construct the Two Rivers Bridge in Chongqing, the municipal government submitted a request to the central government for a subsidy of half of the funds. It has now been approved for a subsidy of one-third. The municipal government is actively raising the remaining two-thirds of the funds so that construction can begin as soon as possible.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] The Nanjing Municipal Government's public land was previously leased to tenant farmers under a tenancy system, which inevitably led to exploitation.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Representatives of the National Assembly from Jiangsu and Shandong Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek received dozens of National Assembly representatives from Jiangsu and Shandong provinces in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 17th, including Lu Xiaobo and He Bingru. When the Chairman listened to the representatives' painful account of the unprecedented conditions in the Communist-occupied areas of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, he sighed for a long time, and a moving look of sorrow appeared on his face. However, he still comforted the representatives with a peaceful and loving attitude, promising to find ways to relieve the innocent refugees fleeing from the two provinces to various places. It is reported that the number of refugees fleeing from northern Jiangsu alone has reached three million. If each refugee is given 10,000 yuan for emergency food relief, it will require 30 billion yuan. If peace is difficult to achieve for a while, what will happen?

### Twenty-Nine Days in Changchun

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi of this Newspaper

This is a faithful report by Shao Shenzhi, a special correspondent for this newspaper, who personally experienced the Changchun upheaval and was detained in Changchun for twenty-nine days. The full text is 50,000 words and will be sent from Shenyang and published successively.

The Changchun upheaval was a fierce war.

We flew from Shenyang to Changchun on April 9. On the 13th, five American reporters flew in and together we witnessed the tragic scene of the Chinese civil war. Each of us was in constant danger of being swallowed by artillery fire, but we saw houses being burned, people dying in the fierce artillery fire, and people's representatives running around calling for a ceasefire, crying and wailing. We were extremely saddened. We forgot that Changchun was a dangerous place and deeply felt that it was a place where human nature erupted.

We were in Changchun for twenty-nine days. I dare not recall the work during this period. But we must publish our experience so that China and the world can increase a little reference information on the Northeast issue. Although we have lost our freedom, because we are Chinese, we are unwilling to use such encounters to provoke various reactions that are detrimental to peace, nor do we want to point out the faults of any party or any individual. We only prepare to record our experiences and contribute them to friends who care about Chinese peace and to the Chinese people who are suffering, so that they can jointly criticize. We are professional reporters, we cherish our independence, and we also hope that readers can respect our position.

A Major Battle: Seeing Off Karlov

The news that the Soviet army had completely withdrawn from Changchun on the 14th was brought to us by Dong Yanping on the 6th when he flew from Changchun to Shenyang. The Soviet army began to withdraw on the 7th, leaving only two or three hundred people on the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, Karlov left for the last time, and the situation in Changchun took a sharp turn.

Dong Yanping and Malinowski had notified each other that after they left Changchun, Dong appointed Chen Jiazhen, a senior advisor to the Military Affairs Commission, to be responsible for military affairs in Changchun. He was one of the members of the military delegation. Malinowski appointed Karlov to be responsible. Their daily contact was just a casual meeting. Chen originally scheduled a farewell to Karlov on the 14th, but Karlov decided to leave Changchun by train at 10:00 AM (12:00 PM Soviet time), so it was canceled.

At 9:00 AM on the 14th, Chen Jiazhen, Zhang Datong, and Secretary Kong went to the train station to see him off. This was a diplomatic occasion that we could not give up, so we took the car to the train station together. We came out of the Mantan Building and drove to the Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, where about five American colleagues went together. Liu Zhuzhou of the Central News Agency had a car, and the Military Affairs Commission gave us a jeep. Eleven people took separate rides and rushed to the train station. After passing the Soviet Army Headquarters at the old YMCA, we saw that the posts had been removed and there was no sound. However, we were solemn because the Communist army had already attacked the Xifei Airport, and contact had begun at 3:00 AM. On the one hand, we were seeing off Karlov, and on the other hand, we were worried about the future situation. Because as soon as the Soviet army withdrew, Changchun immediately fell into war. This was already foreseeable. Therefore, seeing off Karlov made us feel indescribable.

We walked into the station, but the special train had not yet arrived. Chen and Karlov were talking on the platform, with Kong acting as the translator, and introduced us to Karlov. Kong said that there were several American reporters and asked if he would like to talk to them. Karlov faced away from the platform and shook his head quickly without even looking at them. So they were left aside, pacing coldly on the platform, as if they were all passengers waiting for the train, not greeting each other, and each talking to their traveling companions. Although Karlov knew some of them. Karlov was bored standing there, so he suggested pacing and talking. Dong asked: "Has the Soviet army in Changchun all dispersed now?"

"No, there are still two or three people, because they couldn't catch the train, I'm afraid they will stay in Changchun today," Karlov replied.

When the car drove into the station, Karlov and his entourage immediately jumped on it and let the guests who were seeing him off walk in.

On the clean white tablecloth in the official car, vodka and beer, Russian frozen, pickled meat, and beets had been prepared. Everyone raised their glasses together to express their farewell, wish each other good health, and toast to the eternal and solid friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

Karlov raised his glass to the reporters and said: "I hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people can be forever solid, and I hope you will convey this meaning to the readers."

The carriage was small, and the senders and the sent were standing there, squeezed together, holding a glass in their left hand and raising their glasses in their right hand. After about ten minutes, they shook hands with Karlov one by one and said goodbye.

The car drove eastward, and the senders, including a dozen Soviet expatriates, also quietly left the station. The station was extremely empty, with no passengers and no station staff. Chen Jiazhen jumped into the car and rushed back to the Central Bank Defense Headquarters. Zhuzhou also rushed back to the office to make wartime preparations.

At this time, the defense commanders of Changchun, Chen Jiazhen and Liu Dequan, officially announced: all cars should affix a piece of paper with the words "Changchun Defense" written on it, stamped with the seal of the headquarters, and we all received special passes.

At this time, the war in Changchun began to intensify, and we began to live under artillery fire. (To be continued)

### North Ning Railway Open to Yuguan; Fierce Battles Erupt North Along the Route Outside the Pass; Communist Troops Gather Near Various Lines in Beiping and Tianjin

(4) The Qian Suo and Gaoling areas along the North Ning Railway have successively been captured by Communist troops. The defending troops at Wanjia Village sent a desperate telegram at 4 PM today, stating the situation was extremely critical. However, due to the emergence of Communist troops north of Yuguan, reinforcements could not be sent. Currently, trains on the North Ning Railway are running to Yuguan.

(5) Communist troops have built three artillery emplacements near Yu Jiazhuang, 162 kilometers south on the Pinghan Line.

[United Press, Beiping, 17th] According to authoritative sources here: Fierce battles have erupted around Qian Suo, the first train station outside Shanhaiguan on the North Ning Railway. Communist troops have been continuously attacking for four days, attempting to prevent National Army trains from entering Northeast China. As this lifeline for the National Army's entry into Northeast China is being cut off by Communist troops, the National Army is rapidly sending reinforcements from both the north and south. Reinforcements have been dispatched from Tianjin, Tangshan, and Jinzhou. Currently, the fighting is taking place along a fifty-mile stretch of the North Ning Railway near Shanhaiguan. Furthermore, it is reported that Communist troops are strengthening their positions between the Great Wall and Jinzhou.

As of now, the situation around the station is extremely chaotic.

Without Results in Improving Treatment, Judges of the Jiangsu High Court Strike; Promise of Two Months' Pay Temporarily Alleviates the Situation

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 17th] Colleagues in the Jiangsu Higher Court's prosecutorial and judicial review positions have jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration requesting increased pay due to the high cost of living. They claim their income is insufficient to support their families and daily sustenance. To date, no response has been received. The concern has been growing since President Sun and Chief Justice Han went to Nanjing without achieving concrete results. Today, all prosecutorial and judicial review staff of the court suddenly and spontaneously went on strike, resulting in an extremely serious situation. After President Sun and Chief Justice Han issued separate directives for persuasion, the prosecutorial and judicial review staff reported to work in the afternoon, but none of the clerks or court staff returned to their positions. The heads of the court are deeply concerned about this issue. Without urgently seeking relief, the situation cannot be remedied. They have specially decided to allow each staff member to receive two months' pay without deductions, which temporarily alleviated the situation. All scheduled court hearings for today have been suspended.

### Too Few Lawyers in Beiping-Hebei Affects Trial of Traitors

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] Yu Fengpo, presiding judge of the Second Division of the Hebei High Court, stated that there are no fewer than tens of thousands of traitors in Hebei Province, but only 1,500 have been arrested so far. Of these, approximately 400 have been sent to the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office. About 20 have been punished, about 80 have been indicted and sent to the criminal court, and about 30 have been sentenced. However, according to legal regulations, cases involving sentences of five years or more require a lawyer for defense, and there are only fifteen qualified lawyers in Beiping. Therefore, the trial of traitors is significantly affected. It is also learned that major traitors Wang Yintai, Wang Shijing, Yu Xijie, Zou Quansun, Yu Jinhe, Liu Yushu, and Tang Yangdu are still detained in the Army Prison, awaiting instructions from the authorities. Wang is relatively fat in prison and is very respectful to people, lacking the good fortune of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his earlier years. Traitor Zhou has a very arrogant attitude and answers that he needs nothing when asked if he requires any items. Female spy Kawashima Yoshiko is ordered to write a diary every day, but it is full of cunning lies.

### Capital Reporters Hold Tea Party; Warmly Welcome Yu Youren; Yu Discusses His Thoughts on Returning to the Capital and Encourages Reporters; Lively Discussion on Cursive Script Aims at Calligraphic Revolution

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Capital News Reporters Association held a tea party on the 17th to welcome President Yu Youren. Over seventy people attended. No reporters' reception in Nanjing recently has seen such a large number of reporters in attendance at the same time, as in their minds, the Yu being welcomed today is not the President of the Control Yuan but an elder predecessor in the news industry. The tea party began with Ma Xingye as chairman. Lu Qian delivered a welcome speech. Yu then rose amidst warm applause to deliver a speech. First, he discussed his thoughts on returning to the capital, saying that he was filled with emotion because when he thought of the millions of compatriots who were slaughtered when Nanjing fell, and the millions of compatriots who were still in dire straits today upon the return to the capital, he deeply felt the heavy responsibility of those who survived. Yu admitted that the reporters' description of him being "tearful" when he got off the plane the other day was indeed a fact, proving that this old man's emotions were passionate and undiminished with age. Afterwards, in an optimistic tone, he encouraged reporters to consider themselves as builders of a new era and a new China. There is nothing difficult in the world; since the War of Resistance has been won, nation-building will surely succeed. The current diverse and complex phenomena in politics and ideology should be integrated and transformed with the Prime Minister's great spirit of universal love. Finally, Yu sternly criticized the advocates of relocating the capital, saying that we should know that Zhang Zhidong's poem "How can it not ruin a hundred years, this poisonous mountain and river is Jiankang" is a frivolous and absurd act of literary men insulting Nanjing and is not worthy of emulation. We should know that things depend on human effort and should create a "spirit of the place" with "outstanding people." Also, representatives from the student associations of Shangda, Fudan, Zhonggong, and Sanxiao attended today's welcoming meeting and paid their respects to their presidents, deans, and teachers.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] President Yu Youren "promoted" his habitual cursive script in today's welcoming meeting of capital reporters. Amidst a chorus of requests for calligraphy from reporters across the hall, Yu rose and solemnly declared, "If you think that obtaining my calligraphy is something to be cherished, then I will greatly disagree. The reason why I do not like to study oracle bone script and seal script, but only create cursive script, is that there is a profound intention of calligraphic revolution within it. You should know that without riding an airplane, you do not know the value of time. In this new era of seizing time, the cursive script I advocate is characterized by simplicity and rapid strokes, intending to provide a time-saving and effective revolutionary tool for the people. If you value my calligraphy as treasures but do not make this cursive script movement universal, then it is truly contrary to my personal wishes." After finishing his speech, he excused himself amidst enthusiastic applause, and posed for a photo with the welcoming people before departing.

### National Resources Commission to Adopt Company Structure; Qian Changzhao Discusses Future Work

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, stated: "Although the Commission has been reorganized under the Executive Yuan, there is no substantial change in practice. Currently, the Commission's main tasks, in addition to maintaining important industries and mines in the Northwest and Southwest, are to actively reorganize and restore industries and mines in the recovered areas. At the same time, new constructions are also being planned. As for the future business operations, we will strive for enterprise-oriented management as much as possible. Most businesses will adopt a company structure in accordance with the new Company Law. The businesses recently set up in North China and Taiwan have already been organized into companies, and China Petroleum Limited and other companies will soon be established one after another."

### Local Dispatches

Changshu

County Government Investigates Enemy Crimes: The county government has decided to complete the investigation of enemy crimes by the 20th of this month and submit it to higher authorities for review. Accurate statistics are currently unavailable. The investigation of these enemy crimes, since the announcement accepting reports from the people, has been met with widespread concern due to its relation to personal interests. Reports are currently being sorted.

Wuxi

Silk Cocoon Loans Approved: This year's spring cocoons are about to appear, and large and small silk factories are resuming work one after another. Mr. An, a representative of the silk merchants of this county, and others went to Shanghai to contact the China Silk Cocoon Company regarding the issue of silk cocoon loans. The company has approved the loan application amount. In the future, each factory can directly apply to the banking syndicate for loan procedures. Also, the registration of cocoon businesses in Wuxi and Cheng counties closed on the 15th, with a total of 309 businesses. The Sericulture Improvement District will send the registration booklets to the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association for review.

Songjiang

Seawall Collapse; Labor Conscripted for Emergency Repairs: The collapse of the Jinshanwei seawall has led the Soochow-Ningpo Relief Sub-Administration to decide on an emergency repair plan and establish public works offices in Songjiang and other counties to oversee the work. Workers for the emergency repair of the seawall have been conscripted locally, totaling over 500 people, and started repairs on the 15th. The county relief association has allocated 1,380 bags of flour as labor relief. To ensure smooth repairs, County Magistrate Huang has specially dispatched the county security team to fill the defenses to maintain order.

Jiaxing

Township Heads of the Entire County Resign En Masse: Jiaxing's rural areas only produce enough rice to feed themselves each year. This time, the supply of conscripted military grain and the purchase of a large amount of civilian grain for Hangzhou has depleted local reserves. At this time of year when the harvest is scarce, there is a sense of crisis. Recently, the county government was ordered to requisition 18,000 *shi* of military grain, with the price set at 24,000 yuan per *shi* (the current market price of rice is 50,000 yuan), a difference of more than half. Requisition is difficult. County Magistrate Hu specially convened a meeting of all township heads in the county on the 14th. After several discussions, there was no perfect solution. On the 15th, at the meeting, the county government forcibly allocated the quota: 450 *shi* for Category A townships (14 townships in total), 300 *shi* for Category B townships (22 townships in total), 200 *shi* for Category C townships (19 townships in total), and 150 *shi* for Category D townships (10 townships in total). The township heads believed that the people were already on the brink of starvation and it was difficult to bear this amount. Moreover, some villagers had already consumed their rations in advance and had no way to borrow. If requisitioning were to continue, it would be unacceptable. Making up the price difference by allocating it to each household would also violate provincial orders. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 15th, nineteen townships, including Beiping, Huguang, and Anwu, jointly submitted their resignations to the county, requesting to be replaced to avoid delaying official business.

Wujiang

Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway Restores Traffic: The Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway Long Bus Company has completed preparations for resuming operations. It is scheduled to officially resume traffic on May 16. The company has now transported ten new-style buses, temporarily using the Dongwu Hotel outside the station gate as the general station, and has appointed Zhou Zhenxiao as the Suzhou station manager, Zhou Chengfeng as the Wujiang station manager, Gu Minzhi as the Buwang station manager, and Shen Baoru as the Nanxun station manager. It is reported that because the vehicles have not all been transported, the company, in order to consider passenger convenience, will temporarily not crack down on commercial vehicles currently running, except for collecting road maintenance fees. The scheduled departure times are Suzhou at 6 AM, 8 AM, and 1 PM, and Nanxun at 6 AM, 10 AM, and 1 PM. The fare is 1,100 yuan from Suzhou to Wujiang, 1,600 yuan to Bachai, 2,200 yuan to Pingwang, 2,800 yuan to Zhenze, and 3,400 yuan to Nanxun. The Shengze-Jiaxing section is currently rushing to repair bridges and road surfaces and will also restore traffic soon.

Wuhu

Enemy and Puppet Factories Sold at Reduced Prices to Provincial Operation: According to recent statistics, the enemy and puppet properties in Wuhu received and handled by the Anhui Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau include warehouses of Wang Zidong Liji Warehouse and Warehouses No. 1, 5, and 6, received by the Central Trust Bureau's Wuhu Office, and the Japanese Soy Sauce Factory received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Wuhu Office. The Feian steamer of the British firm Jardine Matheson, received by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has been returned. It has been decided that factories such as the Dexin Iron Works, also received, will be sold at reduced prices to the Anhui Provincial Government for operation at the latter's request.

Hefei

Provincial Temporary Consultative Assembly Appeals for Disaster Relief: Rice and flour prices in Lingbi, Sixian, Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Xuyi, Wuhe, Suxian, Dingyuan in northeastern Anhui and Huoqiu, Shouxian, and Yingshang in northern Anhui are simultaneously rising sharply, causing widespread suffering. The disaster situation is extremely serious. The provincial relief sub-administration has decided to allocate the majority of the 900 tons of flour shipped to Anhui by the Executive Headquarters to the above counties, giving 2,500 bags of flour to each county for emergency relief. However, due to the vast area and large population, it is still difficult to provide universal assistance. The Anhui Provincial Temporary Consultative Assembly has received reports from various counties requesting relief and specially convened a meeting yesterday, deciding to send resident assemblyman Shen Yanjing and others to appeal to the Executive Headquarters for more materials to benefit the disaster victims.

### Hangzhou Dancers Petition; Mayor Zhou Orders Them to Change Professions

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Over forty dancers in Hangzhou petitioned the Municipal Government on the morning of the 17th, requesting a postponement of the complete ban on dancing scheduled for the end of the month.

### National Assembly Representatives from Hunan Host Reporters; Appeal for Disaster Relief in Hunan; United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is Working to Eliminate Famine in Inland China

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] National Assembly representatives from Hunan Province hosted the press corps in Nanjing on the afternoon of the 17th to appeal for disaster relief in Hunan and report on the disaster situation. Ma Xuchang, Zhong Boyi, Liu Cicheng, Xiang Naiqi, Xie Jixia, Jiang Chuou, and others reported separately. A summary is given below: Hunan Province has jurisdiction over 78 counties and cities with a population of over 30 million. 54 counties and cities have been occupied. Over 200,000 people have been affected by the disaster, with the most severely affected reaching 4.2 million. The causes of the disaster were the Changsha fire and the three major battles of Changsha, as well as the Hengyang, Changde, and Xiangxi Xuefeng Mountain battles. The province has been affected by war seven times. Subsequently, droughts, windstorms, and locust plagues have had interrelated causes, and disasters have spread throughout the province. This spring, Hunan Province will lack 230,000 tons of grain due to the impact of last year's autumn harvest. Of the 40,000 tons of flour allocated by the Relief Administration, less than 10,000 tons have been shipped out, and only 40 tons have arrived. Various parties are trying to transport it, and 2,000 to 3,000 tons may be shipped out within days, but the amount is still very small. The difficulty of obtaining clothing is due to the relocation and damage of existing yarn factories, making it difficult to produce. Therefore, yarn workers are scarce, and people find it difficult to get clothes. Education has also been largely destroyed. Today's Hunan lacks plowing cattle, seeds, and agricultural tools, creating scorched earth for thousands of miles. In addition, the frequency of bandits has increased due to famine, and people's lives are in deep water. Therefore, we appeal to the people of the country to provide sympathetic assistance and to restore education and commerce as soon as possible.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, United Press, 17th] It is reported that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is now planning to do its utmost to eliminate the famine in inland China and hopes to use airplanes, trucks, trains, and ships to transport large quantities of supplies to relieve the disaster areas.

[US Information Service, Washington, 16th] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that the first batch of UNRRA supplies for relief in Northeast China has arrived in Shenyang, including 26,400 bags of flour and 2,000 bags of used clothing, which will soon begin to be distributed.

Editorial

### Let Everyone Vigorously Practice Thrift

"China is starving, but Shanghai is dancing!" This statement, uttered by a foreign journalist, is a disgrace to us Chinese, especially to the people of Shanghai! Millions upon millions in every corner of China, from the Northwest, North China, and Central China to South China, are struggling daily on the verge of death, while in Shanghai, people indulge in extravagant and luxurious lifestyles without limit. This is a deeply shameful contrast! We appeal to the "United Relief Organization" for aid, and we appeal to foreign countries for assistance, yet some of us in Shanghai live so wastefully. Looking inward and asking ourselves, who should not feel ashamed to death? The United States is the most developed and wealthiest country in terms of production, and its people admire freedom. Now that the war against Japan has ended in victory and World War II has concluded, it should, in principle, be able to return to pre-war living standards. However, they still have not achieved satisfaction in their standard of living; wartime rationing of goods and price controls are still largely in effect. Britain is also a developed country in terms of production. However, the British people still live the same way as during the war, with strict control and rationing of all goods. After fighting for more than five years and defeating Hitler's Japanese warlords, the British people are still living in wartime conditions, with no opportunity to breathe or enjoy life. Only we, a country with backward production, insist on enjoying life without striving for frugality and thrift. This is a disgrace to our nation! Chairman Chiang, seeing this point, has repeatedly emphasized the need for thrift in life. Even the Executive Yuan recently passed a resolution on thrift for civil servants. However, despite the government's repeated orders, the actual results often fall short of expectations. The prevailing atmosphere has led to increasingly extravagant and decadent lifestyles among the people in recent months. Facing the current decline, we must awaken the sense of justice and responsibility of our countrymen and quickly take practical steps to practice thrift, saving some vitality for the country and the nation.

The advocacy of the thrift movement did not begin today. In order to take practical steps to practice thrift and ensure that thrift produces significant results, we must frankly point out that the success of this movement lies not in strict government control but in the people's voluntary compliance. Although the government can issue orders to restrict food consumption or prohibit certain behaviors, such as drinking and dancing, the issuance of these orders may not achieve practical results in thrift; on the contrary, it may make life even more extravagant. The main reason why the thrift movement has not been very effective in the past is that some people believe that the government can restrict people's behavior with a piece of paper. However, if people are not self-aware, the government's orders, no matter how strict, will only lead to numerous malpractices and foster a widespread habit of hypocrisy. Open dancing may be prohibited, but disguised commercial dancing cannot be eliminated. Even if there is a clear order prohibiting gatherings for drinking in restaurants, the practice of entertaining guests at home will still be impossible to stop. All this will lead people to hypocrisy and deception, which is contrary to the New Life Movement advocated by the Chairman. Today, we are raising the timely call for vigorously practicing thrift. We hope that the government can promote this movement, but we also hope that the government authorities will issue orders appropriately. Rather than enacting strict laws and enforcing them leniently, it is better to enact lenient laws and enforce them strictly. To knowingly do what is not feasible will inevitably lead to adverse consequences. Any prohibition must be reasonable and rational in order to be effective. For example, Shanghai is an international city. If we were to absolutely ban dancing and drinking for the sake of thrift, we would not only be ridiculed by friendly nations but also increase the opportunities for hypocrisy and law-breaking. Today, for everything that should be done and must be done, we must awaken the people to act automatically and energetically, based on their conscience and inherent abilities. One person tells ten, ten tell a hundred, and we will not worry about not being able to transform the social atmosphere.

Unreasonable consumption should be curbed in other ways. We do not understand why the market is flooded with unnecessary imported goods such as cigarettes, foreign wines, and fruits, at a time when the government is vigorously practicing thrift. Do we not have domestically produced tobacco and alcohol and locally grown fruits? Why are these unnecessary goods being imported in large quantities at this time? If the government is determined to practice thrift, it should use tariff policies to strictly crack down on the import of unnecessary goods. The import of these unnecessary goods, on the one hand, damages our own backward production sector, and on the other hand, promotes the formation of extravagant habits among the general public. In terms of practicing thrift, the most important aspect is the use of tariff policies to prevent unnecessary foreign goods from being imported, or to make them so expensive that people cannot afford them, thereby curbing the trend of extravagance.

However, in terms of practicing thrift, positive measures are more important than negative measures. The positive measures depend entirely on the people's ability to consciously and automatically take the initiative to practice thrift. Rather than having the government stipulate prohibitions in restaurants, dance halls, tea houses, and wine shops, it is better for all sectors of society to voluntarily formulate three rules and mutually abide by them. Shanghai's trade associations are relatively well-organized. At this time of vigorously practicing thrift, they should take the lead in advocating and discussing ways to practice thrift, and each should conscientiously abide by and implement them. We must encourage everyone to compete in thrift and correct the vain concept of competing in extravagance. We must foster an atmosphere where whoever practices thrift is honorable. In this way, the government can issue fewer prohibitions, and the people's compliance with them may be more effective than the government's prohibitions. We hope that Shanghai's trade associations and social organizations will spontaneously initiate thrift movements without waiting for government orders. The general public should especially understand the difficulties facing the country and sincerely and earnestly abide by all thrift decisions. Only when everyone is of one heart and one mind can the movement function and achieve its goals. Here, we want to awaken every citizen's sense of responsibility for vigorously practicing thrift, which is something everyone should do.

Moreover, the entire country is now actively launching a thrift movement. Shanghai is China's premier city, and it is also the beginning of a new mayor's term. We must actively launch a thrift movement, be pioneers for Shanghai's new municipal administration, set an example for the national thrift movement, and wash away the shame of being called a "den of iniquity" for a century. May the citizens of Shanghai rise up together and vigorously practice thrift!

US Secretary of State Byrnes, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov left here one after another today, each going their own way. Before leaving, Byrnes gave a statement to reporters, admitting that in the past three weeks, not only had no agreement been reached, but the deadlock between the Western powers and the Soviet Union had been aggravated.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov only accepted the US suggestion to send a four-nation investigation team to Germany to investigate the progress of disarmament. As for the revised terms of the Italian armistice treaty, they must first be submitted to the Italian government before being announced. It is expected that this includes a provision to abolish the United Nations Control Commission for Italy.

### Britain Is Determined to Abandon Its Rule in India; Wavell Begins Consultations with Indian Leaders of All Factions to Form an Autonomous Government

[Our newspaper's news] London, 17th broadcast: The British Cabinet delegation to India announced to reporters today that Britain is indeed determined to withdraw from India. Indian Affairs Minister Lawrence said that the work of ending the British institutions in India has already begun, but the delegation will remain in India to urge the two major Indian parties to accept our plan.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Authoritative sources here say that the British government's autonomy plan for India does not set a deadline for India to accept it. It is reported that Indian Governor-General Wavell has already begun consultations with Indian leaders to establish a government composed entirely of Indians. According to New Delhi news, Gandhi said at a prayer meeting yesterday that the plan announced by the British government is a major event in Indian history and deserves careful study. Therefore, he hopes that the masses will remain calm and not be tempted by extremists. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, is now in New Delhi and will probably issue a statement today. The plan announced by the British government supports the unification of India and opposes Jinnah's proposal to divide India and establish an independent Muslim state. Because this requirement is not sufficient to solve the problem of ethnic minorities and because its position is in the strategically important northeast and northwest borders, it has been rejected by the British cabinet delegation. Ali, the leader of the London branch of the Muslim League, has stated that this plan is tantamount to selling out the Muslims of India. He plans to convene a mass rally in London on June 2 to protest.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Governor-General Wavell gave a broadcast to the Indian people this afternoon, elucidating the outline of the British Cabinet delegation's proposal for an Indian interim government. The proposal advocates that the Indian interim government be composed of fifteen people.

### Japan's Twenty-Eight Major War Criminals Fail to Shed Their Crimes; The Presiding Judge Declares All Objections to the Court's Jurisdiction Are Rejected

[Our newspaper's special correspondent, Tokyo, 16th] At 10:00 AM this morning, the International Court opened its session, which lasted a total of five minutes. Presiding Judge Webb introduced Dr. Bal, the Indian judge who had just arrived, and then asked the prosecutors and defense lawyers if they had any arguments to raise regarding judicial issues. Both sides replied in the negative. Webb then declared: The International Court will continue its trial before June 3rd.

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Tojo and the other twenty-seven Japanese war criminals' attempts to use legal arguments to exonerate themselves have completely failed today. The Far East International Military Tribunal opened its session this morning for five minutes, and Presiding Judge Webb simply announced that the defendants' objections to the court's jurisdiction, with the aim of shedding the various crimes they are accused of, are all rejected. The reasons for the rejection will be stated later, and he immediately adjourned the court, setting a date for the next hearing.

### Churchill Calls the British New Plan for India a "New Imperial Policy"; Debate in the Lower House Will Not Be Proposed in the Short Term

[Reuters, London, 17th] The British government's White Paper was issued simultaneously in London and New Delhi yesterday. This is the British government's greatest effort to bring India to complete independence, an unprecedented move in the history of any empire. When Prime Minister Attlee read the White Paper in the Lower House yesterday, Churchill called it a "new situation" sufficient to represent the Labour Party's "new imperial policy." However, regardless of the criticisms from all sides, the British position remains that "the Indians should unite themselves and establish a constitutional body to formulate a constitution." The current question is whether Muslims or Hindus are willing to accept it. There are now two paths for Jinnah to follow: either to accept the British proposal or a similar solution, or to engage in civil war. As for the Hindus, although the British proposal is similar to the demands of the Congress Party, there are also those that they oppose, such as the autonomy of the Muslim provinces, the division of provinces according to ethnicity, and the right of residents to choose. Before the establishment of the All-India Constituent Assembly, separate constitutional conferences will be established. The British proposal has done its best in a written document that cannot be compromised to equate the gains and losses of the two forces. As for supporting the unification of India, this is a natural result. The White Paper begins by stating that only Muslims oppose unification, but supporting unification inevitably promotes the principle of dividing India into four, so the result still cannot solve the ethnic problem in India. The White Paper proposes the establishment of an Indian Federation with both executive and legislative bodies. The former handles foreign affairs, national defense, and transportation matters for the entire territory of India, including the princely states, while the remaining powers are delegated to the provinces and states themselves. Each province can organize its administrative and legislative bodies according to the ethnicity and beliefs of its residents. Each division can decide on the common governance of the province. Regarding the constitutional issue, one representative can be elected for every million residents. After the election, they will be divided into three factions: Muslim, Sikh, and general. All provinces are also divided into three groups. The first group is the Hindu provinces, and the other two groups are the Muslim regions of the Northwest and East. Among the 292 seats in the All-India Constituent Assembly, 210 seats should belong to the general representatives, 78 seats belong to the Muslim representatives, and 4 seats belong to the Sikh representatives. In addition, each department can elect up to 93 seats. The three groups will first hold separate meetings, and then, in the position of the Federal Constituent Assembly, formulate the final constitution of a free India. The White Paper concludes with a warning, stating that if this method is not accepted, there will be unrest and even civil war, so it calls on the Indian people to accept independence. It is reported that the White Paper will not be submitted for debate within a few weeks, but the leaders of all parties will speak today.

### Indo-Dutch Negotiations to Reopen in Batavia

### "Xingzong" Official's Forged Case: Jiang Liquan Ceases Renting British Merchant Vessel

### Shipping Industry Petitions for a 50% Increase in Freight Rates

[This Newspaper's Report] It is reported: The Municipal Shipping Industry Association previously telegraphed the National Government, suggesting crucial measures to protect rights and encourage the shipping industry. The Ministry of Communications has now issued a response with four directives: (1) Regarding the British merchant vessel rented by "Xingzong," which is nearing the end of its term, the Ministry of Communications has instructed "Xingzong" to not renew the lease. (2) Discussions are underway regarding the transfer of ships allocated by "Xingzong" for transporting relief supplies to our country to be purchased, leased, or managed by state-owned and private shipping organizations. (3) Negotiations are in progress with the British side, based on the Sino-British New Treaty, to purchase or lease the British-owned pontoon docks and warehouses along the Yangtze River. (4) The Ministry of Communications, in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, has dispatched personnel to prepare for the restoration of the Wusong Merchant Marine School.

Brief Commentary

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Ends Hastily

The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union held meetings in Paris from the 25th of last month until the adjournment yesterday, a full three weeks. During these twenty-one days, the four foreign ministers discussed several important issues regarding post-war Europe, expending much effort and energy. However, due to differing national interests and opinions, they failed to reach any agreement. Not only did the four foreign ministers exert themselves in vain, but they also greatly disappointed people around the world who hoped that nations would cooperate after the war to maintain peace.

In this conference of foreign ministers, the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes are most noteworthy. He went to Paris with the attitude of "no failure allowed, only success," willing to compromise on every important issue and repeatedly proposing compromise solutions, but still unable to avert the misfortune of the foreign ministers' conference. From this, it can be seen that international contradictions are deeply rooted and cannot be easily eliminated.

In all fairness, the failure of this foreign ministers' conference was expected. From the day it opened, we had no extravagant hopes. Since the end of the war, there have been countless international conferences, some unresolved and others unimplemented, which have long diluted our interest in international meetings. However, seeing the hasty closure of this four-nation foreign ministers' conference and its perfunctory nature, one cannot help but express surprise.

After the four foreign ministers passed the US proposal for a one-month recess, they didn't even set the date for the next meeting, nor did they appoint members of the special committee on German issues. The four foreign ministers then went together to the magnificent wine room of the Luxembourg Palace to drink heavily, using alcohol to relieve their sorrows and lighten the bitterness in their hearts. This is a strange phenomenon rarely seen in diplomatic history! Therefore, the failure of this foreign ministers' conference is worse than the unhappy ending of the five-nation foreign ministers' conference held in London last September.

The foreign ministers' conference will reconvene in a month, on the 15th of next month. What the future holds, no one can predict. However, it can be asserted that Europe's political stalemate, if prolonged, will not be a blessing for the world's people.

### Road Repair Projects; Major Roads to be Completed This Winter

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works: "The bureau's work and plans have not changed at present and will continue to be carried out." In addition, as of now, the road construction projects of the bureau's road department have repaired and newly constructed road surfaces and sidewalks totaling 500,000 square meters. At the beginning of the takeover, the bureau estimated that 360,000 square meters of road surface should be repaired. Later, due to the passage of heavy U.S. military trucks, the road surface was successively damaged and exceeded this number. The bureau was also unable to proceed quickly according to the planned schedule due to the lack of machinery, materials, and asphalt. Currently, an order has been placed with Texaco for 1,200 tons of asphalt, to be shipped in six months, with 200 tons supplied each month. The first batch is expected to arrive by the end of May.

It is expected that five kilometers can be repaired each month. By this winter, the main roads in the city are expected to be repaired.

### Jiang Customs Employees; Stage Another Go-Slow Yesterday; Demanding Adjustment of Salaries and Emergency Loans

### Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Refuse to Board French Ship to Return Home; Call on All Countries to Guarantee They Will Not Be Drafted

### The Whole Country is Covered in Gloom; The Postal Service Also Encounters the Fate of Division

[Report from Our Newspaper] In times when the whole country is covered in gloom, the postal service has also encountered the fate of division. However, through the efforts of the authorities and compromising, local "exchange" of postal services has finally begun. However, it must be solemnly declared that this does not mean that the stamps with Mao Zedong's portrait are recognized, but rather out of consideration for the people's burden, to save them from a late fee and a fine.

The ceasefire agreement cannot stop the advance of the Communist army, so recently the six bureaus of Qidong, Dong'an Town, Jiulong Town, Beixin Town, Sanyang Town, and Qilin Town, which are under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Postal General Bureau, have been successively occupied. At the same time, the stamps with Mao Zedong's portrait printed by the "Traffic Bureau of the Soviet Border Region Government" were also quickly delivered to Shanghai from there.

These stamps are divided into three types: (Convenience) (Air) (Print), and these three characters are printed in the center of the upper line, which represents ordinary letters, airmail, and printed matter. In addition, there are morning glory stamps with English translations below, which are probably the words "Soviet China." The general face value is five cents and one dime (which is the anti-Japanese currency issued by the Communist Party, not the ordinary national currency). An ordinary letter only requires a postage of two dimes, but don't underestimate this area of two dimes. Sometimes its elasticity will exceed the price you pay for a fast letter now!

It is reported that several regions in North China have also implemented postal services. In central Hebei Province, our green-clothed messengers are allowed to freely pass through the Communist army blockade line to deliver letters, but must go through a "check" procedure. Therefore, the post office only accepts ordinary letters for mailing to the Communist army area. (The illustration shows the stamps issued by the Communist Party)

### Yuan Meiyun's Drug Use Case; Sentenced to Six Months; The Little Woman Weeps Silently; Washing Her Face with Tears; Request for Re-examination and Bail Denied; Sighs from the Audience

[Report from Our Newspaper] The sensational case of film star Yuan Meiyun's drug use has been concluded yesterday. Judge Lian Zhenbang pronounced the sentence in court, sentencing her to six months in prison and depriving her of her civil rights for one year. After hearing the sentence, Yuan covered her face with a handkerchief and wept softly. Her condition was extremely miserable. Sighs of sympathy were heard in the audience, and her mother cried even more.

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, the courtroom was packed with spectators, and the windows were also crowded with men and women. Yuan was brought into the dock by two judicial police officers, Zhang Ji and Pan Zhupeng, in front of the crowd. Yuan was wearing a black cheongsam, yellow stockings, and half-high-heeled yellow and white leather shoes. Her hair was very messy, and a white flower hairpin was inserted in her right corner. Her face was pale and thin. She often lowered her head and wept behind the white-rimmed sunglasses on her nose, and tried her best to avoid being photographed by photographers. After Judge Lian questioned her, Dr. Cao Zhishou, a witness, was summoned. Cao was a student of Yuan's father and was familiar with Yuan. According to reports, Yuan quit smoking on December 24 last year and has been abstinent since February 14 this year. Subsequently, the debate began. Lawyer Le Houwei said: "The defendant has quit smoking. The police station forcibly recognized the stomach medicine that the defendant ate as a quit-smoking drug and arrested and handled the case. It is obviously intended to use the defendant's film star status as a propaganda for the anti-smoking movement, which is not appropriate in terms of reason and emotion." Lawyer Huang Menggang said: "Since the defendant has no criminal behavior and no smoking behavior, the forensic doctor determined that he was smoking based on his complexion, but did not use proper methods, such as urine, head, fingers, and physiological metamorphosis to examine his smoking habits. It is inappropriate and a re-examination should be requested." The court refused. Finally, the defendant stated: "There is an elderly mother and young brother at home who rely on Ji for a living. This time , he has lost his reputation and future, so please acquit him and first post bail and stay healthy.” Judge Lian did not allow his request and immediately pronounced the sentence, and explained: "As long as you are determined to quit, you can avoid the punishment." The film star was taken to the women's prison in the District Court with tears in her eyes and weeping silently.

Yuan Meiyun Wipes Tears After Hearing the Verdict

### High Court Hears the Case of Traitors; Gambling Table Owner Speaks Vulgarly; Pseudo-Judge Avoids the Important and Takes the Light; Zhu Shunlin's Case is Concluded in One Trial and the Sentence is Scheduled

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court of the High Court tried several cases of traitors. The first case was Zhu Shunlin. Zhu was from Baoshan, 51 years old. Before the war, he opened the Shunyuan Teahouse in Shanghai West, gathering gamblers and making profits. After Shanghai fell, he opened a gambling den. He then served as the chief inspector of large gambling dens such as Hollywood, Huilege Palace, and the Six Nations Hotel, and colluded with Lu Ying, the pseudo-Shanghai Police Chief, to obtain licenses by force. In 1931, he set up a Dasheng gambling den in Nanyang Bridge, using "Ruele" donations to fund the pseudo-police bureau. He also sent the pseudo-Special Agents Headquarters a reward of 100,000 yuan. His bad deeds were obvious and his harm to the people was not small. During the trial, Zhu was wearing a blue shirt, black shoes, had a shaved head, thick eyebrows, big eyes, and a red face. He spoke vulgarly. According to his confession: In "Hollywood," the defendant was an employee, only "Dasheng" had a small share, and other gambling dens were used by others under his name, and he flatly denied his collusion with Lu Da. He claimed that he was definitely not a traitor. Later, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Ma Zhenzong, and Luo Jiaheng defended him, saying that in 1929, the defendant had rescued Zhao Guoliang, a member of the San Min Zhuyi Youth League, and in 1932, he had rescued American soldier Wake and Peng Xiaolin, and had also funded the construction of houses to help refugees. The court ordered the debate to end and scheduled the sentence to be pronounced on the 21st in the afternoon.

Yang Hui, a native of Wuxi, 30 years old, joined the Wuxi Anti-Enemy Support Association and the Youth Salvation Corps cadres' propaganda work after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He also served as the secretary and judicial section chief of the Wuxi People's Self-Defense Regiment of the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. In February 1931, he surrendered to the enemy and served as the deputy director of the intelligence section of the Wuxi Station of the Pseudo-Special Agents Headquarters, and later served as the director of the Changzhou Branch of the Pseudo-Political Security Bureau and the deputy director of the Pseudo-Suzhou Branch. During the trial, Yang tried to quibble, and Court President Xiao ordered another hearing.

Huang Fusen, a native of Suzhou, 39 years old, was originally the deputy Chinese detective of the pseudo-Public Concession Central Police Station and the Chinese detective of the Shanghai Police General Bureau. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he served as the deputy detective of the special high section of the Second Section of the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the deputy detective of the criminal section. The defendant admitted to the pseudo-positions he held. He only said that he only managed theft cases and had rescued judicial personnel such as Dai Rongduo. He was shot several times in the case of capturing the Huangdao Society, so he never harmed the country or harmed the people. The defendant hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Xu Yin to defend him. The court ordered a later hearing.

Jiang Liquan, a native of Jiangyin, 35 years old, was originally a judge of the Shanghai District Court. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he joined the pseudo-court and served as a pseudo-judge. According to his confession, he only handled ordinary cases during his tenure, did not try political cases, and had protected underground workers and Zhang Baosheng, the liaison officer of the Loyal and Patriotic Salvation Army, and never harmed the country. The defendant did not hire a lawyer at the trial, and no family members came to the court to observe.

In addition, Yang Yongrui, the pseudo-Jiangyin detective patrolman, and Chen Yufu, Cheng Weisheng and other three traitors were also tried, and all were ordered to be heard again at a later date.

### Two Traitors Sentenced

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 3 p.m. yesterday, the High Court pronounced sentences in two cases of traitors: (1) Chang Dongming, the pseudo-district chief, colluded with the enemy country and plotted to resist this country, sentenced to four years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for three years. The charges are the same as above. The verdict on the two traitors Fang Xiang and Ye Zhihua will be announced tomorrow.

In addition, the High Prosecutor's Office recently filed a public prosecution of suspected traitors, including Wang Lubin, Yang Shouzhang, Chang Yuqing, Ha Junqiu, and Ruan Xingzhou, a total of five cases.
