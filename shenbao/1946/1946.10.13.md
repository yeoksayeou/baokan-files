[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday morning, reporters in Shanghai went to the private residence of Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, to inquire about his views on the overall situation of peace. Mr. Sun said that the Central Government's recovery of Zhangjiakou should be a turning point for peace. Military action should be stopped immediately, political negotiations should be resumed, the government should be reorganized in accordance with the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and each party should submit a list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly. As for the convening of the National Assembly announced by the government, it is only a notification and reporting of a general nature, reporting that is not a meeting.

It is reported that Mr. Sun is scheduled to go to Nanjing today to convey the views of the Third Force to the government in order to resume negotiations in a short period of time.

### Frequent Contacts Between Parties; The CCP's Attitude is Extremely Rigid

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. After getting off the train, he went straight to Su Yi Village to visit Li Huang. It is said that Liang's trip to Shanghai was to urge Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing and to discuss compromise measures with representatives of the Political Consultative Conference. Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, it was rumored that he had obtained satisfactory results. This morning, after getting off the train, Liang learned that the government had issued a convening order for the National Assembly and immediately felt that this trip had been in vain, expressing great indignation. Li Huang of the Youth Party met with Minister Zhang Lisheng at his residence at 9:00 AM on the 12th. It is said that they discussed the issue of National Assembly representatives. Mr. Zhang stated that he welcomes the participation of all parties and that all issues can be discussed and resolved as much as possible during the period before the assembly convenes.

It is said that Li plans to fly to Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 13th, and Liang may also leave Beijing because they will gather in Shanghai again to discuss. According to Lei Zhen, who told reporters tonight, he received a call from President Sun Ke from Shanghai today, informing him that the representatives of the Political Consultative Conference had suspended their trip to Beijing and that Sun himself was scheduled to return to Beijing on the morning of the 13th.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] After arriving in Chongqing at the Te Garden at around 4:00 PM on the 11th, Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, made a statement on national affairs to reporters from various newspapers, and the content was nothing more than peace and democracy. It is reported that Zhang will stay in Chongqing for a short time and then go to Beijing and Shanghai.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Today, the political atmosphere in the capital is unstable, and some people are quite pessimistic. The Communist Party representative stated that the government's unilateral convening of the National Assembly has shown its determination to overturn the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to the end, and that this will promote a complete break. They will not be bound by this and will never participate in the National Assembly. At the same time, the government should be held responsible for causing a long-term civil war. It was also said that the official instructions from Yan'an had not arrived as of 10:00 PM. Regarding the National Army's entry into Zhangjiakou, the spokesperson said that the Communist Party has not yet received reports of the war in Zhangjiakou. Assuming that it has been occupied by the National Army, it would be sufficient to show that the government has decided to expand the civil war, and the military and civilians in the Communist "Liberated Areas" will fight to the end with force.

He also stated that he has been in the military for more than 30 years and now, as a retired person, he entrusts his spirit to the country and the nation. The eight-year war of resistance caused heavy losses in manpower and material resources. The urgent task is to stabilize society, and all parties should be sincere and accommodating, and should not create more problems. The reporter then inquired about the reported organization of a party by Mr. Cai. The general replied, "I am a member of the Kuomintang. I hope for the success of democratic politics. I have formed a Democratic Promotion Association with a few friends to study the Three Principles of the People on how to achieve democratic association and assembly. However, outsiders are unaware and misreport, which is regrettable. He hopes that the army will be nationalized and that domestic problems should be resolved through political means. Individuals and parties must act with conscience and prioritize the country and the nation. After the war, the country's vitality has been exhausted, and it is urgent to gather wisdom and effort to build a strong country.

### United States Does Not Abandon Mediation; Special Envoy Marshall is Not Discouraged; U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson's Statement

[French News Agency, Washington, 11th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told the press today that although the situation in China is serious, the United States will not abandon its efforts to mediate between the KMT and the Communists. The rumor that Special Envoy Marshall will soon return home to report on his duties is not true. Special Envoy Marshall is not discouraged about the future of peace in China.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] U.S. authorities firmly believe that U.S. mediation for peace in China is not intended to end. According to the current issue of "World Report" magazine, the United States intends to stay in China until peace and unification are completed. The future of China is bleak. If the civil war continues, Special Envoy Marshall may ultimately fail, but this is not enough to change U.S. policy. Stalin and some Americans advocate that U.S. troops should withdraw from China, but Washington has decided to ignore them. The rumor that the Soviet Union may intervene is also not credible. A Sovietized China is almost certainly the goal of the Soviet Union, but it is still far off.

### National Army Continues to Recover Huai'an; Fire Spreads Through Streets of Zhangyuan; Dong Qiwu Concurrently Serves as Temporary Garrison Commander

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 12th] Official sources claim that the National Army has continued to recover Huai'an, southwest of Zhangjiakou, but have not specified where the National Army came from. Yanggao, an important stronghold on the Ping-Sui Railway above Huai'an, has not been confirmed. There were only rumors that the National Army had recovered Yanggao a few days ago.

[Central News Agency, Guisui, 12th] After the troops of the Twelfth War Zone entered Zhangyuan, Dong Qiwu is now concurrently serving as the temporary garrison commander of Zhangyuan. The situation in the city has stabilized. However, the prosperous streets of Shangxia Fort were set on fire by the Communist army on the morning of the 11th, and the fire spread for four or five li. The property of merchants and residents was reduced to ashes, and the station and water tower were completely destroyed. All the locomotives and cars were also burned. The two airfields outside the city were completely destroyed and cannot be repaired within three or two days.

[United Press, Peiping, 12th] The command here announced that it has been three weeks since the National Army began its offensive against Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that the troops of Fu Zuoyi entered the city without a fight. Part of the army continued south to pursue the Taihang Mountains. It is heard that the Communist troops have retreated to Zhuolu, eighty li southwest of Zhangjiakou, and Yuxian, one hundred and eighty li to the south. Another part of the Fu army turned southeast along the Ping-Sui Railway, heading straight for Xuanhua, attempting to join up with the National Army moving north. After the recovery of Zhangjiakou, not only has the route from Peiping to Guisui been opened, but the connection between the Communist troops in Jehol and North China has been completely cut off. Military authorities said that the siege of Baoding could be lifted within a week.

[French News Agency, Peiping, 12th] Chairman Feng Qinzai of Chahar Province is scheduled to fly to Zhangyuan on the 13th to inspect. When the Communist troops retreated from Zhangyuan City, they laid many landmines, which are currently being cleared by the National Army. According to people from Zhangjiakou, in the past seven weeks, 30,000 residents of Zhangyuan have been evacuated, including Communist Party cadres, border area government personnel, railway personnel, miners, students, and some farmers.

[United Press, San Francisco, 11th] The fall of Zhangjiakou is a major blow to the Communist troops in North China, because the CCP has stored a large amount of military equipment there. The U.S. Strategic Services Bureau learned a year ago that the CCP had stored 500,000 Japanese-style rifles and a large amount of ammunition in Zhangjiakou. The importance of Zhangyuan is at least equal to that of Yan'an, and its defenses are more solid than those of Yan'an.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Huailai Area; More Than Half of He Long's Communist Troops Lost

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 12th] Fierce fighting continues in the Huailai area in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, and it is said that Xiahuayuan has been recovered by the National Army.

[United Press, Peiping, 12th] According to sources close to General Chen Cheng, Chief of General Staff of the National Army, who is personally directing the military operations in Zhangyuan in Peiping, the Communist army's loss of Zhangjiakou was due to three major errors in defensive strategy: (1) The Communist army overestimated the strength of Huailai, the outer defensive line south of Zhangyuan. (2) The Communist army concentrated too many troops in Huailai, resulting in heavy losses when they encountered the better-equipped National Army. In theory, they should have dispersed their lines and taken more mobile actions. (3) Although the Communist army encountered General Fu Zuoyi's Twelfth War Zone troops, they clearly did not anticipate that Fu's troops would advance so quickly. According to military reports received here, the Zhangbei garrison was led by Nie Rongzhen, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army in Chahar Province, who also led the retreat from Zhangjiakou. About a month ago, Nie assured reporters that the Communist army would defend Zhangjiakou to the last man, just as they would not abandon Chengde. He said, "We will defend Zhangjiakou to the last man." However, when the Communist army encountered the powerful National Army, they retreated again without resistance. According to reporters, He Long, a veteran of the Communist army who was known for his resistance against Japan and who personally commanded the siege of Datong, was in charge of military operations in Huailai. According to the National Army, the Communist army suffered the most severe losses in the battle of Huailai, with three-quarters of the troops captured, killed, or missing. At the same time, He Long also lost the most heavy equipment in the battle of Huailai.

### County Governments Return to Cities in Recovered Areas of Jehol; Opening of Peiping-Chengde Railway Still Pending

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 12th] The National Army has entered the counties of Chengde, Chaoyang, Fuxin, Jianping, Ningcheng, Pingquan, Lingyuan, Lingnan, Fengning, Luanping, and Longhua in Jehol Province, and the county governments have returned to the cities to work. However, security in remote rural areas has not yet been consolidated. Chairman Liu Duoji has decided to assist the people in organizing self-defense forces, and Li Shoulian of the Provincial Party Committee will be in charge of training. Also, after the National Army entered Koubei and Chengde, there were frequent reports that the Peiping-Chengde line would soon be open to traffic. However, the mountain roads between Chengde and Koubei are rugged, and the tunnels were blocked by the Communist army driving locomotives into them from both sides. Although the Jinzhou Railway Bureau has sent personnel to inspect, due to the severe shortage of rail sleepers, it is difficult to start work for the time being, and the opening of the Peiping-Chengde line cannot be realized in the short term. However, the Chengde-Koubei highway has been completed after rushed repairs. In addition, the railway repair work on the Pingquan-Chengde section is progressing extremely rapidly. It is expected that after completion next month, the Jinzhou-Chengde train will be able to travel directly.

### Women's Groups in the Capital Send Telegram to Fu Zuoyi to Express Condolences

Wherever the banners point, the separatists will not be able to realize their military dreams. General, you are a pillar of the country, and the people of the whole country deeply respect you. We hereby send our condolences."

Editorial

### It Is Time to Replace the Battlefield with the Parliament

Zhangjiakou was recovered by the National Army on the afternoon of the 11th; at the same time, the National Government issued an order yesterday notifying the representatives of the National Assembly to go to Nanjing to report to the National Assembly from November 2nd, so that the National Assembly can open as scheduled on November 12th. These two events have caused the situation in the past half month to take a sharp turn for the worse. Some people are anxious that the situation may worsen further, and even doubt that Zhou Enlai's threat of "complete breakdown" will become a reality. However, the CCP side, according to reports, is awaiting instructions from Yan'an, so how to react, the representatives in Nanjing and Shanghai are keeping silent. The government side said that the convocation of the National Assembly does not hinder peace talks, and the third-party figures who originally planned to go to Nanjing to mediate on the same day have temporarily postponed their departure. Judging from the current situation, it seems difficult to grasp the trend of future political developments.

However, no matter what the future political situation is, we dare to say that if China wants to achieve the goal of building a democratic constitutional government, there is only one main road: "replace the battlefield with the parliament." There is no shortcut other than this; even if there are some rugged paths, they are all detours that make people waste their energy in vain. Therefore, whether it is the ruling party, the opposition party, or the parties claiming to be the third party, whoever can thoroughly realize this point and immediately abandon the battle for supremacy on the battlefield and instead use the method of debate in the parliament, will win the respect of the people of the country and the sympathy of the world. A few days ago, we believed that if the Communist Party had a great politician, it would not miss this opportunity when the two envoys, Marshall and Stuart, put forward the final proposal, that is, a ten-day truce in Zhangjiakou, and at the same time, hold two types of meetings, three-person and five-person, to resolve all pending military and political issues. However, the Communist Party ultimately rejected it, so that even if the third party figures wanted to run around again, they felt it was too late, and they could not help but deeply regret it for the Communist Party. However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If the Communist Party really wants to be a decent opposition party (the second largest party) in China, then even though Zhangjiakou has been lost, the door to peace talks is still not closed. It still has the opportunity to immediately abandon the battlefield and enter the parliament.

If the Communist Party still wants to insist on its own way today, it must believe that the opportunity for a "complete breakdown" has matured and is unwilling to let go, not allowing the peace talks to be reopened. Then, guessing their intention, there are no more than two points: (1) Believing that even if the positional warfare is defeated, it may be better to change to guerrilla warfare, which can make China a situation of continuous war, waiting for future opportunities; (2) Believing that since Zhangjiakou has been captured, if they accept the government's demands and continue to discuss the reorganization of the government, participation in the National Assembly, and reorganization and unification, etc., it would be equivalent to a "treaty of surrender." In fact, all these ideas are unwise. In the former case, even if there is really continuous war, not to mention the harm to the country, what benefit will it bring to the Communist Party? Moreover, persisting in this way will only make the people of the country hate the Communist Party even more than in the past. In the latter case, the Communist Party representatives said a few days ago that they did not争 for the gain or loss of a city or a place, then the Communist Party does not need to be ashamed of the failure to defend Zhangjiakou, and there is no such thing as a treaty of surrender. Moreover, if both sides put the country and the nation first, then "brothers quarreling at home, but uniting to resist foreign enemies" and releasing suspicion and repairing relations is the performance of virtue. As for the great man being able to bend and stretch, it is even more difficult for ordinary people to learn. If the Communist Party can suddenly realize that military force is not reliable at this time and decide to change its plan to "replace the battlefield with the parliament," then the people of the country will all breathe a sigh of relief, and a peaceful atmosphere will immediately appear. The previous misunderstandings of the Communist Party can be swept away, and they will also feel that the Communist Party can correct its mistakes. What is the reason for the Communist Party not to do this?

At the same time, we want to strongly advise the government not to be content with the few victories it has won on the battlefield recently and forget the consistent policy of achieving peaceful unification through political solutions. We believe that the government will certainly not do so. Although the government has clearly announced the date for the National Assembly representatives to report, it does not mean that it will act arbitrarily and unilaterally. The government will certainly still abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and earnestly hope that all parties and factions and social elites can participate in the National Assembly and jointly formulate the constitution. Even before the National Assembly is convened, as long as the Communist Party and other parties are willing to disclose the list, the government can immediately discuss the reorganization. From the government's position, the method of "replacing the battlefield with the parliament" can be said to be the most stable method of political struggle. Therefore, it is not enough to make people believe that the Communist Party insists that the government intends to "completely break down." However, we hope that the government, in order to gain more trust from the general public and all parties, may as well make a clear announcement again when Zhangjiakou is recovered, ordering the troops in various front-line areas to immediately suspend military operations for a certain period of time, in order to open the door wider for the resumption of political and military discussions. If this is done, the government's hard work in reluctantly launching a counterattack against the Communist army can be better understood by the world. Also, the Communist Party and other parties will have no reason to refuse to resume peace talks with the government.

In short, Zhangjiakou has been recovered, and the National Assembly has been convened on schedule. This is a major turning point for peace at the moment. The CCP cannot miss it, and the government must not let it go. And the third parties who are in the position of mediating and coordinating should especially seize the opportunity and do their best to make the "all-out war" on the battlefield become a "gathering of heroes" in the parliament! This is the happiness of the people and the blessing of the country!

### Suzhou Township Chiefs Flatter Bandits and Offer Favors, Provincial Order to Rectify in Order to Clear Out Bandits, End of Days Nears for Xue Yonghui's "New Fourth Army" Unit

[Our Suzhou Office, 12th] The Suzhou Provincial Government believes that the area between the four districts of Suzhou County has become a base for the "New Fourth Army" Xue Yonghui's unit to harass. The reason why this potential force has been formed is mostly because the township chiefs in these areas flatter the bandits and offer favors, resulting in the bandits going away when the troops come, and the bandits returning when the troops leave. It is really impossible to completely eliminate them. The recent case of Lu Zhongying, the chief of Tong'anqiao Township in the fourth district of the county, being arrested by the First Pacification District for aiding the bandits, with conclusive evidence of guilt, shows that the judgment is not false. Now, in order to thoroughly eliminate the bandit scourge, it is necessary to evaluate the township chiefs in the area and adjust them. This cannot be achieved without success. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Suzhou County Government, strictly ordering it to comply and immediately begin reviewing the qualifications and learning of the township chiefs, and make adjustments immediately, strictly prohibiting connivance, so as to establish a sound political foundation.

### Should Township and Village Chiefs Serve in the Military? Ministry of National Defense Clarifies Doubts; Suzhou Garrison District Convenes Military Service Conference of Three Counties; Hangzhou City Sets One-Month Deadline for Applying for Exemption or Deferment

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 12th] Military service registration in Jiangsu Province's sixty-three counties began on October 1st. The Suzhou Garrison District Command, to solicit the opinions of county governments and accelerate the progress of the work, will convene a military service conference in mid-October, bringing together the county magistrates and military affairs section chiefs of Suzhou, Wujiang, and Changshu counties to jointly discuss implementation. Regarding the question of whether civil servants currently in office should be required to serve, various levels of military service agencies have had many doubts. The Ministry of National Defense has now provided the following clarification: (1) Township and village chiefs concurrently serving as captains or squad leaders in the National Guard are to be considered as already serving in military auxiliary service during their tenure and are to be granted deferment of conscription. Those who are deemed incompetent are not subject to this exemption. (2) Township and village guard unit deputies in each county or city who perform with excellence during their service are to be granted deferment of conscription in accordance with the same criteria as those serving in military auxiliary service.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Since the Hangzhou Municipal Government issued the order for conscription, there has been much discussion in the streets and alleys, and the township chiefs have been very busy. This is the first conscription in Hangzhou since the end of the war. According to an investigation with relevant authorities, the city has established a schedule for reviewing applications for conscription exemptions for this year's recruits and is now actively proceeding accordingly. The Zhejiang Military Region Command, in conjunction with the Department of Civil Affairs, has submitted a request to Chairman Shen for approval regarding the matter of recruits with exemption, suspension, or deferment qualifications paying a fee for deferment certificates when applying. The application period runs from October 5th to October 15th.

[Additional News] The Zhejiang Provincial Government meeting on the 11th decided to reinstate conscription this year. The original preferential treatment and financial assistance methods have been abolished. The Department of Civil Affairs will consult with the Military Region to collect fees for deferred conscription or call-up from recruits in accordance with the new Conscription Law. These funds will be used to provide preferential treatment to families of conscripts, and will be retained entirely within the county for local use, without being submitted to the province for deduction or unified allocation.

### Distributors Manipulate the Market; Kerosene Panic in Taixing

[Our Taixing Dispatch] The market has recently experienced a shortage of kerosene, causing panic over fuel. Originally, Zhentai, Huachang, Dasheng, Taifeng, and other firms in Taixing were contracted to handle the distribution of Meifu, Guanghua, Asia, and Deshigu brands of kerosene in Taixing. However, because of the varying prices in the Taixing market, they conceived the idea of selling the kerosene allocated to them to places such as Diaojiapu in Taizhou at higher prices, causing a shortage of kerosene in Taixing and creating an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to inflate prices. The county chamber of commerce has now requested that these four firms transport all the kerosene allocated to them back to the county for sale and has telegraphed the four companies, Meifu in Shanghai and others, urging them to instruct their managers not to transport the distributed kerosene for sale in other counties in the future, or else they will request that their distribution rights be terminated.

### Zhenjiang Secures Six Hundred Million Yuan in Industrial and Commercial Loans

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Zhenjiang County Provisional Assembly Standing Committee previously noted that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party in Northern Jiangsu had incited chaos, obstructing transportation and causing most industries and businesses in the county to stagnate. Furthermore, the dumping of American goods and the failure of financial policies to adapt to the needs of the situation led to the rise of usury, placing industries and businesses in a state of drinking poison to quench thirst and reaching a dead end. Therefore, it was resolved to implement measures to curb usury and to request swift relief from the provincial government and banks. The county chamber of commerce also engaged in similar activities with various parties. Fortunately, with the support of Chairman Wang of the provincial government and Director Dong of the Department of Finance, the bank authorities agreed to consider the matter. A reporter from this newspaper, aware of the widespread concern about this issue, made a special visit to a person in charge of the chamber of commerce on the 11th. According to the discussion, the total amount of industrial and commercial loans secured by the county is only six hundred million yuan, which is a drop in the bucket. The central China, Agricultural, and Farmers' Three National Banks are still studying the procedures, and it is unknown when the funds will be disbursed. Currently, only the Jiangsu and Jiangsu provincial banks have been approved by the provincial government to prepare to begin lending, but the amount available is only sixty million yuan. It is also learned that various counties in Northern Jiangsu that have been restored are also preparing to request industrial and commercial loans from banks, as local industries and businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch] The Yuchang steamer, traveling from Qingdao to Lianyungang, encountered a breakdown after sailing about a hundred li out of Qingdao in the middle of last month, and was stranded at sea for about five hours. After repairs, it sailed for less than twenty li before stopping again. Later, it encountered a heavy rainstorm and was blown to the foot of Che Niu Mountain. Fortunately, the ship's anchor caught on a stone crevice, preventing the ship from colliding with the rocks. It stayed there for three days before the machinery was repaired and it continued its voyage. It encountered breakdowns several more times along the way. On the fifth day, it finally encountered a rescue ship, which towed it to Lianyungang.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] The Quzhou-Jiangshan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is undergoing active repair and is expected to open next month. The Zhuji-Jinhua section is expected to open within the year. The Jinhua-Quzhou section is still awaiting the arrival of materials, the most lacking of which are the rails. The Ministry of Transportation has promised to allocate 700,000 ties, and some will also be purchased locally, which should be sufficient. It is learned that a batch of imported rails will be allocated to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for use, but even if they arrive in Zhejiang quickly, the opening of the entire line will have to wait until next year.

### Changshu Lacks Meat

[Our Changshu Dispatch] Residents of this city have been unable to find meat to accompany their meals for days. Although there are still large quantities of fresh pork available in the pig markets, all the meat shops have stopped slaughtering and selling.

### Robbery Occurs in Broad Daylight in Downtown Suzhou; Bridge Collapse at Park Sends Visitors Plunging into Water

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Since the second month of this year, although public security has been emphasized, robberies have occurred one after another, but robberies in broad daylight in downtown areas have been rare. At approximately 4:00 PM on the 10th, at the home of a Mr. Sun, the Suzhou distributor of the Shanghai Ruitai Soda Company, located at No. 24, First Heaven Gate in the city's central district, where he had been running a stamp business, he obtained a loan of three million yuan from a certain location and returned home. Because he failed to conceal the money, he attracted the attention of thieves. Two thugs dressed in blue cloth shirts and pants, one about thirty-one or two years old, the other seventeen or eighteen years old, followed him to the door. As Sun had not closed the door in his haste, the two thugs boldly entered the inner room. Sun was too frightened to make a sound as the older thug grabbed two bundles of banknotes, each containing one million yuan, while the younger thug stole one million yuan. After leaving the house, they fled in different directions. Sun, taken by surprise, was initially stunned. By the time the robbers had left, he realized they were unarmed and urgently called out to a Mrs. Mou, who was in the same room, to give chase. As Sun chased one of the robbers to the entrance of the North Bureau Park, he was about to catch up, but the robber threw the money to the ground and escaped without a trace. The other robber disappeared into the crowds along Guanqian Street. Sun, having lost two million yuan out of nowhere, has reported the incident to the local police station and requested that the robbers be apprehended.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The city's only public recreation area is the Central Park. Whenever the weather is pleasant, visitors gather, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere. However, it has fallen into disrepair for the past eight years, with pavilions collapsing and bridges tilting, and is no longer in its former state. Although a Park Restoration Committee has been established after the local restoration, it has been unable to commence construction due to financial constraints. The 10th was National Day, and all agencies and schools in the city had a day off, resulting in a sudden increase in park visitors. At approximately 5:00 PM, a group of visitors were standing on the wooden Nine-Bend Bridge, leaning on the railings and watching the broken lotus stalks and withered stems in the pond when suddenly, with a loud crash, the Nine-Bend Bridge broke and collapsed, sending twelve male and female visitors plunging into the pond. Fortunately, soldiers from the Umbrella Hill Brigade, who were patrolling in the park, bravely rescued them, pulling them ashore one by one. Although no major disaster occurred, the twelve male and female visitors were covered in mud and water and were in a sorry state. Currently, the local media unanimously believes that the park should allocate rent received from numerous restaurants and tea houses leasing land in the park during the summer toward repairs and has urged the Park Restoration Committee to commence work as soon as possible.

Unexpectedly, the bandit learned of the operation and attempted to break out. An exchange of fire resulted in the bandit forces being overwhelmed. The bandit Fang Caigui was captured on the spot. Additionally, an eight-year-old hostage named Zhang Youcai, the son of the victim, was found in the Xiaotian area. The squad has already notified his family.

### Director of the Xuzhou Public Works Bureau Accused of Accepting a Puppet Position

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch] The case against Zheng Yaochen (also known as Zheng Gang), the Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Xuzhou Municipal Government, who is accused of being a traitor, was heard for the first time by the Criminal Division of the Third Branch of the High Court at 10:00 AM on the 7th, with Judge Qian Songsen presiding. According to Zheng's confession, he was from Jian'ou and later moved to Shanghai. He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of Tongji University. Before the war, he served as a technician in the Qingdao Public Works Bureau and later as the acting director. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to Shanghai. In July of the 30th year of the Republic of China, due to financial hardship, he was invited by a friend to come to Xuzhou and served as the chief clerk in the Transportation Section of the Construction Department of the Puppet Su-Huai Special District Administrative Office. He left in August of the 31st year. During his time in the puppet organization, he, along with the Puppet North China Construction General Office, opened Zhongshan Road and Zhongzheng Road in this city, and built the Jizhong and Qingyun bridges. When asked by the court why he had not thought of serving the country, having received a higher education, but had instead joined the puppet organization, Zheng stammered and hesitated. At 11:00 AM, the court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending investigation.

### Su-Ning Branch Office Relief Work: Balancing Emergency and Work Relief While Assisting Northern Refugees to Return Home

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Su-Ning Branch of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), held his first press conference yesterday to foster communication and relationships with reporters from various newspapers stationed in Zhenjiang. Attending were Jiang Renlong, Deputy Director of the branch office; Li Juesheng (an American), Director of the CNRRA Zhenjiang Branch; Head Secretary Hedley; Executive Secretary Anderson; and over twenty reporters stationed in Zhenjiang from Beijing and Shanghai. Director Zheng gave a brief report, stating that the Su-Ning Branch has been established for over nine months now. The initial period was spent on preparatory work, and substantive work gradually began between March and August of this year, almost a year ago. Future work can be divided into two parts: emergency relief and work relief. Emergency relief will focus on northern Jiangsu, while work relief will be province-wide, especially in the southern Jiangsu counties.

Jiangnan Work Relief

Currently, there are four work relief projects being actively pursued: first, water conservancy; second, roads; third, sanitation; and fourth, education. In water conservancy, we are jointly operating the Yangtze River levee restoration project with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the northern Jiangsu canal project with the Huai River Diversion Committee, the Jiangnan sea dike project and the Zhenwu section canal project with the Water Conservancy Commission and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Qinhuai River and southern Nanjing city sewer projects with the Nanjing Municipal Government. In roads, a contract has been signed with the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation to allocate funds for the repair of the Beijing-Hankou National Highway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. We are also cooperating with the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau to repair important provincial roads. In sanitation, we are cooperating with the Department of Health and the Provincial Health Department to repair public and private hospitals in more than ten counties and cities, including Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. Construction of the provincial hospital has already begun. In education, many primary school buildings were destroyed during the war. We have now approved assistance for the repair of twenty school buildings, including the Zhenjiang Teachers' Affiliated Primary School, and we plan to repair twenty primary school buildings each month going forward.

Northern Jiangsu Emergency Relief

In terms of emergency relief, many counties in northern Jiangsu have been successively recovered due to the active military progress. However, the people have suffered greatly from military operations and man-made floods. After the recovery of Huaiyin, Huai'an, and Siyang, the branch office immediately sent personnel to inspect the situation and implement emergency relief. We also observed that in Suining, Suqian, and Siyang counties, 40% of the population were in situations where they had no access to medical care, clothing, or shelter. We are now exerting our utmost efforts to rescue these victims of political hardship. To facilitate relief, we have established an office in Huaiyin and have already allocated 200 tons of flour and 400 bales of old clothing from Xuzhou. To save time and meet urgent needs, the branch office dispatched ten trucks to Xuzhou. The road from Suining to Siyang is now open to traffic, but from Siyang to Huai'an, we have to use small carts and boats for transportation. In terms of health relief, we have contacted the Department of Health to send a medical team to the recovered areas in various counties to provide medical and pharmaceutical relief.

Distribution of Wheat Seeds

We are now preparing to distribute high-quality wheat seeds in Xuzhou, Suining, Suqian, and Siyang to increase next year's crop yield. Shuyang and Lianshui are about to be recovered, and we are also preparing for emergency relief work. In addition to actively providing relief to refugees in northern Jiangsu and Xuhai, we also need to assist refugees from Hebei and Shandong and refugees from the Northeast who are stranded in Xuzhou to return home. We have contacted the Shanghai Branch about this matter. Starting from the 8th of this month, the first batch of 500 refugees will be sent from Xuzhou to Shanghai, and then they will take ships from Shanghai to return to their hometowns. After that, every five days, we can transport 300 people per batch. There are approximately 4,000 refugees stranded in Xuzhou, and they will all be transported by the end of next month at the latest. Many refugees from northern Jiangsu are concentrated in Nanjing, Shanghai, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang. The branch office has started registering refugees for their return home and will provide appropriate travel expenses based on the distance of each refugee's journey back to their hometown.

Making Winter Clothes

For other social welfare services, sewing factories have recently been newly established in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and able-bodied women among the refugees are selected to rush to make winter clothes for distribution to refugees for warmth. Nutrition stations for children and the elderly have also been established in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, with fifteen stations in total. Every day, more than a thousand children and elderly people go to drink milk. We plan to extend this initiative to other areas in the near future. In addition, porridge distribution centers have been established in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Huai'an.

### Huainan Railway Operates Intermodal Transportation

[Our Bengbu Dispatch] The Huainan Railway is operating intermodal road-rail transport from Shuijiahu via Hefei to Yuxikou. After consultation with the Anhui Highway Bureau, it was implemented on the Double Ten Festival. Passengers are assigned seats on the buses, and route security is provided. There are intermodal ticketing offices from Bengbu via Shuijiahu, Hefei, and Yuxikou to Wuhu.

### Many Major Traitors Still at Large in Jiading: County Government Compiles List and Requests Arrest Warrants

[Our Jiading Dispatch] Jiading was occupied for eight years, and local traitors and puppets acted as accomplices to the enemy, committing heinous crimes. Since the recovery, the county government and military police organs have successively reported them, but many important figures are still at large. Recently, the county government has clearly investigated and compiled a list of the traitors whose crimes are obvious and submitted it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial High Court, requesting that arrest warrants be issued promptly and they be punished according to law to prevent them from escaping justice.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office previously received a confidential report that the local Tao Xunsun, who operates movie theaters, was a traitor. Before the war, Tao founded the Da Guangming and Suzhou cinemas and the Xin Su Hotel in Suzhou. During the occupation, he colluded with the enemy and opened the Wei Ya and Xin Ya restaurants. He also opened theaters in Shanghai and Nanjing. When the puppet China Film Company was established, Tao served as the manager of the Suzhou branch. Tao surrendered himself on the 31st of last month and was interrogated. Prosecutor Wei Weiqing detained him after the interrogation. It has been confirmed that he committed traitorous acts, and he was prosecuted by the High Court on the 8th.

Yangzhou Hospital Suddenly Neglects the Poor and Sick

Editor: I am a refugee from northern Jiangsu. I am deeply saddened to see that the Provincial Yangzhou Hospital is superficially complying with the government's orders to alleviate the suffering of refugees but secretly defying them. Initially, the hospital stipulated that registration hours were from 2 to 4 PM every day (excluding holidays) for ordinary outpatient services (ordinary morning consultations). Suddenly, it adopted a bureaucratic tone of "limited time" and changed the hours to Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. For wealthy ordinary people, not only have Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays remained unchanged, but afternoon hours have even been added on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This treatment is too unequal. Even private hospitals that are completely profit-oriented do not "only care about profit" like this. On behalf of the majority of refugees, I urge the hospital to quickly improve by (1) restoring the original hours and (2) simplifying procedures to increase the effectiveness of relief efforts. We would be eternally grateful! (Hu Fenghao)

Impoverished Students Seek Education

Editor:

In today's situation where the problem of being unable to attend school is extremely serious, we students of Great China University have resolved our problems under the principle of cooperation with the school. Today, with boundless joy, we report our struggle process to students who have not yet secured their tuition to serve as a reference for them. The students of Great China University have always been disorganized, but this time, for their own personal issues, we are tightly united.

After the news that the educational loan funding was insufficient for distribution was released, the students were all worried. After much negotiation, under the pleas of all parties, the authorities decided to establish one hundred full tuition waivers and one hundred half-fee waivers. After the announcement was posted, more than four hundred students immediately signed up, which proves how seriously the tuition problem is threatening so many people! Because so many students applied and the original number of slots was insufficient, some of these four hundred students will inevitably not receive the loan funding, but we are still demanding that the school consider increasing the number of slots so that no student at Great China University is unable to attend school because they cannot pay tuition.

With full enthusiasm, we suggest that partners who are still hesitating outside the school gates summon their courage and sincerely request their school authorities to consider increasing the number of full tuition waivers or establishing scholarships. We believe that as long as it is not a diploma mill, the wise school authorities will definitely solve the difficulties for the students. We wish you success here! (A Group of Impoverished Students from Great China University)

Voices from Graduates of Vocational Training Classes

Editor: I am a young person who has been out of school for six years. After the victory, I was assigned by the Former Recruitment Association to the Nanjing Temporary Secondary School. During my studies, the association established a Wuhu Vocational Training Class. In order to support my livelihood and feeling that I was older, I resolutely registered and transferred to the class, hoping to learn a specialized skill from now on to repay the country and maintain my livelihood. Last April, at the opening ceremony of the class, the director said: "This class is a youth re-education and employment institution. The purpose is to cultivate a group of middle and lower-level cadres for national construction." The students were overjoyed to hear this. Now that the graduation period has arrived, the person in charge of the class declared: "Except for six students who have been assigned jobs and sixty students from northern Jiangsu who are allowed to be assigned to higher education, other students are willing to leave the class as soon as possible." Although I am a Jiangnan person, my suffering is no less than that of the people of Jiangbei. My mother lives with my uncle's family, and my father has been dead for nine years. When the group questioned him, he said: "I do not have this responsibility. If you do not believe me, you can ask the Ministry of Education." I think this is probably true, and he also has his own difficulties. However, if the Ministry of Education has taken huge amounts of funding to help a group of out-of-school youth but does not completely help them, what is the use? It wastes manpower, material resources, and financial resources regardless. Can these young people be able to return to school and get a job in the future? The certificate they received cannot be used to apply to schools or apply for jobs. Where are we going? Our enthusiasm for the country may be about to disappear. [Ma Rushan]

### Mail Response

Reply to Mr. Ye Yinyan: Regarding your previous letter pointing out the poor attitude of the doctor at the Shanghai Children's Hospital, we have received a reply from the hospital stating: "After investigation, the doctor is not from Shanghai, and the language barrier may be the main cause of the misunderstanding.

Reply to Mr. Ma Weinong: Regarding your statement on the case of punishing Liu Nengchao, the former Yongjia County Magistrate, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has replied, stating: "After investigation, this case has been accepted and is being investigated by the Lanxi Local Court. Mr. Ma's original letter will be forwarded to the Lanxi Local Court for reference." Special reply.

Reply to Mr. Er: Regarding your report that the Central Bank's one-hundred-city version of the five-hundred-yuan note is being refused in Beijing and Wuhu, the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has replied to our newspaper, stating: "All versions of banknotes issued by the bank are universally valid throughout the country, except for those that are damaged and unusable, which can be exchanged for new banknotes at our branches at any time. Although the refusal situation mentioned by Mr. Xiao is accidental, it is of great importance to currency credibility and public sentiment and should be corrected with great effort. In addition to instructing our Beijing and Wuhu branches to ask the relevant authorities to pay attention and correct it, we are replying accordingly." Special reply.

### Treaty with Bulgaria Passed: No Changes to the Greek-Bulgarian Border

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th, United Press] After overturning the proposal of the Four Powers on the Greek-Bulgarian border, the Peace Conference completed the treaty with Bulgaria at 1:15 AM this morning, the third treaty completed in three days. Representatives from various countries refused to accept the terms of the treaty with Bulgaria passed by the Four Powers' foreign ministers, which denied Greece any opportunity to make changes to the Bulgarian-Greek border. This move by the representatives of the Peace Conference shocked the entire General Assembly today. Greece had previously insisted on certain changes to the border to avoid being attacked and to ensure security. The General Assembly adjourned after passing the Bulgarian treaty. It then continued to vote on the treaty with Hungary at 10:00 AM. When the General Assembly voted on the economic part of the Bulgarian treaty this morning, it also followed the precedent of yesterday's Romanian treaty. More than two-thirds of the representatives voted in favor of the internationalization of the Danube River and ordered Bulgaria to participate in the Danube Conference convened by Western countries within six months. At the same time, it was decided by a two-thirds majority to grant Bulgarian civil aviation equal opportunities. The Peace Conference also passed a resolution by a vote of twelve to six to prohibit Bulgaria from building fortifications along the Greek border, and Bulgaria must destroy any military equipment capable of firing into Greek territory.

### Guerrillas Defeated and Routed in Northern Mountainous Areas of Greece; UK Considering Military Aid

It is reported that the Greek government has told Deppsey and Crow that it cannot save the current situation unless it obtains military equipment from the UK and mobilizes Greek farmers. It is observed that the British government is considering Greece's request with a cautious attitude. Unless Greek Prime Minister Tsaldares expands the Greek cabinet to include other parties, the UK's attitude towards Greece will become lukewarm. According to people close to the Foreign Office, the UK has instructed Greek King George that Greece must form a government that is more representative of the various parties.

### US Requests Use of Naples from Italy: Acheson Claims No Knowledge

### Eisenhower Speaks in England: Does Not Believe in Another War

[French News Agency, London, 11th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower recently spoke to the press here. I do not believe that a new war will break out again. I am very optimistic about the future. Some people have asked me to intercede for some Nazi war criminals, but I respect the International Military Tribunal and cannot comply.

### New Secretary of Commerce Harriman Issues Warning: US Should Be Vigilant Towards the Soviet Union; Explains Trends in Soviet Foreign Policy Based on Intelligence Gathered During His Tenure as Ambassador

[French News Agency, Washington, 11th] New Secretary of Commerce Harriman gave a speech yesterday at a joint meeting of representatives from the Army, Navy, and State Department. Based on intelligence gathered during his previous tenure as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, he explained the trends in Soviet foreign policy. He stated that Marshal Stalin and other Soviet leaders firmly believe that capitalism and communism cannot coexist in the same world. Because the Soviet Union has this belief, it has decided to adopt a policy that intends to obstruct all efforts by the UK and the US to solve global political problems. As for President Roosevelt, he originally believed that although the US and the Soviet Union have different systems, it is still possible to live in peace. However, in the last months of the war, the late president's views changed rapidly. If President Roosevelt were still alive today, he would undoubtedly promote President Truman and Secretary of State Bernays' policy towards the Soviet Union. As for myself, I had to change my original beliefs due to the various difficulties caused by the end of the European war and after the victory. At this moment, I believe that the Soviet Union's comprehensive autocratic system is incompatible with the US democratic system. In other words, the Soviet Union prohibits all freedom, while the US recognizes democratic freedom. Communism is indeed the real crisis in the world, and once it is touched, it is infected. Therefore, the current policy of the United States adopts great vigilance and expresses suspicion of the intentions of the Soviet Union in order to ultimately defend peace.

### Turkish President Calls for Unity Among All Political Parties

[United Press, Istanbul, 10th] Although Turkey will reject the Soviet Union's request for joint defense of the Strait of Dardanelles, it seems that it will agree to negotiations with the Soviet Union to serve as a prelude to a meeting with other countries. At the same time, Turkish President Inonu declared to the leaders of the opposition party, the Democratic Party, that the Democratic Party and the ruling People's Party have no differences. He is a "supra-party" person. It is interpreted that his words are sufficient to indicate that he is trying to unite the domestic parties to cope with external crises. Some people say that it foreshadows Inonu's resignation as President of the People's Party.

### Soviet Military Reforms on a Large Scale to Adapt to Modern Warfare

[Reuters, London, 12th] Our Moscow correspondent, Tang Dong, has just returned from that area. The following is the situation of the Red Army's reform that he described:

Some foreign military attachés in Moscow said that the Soviet army is engaged in a large-scale post-war reform. The highest Soviet military authorities are conducting the most detailed and cautious research on modern warfare, especially atomic bombs, radar, jet and rocket-propelled aircraft, so that the army, navy, and air force can adapt to the latest scientific inventions. At the same time, the large-scale military demobilization work is still far from completion. With the expansion of the Soviet Union's eastern and western borders, military needs have also increased accordingly.

Army Streamlining

Some foreign observers have told reporters that the Soviet army is adopting a streamlined approach to reorganization, and the effectiveness of atomic bombs is being analyzed in detail for reference. In addition to increasing the mobility and independence of the army, consideration is also being given to increasing base supplies and reserves. The Red Army pays great attention to tank and artillery units, but it still considers infantry to be the main body of combat. The Soviet Air Force is making every effort to study the wartime tactics of the British and American air forces. The Soviet Air Force's heavy bomber force is relatively weak in strength and lacks combat knowledge. The main research focus of Soviet Air Force strategists is currently the complex large-scale air offensive. The Soviet Union has always kept secret the progress of post-war aircraft types, and very few outsiders know about it. During the Air Force Day exhibition held in Moscow a few weeks ago, foreigners were able to get a glimpse of the Soviet Union's new aircraft types when Marshal Stalin and the officers of the Political Bureau of the Supreme Command inspected them. The inspected aircraft included the latest four-engine bomber and jet and rocket-propelled fighters. The Soviet Navy is also actively expanding. Authoritative information published by officials and newspapers all indicates this. The number and area of shipyards have increased, and Soviet experts are studying the characteristics of ships obtained from the UK, the US, and former enemy countries. The newly acquired naval bases in the Baltic Sea and the Far East are being greatly expanded. The Soviet Union still considers the navy and air force to be auxiliary to the Great Continental Army. The official and newspaper remarks all claim that the Soviet Army is the backbone of the only Soviet socialist country in the world and is considered the hope of the proletariat all over the world. The government has told the people that it will maintain and improve the Great Army to prevent aggression by capitalists and reactionaries. Capitalism has always been regarded as the source of aggressive war, so as long as capitalism exists in the world, the strength of the Red Army must be maintained at its Greatness. The Soviet Union does not neglect the purpose of politicizing the military, and this work has been intensified recently. At the same time, it is also paying great attention to improving military discipline standards. Absolute obedience is the slogan of the Red Army. Some new military laws have been promulgated to achieve this goal. The training of officers is still not relaxed in the slightest. Young officers who have gained practical experience during the war are now busy searching for theory in books. The number of Soviet troops is a very strict secret. Although the phenomenon of demobilization can be seen everywhere in the Soviet Union, the authorities have not yet published any statistics. Therefore, even if outsiders speculate, it is very inaccurate. The estimated number is around two million.

### Unstable Portuguese Political Situation: Military Mutiny a Prelude to Revolution; Premier Salazar's Position Shaken

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] Reports that Spanish troops had crossed the Portuguese border after a rebellion in Coimbra, Portugal, have been denied by responsible sources here. They stated that they are awaiting news of the outcome of the Coimbra rebellion. Britain has maintained friendly relations with Portugal for centuries and is particularly concerned about peace and order in that country. Rumors that the credibility of Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar has been shaken have not been denied by officials, and the possibility of a cabinet resignation is not ruled out. Diplomatic circles believe that Interior Minister Colonel Moniz, trusted by Prime Minister Salazar, may succeed him. On the other hand, President Carmona enjoys strong support from the army and may form a military government. It is almost certain that once Prime Minister Salazar leaves office, the situation in Portugal will become more difficult. [Reuters, Lisbon, 12th] According to unconfirmed reports, the Portuguese army has issued an ultimatum to the Salazar government, demanding the handover of power, or the army will take control of the entire country. This report comes as security measures in Lisbon and elsewhere in the country, taken in response to the mutiny in Obidos on Thursday, are gradually being relaxed. Traffic between Lisbon and Obidos, once disrupted, has resumed, and troops mobilized at the government's call remain stationed in Lisbon. Machine guns around Prime Minister Salazar's residence have not been removed. Although the government gazette stated that only 70 people participated in the Obidos mutiny and that it has been quelled, observers believe it is a prelude to a national revolutionary movement. Some even say the revolution will break out in Lisbon, and the mutiny was purely military-led. Rumors of communist involvement are hard to believe. Reliable reports are still lacking; it is only known that several people have been arrested and more will follow. So far, only the semi-official "Diário da Manhã" has commented on the matter, stating that the rebels are sabotaging national efforts and should not be spared.

### ### Japanese Female Students Strike Against Haircut Ban

### ### France Deploys Air Force: Renewed Fighting in Vietnam; Innocent Civilians Bombed

[United Press, Paris, 11th] A state of armed truce had been maintained between the French colonial authorities in Vietnam and Annamese resistance fighters since the agreement of May 6. Today, news of new conflicts has emerged. The French and Annamese accuse each other of violating the agreement, and provocations occurred at Cape Varella in southern Annam province. French fighter planes participated in the fighting. According to French sources, 75 Annamese bodies were left on the battlefield. Annamese sources claim that about 2,000 French troops encircled Annamese positions, and an unknown number of French fighter planes attacked civilians in the area.

### ### Soviet Union and Germany Hold Dissenting Views on Establishing International Armed Forces

[Associated Press, New York, 12th] The "New York Times" reported today that the Soviet Union opposes the establishment of a permanent international force to be used by United Nations agencies to maintain world peace. The Soviet Union is against assigning troops to United Nations agencies before any crisis occurs. This point is evident in the memorandum submitted by the Soviet delegation to the Military Committee of the Security Council in September. The points it advocates are almost entirely different from those of the representatives of the United States, Britain, China, and France on the Military Committee. The Soviet Union's interpretation of the UN Charter's provisions for the establishment of a peacekeeping force is that such a force should not be designated to be under the control of the Security Council until it is actually needed.

### Preparations for Chairman's 60th Birthday: 41 Organizations and Groups Recommended to Host Celebrations; Three Methods Determined, Including Statue, School Donation, Etc.

Shanghai Celebrates Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday. All the sponsors held a general meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Those present included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Kong Xiangxi, Fang Xikong, Du Yuesheng, Guo Yunguan, Xu Jiguan, Li Ximou, Li Jianhua, Wang Xiaolai, Yong Xiangming, Xi Yuwan, Li Fusun, Hou Junren, Yu Yunzhu, Zhou Feicheng, Pang Jingzhou, and other representatives from over 400 groups and associations. Wu Guozhen chaired the meeting. After the meeting was formally opened, Chairman Wu reported that the celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday was initiated by the Shanghai Municipal People's Assembly, so President Pan should be the chairman, but because Pan had an important report, he was recommended to represent as the general chairman. The name of this meeting today is "Shanghai Celebrates Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday Sponsors' Conference". I think no one among Shanghai's four million people would disagree or not want to be a sponsor, but because of the size of the place, it cannot accommodate everyone, so I specially invited you to represent the people of the whole city to hold this conference. Then Director Fang Xikong delivered a speech, saying that celebrating Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday is a truly heartfelt initiative of the people of Shanghai. The school donation and birthday celebration initiated in this city have already been responded to by various provinces and cities, which proves that the whole country is united in celebrating enthusiastically. We deeply know that the most important thing for national construction is education, and there are countless people who need education. Moreover, the world of the future is one of competition in strength and intelligence. At this time, donating a school is a grand plan for a hundred years, hoping that this work will be completed quickly so that children can all have books to read, and I think the Chairman will also agree. Then Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, saying that the meaning of school donation and birthday celebration is very long. I think (1) this school donation should be entirely voluntary by the people, without compulsion, otherwise it will lose its original meaning, which the Chairman would not want to see. (2) Create specialized talents who can apply what they have learned, so that people's lives can be improved.

### A Blood Case Six Years Ago: White Russian Regiment Kills孤军; Murderer Michiyakov Arrested After Victory;地院's First Instance Testimony Yesterday Was Vague

[本报讯] Six years ago, the case of He Yuxiang, a soldier of my四行孤军, being shot and killed by a团丁 of the White Russian Merchant Regiment of the former Public Concession was reported to the High Procuratorate after the victory. The murderer Michiyakov was detained, but because the case was an ordinary criminal case, it was transferred by the High Procuratorate to the District Procuratorate to file a public prosecution.

The District Court's Eighth Criminal Tribunal first heard the case yesterday afternoon. Michiyakov testified: 25 years old, joined the万国商团 in 1940, and was assigned to serve at the孤军营 on Singapore Road on September 18, 1929 of the Republic of China. That day was the anniversary of "September 18". The defendant was ordered to serve at the first post. At about 11:00 AM that day, about hundreds of citizens gathered around the孤军营. Many soldiers of the孤军营 climbed the walls and incited the crowd, so passers-by started to encircle and beat the guards. At that time, the situation was very tense. The defendant was frightened and lost his mind. He intended to fire a shot into the sky as a warning, but he could not hold it steady due to 神 轻紧张, so he did not know that he had killed anyone at that time. It was not until the next day that the newspaper reported that one soldier of the 孤军营 had been killed." The defendant Mikiyakov neither denied nor admitted the killing. Qiao Mailin (deputy captain of the White Russian Regiment) and Luo Bainov (the person in charge of investigating the case that year) testified in court. Both witnesses said that they were not eyewitnesses at the time, but they heard gunshots. The defendant's defense lawyer Liu Jiangang raised two points: (1) Three minutes after Michiyakov fired the shot that day, Ra希合维支 of the seventh post also fired a shot, so it remains to be confirmed whether the bullet that hit He Yuxiang was fired by Michiyakov. (2) According to Article 22, Paragraph 2, Section 1 of the 孤军营 Guard Training Order, "If a guard is attacked, or to prevent violent coercion, and armed disarmament, he may fire without the order of a superior." Therefore, the defendant's firing of the gun does not constitute a crime. He also requested that the prosecutor Ji Su, who was handling the case, provide evidence and requested a change of date for retrial, so that there would be sufficient time to collect evidence. The court approved his request and changed the retrial to 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.

### In Retrospect: Remembering the Past

It is said that at that time, the Japanese army repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council to take over the Isolated Battalion, but were refused. However, the Municipal Council's control over the Isolated Battalion camp became increasingly strict. White Russian merchants were dispatched to closely guard the surroundings of the camp. On September 14th, a conflict arose because the merchants erected barbed wire at a certain entrance of the camp, displeasing the soldiers. The White Russians used tear gas and fire hoses against the Battalion, and blockaded the camp. This dispute was the prelude to a bloody incident. After the incident, the late Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Isolated Battalion, issued a sorrowful statement, saying in brief: "The camp's perimeter wall facing the road is equipped with barbed wire, and a bathhouse is located below the wall. It has become customary for the brothers to talk there. Today (the 18th) at 11:50 AM, several soldiers were speaking outwards through the gaps in the barbed wire. Unexpectedly, a White Russian guard standing a few steps away raised his gun and aimed to stop them. The brothers ignored him, and the White Russian immediately opened fire, the bullet entering through the forehead and penetrating the brain, resulting in immediate death. At the same time, another White Russian standing on the left also raised his gun and aimed, injuring one soldier. Life and death are of no concern. We are prepared to sacrifice ourselves at any time for justice and world civilization, and are determined to fight to the end at any cost. We hereby request the Shanghai public, that after our sacrifice, please collect our bones and return them to our government..." The arduous situation of the Isolated Battalion at that time can be seen from this announcement. Today, after the victory, the old case is brought up again, how can it not evoke memories?

### Heads Bowed, Silently Speechless, This Person Alone is Withered; Yuan Meiyun Quietly Returns; A Swarm of People Gathered Before the Shanghai Prison Gates, Eager to See the Final Act of a Tragic Comedy

[Reported by this Newspaper] This is a tragic comedy, which played out its final act yesterday—film star Yuan Meiyun was sentenced to six months in prison for opium addiction, and has been released after serving her term.

At daybreak, a large crowd had gathered in front of the Shanghai Prison gates, with countless eyes fixed on the exit. Winding and turning, they passed through the gates. In front of the tightly closed iron gates of the women's prison, reporters and Yuan's relatives anxiously waited. Reporters searched everywhere for Wang Yin's trace, but everyone was disappointed.

At precisely 8:00 AM, the large gate opened, and two bailiffs in yellow uniforms walked out, followed by a woman with a sallow complexion. She wore a qipao with red background and blue horizontal stripes, covered with a light blue short woolen coat. She wore flesh-colored stockings and two-tone shoes with white and brown trim. Her hair was cut very short, and was dry and dull. She held a mesh bag in one hand, and covered her mouth with a handkerchief in the other. Wearing wide-rimmed sunglasses, she lowered her head and stepped out of the women's prison gates. The mesh bag was immediately taken by relatives, and she silently followed the bailiffs to the District Procuratorate on Rue Loukas, to complete the release procedures.

This is Yuan Meiyun, the once immensely popular "Little Actress," and the lithe and youthful "Avatar Girl" and the stunning "Xi Shi" on the screen! However, seeing her sallow, swollen face caused by malnutrition and indigestion, and covered with scrofula, who could not feel a pang of sorrow for this once radiant star!

She boarded the Qi Ming Transportation Company's ten-seater jeep that had been prepared and drove straight to the District Procuratorate. In the car, she kept her head down, the black sunglasses and white handkerchief covering two-thirds of her face. Reporters tried various ways to coax her into talking, but all failed. She remained silent throughout.

At 8:25 AM, she arrived at the District Procuratorate. She got out of the car and was escorted into the criminal defendant waiting room. People curious and eager to get a look at her were constantly flowing towards the iron bars of the small room to peek at her. Yuan Meiyun—this person who had been imprisoned for six months and was about to regain her freedom—was pacing back and forth inside, her mind filled with confusion. Only those who have experienced the taste of losing freedom know how precious freedom is. How long each moment was for her at this time!

The reporters wanted to talk to her. Since she was silent, the lawyer who had been entrusted to pick her up relayed: "My mind is in chaos today, I don't know where to start. Let's talk another day."

Someone grumbled, "People fear fame, pigs fear fattening." For anyone else, would so many people come to see her and surround her today? Others sighed in injustice: to lock her in this small room, allowing people to constantly peek through the iron bars, is this not like watching an animal in a zoo? What a cruel form of abuse!

Finally, at 9:25 AM, she was brought to court. Prosecutor Chuan Bang took the stand and asked her name, age, place of origin, address, etc. Yuan replied, "Twenty-nine years old, originally from Hebei, residing at 12 Hengye Lane, Zhongzheng Road. I was arrested on April 12th of this year, and entered the detention center on April 16th. The District Court sentenced me to six months." The prosecutor informed her that the term of execution had expired and that she was being released today. He told her not to take it again after going out. Yuan lowered her head and said nothing. Then, she gave her fingerprints and signed the bond. The prosecutor wrote the words "released" heavily on the paper. The film star, who had been imprisoned for six months, regained her freedom at this point. The time was 9:30 AM. She lowered her head and hurriedly stepped out of the courtroom. Relatives stepped forward to help her, and together they jumped into the light gray, brand-new car that had been prepared. Her old mother had been sitting in the car since early morning, waiting until now. Meiyun fell into her arms, the car started, and sped away.

### Newly Appointed Municipal Party Committee Members Fang Zhi and Others to be Sworn in Tomorrow

The newly appointed Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Fang Zhi, Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, and other committee members are scheduled to take the oath of office at the Municipal Stadium at 9:00 AM tomorrow. Wu Jingheng, a supervisor specially appointed by the Central Government, will be the oath administrator.

### Municipal Party Committee Secretary-General Xie Discusses Future Work Guidelines

The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee, Xie Renzhao, expressed his views on the future party affairs guidelines, stating briefly: I am honored to have been ordered to assist, but I could not decline, and I feel apprehensive. However, I believe that party affairs work is an obligation of party members to the party, and it is by no means comparable to holding an official position. In the future, I will continue to uphold the spirit of serving society and devote myself to various social undertakings. As for the work guidelines, my intentions are no more than the following four points: (1) To conduct party activities with a political party style. The essence of the Kuomintang is by no means a party that practices one-party dictatorship. Its ultimate goal is to return power to the people. The National Congress is about to convene, and the country is entering a constitutional period. In the future, the party should conduct party activities with a political party style, so that policies can better penetrate the masses and gain their support. (2) To use the will of the people as the basis for publicity. In a democratic country, sovereignty resides in the people. Today, in a democratic country, it is necessary to grasp the will of the majority of the people before formulating policies and publicizing them to society to promote the implementation of the government. The revival of China's nation-building places the primary emphasis on people's livelihood. The publicity of party affairs in this city will prioritize benefiting the national economy and people's livelihood, and reflecting the will of the people. Cultural education is an essential element in improving life and must not be overlooked. (3) To strive for progress in democratic politics through party and government innovation movements, with the goal of eliminating corruption and improving the atmosphere. (4) To maintain reasonable contact with other parties with a free attitude of research. Democracy and freedom are inseparable, and democracy and the rule of law should be integrated. Those who despise freedom are not truly democratic, and those who undermine the law are not free. The freedom of political parties must be mutually respected, and the laws of the country depend on the public for maintenance. Although the views of political parties may differ, the attitude must be friendly. In this way, the majority of the people can know what to choose, and various parties can maintain contact, jointly serving society and benefiting the people. Xie continued: In the future, the nation's affairs will take the National Assembly and the formulation of a constitution as the only step towards achieving democratic constitutionalism. The National Congress has been scheduled to convene, and we are looking forward to the efforts of all parties.

### Boundless Bitterness and Endless Agony: Miss Fei Man'er, a Renowned Chinese Violinist, Strives On; She Encounters a Heartrending Tragedy on Her Life's Journey; from Her Four Strings Comes the Sound of Utter Grief

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Martin Luther once said, "Music is God's best gift to mankind." However, as we receive this beautiful and moving gift, we may forget how much hardship, struggle, and bitter effort the transmitters of this gift have undergone in order to contribute this spiritual sustenance to others. The reporter here wishes to introduce Miss Fei Man'er, a famous Chinese violinist, who is one such person.

If you are interested in music, if you have lingered in Chongqing or Chengdu, you must know or have heard the name Fei Man'er. I am not willing to extravagantly praise Miss Fei's art, but I dare say that Miss Fei's achievements and status in today's Chinese music circle are by no means easy, especially considering the heartrending tragedy she has encountered in her life's journey, which deserves our sympathy and admiration. The tragic death of Miss Fei's husband, Major Zeng Peifu, the leader of the Third Squadron of the Air Force, was the biggest blow in her life. However, for the past three years, in order to strengthen the courage of the anti-Japanese air force, Miss Fei has never forgotten her own responsibility, continuing to travel around, bringing the crystallization of her heartbreaking tears from her four strings to them. The day before yesterday, on Double Tenth Day (October 10th), Miss Fei was invited by the Hangzhou Jianqiao Air Force Officer School to specially lead a small music group to participate in a performance. The reporter was fortunate enough to have this opportunity to accompany them to enjoy the performance and have a conversation with Miss Fei.

Her Father Passed Away Early

Miss Fei Man'er is from Hangzhou and is only twenty-six years old this year. Her father used to be a teacher at a local school, but he passed away early. Miss Fei's mother placed all her hopes on her only daughter. When she was six years old, she began to urge her to learn the piano, and when she was twelve years old, she also started to learn the violin. At that time, Miss Fei's family still lived in Hangzhou, but every weekend, she came to Shanghai to study the violin with Professor Pudo Higa, a famous Austrian violinist here. Even today, she is still diligently studying with the old professor. Miss Fei studied at the National Academy of Art for six years, but after graduation, she never gave up continuing her studies. In 1937, she participated in the examination of the London College of Music in Shanghai and obtained a diploma from the college.

A Loving Mother Grieves, Then Passes Away

After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Miss Fei went to the interior. Seven years ago, she married Major Zeng Peifu. However, it was also because of this matter that she encountered her second unfortunate experience. At that time, she was only nineteen years old. Miss Fei's mother, for the sake of her daughter's future, did not want her to marry too early, fearing it would affect her musical prospects, which often made her depressed, and she eventually died of cerebral hemorrhage the following year.

In addition to feeling heartbroken, Miss Fei could only use her musical accomplishments to comfort her loving mother in the afterlife. On the one hand, she was also encouraged by her husband. "My husband has always encouraged me to make good progress. His sincerity and urging made me dare not relax my studies again," Miss Fei said. Then, Miss Fei began her tragedy.

Her Husband Perished in a Plane Crash

Major Zeng was a graduate of the sixth class of the Air Force Officer School. In the early years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he participated in more than forty battles and made outstanding achievements. When the enemy's fighter planes first invaded our air force's airspace to engage in combat, Major Zeng was one of them. In that fierce battle, more than forty air force soldiers sacrificed half of their lives. Among the other half, some were seriously injured, and some retreated halfway. Only Major Zeng continued to pursue and returned safely, earning a special commendation. However, heaven was merciless. Three years ago, Major Zeng was working as a training officer in Karachi, India. Once, while demonstrating flight techniques with several Allied soldiers, his plane unfortunately crashed and he died on the spot. At this time, he was only twenty-eight years old. We can imagine how Miss Fei in Chengdu felt at that time! Miss Fei is an affectionate girl, but she is brave.

From that time on, she struggled in the pain of blood and tears with her three-year-old daughter, Xiao Manli, and the newborn little boy, as well as her violin, another sustenance of her life.

Her Child Fell Ill and Died

Last winter, Miss Fei came to Shanghai. I really couldn't believe that there could be such a tragic tragedy in the world, but the facts were right in front of you. This New Year, her little boy, who looked just like his father, also died of meningitis! Tears like a spring gushed from Miss Fei's eyes, and I no longer had the courage to speak. "The people in the Air Force are so good to me, but the pain in my heart cannot be compensated by anything," Miss Fei's short two sentences are more profound and sad than any sad words I could use to describe!

"But, for the sake of my six-year-old daughter (who has now started learning the piano), for the sake of my dead mother, husband, and child, I must live on." Miss Fei moved me to the point of speechlessness.

Preparing to Go to the United States for Further Study

In addition to continuing to practice the violin, Miss Fei is also studying singing with the famous professor Hisslin. She is preparing to go to the United States for further study and is applying for a passport for her daughter, because this is her last and most intimate companion. Miss Fei is very intelligent. She can not only speak fluent English, but also speak Russian, because she has often lived in her teacher Professor Pudo Higa's home since she was a child. In addition, she can also drive airplanes and cars.

Miss Fei is indeed an extremely unfortunate person, but in this war, there are many people in the world who are more unfortunate and pitiful than you. You are still so young, you have unlimited prospects, and God has given you talent, which not every unfortunate person can get. The country needs talents like you, and we sincerely hope that you "put away your painful moans and offer your innocent heart." For the sake of your ideals, move forward bravely. Wish you success! (The above picture is a recent photo of Miss Fei taken by this newspaper)

### Yang Wendao Pronounced Not Guilty; Ten Years of Wrongful Imprisonment Reversed in a Day; He Bowed Repeatedly After Hearing the Verdict, Bursting into Tears of Gratitude; He Will Report and Sue the Police Detective Who Gave False Testimony on That Day

[Report from This Newspaper] At 1:45 PM yesterday, Yang Wendao and his son, Hanzhi, walked into the Second Court of the High Court, silent and with tense expressions, waiting for the final decision on his fate. When the court called his name, the atmosphere suddenly changed, Yang Wendao also smiled, bowing frequently to the court, and calmly walked out of the courtroom, now a free man.

The High Court held a collegial panel hearing yesterday, with the presiding judge being [name missing], judge Wang Ke [name missing], Zhang Shijie, and [name missing] prosecutor Jiang Gongliang; Yang Wendao's defense lawyer was still Tang [name missing] Qun. The interrogation began at 2:15 PM and was very strict, with many feeling uneasy for Yang Wendao. At 4:10 PM, the debate was announced to be over, and the judges retired to deliberate. At 4:30 PM, the judges returned to their seats, and the presiding judge, with a smile on his face, sat down and stood up to pronounce the verdict, reading the main text: "In the case of Yang Wenjin's murder, the original judgment is revoked, and Yang Wendao is not guilty." Yang Wendao bowed to the court after hearing the verdict, and his eyes were filled with tears due to extreme emotion! The audience was silent during the verdict, and then erupted [missing text] when the verdict was delivered. Judge [missing text] also leaned forward to Yang with a smile, nodding. When reporters offered their hands to Yang and his son [missing text], they were overcome with emotion and thanked them profusely. Lawyer [missing text] was extremely happy because of his success.

At 2:15 PM, the court summoned Yang Wendao, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Five large stacks of case files were piled on the court table, each stack more than a foot high. The presiding judge, whose vision was obstructed, specially ordered a bailiff to set up another chair behind the judge's seat to place these documents, but because the stacks were too high, they seemed about to fall.

Yang Wendao wore a beige suit, which was quite neat. He was almost unrecognizable compared to when reporters interviewed him in prison last winter. He wore yellow leather shoes. According to Yang Wendao, he was wearing these shoes when he was arrested ten years ago. In the police station, Japanese police officers ordered him to take off the shoes and used them to hit his head indiscriminately to force a confession, causing him to faint. Yang Wendao announced to be not guilty.

### Tortured After Arrest; Conspired to Falsely Accuse Wu Tiecheng

The court first asked about his age and place of origin. Yang replied that he was fifty-two years old and from Zhongshan, Guangdong. Then asked about the grounds for the appeal, Yang immediately replied that he knew nothing about the assassination of Nakayama Hideo. At 10:00 AM on April 19, 1936, he was going out to attend a funeral when he met Tan Sheng pacing in front of his alley residence. When Tan saw Yang, his face turned red and he looked very uneasy. Yang immediately asked him why he was there, and Tan replied that he was visiting a friend. After walking past three or four shops, Chen Rongsheng, who was walking with Yang, turned around and saw Tan waving to the rear. Three or four people in Western-style suits rushed forward, grabbed his hands from behind, handcuffed him, and dragged him into a car with the letters SMP on it, which drove to the Dithway Road Police Station. He immediately asked why he was arrested, and a Japanese police officer replied that he would know slowly. That night, the Japanese military wanted to transfer him to the headquarters, but the police station authorities did not allow it, so he was sent to the Central Police Station and then to the District Court the next morning. No public prosecution was brought against him that day. The next day, Ye Haisheng was arrested and sent to court together, accused of being the murderer of Nakayama Hideo. Because Yang really didn't know the details, he refused to admit it. After he was arrested, the police station searched his home, and a Western police officer found a book, raised it and asked him if it was his. He said that it was a book in which he hid his pistol, but the original book was actually in English. After Ye Haisheng was arrested, he was taken to the "special room" on the fourth floor every midnight and subjected to severe torture. His knees rotted from kneeling on gravel. People in the police station told him that if he could confess that Wu Tiecheng, the former mayor, and Tang Haian, the customs superintendent of Jianghai, instigated him and that Wu and others gave him 150,000 yuan as the assassination price, he could be exempted from punishment. However, he would rather be tortured every night and never yield. Unexpectedly, when the District Court opened the trial, he was not allowed to speak and was sentenced to death, which was a great injustice, so he refused to accept the judgment and appealed.

### Presiding Judge's Inquiry Lasted an Hour

Then the presiding judge began a thorough and sharp inquiry, lasting more than an hour. Yang Wendao recounted that the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society was established in 1930 as a charitable organization that ran schools and provided job placement. Ye Haisheng was also a member of the society. The source of funding was shared by all members. Yang flatly denied that he and Ye Haisheng had drawn lots in the Hongshun Society to decide to assassinate Nakayama Hideo. Regarding the book with a hole for hiding a pistol, the court asked: What book was it? Answer: It was an English book, I don't know what book. Question: Was it Practical Physics? Answer: I didn't know at the time. Question: You don't know English, why would you use an English book? Answer: I found it in the warehouse. Question: Later you saw a Chinese physics book? Answer: I read it carefully when [text missing] and knew the book was not mine.

Question: You are not a soldier, why do you have a pistol? Answer: This was mentioned earlier by [text missing], the mayor of Wen Hongen, who lent it to me, but I returned the gun to [text missing] before I returned to Guangdong. Question: Why was it placed in the book? Answer: Because there were many children at home, my cousin Yang Jianzhong suggested putting it in a book with a hole in it. Question: Were there bullets? Answer: Yes, six rounds. Question: Why did you admit it before? Answer: Ye Haisheng admitted it, but I never admitted it. Question: Why did Hua Haisheng admit it? Answer: He later told me in prison that he couldn't bear the torture. The Japanese systematically called Ye [text missing] and then called me to implicate Mayor Wu and Tang Haian. Question: How do you know? Answer: The Western detective [text missing], said that if I implicated those two, I could avoid torture. Question: Did you go to Ye Haisheng's performance? Answer: I never knew about it. Ye was detained at the Chengdu Road Police Station, and I was detained at the Central Police Station. Question: One of the witnesses that year was Zhang Zhu? Answer: Zhang Chen [text missing] Ceng Yuanjia, Zheng Weimin, Tan Sheng, etc. formed [text missing] and willingly obeyed the Japanese' instructions, creating the incident and framing China. Later, Zhang Chen, out of conscience, confessed the past situation and asked Ceng Yuan[missing text] to tell them that if they could implicate Yang Wendao, everyone would be in line. However, Zhang Chen was detained in the police station that night and was tortured again. Question: How do you know? Answer: I heard Zhang Chen say it in court later. Question: The Chinese physics book is not yours, what evidence do you have? Answer: It never came into my hands, so I don't know anything about it. Question: [Text missing] Is there oil on the hole [missing text]? Answer: The book was later sent to Zhenru for inspection. According to the court clerk, there was oil on it, as if it had just been taken off the gun, but the gun hand had already dried. There were PC prints in the hole, and the inspectors also said that they were pressed out temporarily. There were fourteen fingerprints on the book, and none of them matched my fingerprints. Yang Wendao stated that when he mentioned Ye Haisheng, [text missing] detective once [text missing] forced him to kneel in front of Ye, using Yang's [text missing] to beat Yang's head severely, and using small stones [text missing] under his knees to force Yang to confess.

Prosecutor Jiang's Three Points of Prosecution

After the interrogation, Prosecutor Jiang stood up and stated three points: (1) The original trial said that Yang Wendao instigated Ye Haisheng to kill Nakayama Hideo. The most important basis was Ye's confession. However, Ye's confession was inconsistent, sometimes saying that Meng Yang was involved, and sometimes saying that he was not. It was said that Ye's confession came from torture, first being punched and rubbed on the ribs, and water being poured into his mouth. According to the inspection report at the time, the situation seemed reliable, and he suffered torture, probably more than once. His confession was chaotic and could not be adopted. (2) The physics text for Yang Wendao's self-defense pistol was in English [text missing] The physics text for the pistol used for the murder was in Chinese. Although the appearance was similar, it did not match. And the inspection [text missing] had [text missing] traces of digging. When Zhang Chen testified, he said that [text missing] Ceng Yuan [text missing] Guo Hui [text missing] and others wanted to plot a reward, colluding to frame him. Ceng’s brother had already proven in another [text missing] that it was difficult to become a traitor and had a relationship with the Japanese, specializing in using the power of the Japanese to act illegally in the Hongkou area. Therefore, Zhang Chen’s confession was quite credible. (3) The circumstances of Haisheng's practice of committing the crime were indeed under threat. In addition, the motivation for Yang Wentong's crime [text missing] said that Yang wanted to kill the Japanese and create the power of his association in Hongkou. However, at that time, Hongkou was within the sphere of influence of the Japanese. Killing the Japanese only prompted the Japanese to eliminate the association. At that time, the situation was special, and the Japanese did not hesitate to make sacrifices and wanted to create a serious incident. Based on the above, the prosecutor believes that Yang Wendao's criminal suspicion is not sufficient.

### Lawyer's Defense

Lawyer Tang continued to defend, saying: Today's trial of this case is in a free atmosphere, but when this case happened that year, the situation was very serious. Residents of Hongkou moved away one after another. At that time, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, He Yingqin, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng, specially dispelled rumors and reassured the people. On that day, Prosecutor Zhang insisted that the defendant should be found not guilty in order to maintain the dignity of Chinese law. But within a week, the atmosphere became extremely tense, and the court even canceled the end of the debate and conducted another trial. The defendant [text missing] was sentenced to death - based on the facts at that time.

(1) From the perspective of the judge, the deceased was only five centimeters away from the shooter, while Ye Haisheng's performance [text missing] was [text missing] zhang away. At that time, the shoe store clerk Hu Xianghe, who [text missing] testified that [text missing] wore clothes similar to those of the murderer. Pay special attention to this. (2) The lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station once copied the book in American English, but later it changed [text missing] The Chinese version. (3) [Text missing] The performance was called pushing five people around, which was a serious “director 1”, not a “performance.” (4) [Text missing] is a member of Hong [text missing], Yang is the president, so the Japanese wanted [text missing] Ye to implicate Yang, and then [text missing] Yang to evaluate [text missing] the chief. (5) Unexpectedly, Yang [text missing] firmly refused to confess, so another plan was born to force Ye Haisheng to admit it, which was used as a final decision. When lawyer Tang finished his defense, he [text missing] to the Central Party Headquarters to prove [text missing] Qiu [text missing] Please [text missing] no translation, [text missing] to receive [text missing]. Yang Wendao [text missing] Li [text missing] [text missing] the chief to reverse his ten years of [text missing]. [Text missing] Gao [text missing] finally finalized [text missing] after [text missing] chasing [text missing] [text missing] Yang Wendao's verdict.

According to [text missing] Luo; After the verdict in this case is final, Yang Wendao will not only [text missing] Gao Zeng Yuan and others for false testimony [text missing] but will also [text missing] the police detective of the shooting police station for using non- [text missing]. Those who have been poisoned by the tea of those who have [text missing] [text missing] [text missing] [text missing] [text missing] offer [text missing] the facts. I heard [text missing] [text missing] also intend to ask the government for compensation for the wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Yang.

### Minister Wang Discusses the Textile Control Commission, Chairman Wu Can Take Over Next Week, Distribution Scope Gradually Expanding

[Reported by this newspaper] Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted a routine board meeting of the China Textile Construction Company yesterday afternoon and met with reporters. He stated that the position of Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee has indeed been concurrently held by Mayor Wu Guozhen. The government believes that to strengthen the joint distribution mechanism for yarn and cloth, relying solely on the Textile Control Commission and relevant trade associations is not enough. For example, adjusting the electricity consumption of various factories is related to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. Restoring workers' working hours to pre-war levels is related to society. Therefore, to ensure thorough and effective work, local governments must take more responsibility. Although it is well known that Mayor Wu is busy with official duties, he was still persuaded to take on the chairmanship. He exchanged views with Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon on the issue of stabilizing yarn and cloth prices, and both sides' viewpoints were very consistent. The position of Deputy Chairman of the Textile Control Commission will continue to be held by Li Shengbo concurrently. In addition, Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, has been appointed as a member of the Textile Control Commission. The original Chairman, Shu Yunjhang, resigned from the chairmanship due to his concurrent position as General Manager of the Textile Construction Company and insufficient energy, but he will remain a member. The new chairman and members are expected to take over next week.

Regarding the first joint distribution of cotton yarn, Minister Wang believes it was satisfactory. However, the second joint distribution was not ideal. Minister Wang stated that when he last came to Shanghai, he and various factories agreed that the maximum distribution price for each piece of 20-count yarn should be 1.55 million yuan, and it could only fall within this limit, not exceed it. However, the market price of cotton yarn continued to rise sharply. The reasons for this are indeed higher sales and expensive raw materials, but the yarn factories participating in the joint distribution are also responsible for whether the distribution price is accurate. It is rumored that some yarn factories also operate yarn shops. Therefore, on the one hand, they seem to be losing money due to the distribution of yarn, but on the other hand, they are still making profits through their yarn shops. Such situations must be strictly investigated. The government's principle for joint distribution is to strengthen the mechanism, and the distribution scope is planned to expand from yarn to cloth. The distribution locations are planned to expand from Shanghai to other cities. This is because there is a nationwide shortage of yarn and cloth, so it is necessary to rationalize joint distribution, with the Textile Control Commission presiding over it. Shanghai is the place with the most cotton yarn and cotton cloth production in the country, and most of the yarn and cloth in other places depends on it, so it is hoped that we can start in Shanghai first to stabilize the market prices of yarn and cloth in other cities. Now that Mayor Wu is the chairman of the Textile Control Commission, with the power of the municipal government to assist in suppressing the market prices of yarn and cloth, greater results will certainly be achieved.

It is also reported that the organizational method of the Industry and Commerce Supervision Office, since its passage, is now being actively prepared, and it is expected to be established within this month.

Minister Wang will conclude his official business in Shanghai and return to Beijing by overnight train at 10:00 PM tonight.

### Shanghai Stock Market Spiritless, Hot Stocks with Slight Touches

The Chinese stock market deteriorated yesterday. Although there was a slight rise at the opening, major investors and new buyers were still absent, so the rise was short-lived, and it soon fell from high to low. Trading in the market was quiet. Only the counters of Yongxin and Xinhe were still lively. Except for slight touches of Xinguangjing, the rest were doubly deserted. Xinhe was fully supplied from number 164, so the chips expanded, almost keeping pace with Yongxin. There was little resistance along the way. The process gradually declined in a calm state.

Converted into legal tender, it is more than 111,000 yuan per dan, which is too far from the 400,000 yuan increase per grade requested by the manufacturers.

### The Price of Sodalin Bleaching Powder and Caustic Soda Is High Due to Shortage

There has been no new Sodalin from Australia for a long time. Its prices has recently increased dramatically due to strong sales. Between June and July, a 180-pound bag was priced at 180,000 yuan, but the current price has reached 550,000 to 600,000 yuan. Caustic soda, because guest merchants have come to Shanghai to purchase, and printing and dyeing factories in the city cannot do without caustic soda for printing, bleaching, and finishing, all parties are trying to buy as much as possible, resulting in holders waiting for prices to rise. Bleaching powder essence has been imported very little this year, but bleaching powder, the surplus material from the US wartime, once flooded the market, and users were happy to use it because of its low price. Now that the bleaching powder is almost exhausted and the price has also soared, bleaching powder essence has become a rare commodity again. Between February and March of this year, the price per barrel (100 market catties) was 670,000 yuan, but it fell to 110,000 to 20,000 yuan between June and July. At the end of June, when credit was extremely tight, it fell to as low as 90,000 yuan per barrel. Now, Erlitong goods have become valuable and there is no stock. US and Japanese goods, 112 pounds per barrel, are priced at 380,000 to 90,000 yuan, and it is quite difficult to buy spot goods.

Domestic sales of green tea in this street's Hakka shops and trading groups remain unchanged. However, Guo Men Hua tea from local tea factories is becoming increasingly active, with top grade fragrant tea already exceeding 50,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Medium grade fragrant tea is following suit, while other teas remain stable.

### Woolen Fabrics Shipped from South Africa - Unloading Yesterday - Besides 5,000 Cases of Cotton Cloth - The Rest Were Woolens and Yarn

### Commodity Tax is a Convenience for Manufacturers - Tax Bureau Affirms

[Nanjing, 12th, 1:00 PM] Since the Ministry of Finance established new regulations for the collection of commodity tax, industries such as fur, tea, and cement have felt that the burden is too heavy and have submitted documents to relevant central ministries and commissions requesting a reduction. The Tax Bureau now states that the collection of commodity tax was approved by the highest authorities and has gone through legislative procedures. As an administrative agency, the bureau will continue to vigorously promote the tax until further orders are received. Among the commodity taxes, there are not many newly levied taxes, and the tax rates are not high for most categories, except for luxury goods and non-essential items. Foreign goods entering the country are subject to the same commodity tax as domestic goods, in addition to customs duties, to ensure impartiality. The collection of commodity tax is actually a convenience for manufacturers, because after the commodity tax is collected, goods can be transported and sold throughout the country, avoiding various local special product taxes.

(Although the amount distributed this time was over 700 tons, there were also 800-900 units in the city's industry, so the average quantity was extremely small. The city's demand for white coal is quite extensive in the winter, and the source is still hopeless, so people's hearts are very strong). White coal dross continues the previous trend, and the market price continues to show resilience. The price of bituminous coal lumps has risen again due to the joint business office's restrictions on industry applications. Only bituminous coal slurry is relatively stable.

### Rice Prices Stop Falling and Turn Firm - Oil and Grains Continue to Decline

After consecutive days of falling rice prices, disputes over origin allocations and applications caused market sentiment to firm in the morning market, calling for a raise of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but the accumulation of goods in Zhabei and the river downstream is abundant, with more than 200 rice boats and registered customer goods of more than 14,000 shi (a unit of volume). The shop stomach (ability to absorb goods) is not smooth, and the market closes down again, becoming bland. As a result, Japonica rice and Yuan rice are similar, and Indica rice is slightly firmer. In the oil market, with consecutive arrivals of Qingdao raw oil and a small number of arrivals in Hankou and Dalian, raw oil continues to weaken by 1,000 yuan, soybean oil is slightly soft, rapeseed oil is fair, and soybean cake oil head is slightly taken, and the price is flat. The sales of soybeans from various places are stagnant, and there are still sources in the Northeast. The city's electrification is clear, and the Longhai Line can also deliver goods, forming an oversupply, and falling by 300-500 to 1,000 yuan. The source of green beans from various roads continues, and there are not many transactions of high-quality goods. There are no buyers for medium and lower-quality goods, and they are returned to 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and there is still a lack of transactions.

[Reuters, New York, 11th] The price of platinum in New York has recently been reduced from a previous price between $85 and $88 to between $85 and $75 per ounce.

Others are still holding the price of $85, but there are currently few new transactions being made. It is also learned that the jewelry industry currently owns more goods than previously estimated.

### Woolen Fabrics Sales are Booming

The recent booming sales of woolen fabrics are truly unexpected. For example, fine wool gabardine, serge, Hailing stick, Zhigong, Sezi tribute, Xuanwei flannel, Warden flannel overcoats, plain thick flannel, etc. Although the market price is expensive, there are still many actual transactions every day. Due to the lack of circulation of goods in the market, the desire to order goods is even stronger. Regardless of British goods, American goods, or Hong Kong transshipment goods, people want to order recent goods, because it is intended to meet the market demand and promote them according to current domestic and foreign market prices, and no batch does not make money. Merchants have reduced the deposit for ordering foreign goods from 30-50% to 20% due to the surge in orders, and the pricing is also much more reasonable than two or three months ago.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Longan: According to telegrams from Tong'an yesterday, Tong'an gui (cinnamon) rose another 10,000 yuan, and the Shanghai market has risen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, which should be considered worthwhile.

Vermicelli: Recently, due to few arrivals, the asking price is tighter, and it has risen again by 20,000 yuan. Superior Longkou vermicelli is 3.78 million yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli is 3.6 million yuan.

Tin Foil: There are few transactions. Shanghai inventory must be subject to commodity tax, so they all go to the production area of Shaoxing to purchase. Since October 1, those exported from the production area have tax bills, and those who hold the tax bills do not need to pay taxes when they arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shaoxing market is lively, and the Shanghai market is quiet.

Hardware: The ironware price increase is in full swing. The market price of Yuan Ding (pig iron) has risen again by more than 10,000 yuan per barrel. Wood screws have been purchased in large quantities by Hakka trading groups, and continue to rise. The inventory of new goods, raw lacquer, is not abundant, and has been searched for in many ways, forming a rare shortage.

### British Goods in Hong Kong - Overwhelming American Goods

[Hong Kong News] The number of American goods arriving in Hong Kong is gradually decreasing, and there is a tendency to continue to decrease. The recent fall in the US dollar is one proof of this. According to a person in charge of a certain American office, the main reasons why American goods may decrease in Hong Kong are: (1) The route for American goods to Hong Kong is too long, and the cost is relatively high. (2) It is difficult to buy official US dollars, and the black market price is high. Therefore, British goods in the Hong Kong market have gradually overwhelmed American goods, because the United Kingdom, Australia, and India all have goods that the United States can arrive, and the cost is lower than that of American goods. For example, for the same calico, the cost of calico from India is only 1.5 yuan per yard, but it costs 2.5 yuan from the United States. It is profitable to sell Indian cloth for 2 yuan, but it will lose money to sell American goods. Canned goods from Australia have also overwhelmed American goods recently. Therefore, fewer American goods are coming, and the demand for US dollars has decreased, and the market price cannot but fall.

In the absence of national education teachers, the system of alternating training and practice and the special normal class or simple normal class attached to high schools and junior high schools for one year should be promoted as much as possible, and high school and junior high school graduates should be recruited and given professional normal training.

Civil Affairs Briefs

### Regulations Stipulate that District and Bao Methods Must be Clearly Indicated in Household Registration and Notification Forms

For the sake of easy distinction of district and bao in the household number column of the household registration book, the Civil Affairs Department has specifically stipulated that the district name abbreviation and bao number should be added between the household number and the number. It also provided detailed explanations for the completion of the resident registration notification form and sent a circular to all district offices for verification and implementation, with the following three points:

(1) It was found that in the household number column of the household registration book, one household was originally designated as one number, with bao as the starting and ending point. However, it was impossible to distinguish which district and bao this number belonged to. It is now stipulated that the district name abbreviation and bao number should be added between the household number and the number, such as "Household Number Pu (2) 98". The character "Pu" refers to Putuo District, (2) refers to the second bao, and 98 is the number, which will be clear at a glance. This wooden stamp will be self-printed by each bao. The district name abbreviations will use the male abbreviations on the National Identification Card.

(2) The household number on the resident registration notification form must clearly indicate the district name abbreviation and bao number, such as: "Pu (2) 98"

(3) Residents listed as migrants in this city on the resident registration notification form refer to those registered in the migration registration book.

### Piercing the Heart with a Single Sword

— Record of the Recovery of Huaiyin Three-Day Huaiyin Express News Special Correspondent Hang Zhou

The reporter stayed at the adjutant's office of the 74th Division on the night of arrival in Huaiyin. Chief of Staff Wei Zhenyue was very happy to hear of the reporter's arrival and met with me late at night, recounting the recovery of Huaiyin with relish. Early the next morning, the reporter met with Division Commander Zhang Lingfu, a tall man with bright eyes and slightly wavy hair, resembling an American. When he talked about the battle, it made the reporter yearn for the midst of gunfire and bullets.

Every soldier of the 74th Division I met gave me an impression of vigor. From the time of General Wang Yaowu, this unit has had a consistent style, which is strict discipline and treating soldiers like their own children. Therefore, in battle, every soldier is willing to die for the purpose of the war, for their superiors, advancing bravely and without hesitation. Because of the strict discipline, when the people in the recovered area recalled the atrocities of the Communist army, they warmly felt: "These are the people who truly came to liberate us!"

The 74th Division is a reorganized division with a total of three brigades: 51st, 57th, and 58th, known as the "Three Fives." Some people also describe them as follows based on the characteristics of these three brigades: the 51st Brigade is as hard as iron, the 57th Brigade is as fiery as fire, and the 58th is as fierce as a lion. Together, they are "Iron Fire Lion"—three loud words! The task of recovering Huaiyin this time was mainly undertaken by the 58th and 51st Brigades, with the 57th Brigade providing cover.

Straight to the Point

The course of this battle has a somewhat legendary meaning.

In late July, the Seventh Army (not yet reorganized) led by Guangxi General Zhong Ji set out from Guzhen, Anhui, and captured the three cities of Lingbi, Sixian, and Wuhe in one go, opening the door to northern Jiangsu. This can be said to be the prelude to the Battle of Huaiyin. Following this, the army pointed directly east, recovered Siyang on September 14, and immediately crossed the Yunhe River and the old Yellow River to attack Zhongxingji. The Communist army deployed heavy troops on the Si-Huai Highway, preparing for a major battle, but unexpectedly, a surprise force suddenly appeared on its left side.

This surprise force was the 74th Division, which followed the Seventh Army after capturing Suqian. The Communist army, which was known for its intelligence, did not detect it. After the Seventh Army successfully crossed the river, the 74th Division suddenly rushed towards Huaiyin from the southeast of Siyang along the old Si-Huai River with amazing speed, like a shooting star in the middle of the night. When the Communist army received the information, panic had already arisen in its reasoning.

The tactic used by the 74th Division was the famous "Piercing the Heart with a Single Sword," or "Straight to the Point." When Xue Yue, the commander of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, summoned Zhang Lingfu, he said: "This tactic is the first time I have used it. You may be surrounded. Although the mission is difficult, success will be doubled." The sharp "sword" of the 74th Division ultimately obtained that "heart."

The Communist Party had pre-annotated its military failures, saying that it could abandon cities and control rural areas when the situation was unfavorable. But for Huaiyin, a city that served as their political, military, and economic center, Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army, issued a death order to defend it. Li Yimang, the chairman of the Su-Wan Border Region Government, stated that he would "live and die with Huaiyin." Therefore, the troops it drew from this area were the main force in northern Jiangsu. It was estimated that there were more than 20 regiments, 30,000 to 40,000 people, including the Second Division, Fourth Division, Sixth Division, Fifth Column, Ninth Column, and a brigade that broke through from the Central Plains.

Overcoming All Difficulties

The National Army felt quite depressed in its forced counterattacks on the northern Jiangsu battlefield because the Communist army, like the Ming Dynasty rebel Li Zicheng they admired, was fleeing everywhere, and it was difficult to find the main force. This time they ran into each other, and it was just right! In the past, the Communist army used its main force in battle, such as the Taixing battle. This was the second time. The battle began on September 14 and entered a fierce stage on the 16th. The first place of fierce fighting was Chenjiaji, where there was a Fuyin River. The National Army overcame the stubborn resistance of the Communist army by forcibly crossing the river in the face of the enemy. After crossing the Fuyin River, the battle moved to the suburbs of Huaiyin.

The 17th and 18th were the decisive battles of the main forces. On the 17th, two assault teams of the National Army overcame all difficulties and rushed into the city, which is why it was once rumored that the city had been captured. However, they soon withdrew due to lack of reinforcements. On the 18th, they tried again and made progress of only one li (approximately 0.5 kilometers). The Communist army relied on its large number of troops and stubbornly refused to retreat. The battle was glued together in blood and flesh. Then, the legendary story I want to tell unfolded.

Yang Jin, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 172nd Regiment of the 58th Brigade, came from the ranks of a private. He had spent 16 years in the army. Repeated military exploits had led him to rise through the ranks. He had recently been promoted to battalion commander and wanted to make a special performance. At 10:30 PM on the evening of the 18th, the climax of the battle had passed. He had a whim and gathered more than 200 soldiers from the entire battalion, announcing a secret plan. Then, the entire battalion lined up and advanced towards the Communist army's position through the gaps. He took a submachine gun and walked in front, with the soldiers following curiously. Everyone's heart was pounding. But they walked very naturally. Approaching the Communist army's sentry line, a sleepy-eyed New Fourth Army soldier asked: "Which unit are you from?"

"The Fourth Division, relieved from the front," Yang Jin casually replied with the Communist army's designation. In the darkness, it was difficult to see faces clearly. The sentry only saw a series of dark shadows passing by. When they arrived at the second sentry post, the sentry asked as usual: "Password?"

Seeing that the first post had been successfully passed, the soldiers were half as bold and shouted at the top of their lungs: "Damn it, what's with all the questions! We've been fighting all day and haven't rested. What password or no password!" The sentry softened, feeling a moment of doubt, but dared not make a sound.

They continued to pass the third, fourth, ... sentry lines. A few bullets flew sideways, hitting several soldiers. The wounded calmed down, gritted their teeth, and never returned fire. - If they returned fire, they would definitely mess things up - They bravely and cleverly mingled through a total of seven sentry lines. The south gate of Huaiyin was already in front of them. They were so excited that their hearts were about to jump out of their mouths.

General Zhang Lingfu, military commander of the recapture of Huaiyin (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou Post)

The Fire of Victory

It was about 4:00 AM, and the sky was not yet bright. They quickly occupied a stronghold near the city and worked there for 40 minutes, preparing to advance to attack or retreat to defend. They were working nervously, but the Communist army still did not notice. A Communist liaison officer stumbled in front of their fortifications in a daze and was captured. Under interrogation, they learned the Communist army's deployment in the city and knew that there were two ammunition depots at the city gate. At this time, Yang Jin received the order: "Be the first to enter the city!" He ordered the deputy battalion commander to lead half of the soldiers to charge. If they occupied the South City, they would set a fire as a signal.

The charging soldiers set off with submachine guns, machine guns, and small cannons. The guards of the city were caught off guard. In the chaotic battle, the soldiers of Yang's battalion rushed into the city and immediately occupied the ammunition depot, using the Communist army's ammunition to bombard the city in all directions. The Communist army could not figure out how many people had come, and their morale was greatly disrupted.

The fire started - this was the fire of victory ignited by the soldiers of Yang's battalion. Then, the sky also brightened. The National Army from all directions outside the city launched a general attack and entered the city one after another. Fierce street battles unfolded in the streets, on the roofs, in the houses, and in every corner. The Communist army used house-to-house tactics, and almost every house and every wall was contested. From the morning of the 19th to noon, the street battle lasted all day and night. The Communist army left corpses everywhere and finally retreated in defeat.

After Huaiyin City, which had been occupied by the Communist army for a year after Japan's surrender, was recovered, there were two superstitious events: First, on the 19th, the apricot tree in the home of Wang Shicheng behind Li Yimang's mansion blossomed. Apricot blossoms bloom in spring, and now they have bloomed a second time. Wang Shicheng said that he had never seen this in his 70 years of life. I specially went to see it once, and I could still see a few remaining flowers. Coincidentally, the Epiphyllum oxypetalum, which had not bloomed for many years in Yeyuan, the guesthouse used by the Communist Party and now the headquarters of the 74th Division, suddenly appeared like the smile of a young girl on the evening of the 21st. After the calamity, the residents of Huaiyin talked about these two events, citing them as the end of their disaster and a sign of prosperity.

A Scene of Night Flight

In this battle, the Communist army attempted to save its declining position with its main force, but the result was a crushing defeat, with most of the main force being routed. In other words, it had lost three-quarters of the capital it had used to cause trouble in northern Jiangsu. Chen Yi went to Wangying Town north of the city to command for two days, but knowing that the situation was hopeless, he secretly slipped away. Li Yimang shouted "Live and die with the city," but staged a "night flight" on the evening of the 17th. Those who suffered were the scapegoats. Chen Yi, out of shame and anger, shot three regimental commanders who had failed in combat.

The National Army rewarded meritorious service. Yang Jin was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel, and all officers and soldiers of the entire battalion were promoted one rank.

The defeated Communist army retreated towards Huai'an and Lianshui. In order to block the pursuit of the National Army, it resorted to extremely inhuman and vicious methods, breaching the Yunhe River dike in four places. The torrents surged south, turning a 200-li area into a swamp. When I arrived in Huaiyin, the streets were still flooded. I went to inspect the breached places, each of which was 50 meters long. But the water, in addition to causing more damage to the common people, could not stop the advance of the National Army, which was rescuing the people from the water and fire. While the National Army was trying to block the breaches, it detoured and pursued the enemy. The 57th Brigade entered Huai'an on the evening of the 21st, clearing out the Communist army and recovering the city.

In addition to the engineers, local people also participated in the breach-blocking and dike-restoration project. Wang Shuming, a 79-year-old man who was familiar with this work, was invited by the local people to guide and supervise the work. By September 29, all four breaches had been blocked. Now the water is slowly receding, but the hatred left by the Communist army has no way to disappear from the hearts of the people!

### Clearing the Countryside and Recovery

— Baoding News, September 12 Our Special Reporter Yang Bingsen

Hebei Province has suddenly shown a new face this month, that is, the smooth development of the province's work of clearing the countryside. Since the beginning of the month, it was first launched in the eastern part of Hebei and Pingdong. In a short period of ten days, it has achieved significant results, but this has further increased the burden on the province's administrative capacity. The Hebei Provincial Government and all units are making every effort to explore all measures related to development. At the same time, with the expansion of the recovered areas, various difficulties have arisen. Therefore, the reporter will report to the readers the details of Hebei's countryside clearing work and the various new measures taken after the recovery.

The Provincial Government's Predicament Before Clearing the Countryside First, let's take a look at the current financial situation in Hebei Province. This year, the province's expenses approved by the Central Government are 5.2 billion yuan. By the end of June, 6.2 billion yuan had already been spent, exceeding the planned expenses for the whole year by 1 billion yuan. The Central Government allocated 700 million yuan in July and 1.2 billion yuan in August, but nothing has been settled in September. The entire financial source has no way to open, and there is no way to reduce expenditure. It can be said that it has reached the end of the road. This is the situation of the entire financial situation of Hebei Province. Let's take another look at the collection of field tax and in-kind, which is closely related to finance. It is expected that the possible collection this year will be 84 million catties. However, because wheat is generally infected with jaundice in central and southern Hebei, coupled with floods, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, the wheat production this year is not high. As of now, more than 6 million catties have been collected. If all 132 counties in the province can be recovered, it is estimated that 1.1 billion catties can be collected, which is a huge difference. The biggest reason for these two items is undoubtedly entirely related to security. Before the launch of the countryside clearing work, only 42 counties in the province had been recovered, less than one-third of the total number of counties in the province. Among them, there was not a single complete county, and only 14 counties had established governance in the county towns. Therefore, all administrative functions could not be implemented, and of course, there was no source of finance. All administrative expenditures still had to be handled, resulting in the entire provincial administration being in a difficult situation, and administrative efficiency also became a "drag."

The Smooth Development of Clearing the Countryside Since the launch of the countryside clearing work in Hebei Province, the implementation has been extremely smooth. Up to now, 11 counties in the eastern part of Hebei and Pingdong have been recovered one after another, including Leting, Yutian, Lulong, Zunhua, Xinglong, Baodi, Sanhe, Xianghe, Jixian, Qian'an, and Pinggu, and two counties in central Hebei, Rongcheng, and southern Hebei, Zhaoxian. At the same time, the Baoding area and the Shijiazhuang area also followed the mobilization in northern Hebei, and the security circle is expanding day by day. Although it has only been more than ten days, the provincial government's administration has controlled 60 counties, and the development of Hebei Province's administration is highly anticipated.

The administrative work in coordination with the military development has also been handled very appropriately by the provincial authorities. Military and administrative coordination is promoted as a whole. After a county town is recovered, the county magistrate immediately sets up the county government sign and implements appeasement and training work. Even the township and baojia chiefs of each county are designated in advance and advance with the army. When they arrive in their respective county borders, they take charge of village administration. At the same time, the home returning teams of each county are all enthusiastic and desperately assisting administrative rehabilitation. Sun Zhenbang, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial Government, also rushed to the front line to supervise the launch of political work.

In order to take into account the entire rehabilitation work, the provincial government also ordered all county magistrates in the province to enter the county and assist refugees in returning home. It also held an administrative commissioner conference to discuss urgent administrative measures during the rehabilitation period and stipulated the allocation of 2.5 million yuan in rehabilitation funds for first- and second-class counties and 2 million yuan for third-class counties.

The Most Important Work is Relief for Refugees

First, let's take a look at the current disaster situation and relief work in Hebei. A total of 25 counties in Hebei Province suffered from floods this year, with 1.2 million victims. There are also 263,000 refugees, 35,558 home returning teams, 112,000 victims of wind, hail, and drought disasters, 33,000 young people out of school, 57,400 unemployed people, and 28,500 extremely poor people. The relief sub-office surveyed 313,000 people. In the newly recovered 11 counties in eastern Hebei, it is estimated that there may be at least 110,000 new refugees. Calculating the 79 counties that have not yet been recovered, there are approximately 790,000 refugees (statistics from the Hebei Provincial Social Affairs Department). From this figure, it can be seen that if all the provinces are recovered, it can add 900,000 refugees. Therefore, this winter, the entire province is expected to have more than 2.8 million refugees of all types waiting for relief.

Let's take another look at the current relief work in Hebei Province. This year, the Central Government allocated 8,000 tons of relief grain and 10 million yuan in relief funds to the province. The province raised 30 million yuan, of which 20 million yuan was allocated for accommodating refugees and handling earthquake relief in Changli and other counties. As for the grain paid by the Central Government, because it was stored in warehouses taken over from the enemy and puppet regimes, half of it was actually moldy and rotten, and half of it was usable. As of now, the relief work handled with the above grain and relief funds has included providing relief to 264,432 people, including those who were struggled against by the Communist army, refugees, home returning teams, volunteer strong men's teams, out-of-school and unemployed youth, and general refugees. Currently, only 600 tons of miscellaneous grains remain. Using this number to provide relief to more than 2.8 million refugees is a drop in the bucket, with a huge difference.

The relief work for the 900,000 refugees who may be generated after the recovery has become a serious and urgent current problem, and it is also the most important work of clearing the countryside and recovering. Therefore, the provincial government decided to request the following minimum relief figures from the central ministries and commissions and the Four Joint Offices, including emergency agricultural loans of 2.88 billion yuan for rural revival, ordinary agricultural loans of 7.2354 billion yuan, and long-term relief funds of 28.5 billion yuan, totaling 30.9654 billion yuan. Sun Lianzhong, Chairman of Hebei, also sent Qu Linghan, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, along with four refugee representatives from various regions to Beijing at the beginning of next month to petition. Everyone in the area controlled by the Communist Party knows that they have implemented a policy of struggle and liquidation. Some of the people's land has been distributed, and some has been forced to sell. Once it is recovered, disputes over small land plots will inevitably arise. In order to take this into account, the provincial government specially formulated the main points for handling land in the recovered areas, the content of which is: (1) Restore the ownership of the original landlords, and the right to use the land will still be temporarily in the hands of the people who are cultivating it. (2) For land sold under pressure, the original landlord may submit proof to request the administrative agency to assess the price and recover the ownership of the land, and the right to use the land will still be temporarily in the hands of the people who are currently cultivating it. . In addition to restoring ownership, the land of self-cultivating farmers that has been illegally distributed or sold will be given priority in restoring the right to use it. (4) The administrative authorities stipulate the maximum and minimum amount of all land and land used by self-cultivating farmers. (5) The administrative agencies stipulate that the land rent standard should be below 37.5%.

In addition, the provincial government plans to establish land administration review committees in various counties and cities in the near future to thoroughly reorganize land registration and land rights work, so as to fully resolve land-related matters.

### General Li Tianxia's Demeanor

At a certain banquet, this reporter had the first opportunity to meet General Li Tianxia, commander of the 83rd Division, formerly the commander of the 100th Army before the reorganization.

His refined diction, humble attitude, and a democratic, artistic demeanor left a deep impression on this reporter.

The division commander is from Baoshan County, Jiangsu, and speaks a Pudong dialect, slightly tinged with a northern accent. He is not particularly tall, but he exudes a youthful vigor and the spirit of a veteran fighter. At the same time, due to his hometown being by the sea and the river, he possesses a passionate and aspiring heart.

From the division commander's conversation, we learned that his talents and hobbies are multifaceted. When we visited the division headquarters daily to gather war news, we often heard a quiet melody drifting in the wind; that was the division commander taking a stroll with his soul. It is said that his favorite song is "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty." As far as this reporter knows, the division's band is equipped with unparalleled completeness and talent compared to any other unit. They not only play music but also compose it. The "Holy War March" and "Victory Fantasia" that this reporter had heard in the past were their creations commemorating the great victory in Western Hunan.

In the past, the division commander often wrote plays, but recently, due to military affairs, he no longer indulges in this pursuit. However, he still actively promotes it. Regarding the "Wedding March" recently performed by the division's political department at the Tai County military-civilian gala, regardless of the scenery, lighting, or acting, it was perfect and extremely skillful. The division commander himself also said, "The performance this time might not be considered particularly brilliant due to the hasty preparations; however, I believe that even as it is, it is a groundbreaking endeavor in northern Jiangsu." This public performance lasted for five consecutive days, and the division commander personally attended every performance until the end. This fact demonstrates how much the division commander loves art and how he leads people to pursue new aspirations!

The division commander's talent extends to his eloquence. At every gathering, it never feels complete without his speech. Once the division commander participates in an assembly, people's attention naturally focuses on the platform, listening to his uninterrupted eloquence. It adds endless vitality to the venue. Not only is it true of his speeches, but in ordinary interactions or conversations, the division commander's vocabulary towards others is always so warm and frank. Based on this alone, he firmly grasps the hearts of his tens of thousands of subordinates, inspiring them to sacrifice for the country and for him, to fight and win battles.

His attitude towards his subordinates is completely democratic, without the slightest pretense of being a "division commander" or a "lieutenant general." After finishing his work, he often drives a Jeep himself to inspect and observe the lives of each of his subordinates. There is a specially established Sun Yat-sen Club in the division headquarters, which is a spiritual resting place for every comrade in the 83rd Division and a place where their lives are entrusted. Here, there is all kinds of noble entertainment, such as movies, musical instruments, chess, and ball games. The division commander and soldiers play together here. He once told the soldiers: "When entertaining, if I arrive, you don't have to stand up or salute. If you want to express your welcome to my participation, then you can clap your hands." This was told to me by a comrade Zhang from the political department with excitement and pride. He also said, "Our division commander's American style is really something."

The division commander is a soldier of the times, constantly advancing with the changes of the times. In his spare time, reading books and newspapers is his only homework. For example, he almost always reads every piece of reporting on northern Jiangsu disclosed in the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai. In the evening, you might see his footprints in the branch offices along Zhongshan Road in Tai County, where he lingers in front of the glass windows, seeking his spiritual nourishment. Because his memory is particularly strong, he reads very quickly. It is said that once, when his wife was surprised that he had read several books in one night, he calmly and methodically summarized the contents of the books. One day, a certain person from the military law department of the division headquarters joked to the reporters: "In front of our division commander, we would never dare to cheat, no matter what. Because if we report a very long number with a slight error twice, the division commander will immediately point it out to us. Do you think we would still talk about cheating?" The division commander has a great interest in economics. He often says: "Everything in the world is completely built on numbers." Perhaps this is the reason for his excellent memory today.

He cares about every one of his subordinates, and he also cares about the youth and students in society. When Weishui Bridge Elementary School in Tai County was restored after the war, because the school building was destroyed by the puppet army and was unusable, a variety show was launched to raise money for repairs. At this time, in addition to providing spiritual support, the division commander also had his beloved band participate in the performance. He also provided assistance from other aspects.

In May and June, the elementary school teachers in Tai County went on strike because their treatment was meager and insufficient to live on. The division commander also joined forces with all walks of life to launch a campaign to respect teachers, making various plans, working hard, and finally completing the matter with great perseverance and enthusiasm, so that the music of Tai County would not be interrupted.

Even recently, the division commander has made great efforts to appeal to relevant parties regarding the matter of establishing a provincial secondary school in Tai County. In addition, regarding the training of refugee youths, the division commander always handles and sponsors it with a compassionate heart.

The division commander is a former subordinate of General Wang Yaowu. He is only forty years old this year, and he is considered a young man among the generals. Because he is young, he has courage and determination. In the fierce battles in Western Hunan and Northern Hunan, he revealed a new spirit, inflicting unprecedented blows on the enemy and supporting the entire battle situation. After the end of the war, in the statistics of the military commission's issued military merit certificates, out of a total of 107, the troops he led obtained 14, including the very first one (No. 1) and the last one (No. 107). After the victory, he led the brave soldiers of the 100th Army to cross the river to maintain stability. He dispersed the armed forces of the puppet army with swift skill and smoothly completed the work of accepting surrender and sending away prisoners. Just as he was preparing to advance, the cease-fire order was suddenly issued, and the planned plan could not be carried out. Afterwards, when talking about this matter, he always had a feeling of regret. He has always been optimistic about the battle situation in northern Jiangsu. He once said boldly: "The national army is not unwilling to fight the Communist Party, but to maintain the vitality of the entire Chinese nation. If we want to fight, I dare say that the 100th Army can be stationed in Huaiyin and Nian in four hours." Later, facts finally proved the accuracy of this statement.

In July, the Communist army frantically launched an offensive in northern Jiangsu. They thought that the national army's slow advancement in compliance with the government's consistent intention to be tolerant for the sake of the country was a sign of weakness. They wanted to test what kind of army the 100th Army really was. The Battle of Taixing told the Communist Party, which believed in force first, that the brilliant victories on the banks of the Xiang River and the Xuefeng Mountains were not accidental. At the same time, on the other hand, it strengthened the conviction of the people of Tai County: "With our Division Commander Li and the 100th Army (to this day, the people of Tai County still habitually call them that), we are not afraid."

Due to strategic reasons, in mid-August, the news came that the 83rd Division would be transferred to southern Jiangsu. All sectors of Tai County sent telegrams to plead for them to stay, but it was ineffective. In order to leave a souvenir, one afternoon, all sectors held a farewell party at the Continental Hotel. Before the meal, the division commander told the reporters: "I feel that the current situation is even more complicated than during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance; therefore, our responsibilities are even greater and more arduous than during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. At this time and place, I don't think anyone can steal peace and enjoy themselves. Everyone should recognize their own position and take on their responsibilities." At the dinner, he gave an impromptu speech, "Our division has been stationed in northern Jiangsu for eight months. During this period, we have received a great deal of assistance from all sectors in all aspects. I would like to express my sincere gratitude. However, I am very ashamed that due to the government's repeated tolerance of the Communist Party, we were unable to make a large-scale advance to achieve everyone's wishes, which is a regrettable thing. Now that we are about to leave, I feel a variety of emotions. What we can all feel together is that the feelings between our division and the people of Tai County will never be hindered by the obstruction of the mountains and clouds. We still need to encourage each other and strive to complete our tasks." Talking and laughing freely, drinking to their hearts' content, until the night was late before they dispersed. It seemed that heaven followed people's wishes. The next day, the battle situation suddenly became tense, and the 83rd Division was ordered to remain in its original defense to deal with the sudden change in the situation, so it conveniently left Division Commander Li to the people of Tai County. However, after only a few days, Division Commander Li finally left Tai County and was transferred to Taixing amid a reluctance. Of course, we believe that the distance of dozens of miles cannot dilute the warm feelings between each other. The 1.2 million people of Tai County will eternally remember their Division Commander Li and the 100th Army, and wish him and them success. Look, do the people coming and going on Zhongshan Road not often point to the photo of the chairman and the division commander displayed in the glass window of Datong Bookstore?

When the division commander first arrived in Tai County, he said at the welcome meeting of all sectors: "We are very willing to cooperate with all sectors to work hard for national construction; we are even more willing to accept the guidance and criticism of the 'rural gentlemen' so that our 100th Army will always be an army of the times." Indeed, with the exchange of sympathy and responsibility, the people of Tai County and the 83rd Division have become one in eight months.

"The timing of heaven is not as good as the advantage of the terrain, and the advantage of the terrain is not as good as the harmony of the people." At this epoch-making transformation, and facing this fragmented northern Jiangsu, we expect General Li to further develop his superior talents and use this vibrant and active unit - the 83rd Division - to bring light back to the entire northern Jiangsu.

### New Autumn on the Banks of Poyang Lake

— Wuyuan, September 15th, this newspaper's reporter Yu Ning

Mr. Yu Dafu described the scenery of the Fuchun River extraordinarily beautifully ten years ago. At that time, some people said that he had a kind of local sentimentality at work. Now, if this writer writes this article about Poyang Lake, will someone make such a misunderstanding? In fact, it is not so. However, this writer's hometown is located in the upper reaches of Poyang Lake, adjacent to Fuliang, Leping, and Dexing, all belonging to the fifth administrative region of Jiangxi, so it has a bit of the atmosphere of Poyang Lake. Poyang Lake is one of the five largest lakes in our country. Dongting Lake is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Taihu Lake is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Poyang Lake is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It flows into the Yangtze River from the lake mouth. It is formed by the confluence of the Chang River, the Xin River, and the Po River. From Leping, Fuliang, and Yingtan in the upper reaches to Wucheng, Nanchang, Xingzi, Duchang, and Hukou in the lower reaches, it spans more than 300 miles. Most of the counties along the lake are purely agricultural areas with abundant products. Most of the residents of each village, except for a few who do business, live the lives of farmers. The natural superior environment gives them extremely fertile land, allowing them to cultivate their own fields in peace. The lake water brings them a comfortable and leisurely life, and the calm and mirror-like green autumn scenery naturally sets off a beautiful and magnificent picture. The vast land on the banks of Poyang Lake is widely planted with major native products and miscellaneous grains, such as Dexing's tea, rice, sugarcane, and paper; Leping's rapeseed oil, rice and wheat, broad beans, soybeans, peanuts, indigo, sugar, radishes, ramie, coal; Fuliang's black tea porcelain; Poyang's tobacco leaves, lotus seeds, rice, miscellaneous grains; melon seeds, peanuts; Wannian's rice, indigo; Duchang's rice, tobacco. This year, the early and late rice crops in all the counties along the lake have a 100% harvest. Other products have also been widely harvested, and the prosperous and peaceful years of well-being have finally reached their goal this year. To add icing to the cake, prices are still rising and cannot fall. If we calculate the total value of agricultural production in each county around the lake throughout the year, the magnitude of the material power is already amazing.

Four Major Needs

The farmers on the shores of the lake live by being diligent and hardworking. They support themselves with blood and sweat. They are producers, not consumers. The extravagant atmosphere of urban material civilization has not yet spread to the countryside, and they still maintain a pure and simple style. Their clothes are mostly cotton fabrics. Because cotton is abundant in the lake area, some people have said: The status of cotton production here is not lower than that of kerosene, steel, or rice. From this statement, we can understand the abundance of cotton production here. Therefore, in the rural areas around the lake, women almost all spin cotton as their main job. Every family has two or three hand-cranked spinning wheels made of bamboo strips. They tirelessly spin and weave from morning to night, using their own cotton to make yarn, and then weaving the yarn into cloth. They don't need to buy expensive cloth in cloth shops to wear. They have already solved the problem of clothing. The problem of food is even more substantial than clothing. Such as rice, oil, beans, millet, wheat, wine, vegetables, sugar, tobacco, pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, goose eggs, etc. needed for daily household use, they not only eat as much as they can, but also sell a large surplus every year. The only thing they need to buy from outside is salt. Therefore, there is no need to solve the problem of food. As for housing, although foreign buildings and mansions are rare, there is no shortage of earthen houses, plank houses, bamboo fences, and thatched cottages. Some households are close together, and some are sparsely arranged. The wood for construction is mostly taken from Dexing and Wuyuan counties because there are no trees along the lake. In recent years, new buildings have been built everywhere more vigorously than before the war. Not only are they just to shield from the wind and rain, but also to provide shelter from the elements. In terms of travel, there are cars on land and boats on water. They don't need to miss the four major needs of life, namely food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and they have long put them behind them.

Dawn and fog, dusk and vastness, cattle and sheep lie and walk along the lake, in groups of hundreds and thousands, children and farmers play with calves, vast trees and low sky, this is the scenery that is always available by the lake. The flowers of the moon are sparse, and the red reeds and geese are startled by the cold. The fishing songs on moonlit nights and the cool breeze blowing on the face have already revealed the bleakness of the new autumn. The products of the rural areas by the lake are mostly harvested at this time. Spring bloom and autumn harvest, this is the right time. Let's take a look at the silver lake and the bright moonlight for thousands of miles. Let's listen to the sound of rice threshing by the lake and listen to the fishing songs sent by the lake wind, and the shadows of the sails carrying the blood and sweat of the rural products. Poyang Lake, which is 300 miles wide! You deeply surround countless self-reliant and simple men, loving each other, how can people not envy you?

Huaiyin South Gate was renamed "Lihua Gate" in memory of the 57th Brigade of the 74th Division, which was the first to enter with the number "Lihua". This newspaper's special correspondent (5th from the left) and Brigade Commander Lu Xing (6th from the left) and Battalion Commander Yang Jing (2nd from the right) took a photo for memory. (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou sent) The Guangzhou Municipal Government is committed to rectifying the city appearance.

### Lingnan Municipal Administration

— Guangzhou Air News, 6th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng

Most attentive to. The first move after Mayor Ouyang took office was to prohibit all street vendors from selling, although the fact that vendors could not make a living after being banned was another matter, but at least the streets were much cleaner! Also, in order to rectify the city's appearance, all the refugees left in the city were sent to the suburbs, asking them to return to their hometowns to make a living, so as not to tarnish the city's appearance here. This was originally a good method of "If there is a famine in Henan, move its people to Hedong, and if there is a famine in Hedong, do the same." However, at present, rural areas are bankrupt, and it is not easy for refugees to find food when they return to their hometowns. Therefore, when "both Henan and Hedong are experiencing famine," this method seems to be unworkable. It is said that many refugees sneaked back to Guangzhou on foot after being sent away, probably because they all knew that it was easier to beg for food in the city!

There are approximately a thousand refugees who have not yet been sent away. Autumn is not very severe, and in the Central News Agency's epidemic diary, the burial team only recovers more than a dozen corpses that die on the streets every day; however, after autumn, the refugees will be ragged and sleep on the streets, suffering from hunger and cold. If the authorities are unable to provide relief, the tragic situation is truly unimaginable. The refugees have long issued appeals, pleading with the authorities to find ways to strengthen relief efforts. However, the reply from the relief authorities is the officialdom's polite phrase of "allowance for consideration." Therefore, in the past few days, more than a dozen refugees have petitioned, even angrily removing the signboard of the Guangzhou District Working Team of the Good Rescue Branch. More than a thousand overseas Chinese waiting for ships to leave the country are also roaring, and a large number of unemployed officers are also without food and clothing, running around and calling for help, requesting that they be taken in. These events are enough to show a glimpse of social unrest!

However, Guangzhou also has its "prosperous" side. If you walk to the Bund and Hanmin Road, the neon lights of those "so-and-so large restaurants" will shine so brightly that you will feel dizzy; the charming and attentive attitude of the charming waitresses in the restaurants will make you lose your mind; many dignitaries, wealthy merchants, and young masters are bowing to them under their skirts, spending hundreds of thousands of gold, and will not be stingy at all; and in a certain two major restaurants in Xiguan, there are even so-called singing girls serving wine, which is an even more beautiful scene, and there is no end to it. If you are in the Xihakou area of the Bund, there are also many "smuggling" Guangzhou girls, who gather in groups of three or five on the streets and throw flirtatious glances at you. If you are interested, they will take you to their "base"—a hotel—and you can indulge yourself for only ten to twenty thousand yuan; also, the "flower boat" on the East Bund is also a world of its own; although prostitution is prohibited in Guangzhou, some people estimate that there are more than 20,000 women in the city who are engaged in the flesh trade, which is probably another social problem!

Due to these various phenomena of social unrest, newspaper reporters often report on social news, which often involves municipal measures, thus arousing the dissatisfaction of the municipal authorities with newspaper reporters. The municipal government initially wanted to control the news and strictly prohibit various units from releasing information, which aroused the resentment of reporters throughout the city. As a result, few people attended Mayor Ouyang's reception for reporters, and things only calmed down after several explanations. However, the newspaper reporters just happened to be "unwilling to accept favors" and have recently continued to report or criticize the weaknesses of the municipal administration, which made the authorities have to show them some color! Therefore, recently, one daily newspaper and one evening newspaper were fined for simultaneously reprinting an article from the supplement of the Nanjing Xinmin Daily, and were ordered to stop publication for one day. There was also a small daily newspaper that was ordered to stop publication, allegedly because it published a piece of news exposing corruption, which angered the authorities and was used as a reason to stop its publication. In fact, the municipal authorities, of course, also have many difficulties; regarding the difficulties of municipal implementation, Mayor Ouyang has reported very thoroughly at the provincial administrative meeting. The most important thing, of course, is the lack of funding. He also talked about the situation of municipal construction before the war and the situation of destruction after the war, and the last sentence was also because of the lack of funding; he specifically pointed out that the central government only subsidized 50 million yuan in reconstruction funds twice, which was not enough to repair the roads alone, and it was even more impossible to talk about other things! Therefore, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Although the municipal government's tax revenue is increasing every month, it was more than 50 million yuan in August and more than 69 million yuan in September, an increase of more than 10 million yuan, but it is feared that apart from being able to improve the treatment of municipal government officials in the past few months, there will be little left for other construction projects!

In the recovery of Huaiyin and other countries, the transportation of the national army relied mainly on ox carts, except for a few artisanal tools. (Photo by Central News Agency)

If everyone in the world was like Li Lianying and Li Jie'er, what kind of world would this be?

### The Story of "Man and Mouse"

— Hu Tian

Xia Zhibing, Ying Shijie, and Ji Ruolan were classmates. Xia Zhibing was deeply in love with his cousin, Ruolan. However, Ruolan married Shijie. From then on, Zhibing fought against the Japanese in the Northeast. Shijie, relying on his business acumen, became one of the high-society Chinese celebrities in Shanghai's foreign concessions, while Ruolan led a fulfilling life as a virtuous wife and loving mother.

When the "1931" War of Resistance began, Zhibing suddenly came to Shijie's house. He urged Shijie to donate his wealth to the war effort and also persuaded him to move his factory in the Shanghai concessions to the interior, to strengthen the rear's production capacity. However, Shijie did not accept Zhibing's advice and secretly went to Hong Kong to live a life of leisure. Zhibing felt extremely disappointed in Shijie's cowardice and greed. However, he also met a group of passionate friends, who were representatives of the workers who came to petition.

In December of that year, the National Revolutionary Army in Shanghai retreated westward, and the concessions became isolated islands. Zhibing and his comrades, who had shared hardships, lived in seclusion in the home of A'Fa in the slum area of western Shanghai, continuing their underground work.

Shijie and Ruolan returned from Hong Kong. Ruolan found out Zhibing's address and came to visit him in this humble abode. When she saw the impoverished lives of Zhibing and his friends, she did not understand what force was sustaining their spirits. Lao Zhang, together with the intellectual youth Xiao Lu, felt indignant about the major demonstration the enemy was planning on Nanjing Road. After discussing it, they secretly each took a grenade and left.

Shijie was preparing to resume production at his factory. A'Fa was not satisfied with merely resolving his own unemployment problem. He wanted to persuade Shijie again to move the factory to the interior via Hong Kong. This request was still rejected. Furthermore, due to differing views on the War of Resistance, A'Fa exposed Shijie's secret dealings of supplying the enemy with hemp sacks. Ruolan felt very hurt because of this, as she also began to realize Shijie's contemptibility.

A'Long came and witnessed the scene of Lao Zhang throwing a grenade at the enemy at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yinhua Street, sacrificing himself for his country. Everyone mourned Lao Zhang. Xiao Lu also returned, admitting that he had become cowardly at the critical moment, causing Lao Zhang to bravely sacrifice himself. Everyone thought that Xiao Lu was the youngest, had not succeeded in his studies, and had not mastered swordsmanship, so it would be better for him to go to the rear for further education. So, everyone gathered their last bit of money to give him travel expenses to go to the interior via Hong Kong.

The Mickey Mouse Ballroom was a gathering place for Shanghai's nouveau riche and social climbers. That night, Zhibing also became a guest. This was also a place where Shijie and Ruolan often came, so Zhibing also met them there. A'Liang, a worker who had sold his soul, now appeared as a nouveau riche. The time that Zhibing and A'Fa had planned to eliminate A'Liang was approaching, but they also had to deal with Ruolan's conversation. When the ballroom reached the point of performing a special Conga dance, all the lights in the ballroom suddenly went out, and gunshots rang out. In the chaos, Ruolan saw A'Fa calmly leaving the ballroom. Zhibing watched A'Fa leave and then deeply breathed a sigh of relief, secretly instructing Ruolan not to make a scene. From then on, Ruolan fully understood Zhibing's work, but she was also worried about Shijie's reckless behavior. Shijie had a conflict of interest with a major traitor, and that traitor threatened to harm him. So, he wanted to go to Hong Kong to temporarily avoid the danger, but the traitor's persecution did not let up on Shijie. As soon as Shijie's car left the gate, he died in a hail of gunfire.

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Xiao Lu, whose will was not firm, constantly wavered between man and mouse, and finally, under the lure of great profit, he betrayed Zhibing. Zhibing and A'Fa were arrested at the same time but in different locations. Xiao Lu also did not escape the enemy's clutches and was killed by the enemy. At the same time, following a check as a clue, Ruolan was also arrested one night. The enemy wanted to use her to soften Zhibing and gave them both a chance to talk alone. Zhibing and Ruolan knew his tricks, so they took advantage of this opportunity to talk about their own affairs. Due to the retelling of past events, Ruolan revealed the secret in Zhibing's heart. The feelings that he had suppressed for so many years, he had always played the role of Cyrano in love. Dawn broke! They faced the morning sun, following A'Fa's bloody footprints, sacrificing their lives to fulfill their responsibility as human beings.

### Regarding the Dare-to-Die Commando

— A Screenwriter's Thoughts, Kou Jiabi

In recent days, many friends have asked me to write something about "Dare-to-Die Commando." Director Tang Xiaodan also wants to make a big splash. This has evoked many memories—

In July of the thirty-third year [1944], the China Film Studio used the Lend-Lease Act to obtain a large batch of materials from the United States. Due to the inconvenience of international transportation, it took nearly three years on the road. If the material was not used immediately, all the film would be destroyed. At that time, Director Xiaodan brought a short text of several hundred words, which was neither an outline nor a story. It could only be said to be an incomplete idea, and he wanted me to turn it into a complete film script of more than one hundred pages.

Writing a film script is not like writing poetry, novels, or plays, because it is not only purely literary but also closely related to modern science. One must be familiar with mechanical and filming techniques to write a script that is applicable. I myself am a layman when it comes to film and really dare not accept. After Director Xiaodan's repeated persuasion and encouragement, I reluctantly made a bold attempt.

I felt enormous difficulty in handling this subject matter. The person in charge specified that the theme of the film was to praise the protagonist, Zhou Mengli, as a modern new policeman whose true spirit was to serve the people, the police being the nanny of the people. But the public's impression of the police was that they only knew how to cause trouble, extort money, and bully the common people, being ruthless wolves. If this was filmed, the audience would not enter the theater and it would only be shown to ourselves.

At that time, the country was resisting the war, society was progressing, and the system was reforming. So, we could use the differences between the new and old police, what the new police's spirit of service was, and what the bad habits of the old police were, to make the public understand the duties of the police as the theme of the film. Why not try it?

In the sweltering summer, sitting in a small room, I rushed day and night. In half a month, the first draft of the scene division was completed. Director Xiaodan took it to the Central Police Academy and several experts to study. The result was that the shortcomings of the old police were not allowed to be exposed, so as not to cause disputes. However, without Qin Hui's treachery, how can Yue Fei's loyalty be shown! At that time, I could not get out of the job, and I felt great pain in my spirit. But there were many people who thought this was a good stepping stone to promotion and wealth, like a group of stinky flies, pulling out many unnecessary personnel matters.

Every play must have its dramatic quality; otherwise, it cannot become a play. The main scene of "Ode to the Police Soul" was in an irrefutable joint trial, which was the entire "climax." It was what I spent the most effort writing, what the director wanted to film, what the actors wanted to act, and what the audience wanted to see. Just as we were filming here, the film ran out.

At that time, because of the obstruction of international transportation, there was a shortage of film. The studio limited each film to 18,000 feet. The first part of the police academy that is now showing was not written by me; it was the director's introduction. Because there was too much foreshadowing in the front, it affected the lack of film in the back. In order to complete the work, the director deleted most of the main scene and moved the climax to the back, a full-scale fight to destroy enemy spies. This diluted the original theme. In addition, with all the scars, I am truly afraid to take credit for it still being praised by people in society now!

"Ode to the Police Soul" is the school song of the Central Police Academy and was designated by Dean Li Shizhen as the title of the film. Although not exactly appropriate, it is still in line with the film. When it was shown in Chongqing, it was extremely popular, running for 28 consecutive days, breaking all film records. This time, it is being shown in "Hu Guang" and renamed "Dare-to-Die Commando." I don't know who made the decision on their own and did not seek the author's consent. I don't know what the difference is between Chongqing and Shanghai. If it is for ticket sales, it is better to change it to "Spring Palace Erotic History."

Everyone knows that the completion of a film is not a personal matter but requires the cooperation of most people. The completion of "Ode to the Police Soul" took 15 months. During this long period, all the staff endured hardships, suffered hunger, and tasted all the bitterness. But today, all the advertisements and posters, large and small, do not list the names of anyone except for Director Tang Xiaodan, who printed his name in special type. Even the author is not included. "China Production" is a national cultural institution, and its productions are to promote social education, not to create a special social status for one or two people. In indignation, everyone went to question Peng Jieren, the person in charge of distribution at the "China Production" Shanghai office, only to find out that the manuscript originated from the director himself. This kind of personal egoism of "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones wither" is quite disappointing.

### Walt Disney's New Offering: A New Film Combining Live Action and Cartoons, "Song of the South"

### New Film Reviews This Week

— Ma Boling

Spy Ring Commando

An old story unfolds through a new form, at an extremely tense tempo. It has small scenes similar to "Upper Salsblinga," but "Spy Ring Commando" is more somber. It focuses on the lives and deaths of intelligence agents, with romantic love being just a subplot. The overall result is unexpectedly excellent. Director Irwin Penzel's technique is simple and delicate, gripping at every turn, and vigorous. His efforts are evident, and there are many unique creations. The small story at the beginning immediately gives people a complete surprise. The introduction of various new weapons and intelligence personnel training procedures is not at all verbose or redundant and can be said to be a few clever gimmicks. In the scene of the murder in the Barna telegraph room and Ellen's disappearance, Irwin Penzel cleverly avoided direct depiction but strengthened the power from the side. In Barna's courtship of the female telegraph operator and Martin's refusal to continue working, his intention is to add a bit of human touch, like "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." The ending scene is very vivid and full of tragic grandeur. It can perhaps be said that Irwin has made great progress. In the 1944 film "Enchantment," his technique was flat and chaotic, but in 1945, "Along Came Jones" made him highly praised. Compared with "Along Came Jones," "Spy Ring Commando" has several times more complex plot, so it is, in other words, a more successful film.

The dubbing is amazing, the photography is fresh, the editing is smooth, and in terms of actors, Alan Ladd is much more outstanding than in "Enchantment." He and Loretta Young have equally lovely performances. Leah Baird is as clear as ever, and her eyes still look so far and firm.

Desert Song

A romantic title, the content is an overly romantic theme. I don't like this kind of excessive exaggeration, and I also hate this kind of megalomaniac American hero and beauty. If the story of "Desert Song" did not have the wildness of the grasslands like the French film "Les Fils de la Nuit," it should at least have the beautiful dreams like "Ugetsu," so as not to waste the colorful and dazzling flat sands. Why must it be changed to anti-Nazi? Why not use the theme of "The Steppe Story" from Gorky's "Russian Fairy Tales"! I always remember the beautiful scenes of Raymond Novarro and Lola Lane, America's screen sweetheart at the time, co-starring in the "Desert Song." The director has his merits. The hotel dance scene and the cavalry's all-out attack scene, along with that Arabic war song, should have the same aftertaste, but that is all.

Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio

A bundle of bizarre paintings unfolds, a murderous magic mirror, a puppet haunted by ghosts, a demon in an ancient castle, a portentous dream, eerie and terrifying, similar to "New York Stories," with less smooth connection, but with separate, complete, and beautiful stories. It is in the withered autumn afternoon that a few cups of tea bring out the realm, the horror that everyone imagines when sitting by the autumn lamp in the evening. The painting scroll is folded up, it is a nightmare, but the forest-lined road on the weekend enters the dream road again. It is precisely the beginning of another bizarre and mysterious painting scroll, and the changing imagination below is left to you.

### Explanation of Renaming — Tang Xiaodan

My humble work "Dare-to-Die Commando," originally titled "Ode to the Police Soul," was completed in the rear filming location, which was full of air raid alarms, constant power outages, and outdated equipment, over a leisurely period of one year. All the staff, in a state of barely being able to eat and not starving to death, tightened their belts and worked hard for the public good. It was because of their loyalty to the arts that this film was worth watching. On New Year's Day this year, the film premiered at the only large theater in the capital city, Chongqing, and it was extremely popular, running for more than 120 screenings. This can be considered a bit of spiritual comfort to us amidst our hardships.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, many films returned to the capital one after another, and everyone scrambled to show them in this city. "Dare-to-Die Commando" was completed after the victory, so it was late in coming. With the success of the Chongqing box office, we thought that there was no need to rename the film at all because most of the returnees knew the film's name, or at least they could enthusiastically recommend it to their friends and relatives. But things turned out to be beyond our expectations. Apart from a few friends in the cultural field, the rest of the citizens did not know about this film. So, the theater owners all advocated that we change the film's name; otherwise, it would be impossible to attract audiences. So, we were subdued by the "Shanghai-style" approach!

The name "Dare-to-Die Commando" is very popular. It was changed for us by Manager Shi of the Shanghai Hu Guang Theater after watching the film. He has decades of film screening experience and deeply understands the psychology of Shanghai audiences. With such a confident vision, if we say that American films should be based on the opinions of showmen as a reference for production, then the change of "Ode to the Police Soul" to "Dare-to-Die Commando" is a first test. Anyway, the American film "Random Harvest" also needs to be changed to "Waterloo Bridge" to suit the tastes of Shanghai audiences. Why can't our "Ode to the Police Soul" also be changed to "Dare-to-Die Commando"? I am only afraid that if the film is not good, changing to a new name to deceive people would be damaging to virtue!

As expected, "Dare-to-Die Commando" has been showing in Hu Guang with a popular image and has been full every time. Afterwards, many Chinese-style American film titles were found in the newspaper film advertising columns, such as "Spy Ring Dare-to-Die Commando" and "Guerrilla Dare-to-Die Commando," all using the words "Dare-to-Die" as a slogan. So, I am even more suspicious. Do theater owners like "Dare-to-Die" so much? Or are our dear audiences particularly interested in "Dare-to-Die"?

However, ours is not a foreign "Dare-to-Die Commando" but an authentic domestic "Dare-to-Die" after all!

### Shifting the Base of Spoken Drama

— Mo Jin

Shanghai's spoken drama theaters are only concentrated in the old French Concession area. For Hongkou, western Shanghai, Nanshi, and other areas, even if there are theaters, no spoken drama troupes are willing to perform in those places. Of course, the troupes themselves have many difficulties. For example, the theaters there are not suitable for performing spoken drama, and the number of audience members is small, which affects the number of performances. At the same time, it also affects business income. From the troupe's point of view, of course, we hope that they can perform more in areas with more audiences because this can prevent the troupe from suffering losses in business and extend the troupe's lifespan, which means that the life of spoken drama will be more lasting! However, from the audience's point of view, the troupe should perform near their environment for their sake so that they can all appreciate this higher-artistic-level spoken drama and guide them into the theater. This can also be said to be the responsibility of theater workers. From a third-party standpoint, Shanghai is, after all, a big city, and five or six million citizens are scattered in every corner of Shanghai. Those audiences far from the theater have no choice but to painfully sacrifice their appreciation of art because of the time and transportation costs! If we specifically want the troupe to rehearse a play to perform in Hongkou or western Shanghai and Nanshi, we dare not say that business is guaranteed. But moving a play that has already been performed to those places to perform for ten or eight days should be a win-win solution, right?

Although the "Audience Performance Company" is a newly established troupe, they have a great purpose and a sincere attitude that all theater workers should have! That is, everything is for the audience! We hope that all troupes have such a purpose: do not deceive the audience, do not deceive art, and do not deceive yourself! Based on their own artistic conscience, introduce the true art and full talent to the audience! On this point, the "Audience Performance Company" has undoubtedly already done it. Because the artistic workers who participated in the "Audience Performance Company" have been recognized for their attitude in several performances in the rear and in Shanghai!

For this reason, we can only hope that the "Audience Performance Company" initiates and leads this pioneering work: after each performance of a play, they can move it to other areas for performances again so that those audiences who do not have the opportunity to appreciate art can also see this complete and serious dramatic art!

We hope that the "Audience Performance Company" will start with "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"! Move into theaters in other areas to perform and see the business situation and the number of audience members in those areas!

### Happiness Island

— Fan Quan

(1) Jinshan

I was born in Lüxiang Town, Jinshan County, but I couldn't find a single mountain to visit in Jinshan County. When I was a child, I often imagined: What kind of sublime monster is a mountain? Perhaps the peak of the mountain can directly reach the sky because there are clouds in the sky, and the peak of the mountain is covered with clouds. From the clouds, I also thought of the stories of immortals riding the clouds and fog. I saw many immortals walking in the clouds in the popular comic strips. They did not expend any effort and could sit on the clouds, reaching Shanghai in an instant and flying to America in another. I thought, if there were mountains in Jinshan County, how proud I would be of myself! I might not hesitate to endure hardships and use all my strength to climb from the foot of the mountain to the top. So, I would catch the clouds on the top of the mountain and let my feet step on them, standing on the white clouds. Then I would blow a breath and push the clouds away from the top of the mountain, drifting aimlessly, drifting, drifting all the way to the beautiful place I longed for in my heart. I thought, why did humans have to invent airplanes? Airplanes can only carry a limited number of people, but the mountain—that mountain walking into the cloud ship—can carry countless people, and the vastness of the clouds is boundless. It can carry all of humanity, regardless of race or social status, drifting freely, drifting, drifting all the way to the place where humans want to go.

If humanity has an ideal Happiness Island, the clouds can drift to that Happiness Island according to your will, without limiting the number of people or social rank—it is a savior who saves all living beings.

How much I longed to have a golden, magnificent mountain!

(2) Blue Sea

When I was fourteen years old, I left my mother and came alone to study in the Jinshan County Middle School in Zhujing Town. At that time, I often missed home. Because of homesickness, a feeling of melancholy pierced my heart. I became lonely from melancholy and often quietly wandered on the grass of the playground. So, again and again, I used my arms as pillows and lay face up in the open field. The evening field seemed so quiet. Two or three crows划过过过through the azure sky, and a desolate long cry added to the infinite desolation of the field. But I loved that kind of emptiness and desolation. I lay there freely, looking up at the distant horizon, which made me feel the infinite enthusiasm of life. Yes, when I raised my eyes and saw the beautiful clouds, I thought of the beauty of life and the burning desire.

I opened my eyes wide, round, and passed through the vast sky. I saw the azure sky. The rosy sunset glow, like stars scattered everywhere in the azure sky. The azure sky seemed like a vast sea, and the rosy sunset glow seemed like islands scattered in the azure ocean. "Sea," I said in my heart, "What a vast distance the sea should have! I cannot measure it with a ruler, and I cannot see it with my eyes, but the sea, it connects the ends of the earth on one side and the corners of the earth on the other. It may be a boundless and bottomless Taijitu!"

I stared blankly at the sky and the sea, at the colorful sunset glow, as if I were in the sea. I saw all kinds of strange animals in the sea. I heard the roar of the tide and the cries of the seagulls, but it seemed to be gathered together, becoming a kind of musical rhythm. My lonely heart began to stir. I felt like I was happily wading in the sea. I was breaking through the waves, using all my strength to move forward bravely on the azure waves of the sea. What was I busy for in the azure sea? What was I groping for in the empty waves?

"Looking for Happiness Island!"

I answered like this.

The rhythm of music led me, and I did not hesitate to endure hardships and wade forward. Only in such wading did I not feel lonely in my heart. It seemed like thousands of people were following me. They enthusiastically encouraged me, guided me, and told me about the road to Happiness Island. "Yes, Happiness Island, that is not the happiness of one person, it is the Happiness Island of thousands of people! It is the Happiness Island of all mankind!" I finally suddenly realized.

So, I felt supreme joy.

### Dreams of Black and White

— Song Mengqin

Because of an experience in a night dream, my spirit is in a daze all day long.

What do you mean?

When you hurriedly brought two cloaks of black and white, insisting that I choose one, I was truly at a loss. You raised a black one and handed it to me, making me even more hesitant. In that moment of indecision, you switched to the white cloak and put it on me, then hurriedly left again.

Even now, I still feel unhappy.

Yesterday, I asked you, "Why didn't you wait for me to decide and just leave the white one behind and run off?" You laughed and said, "Still so childish! Isn't it just a dream? Is it worth pondering for so long? If you didn't accept the black one I offered, naturally I'd give you the white one."

Friend, your answer is so lighthearted! But it also shows that you haven't thought deeply. Friend, my contemplation is not about the dream itself. I'm not superstitious, and I don't chase after the dream's essence. I can let things slip by, and I won't hold a grudge about a dream. My unhappiness stems from the fact that you didn't give me a chance to express my opinion in that moment of receiving and giving.

Black and white occupy opposite positions in the spectrum, and the feelings they give people are absolutely different. When people see black, hear black, or are aware of black, there is always a feeling of misery, coldness, dampness, desolation, rigidity, the end of the road, or the ultimate despair of death. This is not just a modern concept; it has existed since ancient times. Look at the construction of characters; aren't all meanings that abandon light derived from black? Like the characters "黝," "點," "黯," "黛," "黲," "黨," "黴," "墨," "讀," etc., are all good examples. Under people's subjective consciousness, these unfortunate characters have been symbols of gloom, baseness, and despair for thousands of years. "White is the color of happiness," that's what the political science textbook told me as soon as I started reading. Its position in people's imagery is so lofty. Therefore, the bright, pure, and great meanings of the characters "皇," "皎," "晳," "皚," "晶," "皓," "皓," "皓," "皎," "暾," "暉," "嚼" all come from white.

People should dislike black and like white, abandon black and follow white. Indeed, I have liked white since I was a child, perhaps because my mother liked to dress me in white after I was born. Therefore, I reject everything that is the opposite of white and close to black, and I try my best to choose white for everything around me.

Has living with white for more than ten years made me a little tired of it? Why is human thought so mysterious! Do you remember? One autumn evening five years ago, I seemed to have said something like this to you: "...my disappointment in black is not as heavy as my worry about white." I remember you said at the time, "Don't get angry when I say you're a child... but your thoughts contain philosophy..." I didn't pay attention to what philosophy it was, I only knew that my inner consciousness was like this. When I see white, hear white, and am aware of white, I immediately start to worry. From that time on, I avoided contact with white.

Friend, do you say I'm too fickle? Do you say my will is too weak? Do you say my cultivation of life is lacking? I admit all of these, and I have long felt guilty about it - at least before you said it! But emotions are mysterious; not only can I not control their arrival, but I have involuntarily been swept away by them. Now, involuntarily, I am changing again. The strangest thing is that I think this change has sufficient reason to drive me. The love of white seems to have no trace left in my mind, and I already feel that worrying about white is meddling. I have carefully analyzed it, and all things that cause people to worry have an inherent factor that accepts destruction! The feeling of worrying about white is nothing more than worrying about its being easily stained. But of the thousands upon thousands of colors, which one is not dyed by white? Even if white is something with a will, how can it hold fast to its unblemished state? But after a long time of erosion by sunlight and dust, it will silently be enveloped in a layer of yellow. Human efforts can be avoided, but the power of nature cannot be escaped. White! How much of your final state can be pure?

Because of this, some friends have recently ridiculed me as a "glass idealist." However, there is no way for me to tell the injustices I suffer. Glass is nothing more than taking the meaning of colorless and transparent, which seems very detached. But you must know that it reflects whatever color is behind it. Rather than saying that colorless and transparent is the most neutral, it is better to say that it is sitting on the fence; rather than saying that it is detached, it is better to say that it is cunning!

Friend, I have changed, I admit that I have changed. Today I discovered the characteristics of black. Only black is the most steadfast, only black is the most tolerant, only black is the most thorough, and only black is the most permanent. Black is great and noble, but who understands it? Yes, understood, it is black; not understood, it is still black; ridiculed, it is black; hated, it is still just black. It is precisely because it is rejected by people that it succeeds in its peaceful integrity; it is precisely because it is considered hopeless that it establishes its independent color personality. Can white possibly do these things? White and black are just names that refer to reality; if white must be named pure and great, it seems that it would not hurt to switch the name and the reality. But this is definitely not something that black cares about.

Friend, why did you misunderstand me, and in a dream?

### Pioneer

— Shang Mozong

### Expectation

— Shengjie

"Expectation" is like a small boat sailing towards the vast and boundless shore, forever wandering in the ocean.

Even though I know that this kind of expectation is superfluous, I still turn pain into pleasure! Isn't pain caused by excessive pleasure? Entrust your expectations to distant fantasies, just like waiting for light in a long night, look forward to it with a happy mood!

Everything can be forgotten, only expectation cannot be diluted by any force. "Expectation" has its mysterious traces in every stage of a person's entire life.

In the universe, there is not a single second that is not expectation, whether it is short or eternal. We come into contact with many people and things every day, and these people and things influence us to produce countless expectations; sometimes, when you occasionally see someone else make a windfall, you envy him, and even sincerely imitate him, and the greatest expectation suddenly arises in your heart; sometimes, you meet a very beautiful woman, and she unintentionally turns her head and gazes at you, or makes an unintentional movement, and you are immediately attracted by her magic, your heart is tempted by her, your heart will keep beating, and a cloud of expectation floats in your mind like an electric shock.

In this vast world, this kind of "expectation" flows like the endless water of the Yangtze River, day and night, and can also be said to be a kind of nervous stimulation, but it cannot be denied that it is a kind of expectation, but it will pass like a shooting star in an instant. If you are entangled by this kind of expectation, then the impulsive emotion will turn into a permanent expectation; in the short journey of life, you will be concerned by these expectations, and even fall into the abyss of pain. However, on that future day filled with the dawn, you will have unlimited enthusiasm for her arrival, expecting such an ideal day. The poetic traces of dreams disappear from your luxurious years, you walk into the desolate wilderness, wandering in the bitter cold of the night, you will wistfully and quietly exhale a breath, this breath contains thousands of sad emotions, and even feels indescribably uncomfortable.

Life is a comprehensive symphony composed of various mysterious rhythms, and this piece can represent various different moods, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness...; and "expectation" is also like a beautiful and moving song, if you go closer to listen to it, it will add countless troubles to your thinking, if you appreciate it silently from a distance, it will make you nostalgic, and it will also evoke that poetic fantasy, forever hovering in your yearning.

This song is a distant hope, an optimistic fantasy, a lost lover will return to his arms, a lost beloved thing will be found again, a dead body can be reborn. Everything in the world is unpredictable, sometimes infinite pain, sometimes wild joy like a landslide. If "expectation" really comes to an end, this beautiful and moving song will release a loud voice, singing to its heart's content, roaring to its heart's content, as if a prisoner serving an indefinite sentence in a long and dreary dungeon has discovered light and freedom.

The years of youth are like glittering stars, flying past like a dream. In this long process, my every word, every sentence, every action, has disappeared in expectation. Therefore, I am most afraid of seeing the two words "expectation," and I also hate others mentioning "expectation"; however, on the other hand, a contradictory psychology does drive me to like it, to be inseparable from it, and in countless sleepless nights, I have used distant reverie to "expect"; at that time, emotions cannot be controlled, and as long as there is some stir of breeze and drizzle, the sensitive will immediately recognize it as the prelude to the arrival of expectation, gradually stimulating the enthusiasm sealed in the heart, bursting out like a waterfall, this prelude will shock the entire world, like a volcanic eruption shaking the universe, and creating an indelible hope in life—"expectation."

If a third party stands in another world and quietly observes each expecting person, he will feel that expectation is too precious. It has immeasurable power, mysteriously manipulating the crowd in the universe. Is it a bright guide for people? Or does it use seductive charm to control the crowd? It is like a hero who has been on the battlefield for a long time, always surrounding the circle of life, fighting and listening, turning those precious moments and pure and sincere affection into a small boat on the ocean, allowing the sea breeze to blow, the huge waves to overturn the sky, and always being in danger of being sunk at the bottom of the sea; if, by chance, it survives, it will still live a wandering life, sailing towards the endless other shore, eternally and eternally, forcing a smile and expecting, this long expectation makes the intelligent crowd add a layer of painful melancholy!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 61

— Ye Jingfeng

"Uncle...!" a tender childish voice.

"Mr. Yue...!" a clear and crisp throat.

What is this all about? I went to all this trouble, braving the gunfire to get here, wasn't it because these two people were missing? Why, when I get here, are they standing here safe and sound, as if nothing had happened?

"These two have just returned, less than ten minutes ago," the action commander said with a slight smile. "Mu Lai was resting, and when she heard you were coming, she asked me not to say anything..."

"I'm sorry, Mr. Yue," Yaoqun giggled, "to trouble you, cause you so much trouble and worry... but we can't completely blame us either, it's just that there was really no way to communicate and report our whereabouts - we haven't been idle from morning till now."

She was wearing a "security team" uniform, with a pistol hanging on her armed belt. Her skin seemed to have been dyed, and it was much older and darker than when I saw her a few days ago. She was originally dressed as a man; dressed like this, if she didn't speak, even I wouldn't be able to tell at first glance that she was a woman. Moreover, her vocal cords were quite wide, and her chest cavity was heavier than that of ordinary women. If she suppressed her voice a little, she sounded like a young man.

Little Tiger was dressed in the same way as Yaoqun, but he had a shaved head like a monk, his eyes were still so big and round, surrounded by a circle of long eyelashes. He was originally standing next to Yaoqun, but when he saw me staring, he seemed a little scared and hid his body behind Yaoqun's clothes.

"So..." I just opened my mouth to speak.

"The Beiping has already notified the team leader," Yaoqun had already guessed what I was going to say, "and asked them to dispel the news... I originally planned to ask you not to bother, but it was too late..."

"Very good," I nodded. "Please go and rest. I'd like to hear about your experience later, how exactly did you two go together...?"

After all, Jingqun was young and strong, and Little Tiger had practiced such deep martial arts, so of course he didn't feel tired. He just said, "We just ate, and we were just about to report what happened." At first, I thought that the two of them had, at most, gone to the enemy's side to scout out some information, or just ran to the front line to join in the fun; who could have expected that they had gone deep into the lair, and in the enemy's den, it could be said that they had caused a heaven-overturning change.

Here, I will repeat Yaoqun's oral account as completely as I can remember; the "I" below is Yaoqun herself:

That morning, the team leader (i.e., Mr. W) explained clearly the key points of going to Tongzhou - where to go, who to meet, what work to do - and repeatedly instructed them before setting off that there were many enemy agents active from the station onwards; every move must be very careful. He also said, "Although we are rewarded for doing things, we are not given preferential treatment, but we are severely punished for mistakes and dereliction of duty. Everything must be done in cooperation with the commander of the Changdi headquarters, and there must be no going beyond the rules, unless there is no other choice but to act alone, but you must also try to contact the headquarters."

We (i.e., Yaoqun and Hucheng) arrived at the station at exactly 6:07 or 6:08. Because the enemy and I often have small conflicts in this area, the train cannot run according to the timetable. The only way to know is to hang a temporary sign to notify. On this day, the sign was hung, indicating that there would be a train at 7:00 sharp. I and my younger brother Hu waited at the station to buy tickets. Who knew that we waited until 5 minutes before 7:00, but still didn't see any action to buy tickets. What was especially strange was that apart from a few villagers, I didn't see anyone waiting for the train. When I asked someone at the station, I found out that the matter of hanging signs to sell tickets was not very reliable; even if the tickets were sold, there was still no train, which was also a common occurrence. Ordinary people mostly take cars, ride bikes, or walk.

### Scenery of the North Station

— Shaofu

The autumn sky is high and the air is crisp, and people have the leisure to go on an outing. I have a suggestion, please ask him to take a sightseeing tour of the North Station. That scene will make those with elegant interests feel refreshed, and those with benevolent hearts feel compassion.

There is too little empty space on the platform, so little that the passengers coming in and out have no choice but to squeeze through these walls of people, or endure the "ground paved with people." The "walls of people" are the rows of people lined up to buy tickets. I heard a porter's sigh, which described its length: "Um! Sixteenth Road!" The "human ground" is completely in a sitting or lying position, with old people with white hair and long beards, and babies as young as three or four months old, men and women, even quilts, pillows, and bedding are complete, and the cement has become their hotel.

I didn't inquire about what these people were there for. Judging from their appearance, they weren't necessarily treating the North Station as a shelter, or waiting to buy train tickets; if my estimate is correct, then I have to admire some of the railway authorities in the towering building opposite that scene. Did they not see it, or did they see it and not care?

### Banning Hong Kong Shirts

— Ganlai

The "Hong Kong shirt" that was popular in Shanghai in the summer should actually be called the "Hawaiian shirt," because this kind of clothing was originally created by the natives of that archipelago. Its advantages are that it is cool, convenient, and economical, and it can be called the standard summer clothing for tropical regions.

This summer outfit was transmitted from Hawaii to Hong Kong, and then spread from Hong Kong to various parts of China. By mistake, it was changed to the name "Hong Kong shirt." It entered Shanghai in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China. It was first worn by a few overseas Chinese children who returned to China, swaggering through the streets. The cloth used was red and green, and the colors were colorful. When Shanghai people first saw this kind of short-sleeved, waist-hugging, non-Chinese, non-Western, strange dress, they only felt surprised at first, and there were not many people who imitated it. It was not until the summer of the 29th year that the "Hong Kong shirt" began to show its face in Shanghai, and almost every young person prepared one or two sets. Later, on the one hand, due to the delay of the war, the source of materials gradually dried up, and the prices of goods rose frequently, especially clothing cloth. The material used for this kind of Hong Kong shirt is less than a Western shirt, and it can save the trouble of a Western top and tie. Compared with the Chinese-style short shirt and trousers, the material is more economical, and the appearance is more beautiful. On the other hand, it happened to be summer, and Shanghai people tried wearing this new summer clothing, and they really felt relaxed and very comfortable. Therefore, the "Hong Kong shirt" became popular in Shanghai for a while. Today, there are no less than two or three hundred factories and shops specializing in Hong Kong shirts. When summer comes, if you try to look at the pedestrians on the street, eight or nine out of ten are wearing "Hong Kong shirts."

Guangdong Province is close to the tropics, and the summer season is hotter than Shanghai. There must be more people wearing "Hong Kong shirts." However, recently, the Guangdong Provincial Government suddenly ordered its affiliated agencies to warn employees not to wear "Hawaiian shirts" during office hours, believing that this kind of clothing is unsightly and loses decorum. It is said that on the 19th of last month, a section chief of a certain subordinate bureau of the Provincial Government temporarily forgot the ban and actually wore a Hong Kong shirt directly into Luo Zhuoying's private Qiu to pay his respects to the chairman of the Provincial Government. The next day, he was dismissed by Luo's order. After reading this news, the following thoughts arise:

Hong Kong shirts have their undeniable advantages: economy, convenience, and coolness. Although the Guangdong Provincial Government's accusation of being unsightly and losing decorum is not without basis, it is still too demanding. Moreover, today's civil servants, if they are honest and upright, it is not easy to wear a neat and clean Hong Kong shirt. Do you want them to all wear silk clothes to "enhance the appearance and maintain decorum"? I'm afraid that even if the chairman agrees, their salaries, their parents, wives, and daughters will not agree, right?

Banning Hong Kong shirts, I think, should be taken as a joke!

### Many Things in the Buddhist Temple

— Hongyu

Since the Municipal Council raised the issue of temples, it has stirred up a huge wave of monks' petitions. Who knew that the big wave had not subsided, but the small waves within the Buddhist temple were rising one after another. In Shanghai's most famous Jing'an Temple, two monks, Dewu and Mika, were arrested by the court on suspicion of being traitors. Following this, the property of Xizhu Temple was generously donated by the original owner, Zhifang, to the Chinese Buddhist Hospital because Mika was arrested. There was also the abbot of Luohan Temple, who, after his death, his mistress recruited another monk to temporarily act as the owner of the temple, but the disciples of the temple refused to accept it and firmly opposed it. This scandal has not yet been resolved. Recently, in Wanshou Nunnery, there has been a scandal of the "Wu Zetian" (Wu Zetian is the nickname of Chen Jiangshi, a woman from Jiangbei) who lives upstairs, selling drugs. The head monk, Jiyuan, is a drug addict and is also Wu Zetian's adopted father. With such tangled Buddhist scandals, no wonder a certain director in the council wanted to frankly reveal their clean but not really clean inside story. Although the momentum was turbulent at the time, and the crowd of bald heads wanted to accuse him of defamation, the facts are now in front of us, so what is there to say? Alas! "Buddhist countries have fate, and Buddhist teachings are related." Is that how it should be explained? Sin! Sin!

### Map

— Chu Pinwen

Reading Mr. Weiran's linen book in the Sixth Column of Japan makes one feel infinite emotion. This kind of situation is indeed quite common in our China. A few days ago, the author also encountered a similar thing. It was an evening around the third day. The author was wandering on the street and happened to see a conversational book for junior high school students. Its name was "Daily English Conversation," published by Evans. Driven by curiosity, he stopped and flipped through it. On the back cover, he discovered a shocking trademark. It turned out that the trademark seemed to be a topographical map of our country. However, in this black topographical map, there were only the provinces of Central and Southern China (because it was just a black shadow, it was impossible to tell exactly which provinces were included). However, it could be clearly distinguished that there was no Xinjiang, no Tibet, and no Northeast. Seeing it was really frightening. This absurd situation may have occurred in the concession era and the fatuous enemy-puppet era. In the former, because the imperialists had long not considered the border provinces as our country's territory, and in the latter, they simply listened to the commands of the Japanese invaders. However, looking at the inside of the back cover, it was clearly printed: "Published in May of the 35th year of the Republic of China." I really don't know how he was allowed to publish it and sell it in large quantities. I don't even know if it is because of the great national style and "not being concerned with trifles"?

### Self-Description of a Telegram Draft

— Jingcao

On the day I was born, the telegraph operator wrote the four characters "(Extremely Urgent)" on my head. This is what I am most proud of. The code translator copied my identity on a telegram paper and drew three "ten" characters and three circles on top of my head and handed it to the clerk. The clerk signed a date and stamped a private seal on it, seemingly unconcerned. However, how anxious I was in my heart! I waited for a full five hours in the section chief's office. The three "ten" characters on my head made me sweat all over. The section chief easily wrote the two characters "for review" and sent it to the director's mansion. The director was not at home, and his wife took me down, stuffed me into a drawer, and I suffered from afternoon until noon the next day. If it wasn't for the maid tidying the drawer, my life would have come to an end. The director was furious and stamped his feet because I was discriminated against, and scolded the maid severely, but the wife didn't say a word. The director wrote the six big characters "Hand it over to Section Chief × to handle quickly" on my face. The section chief held his pen and rested his head, smoking four cigarettes before replying to me, but I didn't feel satisfied. The director didn't even see clearly what the section chief had written, and then waved "as proposed"; then handed it over to the clerk × to draft, and waited a long time again. After the section chief's supplement and modification, the director forcefully wrote a big and thick character "Okay," and returned to the code translator's hand to change his appearance. By the time the telegraph operator removed my task, a total of two and fourteen hours had passed.

### Humanitarianism

— Li Xiao

A talked about retribution, saying, "Killing cows in this life, reincarnating as a cow in the next life, killing pigs in this life, turning into a pig in the next life, even killing a bird, an insect, or an ant, you must turn into a bird, an insect, or an ant in the next life." B said, "Then, you can only kill people."

Someone eats beef but does not eat shrimp paste soy sauce. Everyone asked why. He replied, "Killing a cow can be eaten countless times, only one life is lost. One spoonful of shrimp paste soy sauce loses countless lives. We humans cannot abstain from killing, we only seek to kill less." Everyone ridiculed him.

### Short Takes

Except for those with hearts of stone, most people value relationships. In small matters, if someone lends you half a bowl of rice, you must return a whole bowl. If someone pays for my streetcar fare, I must treat them to snacks. When I got married, they gave me 100,000 CRB (even on the day it was announced that 200 was equivalent to 1), now that they are getting married, I must also give them 100,000 CNC. In the past, reciprocity was the norm in human relations; one absolutely could not be stingy. One would pawn their long underwear or go hungry, but it had to be done to avoid being considered unkind and giving people reason to speak harshly.

Consider the names of our Chinese women, mostly choosing orchids, chrysanthemums, fragrant pearls, and beautiful jade. However, with the progress of the times, everything new replaces the old, which is also the law of natural selection. Thus, there are those who, despite being like Dong Shi, choose "Beautiful" for a name. There are those who add "Beauty" to "Beauty" or "Saliva" to "Beauty," and even those who hide their original names and choose "Mona" or "Lover." This is utterly appalling and breathtaking. Even more, there are those who consider themselves avant-garde and choose "Manly," "Lily," or "Alice," following in the footsteps of Europe and America. Therefore, parents must observe their children's personalities and choose appropriate names; otherwise, it would be better to call out numbers like ticket sellers, which is more straightforward. Like a certain gentleman at sea who has too many children, it might be better to use a numbering system and wear a family crest to avoid being unfamiliar and becoming a laughingstock!

"Heaven is above, earth is below, conscience is in the middle, if you cheat me out of a penny, you are a bastard." Under the principle of never doing business that loses money no matter how many deals you do, it's unexpected that businessmen have such a decisive and inviolable principle.

Aren't non-business people the same? "We come from the people, to seek benefits for the people, not afraid of death, not wanting money, three—Three Principles of the People!" Why the red face and ears? Listening to his inaugural declaration, it sounds like he earnestly wants to decline gifts. However, what will it be like when he resigns? Should we eliminate the corrupt elements who disgrace the Three Principles of the People?

"On the Double Tenth Festival, all parks in the city are open for free, allowing anyone to visit."

Having to have a "pass" to enter a "public" park is still an exploitative policy left by foreigners. This time, thanks to the glory of National Day, common people can enter for free. We must truly thank the martyrs for their bloodshed. Following old customs is acceptable in good areas. However, parks are one of the city's municipal facilities, so how can they be listed as a source of tax revenue? Furthermore, public officials often enter without a "pass" by virtue of their "plum blossom badge," swaggering in while the gatekeepers nod and wave them in. Isn't this tax evasion?

Li Qingping's applying of rouge and powder, drawing eyebrows and eyes, is precisely the demeanor of an artist. Why is there any need to consider it strange? What is strange is that she was on the list, yet they waited until three days after her art exhibition ended before arresting her. Why the delay?

### Breathtaking

— Ganlai

Not long ago, I saw an advertisement for "yellow publications" in the newspaper, described in vivid and graphic detail, truly a feat of "pleasing the eye and delighting the heart."

Recently, there is a type of "secretary" in Guangzhou that is also commonly sold at newspaper stands. The cover of the book is printed with the following line of words:

"Notice to Readers: Those above the age of sixteen and below the age of fifty should not buy this book!"

The four words below are especially large. As a result, readers rushed to buy it, making it a bestseller for a time.

Tell the publishing "merchants" in Shanghai and the bosses of yellow publications that you can "imitate" this once. You can save a huge amount of advertising fees and avoid racking your brains when drafting the advertisement, and the resulting effect may not be that much different. Why not do it?

### Talking About the Haining Tide

— Yang Ren

The Qiantang River tide is a magnificent spectacle. However, tides exist everywhere in the world, so why is only the one on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month famous? According to folklore, there is a reason for this: After Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty seized the throne by killing his brother, his conscience was troubled, and he became suspicious and anxious. Therefore, he named his elder brother "King of the Tide" to be the god of the tide. He built the "Temple of the Sea God" in Haining City to worship him and set the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month as the date of sacrifice (or according to the appropriate hour), probably with the intention of "everlasting incense and eternal offerings" to appease the spirit. At that time, coastal residents, to ensure that the sea would not cause trouble and for their own peaceful lives, would gather before the god on the day of the sacrifice, burn incense, and pray. Tourists and merchants also gathered to enjoy the spectacle. Over time, it became a custom, eventually evolving into the famous "Watching the Haining Tide on the Eighteenth Day of the Eighth Month" that is known at home and abroad. (According to the Haining County Chronicle, the construction date of the Temple of the Sea God matches this legend, so this story is likely not fictional.)

The rise and fall of sand in the Qiantang River are very strange. Sometimes, in just a few days, dozens of square miles of sand suddenly rise from the sea, "accumulating sand into land," lasting for hundreds of years without collapsing, allowing residents to cultivate the land. Sometimes, areas of sand covering dozens of square miles can completely collapse in just a few days once a crack appears.

During the War of Resistance, the seawall was neglected and deteriorated day by day. The safety of the people in the seven counties north of the sea was also lost. Although local officials and civilians made every effort to repair it, even a complete stone seawall could not withstand the destruction of the raging tide. What good would some dirt and tree branches do? Just when things were critical, it was truly a "heavenly blessing in times of emergency." Suddenly, a vast expanse of sand rose along the thirty-mile stretch of the coast (from Haining East to Xinjiu Cang). This area was where the tide was most powerful. With the sand blocking it, the force of the impact was greatly reduced. As a result, the dilapidated stone seawall and the temporary rescue efforts were able to last until victory.

According to elders, when the Taiping Rebellion occurred, the seawall was severely damaged. A major disaster was avoided due to the sand rising along the coast.

Who would have thought that this stubborn sand has repeatedly played a major role in protecting the lives of the people!
