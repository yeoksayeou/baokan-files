### The Seventh National Assembly Session Passes Proposal to Extend Deadline for Constitutional Draft Submissions; Frontier Issues Attract Attention from Entire Assembly

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Seventh National Assembly session was held on the morning of the 3rd. By 9:10 AM, 1,162 delegates had arrived, and the meeting was declared open, with Kong Geng serving as chair. The secretariat read the minutes of the sixth meeting and congratulatory telegrams for the opening of the Assembly, as well as letters and telegrams of leave from delegates. Later, the Deputy Secretary-General announced the decisions of the ninth meeting of the Presidium: (1) The deadline for receiving proposals would be December 5th; (2) Each unit comprising the Comprehensive Review Committee should nominate three individuals before 12:00 noon on the 3rd, and submit the lists to the Presidium. Subsequently, several delegates rose to speak, arguing that the widespread expression of opinions had not yet reached a universal level, and that the vast majority of those who wanted to express their views had not been able to do so. They hoped that the deadline for receiving proposals could be extended. Deputy Secretary-General Lei reiterated that after the deadline for receiving proposals, the Assembly would continue to be held, with plenary sessions in the mornings and committee reviews in the afternoons, proceeding in tandem, which would expedite the sorting of proposals. As the atmosphere in the Assembly Hall increasingly favored extending the deadline, the Chairman put it to a vote. As a result, the opinion to extend the deadline for expressing opinions and submitting proposals to 12:00 noon on December 7th was passed with a majority of 845 votes. At the beginning of the meeting, Delegate Sun Shengwu spoke first, believing that the Xinjiang and Mongolian delegates had come from afar and worked extremely hard, and should be allowed to speak first. The frontier delegates listened and applauded warmly. Subsequently, Zhang Kailian, Wang Zemin, Huang Mengfei, An Futing, Guo Zhongxing, Ren Zhuoxuan, Ahemaitijiang, Aisa, Yang Zhizhong, Dengzhunam, Luo Jialun, and others spoke in succession. On the morning of the 6th, the focus of the speeches was on frontier delegates, and the issues raised focused on ethnic minorities in the frontier regions. As these matters concerned national politics, they were able to attract the attention of all delegates in the Assembly Hall. The Assembly adjourned at 12:00 noon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Seventh National Assembly session continued on the afternoon of the 3rd at 3:40 PM, with 1,124 delegates present. Delegate Liu Henghengjing (female) served as chair. After the meeting commenced, a broad discussion of the Draft Constitution of the Republic of China continued. Hubei Delegate Meng Xianzhang, Shandong Delegate Gu Chi, Beiping Delegate Sun Shengwu, Independent Professional Delegate Jiang Yiping, Hebei Delegate Qu Zhisheng, Jiangxi Delegate Yang Dupu, Youth Party Delegate Song Yiqing, Shanxi Delegate Liang Shangdong, Liaobei Delegate Liu Guozeng, Hunan Delegate Liu Ziya, and Hubei Delegate Qiu Jianyuan spoke in succession. The main points of discussion were still (1) the issue of the capital city in the draft constitution, with some advocating for Beiping or Wuhan as the capital, and others advocating for multiple secondary capitals; (2) alterations to the territory of the Republic of China, with some advocating that no alterations should be made without the decision of the National Assembly; (3) the issue of adding professional representatives; (4) the powers of the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan. At 4:50 PM, there was a ten-minute break. Afterwards, the secretariat announced twenty-four written opinions on the draft constitution submitted by twenty-four delegates, including Ye Suzhong, Zhang Yuanruo, Huang Guoshu, Leng Xin, and Zhang Daoxing. The meeting adjourned at 6:08 PM.

[Additional Telegram] The 3rd marked the 18th day since the opening of the National Assembly. Youth Party Delegate Li Yuhua and Regional Delegate Ma Shaowu reported their arrival, bringing the total number of delegates who have reported to 1,654.

### Delegates' Speeches in the Morning Focused on Frontier Ethnic Minorities

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The important speeches of the delegates during the Seventh National Assembly session on the morning of the 3rd were as follows:

Zhang Kailian: Article 7, which designates Nanjing as the capital, should be deleted, as no other constitution in the world has such a provision. Article 11, Section 114, which stipulates that provinces may convene provincial people's representative assemblies to formulate provincial self-government laws based on the Provincial and County Self-Government Regulations, should be changed to allow for free formulation.

Wang Zemin: The Draft Constitution of the Republic of China should be based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, and should take the 1946 Draft Constitution as its principle.

Huang Mengfei: Regarding the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, how can we make it ideal? According to this draft constitution, the Legislative Yuan exercises executive power, rendering the National Assembly useless, with only the power to elect the president, which can be said to be only half of an electoral power. Using parliamentary politics, the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan can hold meetings simultaneously without friction, but this would lead to a hybrid system that is neither fish nor fowl. Therefore, if the regulations for parliament are not proper, the parliament will also become autocratic. We believe that the National Assembly should have the power to impeach the Control Yuan and the Legislative Yuan in order to achieve balance.

An Futing: Add a chapter on social security and stipulate an electoral system for professional representatives.

Guo Zhongxing: During the Northern Expedition and the eight-year War of Resistance, workers made their greatest efforts. Workers have made great contributions to the country, so there is ample justification for including professional representatives in the electoral college.

Ren Zhuoxuan (i.e., Ye Qing): This draft constitution is a kind of form between a representative system and the Five-Power Constitution. We have the following opinions on this: (1) There are three types of representatives in the National Assembly, and the people have to elect three times. I believe that the people should only elect once. (2) Members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan should not be delegates to the National Assembly. Furthermore, Sun Ke's explanation that representatives elected from various places will focus on local interests is completely inconsistent with the facts. (3) The National Assembly does not have the power to amend a constitution formulated by the National Assembly, which is extremely unreasonable. (4) We must transform reality with ideals and advance reality. Our ideal is the Five-Power Constitution. If we deviate from ideals to formulate a constitution, it will not be a plan for a hundred years, but a plan for one or two years. We should follow the ideal of the Five-Power Constitution, adopt the strengths of European and American systems as much as possible, and jointly create the most advanced political system of world democracy.

### Joint Land and Air Exercise to Entertain National Assembly Delegates

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Students from military academies in the capital and garrison troops, including infantry, cavalry, artillery, air force, and paratroopers, are scheduled to hold a joint military exercise on land and in the air at the Ming Palace airfield on the 8th of this month to welcome National Assembly delegates. General Tang Enbo, commander of the Nanjing Garrison, will command the exercise. After the exercise, Tang will host the delegates.

Ahemaitijiang: I am a representative from Xinjiang, coming from the frontier. I have the following opinions on the draft constitution: (1) Article 5, which states that all ethnic groups in the Republic of China are equal, should not only be written down but also be truly implemented. (2) Under Article 5, the original names of all ethnic groups and a high degree of ethnic autonomy should be clearly stipulated. (3) A chapter on ethnic minorities should be added after Chapter 11 and Chapter 12, i.e., after the chapter on provincial and county systems. (4) Xinjiang should be granted a high degree of ethnic autonomy.

Aisa: It is very regrettable that the draft constitution fails to clearly define the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities in the country. This draft constitution was drafted under the leadership of the Kuomintang and failed to comply with Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Article 4 of the Outline of National Reconstruction clearly stipulates the status of all ethnic groups, and the declaration of the First National Congress also recognizes the rights of ethnic autonomy and self-defense. The resolution of the Second Plenary Session grants ethnic equality and autonomy to ethnic minorities, but these are not clearly stipulated in the draft constitution. In the frontier regions, there have been many bloody tragedies over the years. Some say that this is due to dissatisfaction with reality and a fondness for creating disturbances. In fact, this is due to the government's lack of good policies, the misjudgment of a small number of people, and the insults of a small number of people. These are all historical records. Corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats arrive in the frontier regions and do as they please, extracting as much as they can, shifting responsibility, and letting them take responsibility. Everything should be done to save the situation, and this should not happen again. The constitution should have very good regulations. If there is no guarantee of autonomy, freedom, and survival, bloodshed is inevitable. We hope to obtain a high degree of ethnic autonomy, which is autonomy above independence. The reasons are as follows: (1) Independent, autonomous, and free are basic human requirements for people around the world, and Xinjiang compatriots are no exception. (2) Our neighbors in the Soviet Union, who are of the same blood, race, and religion, have all obtained federal autonomous status. The Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Afghans are all Muslims. The 100 million Muslims in India are not satisfied with proportional equality and want to divide India in half to implement autonomy. This greatly affects our emotions. (3) The trends of the world are changing rapidly. We do not agree with any ethnic group that does not obtain autonomous territories. Finally, he emphasized: Now, some people believe that the demands for autonomy by ethnic minorities in the country are a movement for division and independence, but in fact, it is a sacred and free movement. If our sacred freedom is guaranteed, there will naturally be no division movement. For example, the United States is a free country, so there is no division movement. Wherever there is a lack of freedom, there is a division movement. Therefore, if we cannot achieve our goals, we will inevitably take this path in the future. All movements in history have been for survival and for freedom.

Yang Zhizhong: I am a representative of the indigenous ethnic minorities in the southwest. I have the following opinions: In Chapters 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, a few words should be added: "In provinces with indigenous ethnic minorities, elections should be conducted in proportion to the population." Our indigenous ethnic minorities are scattered in Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guangxi. None of them are doing well like the Han Chinese. Quoting Mr. Aisa, in the past, corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats were responsible, but in the future, the Chinese National Assembly will be responsible.

Dengzhunam: I am from the Ba'an people of Xikang. As you all know, millions of compatriots in the frontier are looking forward to everyone's sympathy and cultivation. They believe that the central government should treat all ethnic groups equally. My opinion is that education and various facilities in the frontier regions should be developed in a balanced manner so that the entire country has a future. In particular, women in the frontier regions should also be guaranteed employment.

Luo Jialun: He paid much attention to civil rights, but neglected the people's livelihood. In the chapter on basic national policies, the protection of workers is too neglected. Article 139 should be amended to read: "The state shall enable tillers to have their land, and laborers to have their work and livelihood guaranteed." Article 141, "Private wealth and private enterprises shall be protected," has a capitalist tone. In the examination chapter, the provision that it should transcend party affiliations is too vague. For example, the Kuomintang should not interfere, and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party should also withdraw from schools and examination institutions. Furthermore, the audit agency should be superior to the Control Yuan and should have the power to report corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats.

### List of Constitutional Draft Review Committee Members Likely to be Proposed at Today's Assembly; Presidium Discusses Conveners of Each Group

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The list of group members for the Constitutional Draft Review Committee is largely complete, and the Presidium is considering the conveners of each group. Furthermore, the list of representatives nominated by various units to participate in the Comprehensive Review Committee has been received from more than forty units, and the remaining units will also submit them to the Secretariat of the Assembly for forwarding to the Presidium. The complete list of members of the Constitutional Committee is expected to be proposed at the Assembly on the 4th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Presidium of the National Assembly held a meeting at 4:45 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, presided over by Hu Shuhua, and decided to hold the eighth meeting on the 4th, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon, presided over by Hu Shuhua, and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, chaired by Wang Yunwu, to continue a broad discussion of the constitutional draft. The Presidium also decided to hold another meeting during the recess of the afternoon session.

### Representatives from Jilin and Liaoning Both Advocate for Establishing the Capital in Beiping

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] During the National Assembly session on the afternoon of the 3rd, the speeches of the delegates were as follows: Hubei Delegate Meng Xianzhang: (1) The amendments to the draft constitution are more progressive than the 1946 draft constitution in terms of political regulations, but not in terms of economic regulations. If the people have no economic rights, how can their political rights be guaranteed? This point needs to be supplemented. (2) Within a country, ethnic heroes are not to be feared, but rather the lack of correct ethnic policies. Autonomy and unity are two sides of the same coin and are by no means contradictory. We should use cool heads and far-sighted eyes to solve this problem.

Shandong Professional Delegate Gu Chi: The election of professional organizations and women's organizations must be included in the constitution. Beiping Delegate Sun Shengwu: (1) The National Assembly is not a party meeting and should not excessively accommodate the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Moreover, the Political Consultative Conference did not have frontier representatives participating, so the resolutions are indeed lacking in comprehensiveness. (2) Article 5, regarding the equality of all ethnic groups in the country, is insufficient and should be amended to include assistance to weak ethnic minorities. (3) Although Article 8 stipulates that all people in the country are equal regardless of religion, there are very few Muslim representatives at this meeting. In the election of the Twelfth Army, a certain number of seats should be added to each province for religious people with special customs. (4) Regarding the opinion of a high degree of autonomy in the frontier areas, he believes that after the implementation of the constitution, all governors below the provincial level should be publicly elected, and all problems should be solved. As for the system of autonomy above independence proposed by Delegate Aisa this morning, it lacks concrete measures.

Independent Professional Delegate Jiang Yiping: The national situation requires a strong and capable government. Therefore, while preventing the phenomenon of centralization of power, the power to govern should be developed as much as possible. However, in the amendments, the Executive Yuan is excessively controlled by the Legislative Yuan. The Premier of the Executive Yuan not only cannot act freely but must also lobby the Legislative Yuan extensively before taking any action, which affects public affairs. He hopes that representatives of all parties can share the same goal as the people's representatives, amend this point in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of a capable government with five separate powers, and make the Legislative Yuan and others responsible to the National Assembly so that the people can supervise the government with political power.

Hebei Professional Delegate Qu Zhisheng: The capital is the nerve center of a country, and its location should be rigidly stipulated in the constitution. However, where it should be located should be discussed and decided with a calm, fair, and impartial attitude.

Jiangxi Professional Delegate Yang Dupu: (1) The principle of dividing power and enabling five powers to be independent must be ensured. (2) The protection of the people's lives and health should be stipulated, and a public medical system should be adopted.

Jilin Delegate Li Wenpu: A. Please establish the capital in Beiping. (1) From a national defense perspective, establishing the capital in Beiping can be close to the Northeast and Northwest, and the phenomenon of chaos and disaster in the north can also be changed. (2) In terms of climate, the northern climate is beneficial to physical and mental health and administrative efficiency. (3) In terms of culture, Beiping is the cultural center of our country. The atmosphere is pure and simple, unlike Nanjing, which is often affected by the financial economy of Shanghai, leading to extravagance. B. The terms of office of National Assembly delegates, the president, vice president, and members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan should all be reduced to four years, and the National Assembly should meet every two years.

Shanxi Professional Delegate Liang Shangdong: (1) Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong revolution and struggle were all for the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. The first article should be clearly named "The Republic of the Three Principles of the People." (2) Article 4, changes to the national territory must be approved by the National Assembly. (3) All professional organizations should elect representatives to participate in the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. (4) The name of the "Basic National Policies" chapter is inappropriate, and many of the articles are also far-fetched. For example, in Article 37, the provisions regarding the United Nations Charter are not necessary.

Liaobei Regional Delegate Liu Guozeng: (1) The content of the draft constitution does not match the preface and is not based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings in founding the Republic of China and should be corrected. (2) The words "government of the people, by the people, and for the people" in the first article are superfluous. (3) Article 4, territorial changes must be approved by the National Assembly. (4) The capital should be established in Beiping. (5) The phrase "without distinction of gender, religion, race, class, or party affiliation" in Article 8 should be deleted. (6) The right to survival should be added to the rights and duties of the people.

Hunan Delegate Liu Ziya: I have another proposal on the currency issue, please pay attention to it.

Hubei Delegate Qiu Jianyuan: (1) Request detailed agricultural policies to alleviate the suffering of farmers. (2) Determine the status and treatment of soldiers to reward their hard work. (3) Move the capital to Wuhan.

Hebei Delegate Zhao Zimao: (1) In the election of National Assembly delegates, professional organizations and compatriots in the border areas should participate universally. (2) The National Assembly should meet once a year, and the resident representative assembly should exercise its powers on its behalf during the adjournment. (3) In the formulation of laws, the Chinese National Assembly should decide on the principles, and the Legislative Yuan, composed of experts and scholars elected by the Chinese National Assembly, should formulate them. (4) The National Assembly should have broad powers to remove officials of the central government.

### Democratic Socialist Party Participates in the National Assembly to Complete the Main Constitution

Sun Baoyi Makes a Speech in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, This City] The China Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting at the Fanwei on the afternoon of the 1st. Zhang Junmai, Wu Xianzi, Xu Fulin, Tang Zhuxin, Sha Yankai, Sun Baogang, and Sun Baoyi attended. According to Sun Baoyi, the party's Shanghai spokesperson, on the 3rd, the meeting had a wide-ranging discussion on general issues and finally reached a concrete resolution, namely, that the party would participate in the National Assembly in order to complete the democratic constitution. Other issues, such as participation in the government, were separate from the National Assembly, and the party had not yet considered them. In addition, this person was appointed as the party's Shanghai spokesperson, and Xu Fulin and Jiang Yuntian were appointed as the party's Nanjing spokespersons. Moreover, among the standing committee members who participated in the Central Standing Committee meeting, except for Xu Fulin, who took a train to Pukou on the morning of the 3rd, the rest were all in Shanghai.

### Thai Ambassador to China Arrives in Shanghai; Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Within Ten Days to Present Credentials; Vows to Strive to Foster Good Relations

[This City] The first Thai Ambassador to China, Sanguon Lulaak, arrived in Shanghai the night before last and will go to Nanjing around the 9th or 10th of this month to meet President Chiang and present his credentials. The Ambassador also met with reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday and said that he would devote himself to improving Sino-Thai relations and making them better day by day. During this visit to China, he will discuss various issues of Sino-Thai trade with the Chinese government. Thai rice, timber, and rubber can be transported to China, and China also has several materials needed by Thailand. Sino-Thai diplomatic relations were very good before the war. The local overseas Chinese and Thais have always lived in harmony. Later, due to the outbreak of the war and the influence of the Japanese, Sino-Thai disputes arose, one example of which was the unrest not long ago. However, this kind of problem has gradually decreased, and the fundamental way to improve it is to educate the people of both sides so that they can understand and cooperate with each other. In the future, relations between the two countries will naturally be even better. Talking about the current situation in Thailand, the Ambassador said that since the end of the war, the lives of the people of Thailand have not been as good as before the war, but compared to other countries, it is considered good. The people still have sufficient food to eat, and there are also more political problems than before the war. Thailand and France have also reached an understanding and have sent ambassadors to each other. The French Ambassador will arrive in Thailand in the spring. Thailand is also preparing to set up consulates in Shanghai, Shantou, and Haikou in the future. When reporters asked him about his impression of China, the Ambassador said that he secretly went to Chongqing from the border during the War of Resistance in 1943 to meet President Chiang and had a very good impression of China. He also said that many Thais are of Chinese descent. Bili, who recently visited China, and the ancestors of the Thai Prime Minister were all Chinese. The Ambassador himself's father was also from Fujian, China. The Ambassador is currently 44 years old and has served as a Minister without Portfolio in Thailand, and has also worked in the Ministry of Finance, the Parliament, and the courts. He is very prestigious in Thai political circles.

### British Troops Invade Shenzhen and Kill One of Our Villagers on the Spot

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 3rd] Reporters learned tonight from reliable sources that a group of British armed forces destroyed our country's sovereignty today. It is reported that they invaded Shenzhen from Kowloon this afternoon and killed one of our villagers. British police stationed in the border area of Kowloon admitted to the unfortunate incident when reporters went to inquire and said that they are currently investigating, so they refused to disclose details. It is reported that a group of British troops invaded Shenzhen at 2:00 PM today with the aim of arresting two Chinese youths. It is said that the two men smuggled a large amount of flour from British territory. The Chinese troops stationed in Shenzhen drove them back because the British army's move violated our country's sovereignty. However, an hour later, they invaded again with some reinforcements, but were still blocked by our army. Chinese villagers gathered to watch. It is reported that the British army then opened fire and killed one villager.

### Contentious Debates on Frontier Affairs at the Convention

— Our Reporter Zhang Ming, Pu Dejie

—A Record of Anecdotes from the Seventh National Assembly

By the seventh session of the National Assembly, the extensive expression of opinions had already caused a sense of weariness from the relentless bombardment of words. However, today's session offered a different flavor. The demands of the frontier representatives and their fervent hopes placed on the government reminded everyone present of those remote regions, vital components of the Republic of China.

Representative Ahmet Hong, representing the Xinjiang compatriots, wore a crimson velvet hat with black edges and black flowers, paired with a Western suit. Sporting a tuft of a beard and a robust physique, his eyes gleamed with spirit. However, he could not speak Mandarin. Therefore, for the first time in a domestic conference within the Republic of China, interpreters were used.

Aisha spoke fluent Mandarin, voicing the most urgent demands and the most serious problems. He began with a stark warning: "Xinjiang is the most important issue for the entire nation. China is like a house, and Xinjiang is like the walls and doors of that house. If the house is gone, what good are the walls and doors? I ask for a little more of your time, so you may see what our walls and doors look like."

Deng Zhunam, a female compatriot from the frontier, attended as a representative of distinguished members of society. Her speech gave equal weight to frontier, ethnic, and women's issues. As a professor at the Central Political University, her demeanor was extremely steady and she was very popular.

At the beginning of the assembly, someone suggested bringing out the draft constitution discussed in the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly for joint study, but this call did not resonate, perhaps because it was too far off-topic.

Not long after the assembly began, a slight misunderstanding occurred in the venue. Representative Wu Jingxiong had submitted a written opinion to the presidium, which was read by Deputy Secretary-General Lei. The key point of the opinion was to stipulate the electoral system for professional representatives. However, a trade union representative in the back left corner mistakenly believed that Wu's opinion was to "not clearly stipulate the election of professional representatives." Thus, he shouted, "Please Representative Wu explain the reasons, or else we will 'all walk out!'" Chaos ensued. News reporters and venue staff rushed to the scene, but Deputy Secretary-General Lei's explanation immediately defused the situation. Almost as if news reporters were ready to transfer their position, with some considering that corner to be the powder keg of the assembly venue.

Minister Zhang Lisheng walked past the news reporter seats and was surrounded for a long time. He gave instructions on how the reporters should write the news: "It's best to write comprehensively" and "Be cautious."

Representative Ren Zhuoyi, formerly the renowned Ye Qing, received applause and welcome from the audience due to his brilliant speech. Despite repeated ringing of the bell on the stage, he was allowed to continue speaking, indicating that he truly had the support of the people.

The afternoon session of the seventh assembly was chaired by Liu Hengjing, the only female chair. She wore a dark purple cheongsam, with a light brown wool coat, gold-rimmed glasses, and a loosely styled bun. She gracefully took her seat amidst applause, with the tall Lei Zhen to her right, creating a sharp contrast. After accepting the photographers' camera lenses, she used Cantonese-tinged Mandarin to preside over the meeting, ringing the bell with an imposing air.

Just as the meeting started, Zhang Daofan appeared, walked up to Shao Lizi, and bowed respectfully. Shao hurriedly returned the greeting, stood up, and let him go to a seat inside. Who knew that he had gone the wrong way, and came out again, sitting in the front row. Jiang Yiping said, "Regarding Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we don't believe in his teachings simply because he is the Father of the Nation, but because of his lofty political ideals that we respect him as the Father of the Nation. We hope that the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party can all agree that the assembly should impartially revise the constitution according to the principles of the Father of the Nation's political ideals, making it perfect."

Li Wenpu advocated for establishing the capital in Beiping, and said when discussing the climate reasons: "Beiping is suitable for work in all four seasons, but Nanjing is not. In the summer, it's almost one hundred degrees, too hot to work. Every year at this time, senior government officials go to Lushan to escape the heat, delaying government affairs is a small matter, but wasting the nation's treasury is a big matter. We, the National Assembly, represent the people, and we cannot allow the people's hard-earned money to be wasted like this." This caused enthusiastic applause.

Liu Guozeng demanded that the people's right to survival be included, believing that the Principle of People's Livelihood must be realized for the people to survive. He said: "The Communist Party can only cause trouble if the Kuomintang cannot implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. If the Kuomintang had truly implemented the Principle of People's Livelihood, the Communist Party would have been eliminated long ago. Now the country is in chaos, and the people are living in misery. Know that if the people cannot survive, all laws are nonsense."

Before the break, Chairman Liu announced: "Someone said that the air in the venue is too bad because there are too many people, and requested that the doors be opened. But I think the representatives sitting by the door must be cold. After one more speech, we'll take a break and open all the doors to change the air." So, after Qiu Jianyuan delivered a passionate speech on behalf of the peasants, everyone went out to change the air.

After the break, only one person spoke, and then they began reading written opinions one after another. Two announcers took turns reading until the adjournment, but very few people were listening.

At 5:45 PM, Deng Wenyi entered the venue from the front left side. He was handsome, his military uniform was crisp, and he sat down in the empty seat of Gan Naiguang at number 453 with a stride, chatting and laughing with Wang Junying at number 451 in the next seat (several Nanjing newspapers had reported that she had been publicly recognized by the assembly as the "Queen of the National Assembly") and Chen Yiyun and Rong Xi in the front row. The topic of discussion went on until the adjournment. (December 3)

### Communist Troops Launch Offensive, Juancheng Falls, Many Townships in Yuncheng in Danger, Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway in Intense Fighting, Sun Lianzhong Goes to the Front to Supervise

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 3rd] Taking advantage of the National Army's cease-fire order, the Communist troops in Shandong Province have intensified their activities. The 13th Column of Liu Bocheng's forces and the 7th Column of Yang Mian's forces, totaling over 50,000, along with local militia, numbering around 100,000, launched an offensive against the National Army in southwestern Shandong on November 30th. The city of Juancheng was captured, and Jinxiang and Juancheng counties are also in critical condition. He Long's troops in northern Shandong have advanced from Cangxian to Dexian. Shandong convened a military and political meeting and decided to launch an effort to clear the Jinpu Railway, ordering the populace to organize stretcher-bearer units and "rescue squads," which is effectively the replenishment of troop strength. There have been no major changes in the eastern Shandong area recently.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 2nd] The Communist troops in Shandong Province are actively preparing to launch a large-scale offensive, dividing the area into three regions, intending to concentrate their forces and attack. In Jiaodong, they will focus on Gaomi to cut off the Jiaoji Railway and restore the Jiaodong corridor. In central Shandong, they will target Zibo to capture the region; in northern Shandong, they will target Jinan.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Communist troops concentrated four divisions in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, south of Baoding, engaging in fierce battles with the National Army near Yujiazhuang. Sun Lianzhong personally went to the front yesterday to supervise the troops.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 3rd] Official News: (1) The Communist troops have recently been conscripting large numbers of civilians in the area west of Baitabu in Donghai, forcibly destroying the Haizhou Railway line, causing the populace to flee in distress. (2) The Communist troops have been carrying out massacres in the Xinan Township area, branding intellectuals, youths, and landlords as "Nationalist spies" and executing them.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 3rd] Siyang News: The Communist troops within Lianshui have suffered heavy blows after repeated interceptions by the National Army. It is reported that the remaining Communist troops in Lian, Shu, Yan, and Fu total approximately 10,000, but they are severely lacking in ammunition and food. Some Communist troops are poorly clothed, and the populace calls them "beggar soldiers." According to captured Communist troops, the Communist troops' grain reserves in Lian, Shu, Yan, and Fu can only last for two months. This offensive was launched in an attempt to seize grain and clothing to prolong their existence. If the National Army tightens the encirclement and blocks the sea outlet in northern Jiangsu, they will surely perish.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 3rd] Since the National Army cleared the Si-Huai Road and recovered Dingxi, north of Dongtai, the war in northern Jiangsu has become quiet. The National Army is now strengthening pacification efforts to consolidate the recovered rural areas, allowing returning civilians to cultivate the land in peace during the winter.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Chief of Staff Guo Zongfen of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters recently announced the situation of the Communist troops attacking the National Army in western Shanxi: The Communist troops launched a full-scale offensive towards Yonghe, Daning, Shilu, Puxian, and Wuxiang. Street fighting broke out in Gexian at 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month, and no further reports have been received since. The city walls of Puxian were breached on the 27th of last month, and the defending troops broke through on the morning of the 28th, establishing contact with the National Army in Linfen. The National Army in Shilu also retreated automatically due to the defeat in Yonghe and Gexian. Currently, Communist troops with a strength of 14,000 are attacking Jixian.

### Widespread Talk of Taking Over Dalian, Residents of Lushun and Dalian in Shenyang Prepare to Return Home, Staff Officer of the Andong Garrison Command Meets with Soviet Commander

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] There is much talk about the National Army's impending takeover of Dalian. Residents of Lushun and Dalian in Shenyang are preparing to return home, but the military authorities have avoided making any statements. According to a compilation of news from various sources, the National Army is currently advancing to the vicinity of Shihe. Shihe is located between Fuxian and Jinzhou, approximately 150 to 160 li from Dalian. Shihe is currently garrisoned by Soviet troops, which is the outer boundary of Dalian under the Sino-Soviet Treaty. How things will develop in the future remains to be seen.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Gong Xuesui, the newly appointed mayor of Dalian, stated in a letter to friends from the Northeast that he is scheduled to go to the Northeast via Beiping at the end of this month, but there is no definite news about the takeover of Dalian.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Today, military officials denied the rumor that the National Army had already entered the city of Dalian, but many believe that the National Army may enter the port within a week. Another report stated that the National Army, advancing south from Kaiping, 110 miles from Dalian, has reached a location nine miles from Dalian.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] At 10:00 AM on the 1st, Lei Kewen, the staff officer of the Andong Garrison Command, held talks with Colonel Kravov, the commander of the Soviet troops stationed in Sinuiju, in the middle of the Yalu River railway bridge. As a result, the 90-li Changdian River Estuary on the Andong side was officially handed over to our army by the Soviet troops at noon on the 2nd. A medium-sized motorboat from our side, which had sailed from Dadonggou to Andong, went missing in the Longyanpu area. Colonel K stated that the boat was detained by the Soviet army due to getting lost and will be returned in the coming days. Regarding the issue of Korean residents returning to their country, Colonel K said that he needs to consult before a decision can be made. The talks lasted for an hour and were extremely harmonious.

### French Reporter Reports on Dalian Today

[Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 2nd] A French Agence France-Presse reporter, Jelson, recently telegraphed, stating that according to responsible sources, the Soviet troops in Dalian city withdrew in April of this year. Since then, there has been no trace of Soviet soldiers in Dalian city. This is a fact witnessed by everyone. The American consulate in Dalian has likely telegraphed this matter to the State Department, but outside rumors are rampant, claiming that the Soviet troops did not withdraw until November and handed over the Dalian city administration to the Chinese Communist Party. This statement is purely fictional, and the world should not believe it to be true. Since the end of April, the Soviet expatriates living in Dalian city have all been civilians, mostly civil servants of the Dalian city government. According to the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty signed in August 1945, the Dalian city administration is jointly governed by China and the Soviet Union. In the past seven months, although there have been no soldiers in Dalian city, there are still Soviet troops stationed outside the city. Therefore, in fact, Dalian city is still within the Soviet defense zone of Lushun. According to this Soviet defense zone, it extends 30 miles northeast to Dalian city, almost cutting the south of the former Japanese-leased Kwantung territory. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian is a free port and no troops may be stationed there. Therefore, in Dalian city, except for the police, there are no troops stationed. Furthermore, due to this regulation, it is impossible for the National Army to enter Dalian city. This is because if the National Army enters Dalian city by land, it will inevitably clash with the Soviet troops. According to General Du Yuming's statement a few days ago, the National Army will not use force to take over Dalian. The National Army has been waiting outside the Soviet defense zone for more than a month. In addition, it is said that the Dalian city government was elected by the local people. Although not 100% Communist Party members, the Communist Party's influence is very strong.

### National Army in the Northeast Recovers Changling

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] A certain unit of the National Army recovered Changling (approximately 400 li east of Changchun) at 2:00 PM on November 30th.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 3rd] Lin Biao, the commander-in-chief of the Communist troops in the Northeast, has been gradually expanding his offensive. His troops have attacked the National Army's positions south of the Songhua River between Harbin and Changchun.

### Rumor that Fu Zuoyi has Arrived in Beiping

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] Fu Zuoyi flew from Nanjing to Beiping at 2:00 PM this afternoon. It is rumored that Fu originally planned to return directly to Zhangjiakou from Nanjing, but due to military issues, he needed to consult with the Eleventh War Zone, so he stayed in Beiping for one night. Regarding the personnel details of the reorganization of the provincial governments of Chahar and Suiyuan, Fu has discussed them with the central government during this trip to Nanjing and will be announced soon.

### Communist Troops Plant Landmines to Disrupt Transportation, Train on the Beining Railway Destroyed, Train Conductor Stabbed, Passengers and Staff Kidnapped

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 3rd] On the night of the 2nd, a train between Beidaihe and Liushouying on the Beining Railway hit a landmine planted by the Communist troops. Five cars were destroyed, and twelve cars were derailed. The Communist troops along the railway immediately broke into the train and looted it extensively. The train conductor was stabbed, and the staff and passengers on the train were kidnapped. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Traffic on the Pingjin line will be interrupted for a day or two.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] The Xin-Bing section of the Tongpu Northern Line has been repaired and is now open to traffic. The Southern Line is being repaired southward from Yitang and has crossed the two rivers to one kilometer north of Lingshi.

### Li Shouxin Renames Himself Zizhong, His Troops Have Been Transferred to Northern Rehe

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] After Li Shouxin was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Rehe People's Self-Defense Army, he has been transferred to Kaiping in northern Rehe. His task from now on is to expand local armed forces and assist the National Army in pacifying Rehe. However, the province's local troops, which originally had five battalions, are now planning to expand to ten battalions. Li has changed his name to Zizhong. The power generation facilities in Rehe Province have not yet been restored.

### A Record of an Inspection of the Blockhouse Lines in Northern Shaanxi, No National Army within Hundreds of Li of Yijun and Other Counties, Most of the People's Self-Defense Forces Disbanded by Communist Troops

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 3rd] After inspecting the blockhouse line areas in Yijun, Tongguan, Yaoxian, and Chunhua counties in northern Shaanxi, our reporter returned to Xi'an. There is not a single National Army soldier within hundreds of li of the blockhouse lines. All of them were the last to withdraw during the ceasefire. The People's Self-Defense Forces of various counties who took over the blockhouse lines have inferior weapons and most have been disbanded by the Communist troops. The counties close to the border areas, which previously had their taxes waived due to the people's hardships, have been decided to be restored next year. The people have expressed dissatisfaction with this. In the Yihuang area from Huangling to Xunyi over the last half month, the Communist troops have amassed large forces. As of now, there are the Red 6th Regiment and the Red 8th Regiment of the Police 1st Brigade, the 516th Regiment and 177th Regiment of the New 4th Brigade, the Provisional 2nd Brigade and 3rd Brigade of the New 4th Army, and the Police 3rd Regiment. Their regular activities include murdering Baojia personnel, seizing weapons, and taking away livestock, carts, grain, materials, and supplies. There has been a slight lull recently, but the situation is still tense. In the area east of the Xianyu Highway, which was originally not part of the border area, multiple groups of unidentified armed forces have gathered. When our reporter left Tongguan the day before yesterday, the town of Hongtu, 30 li east of the city, was captured, the town chief was killed, and livestock and supplies were taken away. They frequently enter and exit the area around Huangling County, and the situation in Huangyi is more serious. The border line between the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area seems to be in a state of uncertainty. The National Army along the Xianyu Highway constantly sends letters to persuade the Communist troops not to approach the county towns, otherwise they will be shot. Since the victory, the number of National Army troops in northern Shaanxi has decreased significantly. Currently, only a small number of National Army troops are stationed in each county. On the Xianyu Highway and various rural roads, our reporter only encountered two empty trucks heading north during ten days in Tongguan. The road was desolate, and the cold dust obscured the sun, with only mule caravans for company. Overall, in terms of the military situation, the Communist troops can break through the defense line and advance south at any time. The small number of National Army troops stationed there greatly surprised our reporter.

### Such a "Liberation" Movement

Shaanxi Communists Force Churches to Hand Over Church Property

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd] The Communist Party has recently been vigorously carrying out the "liberation" movement in the Sanbian area of northern Shaanxi, forcing Catholic churches in Weizi Liangshan Bridge, Baini Well, Heilang Bay, and other places to hand over church property, and also demanding the collection of rent grain from the churches since 1935. Belgian and Chinese priests Mei Jiding, Sha Zhilin, Gong Dehua, and others fled one after another due to unbearable oppression. Some were detained by Communist troops in Sanbian and suffered severe abuse. In addition to instructing various counties to rescue them, the Shaanxi Provincial Government has also ordered the Department of Social Affairs to allocate funds for relief.

### American Bishop Cai Fasi Subjected to "Liquidation" and Interrogation

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] Robert P. Post of the New York Times reported yesterday from Xuzhou on the Chinese Communist Party's abuse of Bishop Cai Fasi of the Catholic Church in Daming. It is reported that the 53-year-old bishop was expelled and came to Xuzhou after the CCP occupied Daming. Cai Fasi was subjected to liquidation and interrogation. During the CCP's interrogation, after being beaten, he was convicted and fined 30 tons of grain and 47 million yuan (wartime currency). When Bishop Cai stated that he was unable to pay the fine, the Communist Party confiscated the church and all its furniture and livestock and confiscated 33 acres of land. The bishop also said that the Communists also abused Christians. Bishop Cai has gone to Shanghai to heal the wounds he sustained during the interrogation.

### Implementation Measures for Cooperative Enterprises in Pacification Zones Have Been Announced

The purpose is to improve the basic social and economic organization and develop the people's livelihood economy. In principle, a cooperative organization in the pacification zone should be established in each county town and each township, and a joint cooperative should be established in each county.

### The Darkness Within the Chinese Communist Party is Fully Exposed in the "Instructions on Mass Movement," Admitting that the Work of Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction is Still Extremely Unbalanced

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] The key document of the Communist Party, "Instructions on the Universal Mass Movement in the Jin-Sui Border Region," obtained from relevant sources, is over 5,000 words long. Its content is sufficient to expose the darkness within the Communist Party, no different from a self-confession.

Regarding the so-called mass movement in the Jin-Sui border region, the document says that there are many shortcomings. From a regional perspective, the work of rent reduction and interest reduction is still extremely unbalanced. The masses have not yet been mobilized. The cadres have the opportunistic idea of working to write reports to their superiors.

"In terms of work and policy control," the document says: Our shortcomings and errors are even more serious. All work does not start from the urgent demands of the masses at the time and place, but is instead replaced by doing everything for them and forced orders. It also says: The policy of rent reduction and interest reduction, from the district to the county, from the county to the district, and even to the heads of village cadres, is that if there is no landlord, they will fight the rich peasant, if there is no rich peasant, they will fight the middle peasant, and some even reach out to the poor peasant, unlimited rent refunds and clearing of old debts; some even cleared up to the Guangxu period, and the clearing of debts was changed to clearing up the account books, and some even brought out the ancestral tablets of three generations, so not only did they not mobilize the masses, but they greatly suppressed the production enthusiasm of the masses. Of course, rich peasants want to reduce production, and even the poor laborers who have turned over and bought land dare not produce boldly, fearing that they will be fought if they plant too much land. The masses believe that "in this era, it is enough to get by and not die." They think that whoever has it will be fought, pouring cold water on the masses. This is leadership bureaucracy.

### A Staff Member of the Hebei Provincial Government Commits Suicide by Drinking Blue Ink

Life Difficulties Lead to Short-Sightedness

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] Tian Zemin, a staff member of the First Section of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Government, due to soaring prices, difficult living conditions, and the impending birth of his wife, whose monthly salary was not enough for ten days' use, suddenly had a short-sighted idea at his home on the evening of the 2nd, drinking twelve bottles of blue ink and stabbing his navel with a steel pen in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was discovered early and sent to the provincial hospital for treatment, and his life is no longer in danger.

### United States to Send a Second Batch of Experts to China to Study Agriculture, Zou Bingwen to Attend Food Conference in the United States

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] The Sino-American Agricultural Study Group has just completed its mission, and the United States is about to send a second study group to China. Its members are all experts in the use of agricultural machinery. The leader of the group is Davidson, the director of the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Iowa State University. The members include agricultural machinery expert Stone, farm construction expert Hansen, and farmland irrigation expert Macaulay. This study is intended to stay in China for three years, and its expenses are subsidized by an agreement between the International Farm Products Company and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Nanjing Government. The International Farm Products Company has also established 20 agricultural science scholarships to subsidize Chinese students studying at graduate schools in the United States.

### Negotiations on the Haiphong Incident Yield No Results, Tension Remains in Hanoi, French Commissioner to Vietnam Says He is Quite Satisfied with Sino-French Relations

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 2nd] Although the Battle of Haiphong has ended, relations between France and Vietnam have not improved in any way. In Hanoi, the atmosphere is very tense because the French and Vietnamese sides have been unable to reach an agreement on resolving the Haiphong incident. The Vietnamese and French newspapers here continue to accuse each other. The Vietnamese government has ordered the people to evacuate the city to prevent any eventuality, and some Vietnamese government agencies have also been moved out. The Vietnamese Propaganda Department issued a statement announcing the negotiations between France and Vietnam to resolve the Haiphong incident, stating that the negotiations have not yet yielded results.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Vice Admiral d'Argenlieu, recently stated in an interview with the "Climate" magazine that relations between China and France are quite satisfactory. We are currently implementing the economic agreement recently signed between China and France. Regarding the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Vietnam, it was not easy, and much of the credit should be given to President Chiang's political wisdom. President Chiang was successful in overcoming the local troops' egoism and the imperialism of some military leaders, which is commendable.

[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 2nd] Officials recently announced that a special delegation from the Vietnamese Viet Minh government departed for Siam today. Vietnamese expatriates in Siam gathered to welcome the delegation and held a demonstration, passing the following resolutions: (1) Fully support President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh government; (2) Continue to fight for Vietnam's independence and territorial integrity; (3) Oppose France's implementation of terrorism in southern Vietnam and southern Annam and its willful provocation in Tonkin; (4) Strive for the implementation of the Franco-Vietnamese Provisional Agreement by all possible means.

### Stark Contrast in Qingdao: Citizens' Lives are Difficult, Receiving Personnel are Licentious; Bandit Traces are Seen from Time to Time in the Suburbs; Martial Law on the Sea Starting from the 5th

[Our Newspaper Qingdao, 3rd] Qingdao, a summer resort of victory, is gradually becoming deserted in winter. There are only a little over a thousand U.S. Navy personnel stationed here now. Prices are high, exceeding those in Shanghai. The business community is generally depressed. Strikes have occurred in recent days. The hardship of the general public's life contrasts sharply with the licentiousness of the receiving personnel. Bandit traces are seen from time to time dozens of miles outside the city. The garrison headquarters announced that martial law will be imposed on the sea from 5:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, starting from the 5th, prohibiting civilian ships from entering and exiting.

### Tianjin Stallholders Stop Business to Protest the City Government's Order to Relocate

[Central News Agency Tianjin, 3rd] The vegetable market in the former French Concession of Tianjin is a concentrated area for stallholders. Since the influx of American goods here, the number of stallholders has increased daily, and it is extremely lively. Recently, the city government, considering the area to be the traffic center of the city and the presence of many stalls obstructs traffic, negotiated with the municipal Chamber of Commerce and decided to select Zhang Zizhong Road as the stallholders' trading area, ordering them to relocate. Upon hearing this, the stallholders, believing that losses would be huge if they relocated near the end of the year, formed a kneeling petition group and went to the Municipal Government Police Bureau to petition for a postponement of the relocation. The city government stated that the order could not be withdrawn and must be enforced, resulting in the issue becoming serious due to the stalemate. The Chamber of Commerce and local gentry are currently trying to persuade them to withdraw, but all the stallholders have automatically stopped trading to show their protest.

Editorial

### The Rumor of an Anglo-American Alliance

The London "Daily Worker" reported on the 1st that Britain will soon conclude a military alliance treaty with the United States. Once Alexander takes office as Minister of Defense, this treaty will be implemented. Although this shocking news has been denied by the British Army, we cannot but pay considerable attention to the origin of this rumor. Especially in these days when the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the investigation of foreign troops in various countries, the overall reduction of armaments, and the survival of the veto power, the waves on the Lake of Success are rising one after another, which truly makes us worry about the future of the world.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the National Foreign Affairs Association held a symposium on "The International Situation and China," reviewing the evolution of the world situation and our country's diplomatic way out. All the international affairs experts who participated in the symposium believed that today's world has reached a crossroads. One road leads to "one world," as long as Britain and the Soviet Union, together with all other peace-loving countries, cooperate closely to restore the wartime spirit of unity and cooperation to create world peace, they will be able to make the post-war world enter the ideal realm of "one world." The other road leads to "two worlds." Observing the political trends of various countries since the end of World War II, it is clear that the opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union has the possibility of splitting today's world into "two worlds." In the situation of opposition between these two worlds, there can be no peace in the world. All peace-loving countries do not want to see the reality of "two worlds." However, the rumor of an Anglo-American alliance can indeed increase our worries about Britain and the United States going their separate ways. Compared to this, we have to pay close attention.

Since the end of World War II, the work of creating peace has been continuously carried out through the efforts of politicians and diplomats of various countries. In this year and four months, the international community has held numerous foreign ministers' meetings, Paris conferences, and United Nations General Assemblies. However, true peace has not only not yet come to the world, but also this world is moving further and further away from the "gate of peace," which makes everyone feel disappointed. Looking at the situation of the United Nations General Assembly these days, one cannot but think that the great powers' diplomats are "joking" there. The world is now standing at a crossroads, which road will it take? Under the turbulent waves of the Lake of Success, the future of the world feels even more uncertain. Hearing the rumor that Britain and the United States will form an alliance naturally gives rise to a sense of "bewilderment."

An Anglo-American alliance is not surprising from a racial, political, economic, military, or historical point of view. Britain and the United States are both Anglo-Saxon nations, with the same blood and language, and similar customs and habits. They are fundamentally two countries that cannot be separated. Moreover, in both the First and Second World Wars, the United States spared no cost to stand on Britain's side and participate in the war, both achieving glorious victories. Therefore, in fact, there has long been a kind of "unwritten treaty" between Britain and the United States. Assuming a new war unfortunately breaks out, even if Britain and the United States do not conclude a treaty, the United States will inevitably still stand on Britain's side. But why are people so alarmed when they hear the rumor that Britain and the United States will form an alliance? This is because the people of all countries in the world, after the war, have learned from the pain and believe that the great powers should unite rather than separate. On the current international stage, the opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is already very obvious and seems inevitable. However, political and diplomatic efforts in various countries are still making every effort to achieve international understanding and cooperation, and it cannot be considered that hope has been completely lost. Moreover, everyone knows that if Britain and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate, there is no hope for peace in Europe; similarly, if Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate, there will be no peace in the world. The United Nations General Assembly is currently meeting on the shores of the Lake of Success. How to eliminate suspicions between countries and all the shadows in the international community, so as not to split into "two worlds," but to promote the realization of "one world," all peace-loving and peace-desiring people in various countries have consistent and great expectations. Especially hope that the United Nations General Assembly can complete its mission in a friendly atmosphere. Now, the rumor of an Anglo-American alliance is spreading internationally, which is really extremely unfavorable news for the United Nations General Assembly.

I remember that former British Prime Minister Churchill, within this year, repeatedly made remarks. Once, in a speech in Fulton, USA, he advocated Anglo-American cooperation. Another time in France, he advocated an Anglo-French alliance; and another time in Switzerland, he advocated Franco-German cooperation. All of these made people suspect that people like Churchill were trying to organize a Western group to confront the Soviet Union, insisting on dividing "one world" into "two worlds." Our country hopes that the post-war world will step into a new era of peace and democracy, and we cannot agree with any proposition that will split the world and form a confrontational group. This newspaper has also repeatedly commented on this, and all believe that it is inappropriate. Therefore, we do not believe in the rumor of an Anglo-American alliance. Although the diplomatic policy adopted by the British Labor Party government has maintained the style of the Conservative Party, it will not lightly engage in diplomatic actions that are enough to cause a sense of division in the world. What's more, recently some Labor Party members have expressed dissatisfaction with the current diplomatic policy and submitted amendments to the House of Commons, advocating a transcendent and independent policy, demanding that the government adopt a policy that "opposes Soviet communism while opposing American imperialism." Although it was rejected by the House of Commons, in any case, this move is still a warning to the Labor Party government, making it have to be more cautious about the diplomatic measures it will often take in the future.

### Prospects for the Anglo-Indian Conference

British Governor-General of India Wavell, along with Indian Interim Government Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah, Finance Minister Ali Khan, and Defense Minister Baldev Singh, flew to Britain on the same plane and have arrived in London. The Anglo-Indian Round Table Conference is about to open, and the British Cabinet has also decided on the agenda of the meeting. This is the first joint meeting of the British, Indian, and Muslim sides since the Calcutta Massacre on August 16. The venue is far away in London, which can avoid the direct impulse of public emotions, and representatives from the three sides can use a more calm mind to deal with this complex and urgent problem.

It was not easy to convene this meeting successfully. When Nehru formed the interim government on September 2 under Wavell's invitation, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah not only refused to participate, but also instructed all Indian Muslims to hang black flags on the day the new government was established to show resistance, resulting in continued violent clashes. Later, on October 3, Jinnah met with Wavell and his attitude suddenly changed, resolutely deciding to participate in the new government. However, Jinnah suddenly expressed opposition to the Constituent Assembly meeting scheduled to be convened on December 9. Wavell contacted Jinnah and decided to convene this London 　　conference. Jinnah agreed, and Nehru expressed his unwillingness to attend because he was afraid of delaying the convening of the Constituent Assembly. Later, Prime Minister Attlee was willing to guarantee the success of the Indian Constituent Assembly, and Nehru agreed to return.

From the above series of facts, we can know that this London Round Table Conference has three fundamental issues: first, the future status of Muslims in the Indian government; second, to what extent can Nehru concede to the Muslims? Third, whether the British government allows India to be truly independent.

Muslims cannot compete with Indians in elections because their population is less than 100 million, accounting for a quarter of the total Indian population. What Muslims are now striving for is Pakistan, that is, the separation of India and Pakistan, with Muslims forming Pakistan independently, or Muslims can occupy more positions in the Indian government to avoid any unfavorable measures taken by Indians relying on the majority. Jinnah initially refused to participate in the interim government, and now he is unwilling to participate in the Constituent Assembly for this motive. However, on Nehru's side, he feels that he has made sufficient concessions to the Muslim League. Muslims occupy six seats in the interim government. In the future, the Constituent Assembly can also specially stipulate in the constitution for Muslims so that Muslims do not feel oppressed. Now the Muslim League is fundamentally unwilling to participate in the Constituent Assembly, and its attitude is too tough. Therefore, Nehru criticized the Muslim League leaders for having a fascist style, and the reason for this is also this.

In addition to the conflict between India and Muslims, the most important thing is the attitude of the British government. After the First World War, Britain broke its promise to allow India to be independent. After the Second World War, the national movements in various colonies rose one after another, and the British government felt that it could not completely adopt a policy of military suppression. For India, only by letting her be independent can it still gain the favor of the Indians, and it can retain important rights in military and economic aspects. Therefore, Britain's permission for India to be independent is not willing, but is compelled by the situation. If there is an opportunity to control it for one more day, she will still try her best to maintain the old forces. 、

The internal conflict between India and Muslims is a fatal wound to the future of Indian independence. Because if India and Muslims are united, the British government has little to do. The Indians can train their own national defense forces according to Nehru's proposal and ask the British army to return to their country. In terms of commerce, cooperate with the United States and the Soviet Union and not allow the British to monopolize. India's true freedom and independence can be easily achieved, but the non-cooperation between India and Muslims allows the British government to take the opportunity to use divisive tactics. At the time of the formation of the interim government, Jinnah attacked the British government and Nehru for cooperating and oppressing Muslims. Now Jinnah had a discussion with Wavell and immediately joined the new government. This time there is another London conference. In the eyes of Nehru and the Indians, the British government and the Muslim League cannot avoid the suspicion of collusion. Therefore, Nehru told reporters from the United Press in Cairo: "If the British army withdraws from India, the National Congress Party and the Muslim League will reach an agreement, which will be easier."

We want to advise the Indian and Muslim races to be independent and autonomous and not to be fooled by others. The freedom and independence of all India cannot be built on internal struggles, let alone on the support of others. Only unity can generate strength, and only peace can build the country. At the same time, we also hope that the British Labor Party government will abandon outdated colonialism and the policy of balanced power and "divide and rule" of President 　. In today's era of 　　ethnic awareness development, power and fraud can no longer be used as good tools to maintain the British Empire. The British 　 government's vision should focus on the future. In case there are international disputes in the future, whether the 350 million Indians will be friends or enemies of the British depends on what attitude the British government decides to take in this London Round Table Conference. Therefore, we sincerely hope that after this Round Table Conference attended by the British, Indian, and Muslim parties, an agreement can be reached, so that the Constituent Assembly convened on the 9th of this month can be opened as scheduled.

### Thirteen Robbers Escape from Suzhou Prison: Using Foreign Lead Sheet as a Sharp Tool to Dig Holes and Break Through Walls; Only Two Captured in the Dark Night

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 3rd] Around 3:00 AM on the 3rd, the Suzhou County Local Court Guard House suddenly discovered that inmates Yuan Dahua, Huang Yonglin, Wang Xiangsheng, Ma Shijie, Hu Xiaoquan, Song Wanxin, Zhong Rongsheng, Huang Zhenhua, Zhu Daguozi, Zhou A'er, Wu Genmu, Wu Linquan, and opium addict Fan Gensheng, a total of thirteen prisoners, had committed a major jailbreak and fled. Court President Wang Yu immediately ordered all bailiffs and guards to mobilize, guarding all city gates, and captured two robber prisoners, Wu Genmu and Wu Linquan. At dawn, President Wang, accompanied by Chief Prosecutor Kan Yue, led Warden Yin Zaicheng to report to the Suzhou High Court and requested punishment. The two heads of the High Court were on a tour of northern Jiangsu, so Zhang Qi'e, the acting director of the First Criminal Tribunal, dispatched two clerks, Mao Yuyu and Ji Yudong, to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. It was found that the inmates Yuan Dahua, etc., had secretly gone to the side of the room wall from the gap under the wooden bed board, dug a tunnel with a foreign lead sheet, passed through the passage outside the room that only allowed people to walk, and reached the surrounding wall, and then broke through the hole to escape, so that the patrols and guards did not notice. It was not until there was no one in the room that it was discovered. Because it was dark at the time, it was easy to hide, so in addition to the two prisoners who were captured, the rest escaped. The police are now searching in all directions and intensifying the pursuit. Our reporter made a special trip to visit President Wang to inquire about his views on this incident. He was pleased to make the following remarks: The responsible department is undoubtedly to blame for the responsibility issue in this case, and the court and prosecutor's office also have shortcomings in supervision. However, to go a step further, the construction of the court's guard house is difficult to be strong due to limited funds, and it accommodates more than 400 inmates, while the entire guard has only 20 people, and supervision is also difficult to be thorough. In order to enhance the vigilance of my subordinates, I often go to inspect it personally before going to bed every night. When I went to see it at 7:00 PM on the 2nd night, I still did not feel any signs. It is true that the room is narrow and crowded, and it is not easy to detect one or two people missing by digging secretly under the bed board. Moreover, it was a tunnel escape, which was beyond expectations, so the lack of financial and human resources is also one of the reasons for the formation of this case. Now, in addition to trying my best to arrest them, I often wait for President Sun and Chief Han of the High Court to return to Suzhou to decide on the disposal method. The reporter then inquired about the sentencing situation of the fugitives, and he replied that most of them were still in the investigation or trial process, only a few had been sentenced, and the most severe sentence was twenty years. However, these people are all habitual thieves and have special skills in excavation.

### Under the Principle of Not Obstructing Traffic, Suzhou and Hangzhou Concede to Allow Stalls; Hangzhou Police Chief Restrains His Subordinates to Cherish Themselves

[Our Newspaper Suzhou News] The Suzhou City Defense Headquarters previously ordered the police bureau to ban stallholders in the Guanqian Street area in order to rectify the city appearance, and designated the sidewalk behind the Guohuo Company of the North Bureau and the Xinshi Market at the First Tianmen as concentrated business locations for stallholders. However, the stallholders believed that the above two places were remote and sparsely populated, and their livelihood was bleak, and it was bound to be difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, they formed a "Stallholders Friendship Association" and gathered more than 300 stallholders in Yuemiao Temple to discuss response measures, and decided to petition the authorities. At that time, the police bureau was afraid of accidents, so it sent many policemen to maintain order. Now the City Defense Headquarters has approved the change of the ban method, stipulating that although stallholders are still not allowed to set up stalls on the sidewalk of Guanqian Street, stallholders are allowed to set up stalls in the alleys (lanes) and shops in the Guanqian area, under the principle of not obstructing traffic. The method is softened, and all the stallholders have expressed their agreement to accept it.

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] When the Hangzhou Police Bureau held a memorial week at 8:00 AM on the 2nd, Chief Shen Pu instructed each branch bureau to pay attention to three things: (1) The ban on stallholders in Shanghai caused a great disturbance. This city has made considerable achievements in this work. In the future, when performing duties, if the stallholders do not obstruct traffic order, their livelihood must be taken into account and they are allowed to set up stalls. (2) Each branch bureau and supervisor should strictly review their subordinates, cherish themselves, and avoid causing trouble. (3) For the convenience of management, the security police stationed in various agencies and banks will be re-divided from this month.

### Returning from Selling Rice; Robbed by Bandits; Yitai Rice Shop in Weiting Suffers Loss

[Our Weiting Report] The Yitai Rice Shop in Xiatang, this town, is large in scale. In addition to retail sales, it also transports rice to Kunshan and Shanghai for sale. On the 27th of last month, [they] returned from selling rice [elsewhere]. At midnight on the 28th, seven bandits, each carrying firearms, suddenly arrived at the rear of the residence, dug a deep hole to enter, and immediately captured the shop owner, Li Zhongying. They intimidated him in every way, demanding that he hand over the money from the rice sales. Under duress, the shop had to hand over several sacks of original banknotes.

### Financial Difficulties in Anhui Province Counties; District Meetings Convened for Balancing

[Our Hefei Report] Anhui Province's provincial finances are severely deficient, and county-level finances are even more difficult. According to repeated talks with county magistrates who have come to the province, the meager salaries and subsidies of county-level staff and primary school teachers are often delayed by two or three months before they can be paid. Moreover, the deficits made up by misappropriation are often rejected by the County Council during review. To solve the county-level difficulties, the Finance Department has obtained approval from the provincial government to send personnel to Bengbu, Wuhu, and Anqing in early December to convene county-level financial balancing meetings, to discuss the reorganization of taxation, the clearing of public school property, and ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The Bengbu meeting is scheduled for December 5th to 7th, the Wuhu meeting for December 25th to 27th, and the Anqing meeting for December 20th to 22nd. Orders have been telegraphed to the commissioners of the ten districts throughout the province, county and city mayors, and heads of financial institutions to arrive at the designated meeting locations in advance to attend. It is reported that Director of Finance Pu Mengjiu will also rush to preside over the meetings in turn.

### Current Financial Situation in Anhui Province

[Our Hefei Report] The revenue and expenditure of Anhui Province have always been unbalanced. Since the implementation of the central, provincial (city), and county (city) three-level system in July of this year, the province's share of the agricultural tax (or land tax) at 20% and the business tax at 50% is too small. It is estimated that the total income for the second half of the year may not exceed 3 to 4 billion yuan, while the expenditure will reach 10 billion yuan, a huge discrepancy. It was originally planned that the shortfall for July, August, and September would be subsidized by the central government, but due to the shortage of income, the three months of October, November, and December still require central government subsidies. Since July of this year, county-level finances have been operating according to the "new fiscal system." In addition to the original statutory taxes and levies, an additional 50% of the agricultural tax (or land tax) and business tax has been allocated, and all of the deed tax goes to the county. Their income is more abundant than before. However, since the counties are autonomous units, the expenses required for the development of various self-reliant undertakings are very large. Counting the second half of this year, the expenditure of all counties in the province is about 30 billion yuan, while the income is only over 10 billion yuan, a large disparity between revenue and expenditure. Therefore, the financial situation of both the province and the counties is currently in deficit. The Department of Finance is closely planning how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure in the province. The takeover of various provincial and county taxes by the county collection agencies has been completed. The names of the agencies have been designated as "Tax Collection Bureaus" to distinguish them from the original county "Tax Collection Offices." They are divided into five grades, depending on the amount of annual collection, and the number of personnel employed is also proportional to the grade. Director of Finance Pu Mengjiu is extremely cautious about the selection of heads of the tax collection bureaus, and the principles of appointment are divided into four types: (1) The original directors of the tax collection offices who have achieved outstanding results will be reappointed. (2) Those who were originally transferred from the central tax bureaus to the provincial level and have excellent performance will be retained as appropriate. (3) Those who have previously engaged in financial work, have rich experience, and have achieved excellent results will be appointed. (4) Those recommended by various parties will be selected and appointed. Separate appointment and reward and punishment measures have been formulated to bring the province's tax administration into order.

### Strange Disease on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line; Diarrhea and Bloated Abdomen Lead to Death; Many Students in Mudu Infected

[Our City Report] Zhang Bingrui, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Health Affairs Committee, recently returned from inspecting health conditions in various parts of Jiangsu Province. According to his report: "A strange disease has recently been discovered along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line, prevalent near Mudu in Suzhou, called the 'Blood-Sucking Disease.' Patients first experience diarrhea, followed by swelling of the spleen and abdomen, eventually leading to death. According to investigations, up to 25% of primary school students in Mudu are infected with this disease. The Jiangsu Provincial Health Department and the Central Health Laboratory have recently established clinics in Mudu to prevent its spread. As for the treatment of the Blood-Sucking Disease, there are effective drugs available abroad, and the Executive Yuan is urging the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to purchase them. Recently, a new disease has been discovered in Jiangbei, a type of yaws, prevalent in the Huaiyin area, a skin disease transmitted by the Japanese army from the South Pacific during the war, which is easier to treat." Zhang also recounted the recent health situation in various places along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line, saying that hospitals in Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi are actively repairing buildings and reorganizing internally, and are expected to return to normal before the end of the year. The Executive Yuan will supply the hospitals with medical equipment to improve the health conditions in various places.

### Qingpu Captures Bandit Gang

### Zhejiang Land Tax Collection in Kind; Only One-Tenth Collected

### Former County Magistrate of Bogus Hao County, Zhao Qizhai, Preliminary Trial Completed

Hope for Improvement in Coffin Transportation Methods

First Letter Since the news spread that the Municipal Health Bureau will clear accumulated coffins in the urban area, coffin families have not been without feeling anxious. According to reports, there are as many as 100,000 accumulated coffins in this city, a number that is shocking. The reason for reaching this huge number is nothing more than that since the eight years of the War of Resistance, there have been many people living in this city who have been unable to return to their hometowns. When family members died, arranging coffins was already difficult, let alone having the spare capacity to purchase land for burial. In addition, the suburbs are unsettled, and transportation is blocked. Even if they have the heart to escort the coffins back to their hometowns, the environment does not allow it. Moreover, many coffin families are travelers whose hometowns cannot be reached quickly. At this time of material hardship, it is not easy for them to immediately raise large sums of money to arrange transportation. From this, it can be seen that those who have kept coffins for a long time without transporting them have their own unavoidable difficulties.

The nature of our people is simple and honest, and many still adhere to traditional concepts such as burying ancestors in their ancestral tombs and burying parents together. Although the authorities have allowed a grace period of three months, can coffin families fully handle it as scheduled? Otherwise, when the deadline expires in the blink of an eye, and the authorities incinerate them as unclaimed coffins, it seems that they have not deeply sympathized with their desire to enshrine them and the Chinese old etiquette of filial piety, which is regrettable.

The health authorities place emphasis on the fact that such a large number of coffins are stored in a place where millions of people gather, and for the health of the citizens, it is appropriate to thoroughly remove them. They have already considered it for the coffin families and extended the deadline to March of next year, which cannot be said to be inconsiderate. Those coffin families who can afford it should carry it out as soon as possible, on the one hand, to obey the law, and on the other hand, to fulfill their own obligations, and they must not continue to procrastinate and bring trouble on themselves. However, for those coffin families with weak ability, where the economy is already difficult, or where transportation is inconvenient, or where their hometowns are still occupied by soldiers and bandits and it is not easy to handle, it seems that the authorities should be asked to extend the deadline further. Can it be approved that within the original extended deadline, the coffins stored in the funeral parlors and coffin storage places in the central area of this city be gradually cleared first, and then the coffins stored in the coffin storage places and mortuaries in the border areas of this city be removed in the second step, in order to complete the entire plan within one year? Then the coffin families can have the opportunity to wait for the situation to become more stable and facilitate transportation, and they can also plan a considerable amount of money to cover transportation costs, benefiting both the public and private sectors. These are humble opinions, and it is still hoped that the authorities will adopt them. (Wang Mu**)

Second Letter My friend is from Hankou, and his mother-in-law died in Shanghai and is buried in the Huxi Funeral Parlor. Recently, I heard that the Municipal Health Bureau announced that it advocates transporting them back to their hometowns. After finding a guarantor and applying for a passport at the police station, obtaining a quarantine certificate from the quarantine station, and declaring it at customs, following the regulations of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the procedures were completed, and the lucky bill of lading was also obtained. Then the coffin truck was shipped to the wharf, but unexpectedly, the problem came again. The porters at the dock asked for an exorbitant price, requiring 100,000 yuan in national currency to carry it onto the ship, and another 100,000 yuan to carry it into the ship. The managers also have to spend money, and they cannot hire other workers to carry it themselves, which is both tyrannical and unreasonable. The authorities turned a blind eye. Such a troublesome and costly affair. The municipality's plan to clear accumulated coffins by the end of this year, I guess: will again be hindered by the facts and cannot be implemented, because most of the poor and miserable people cannot afford it, so they have to watch as they are cremated. Now I come up with an extra request to the municipal government, can the above troublesome procedures be reformed and simplified a bit? Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is state-run, there should be a strict way to stop these porters from extorting them indiscriminately, and try to improve it. I hope that the responsible persons in the relevant authorities will seek more benefits for the people, so that the municipal government's plan may be realized! (Xiao She)

### Call for Attention to Public Security in Nanshi

Taosha Yard Street, Shizi Street, and Sanpailou Street in Nanshi are all thoroughfares that run through the northern half of the city, and are also the only routes for residents in the city center to return from north to south. However, in addition to the fact that the above-mentioned places have been rugged and in disrepair for many years, there are no street lights installed, and after dark, it is so dark that you cannot see your fingers. As the winter defense is approaching, it is inevitable that petty thieves will hide and cause trouble. It is hoped that the Bureau of Public Works will install street lights in that area, and that the Police Bureau will assign more police officers or step up patrols in that area, in order to maintain the peace of the citizens.

### Economic Unification of German Occupation Zones; Agreement Signed by Britain and the United States; Costs Shared Equally, Setting Germany on a Self-Sufficient Basis

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin simultaneously announced: the economic merger of the British and American zones in Germany. Byrnes also said that before the end of the Foreign Ministers' meeting in New York, he would ask the British, Soviet, and French Foreign Ministers to discuss the peace treaties with Austria and Germany.

[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] According to an announcement by the State Department: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin signed an agreement here today to economically merge their respective occupied zones in Germany, in order to make the economies of these zones self-sufficient within three years. This matter had been negotiated for a long time in Berlin, Washington, and here, and now it has come to a conclusion. However, the Soviet and French occupation zones have not shown any signs of participating. The special negotiators for the past two weeks have been General Clay, commander of the American occupation forces in Germany, and General Robertson, commander of the British occupation forces. Clay arrived here yesterday from Washington with a draft agreement, which was reviewed for the final time by Byrnes and Bevin this morning without any objections, and then signed. The content will be announced later, pending approval by the British House of Commons tomorrow afternoon. According to a report from London, the plan to make the British and American occupation zones in Germany economically independent within three years will cost US$10 million, which can be shared by the two countries, but the procurement of equipment and assistance cannot be limited to the gold standard countries group.

[Associated Press, New York, 3rd] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin agreed today to announce the recently concluded agreement on the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany, which is the most significant change since the United Nations began occupying Germany. The merger may increase the cost of the American occupation of Germany by about US$100 million next year. However, U.S. officials said that the increase in occupation costs is justified because the pooling of resources by the U.S. and British zones is expected to make them self-sufficient within three years. The French and Soviet occupation zones are not affected. Byrnes and Bevin signed this agreement last night. It is reported that the merger plan has been notified to the Soviet Union and France, but these two countries have not made any suggestions to make it an agreement between three or four countries. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not directly participate in this matter, but it is reported that the Soviet representative in Berlin is already exploring the possibility of economic unification of the entire German territory.

### United States Suggests to the United Nations General Assembly; Demanding Franco Step Down; So as to Establish a Government Representing the Will of the People

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 2nd] The United States today suggested to the United Nations General Assembly that Franco be required to step down and transfer power to a Spanish interim government that broadly represents the Spanish people, and that government would be responsible for holding truly free elections. This suggestion was made by U.S. Representative Connally to the General Assembly's Political and Security Committee. Connally also advocated prohibiting the current Franco regime from participating in any international organizations related to the United Nations, while on the other hand expressing "sympathy" to the Spanish people, asking them to promote Spain's eligibility to join the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss the Spanish issue. U.S. Representative Connally proposed that as long as the Franco regime exists, Spain should not be allowed to participate in any United Nations organizations. The representative of Byelorussia further demanded economic sanctions against the Franco regime to force it to relinquish power. Polish Representative Lange called for the severance of diplomatic relations with Spain. Guatemala, Venezuela, and Uruguay all expressed hostility towards the Franco regime. However, the Philippine representative said that he could not accept the proposals of Poland and Byelorussia, because once relations with Spain were severed, the Spanish people would feel insulted, and the result would be contrary to expectations. Therefore, the U.S. amendment should be adopted, not interfering in Spain's internal affairs, and allowing the Spanish people to save themselves and choose the government they desire.

### Fourteen-Nation Group Discusses the Veto Issue

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] The Fourteen-Nation Sub-Committee of the Political Committee failed to reach an agreement on the veto issue after five hours of discussion yesterday. Indian Representative Menon suggested that the United Nations General Assembly should recommend to the Security Council that, based on the experience and lessons learned in the past few months, appropriate measures should be taken to enable the Council to pass resolutions and fulfill the important responsibilities conferred upon it by the Charter. The task of the sub-committee is to formulate a resolution from six draft resolutions.

### Disagreement Between US and USSR on Atomic Energy Control

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 2nd] The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the issue of arms reduction today. U.S. Representative Connally said in his speech that the United States cannot accept any plan to control atomic energy that uses the veto to prevent the investigation of the situation in various countries. Any control plan limited by the veto cannot be effective. The purpose of the plan proposed by the Soviet Union may only be to ban the atomic bomb, but the plan proposed by the United States expands the scope of the control mechanism so that it can implement control over any type of weapon. At this point, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky stood up to reply, saying that some countries that consumed a lot of war materials during the war have the right to speak, but other countries that lost countless lives during the war have even more right to speak. The purpose of the plans proposed by the US and the Soviet Union for arms reduction is to abolish the atomic bomb, and the Soviet plan also stipulates that universal disarmament should be implemented nationwide. I now propose that this committee should suspend the discussion of disarmament issues so that the Soviet delegation can carefully study the suggestions of the United States.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 2nd] British Representative Shawcross said in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly yesterday that there would be a weapon more terrible than the atomic bomb. When asked by this agency's reporter afterwards to elaborate on his statement, Shawcross only said that scientists are currently engaged in research on extremely destructive weapons. Once successful, they will make the atomic bomb secondary. The research on bacteriological warfare has not yet been noticed by outsiders, so the public should not only pay attention to the atomic bomb and think that the atomic bomb must still be the most terrible weapon in future wars.

### New Zealand Accepts Trusteeship Draft Amendment

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] New Zealand has accepted the recommendations of the United Nations Trusteeship Committee and will not list Western Samoa as part of New Zealand in the trusteeship draft. New Zealand has also accepted the other amendments to the draft.

### Attlee Meets with Indian Leaders; Urges Peaceful Cooperation in the Constituent Assembly; Gandhi Says Non-Violence No Longer Applicable

[Special dispatch from our London correspondent, 3rd] After arriving in England, the Governor-General of India immediately held talks with Attlee and cabinet officials. Attlee then met with Nehru, Lawrence, Cripps, etc. who were all present. Attlee at the time urged the Indian leaders to cooperate peacefully in the first Constituent Assembly. Nehru is scheduled to return to India this weekend, and the British side has expressed its agreement.

[Agence France-Presse, Bombay, 3rd] The future of India has recently become the focus of discussion for the British people. According to well-informed sources, the main topic to be discussed in the negotiations between the British government and the leaders of the Indian political parties is how to interpret the declaration issued on May 16 of this year. According to this declaration, the provinces of India are divided into three regions, each of which formulates its own constitution. (1) Provinces where Hindus are in the majority, (2) Northwestern Indian provinces and the province of Punjab, where Muslims are in the majority and Sikhs are a minority, (3) Bengal, Eastern, and Sylhet provinces. The Congress Party and the Muslim League have both expressed their agreement with this plan, but the Muslim League still insists that the northwestern and eastern Indian provinces should be permanently divided. The Congress Party believes that this is of a temporary nature, and that each province has the freedom to leave its region, but the British plan does not stipulate this. The Muslim League has a minority of representatives in the Constituent Assembly to be convened on the 9th of this month, and has no hope of expressing its opinions, so it refuses to participate.

I firmly believe that non-violence itself is a perfect tool, so the reason it has not been effective must be a technical error. Therefore, I have come here personally to investigate the reasons for the failure in the hope of finding something. Now I know that my words alone seem to be not enough, because the mistrust between the two sides seems to be deeply rooted."

### Japan's Largest Union Emerges; Three Million Demobilized Soldiers are All Members; Aims to Solve Unemployment Through Cooperation

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 3rd] Three million demobilized Japanese soldiers have recently organized the "Demobilized Soldiers Association." With its large number of members, it has become Japan's largest trade union organization. The association announced that its purpose is to seek cooperation to solve unemployment and to collectively negotiate contracts with the government. Political observers believe that the establishment of this trade union is of great significance because most of the members are infected by the former warlords and may become a disguised military organization. In any case, the association has never expressed a desire to cooperate with the Yoshida cabinet, and its attitude towards the American occupying forces remains ambiguous.

### National Christian Council Holds 12th Annual Meeting; 120 Domestic and Foreign Representatives Attend; Meeting to Last Seven Days; Mayor Delivers Speech, Offers Three Points of Advice

[Report from this newspaper] The 11th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China opened yesterday afternoon at the International Social Hall on Hengshan Road. Dr. Wu Yifang, president of the council, served as chairman. The attendees included Mayor Wu, He Dekui, Soochow University President Sheng Zhenwei, National Young Women's Christian Association General Secretary Cai Kui, representatives from 22 churches across the country, and representatives from foreign church visiting groups, totaling 120 people.

Wu Yifang's Opening Remarks

This conference is the first in nine years and will be held here for a week. The opening ceremony began yesterday with a prayer by Dr. Zhao Zichen and a reading of scripture by Dr. Liang Xiaochu. Then, Dr. Wu Yifang delivered the opening remarks, stating briefly: "The Christian Council of China has lacked time, manpower, and financial resources in the past nine years, which has prevented the work from proceeding smoothly. I feel very sorry. But our country has achieved victory after eight years of resistance against Japan. Justice has overcome violence. We should be grateful to God for the happiness He has given us. This proves that God is always present. But looking back at the wavering wills of some people during the war, their inability to control themselves, and today's fickle world and difficult environment, we have not made good use of the strength God has given us, and our moral standards have been relaxed. We should sincerely and humbly admit our sins before God. In the future, both the church and individuals should pay attention to two points: (1) Deeply progress and seek God, (2) Make the country embark on the path of true democracy. We must show it in action, use the power given to us by nature, and pursue human moral goals according to the teachings of the church."

Chairman's Congratulatory Telegram

It was then announced that Chairman Chiang had sent a congratulatory telegram stating: "To Mr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai, and to the distinguished participants of the 12th Representative Assembly: I am deeply gratified that your esteemed council has convened the 12th National Representative Assembly, a grand event that has not been held for nine years since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Since the outbreak of the war, Christian churches and organizations across the country have made great contributions to saving the dying, healing the wounded, relieving disasters, providing for the poor, supporting the elderly and weak, and protecting women and children, based on the spirit of love and service. Those who served on the front lines braved the rain of bullets and bombs without avoiding difficulties and dangers, while those in the occupied areas remained steadfast and unyielding to violence. With shared hatred of the enemy and a clear sense of justice, they made heavy sacrifices and never gave up, relying on the sincerity of great benevolence and courage to achieve the final glorious victory. Our country has suffered from war, and social morality has been severely damaged. Spiritual construction is very important. I hope that you will uphold the spirit of saving people and the world, promote the truth, awaken society, revitalize the hearts of those who are depressed and decadent, and establish a spirit of progress and positivity. The establishment of a new China depends on this. I am filled with anticipation. Chiang Kai-shek, Winter Month of the Year, Nanjing."

Dr. Wu then announced that the American Church had sent a congratulatory telegram to the Council.

Mayor's Speech

Mayor Wu attended the Council's ceremony and delivered a speech stating: "I was inspired by the Chairman's congratulatory telegram, which mentioned promoting morality. After the war, social customs have deteriorated, and people's hearts have become [unclear]. Human beings are originally half divine and half [unclear], so [unclear] is [unclear] selfishness. [unclear] God created the opposite, we should [unclear] ourselves, try to promote God's half and line up against the animal's half. I have three points of advice for the church: (1) You should bring out a heart of enthusiasm, (2) Actively act, correct social ills as much as possible, and praise good deeds, (3) Bring out the Christian spirit to deal with the world and serve humanity."

Representative of Shanghai Churches

Mr. Zhao Jinqing, representing the Shanghai churches, delivered a welcoming speech, expressing that today's church needs leaders and church talents, and requesting that the conference pay attention to this and give church members more opportunities to participate in work in society. Then, Dr. Chen Wenyuan, General Secretary of the Council, reported on the Council's work over the past nine years, including wartime relief, refugee relief, wounded soldier care, child welfare work, European refugee relief, Christian propaganda work, the development of church schools, and close cooperation between international communities. Finally, the conference observed a moment of silence for those who died in the War of Resistance.

### Gao Shen Da Destroyed, Arousing Sympathy; A Jewish Person Donates Five US Dollars; Staff of the Greater America Evening News Donate 100,000

[Report from this newspaper] Gao Shen Da Paper Company being vandalized and burned by rioters has undoubtedly become a major news story in Shanghai in recent days, serving as material for discussions and commentary. Although Gao Shen Da has suffered a tremendous material loss, they should feel comforted in spirit.

"Compassion is inherent in all people." The Gao Shen Da tragedy has not only aroused the sympathy of Chinese compatriots but has also deeply moved people from friendly nations. The first person to be touched and offer deep sympathy was a Jewish immigrant, a "person fallen from grace."

### Nazi Atrocities Still Remembered

This unnamed Jewish person, upon seeing the misfortune of Gao Shen Da, sent a letter yesterday with five US dollars to the English Greater America Evening News. The letter not only expressed his sorrow for Mr. Gao Chengxi, the owner of Gao Shen Da, but also fully lamented the homelessness of the Jewish people. The letter stated: "I feel immense sympathy for Gao Shen Da's misfortune because in 1938, I and many innocent Jewish people in Germany also suffered the same devastation. However, the tragedy we and the Gaos suffered is somewhat different: we had neither police protection nor the sympathy of the people and the government. The entire Jewish people were despised and abandoned.

We are grateful that China has extended a helping hand to us, allowing us to have a place to live here. This demonstrates the great kindness of the Chinese people and also proves that the future of China and its people is boundless. Therefore, I deeply sympathize with Gao Shen Da for being destroyed by rioters this time, and I hereby send five US dollars to Mr. Gao to express my humble intention. I would like to donate more, but I am unable to do so!"

### Greater America Evening News, Letter from the Mayor

In addition, the staff of the Greater America Evening News editorial department also generously donated 100,000 national currency as a consolation gift to Gao Shen Da. The funds were delivered to Mayor Wu for transfer by Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the Greater America Evening News. The original letter stated:

"To Mayor Wu: We are deeply moved that you, in your personal capacity, generously donated one million yuan to Mr. Gao Chengxi, the owner of the paper company that suffered losses due to the mass riots last weekend. We enclose five US dollars and 100,000 national currency, and respectfully request that you forward them to Mr. Gao. Many people who read the Greater America Evening News' report on the destruction of Gao Shen Da expressed their sympathy. The attached five US dollars were brought in this morning by a Jewish resident who has not forgotten the persecution and atrocities of the Nazis and was deeply moved by the suffering of this merchant. His letter is attached, but he does not wish to disclose his name, so we can only briefly reveal his identity. The remaining 100,000 yuan was donated by the staff of this newspaper's editorial department.

We are deeply impressed by your capable and benevolent handling of this incident. We believe that this unexpected event has served to demonstrate your abilities and kindness. Sincerely, Gao Erde, Editor of the Greater America Evening News"

### Exploring the Mystery of Hidden Gold: Further Survey of Fuxing Island Reveals New Discoveries; Cement of Japanese Goods Buried in Muddy Ground; Packaging Paper Surprisingly Still Intact

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Fuxing Island hidden gold case is a mysterious story. The informant, named "Yang Biya," is relentlessly informing everywhere, but no one has ever seen this mysterious figure behind the scenes. His confidential report describes in detail how the Japanese army built secret tunnels on Fuxing Island, hiding materials worth 20 million US dollars, as well as two large bathtubs of gold bars buried in the soil. He also explained how the gold bars in the bathtubs were discovered, divided, and embezzled. The materials in the tunnels were transported by 20 to 30 trucks every day for more than a month. The Shanghai Garrison Command, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Receiving Work Investigation Group, and the Chairman's Complaint Box have all received this confidential report, and various agencies have conducted investigations, but the situation is too bizarre, and after a year, no clue has been found. This time, the Local Court Procuratorate has taken on the task of investigation. Prosecutor Gu Hongbiao personally inspected the island on the morning of the 19th of last month. Two days ago, Prosecutor Gu returned from Nanjing, and it was suddenly reported that Prosecutor Gu had decided to conduct a second personal inspection yesterday.

Tracking to Fuxing Island

The reporter received this news early yesterday morning and took a car to track them down. The weather was warmer yesterday, and although the northwest wind was blowing, it didn't feel too cold as the car sped along. Passing the Waibaidu Bridge, Yangshupu Road, and Dinghai Bridge, Fuxing Island was ahead. There were naval guards at the Dinghai Bridge, and it was not easy to pass. The reporter took out his business card, explained the matter, and was allowed to pass. After crossing the bridge, we were on Fuxing Island. A not-so-smooth cinder road was about three or four li long, and it took more than ten minutes to drive. Along the way, there were many outposts, and armed soldiers in black uniforms and flat-topped caps were Chinese naval personnel. At the end of the road, a gate appeared with the words "Fuxing Fisheries" written horizontally on a large plaque. Prosecutor Gu and his party were walking slowly ahead. Accompanying Prosecutor Gu were Secretary Yang, Translator Xu, and four bailiffs. They were also accompanied by Committee Member Yu of the Executive Yuan, Section Chief Wang of the Shanghai Garrison Command, Section Chief Xuan Huifan of the Shanghai North Inspection Office, Wu Shiyi, and others. Wang Yikang, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Industry Management Office on the island, General Affairs Section Chief Li Jingping, Affairs Section Chief Li Yunpeng, and Technical Committee Member Wang Qianli, warmly welcomed them and first went to the Fuxing Building. This four-story building was once used as the headquarters of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. Before the victory, Fuxing Island was basically a large barracks for the enemy navy, so it was also subjected to fierce bombing by the Republic of China Air Force. This Fuxing Building was certainly a target of the bombing, and although it had been repaired, it was still dilapidated, with broken bricks and wood all over the ground. The Fisheries Office is located here, and the newly decorated reception room on the third floor is quite exquisite but seemed too small yesterday because there were too many people.

Conversation between Two People

Executive Yuan Technical Committee Member Wang Qianli, a tall man with a square face and a small mustache, spoke slowly and comfortably. He talked about the history of Fuxing Island and the history of its takeover after the victory. He said, "Fuxing Island was formed by the accumulation of mud and sand dredged from the bottom of the Huangpu River over the years. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Industry built wharves and houses on the island, which later became a fish market. Last year, after the victory, the Navy took over the island because the enemy navy had fortified it as a base for the Marine Corps. It was also used as a concentration camp for Japanese residents and prisoners. At that time, there were many and mixed troops on the island, including the Navy, the Third Theater, the Foreign Affairs Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Brigade, and the Joint Logistics Command. After the Executive Yuan's fishing boats arrived in Shanghai, they borrowed the location as a base because there was no place to dock. The first to arrive were Section Chief Li Yunpeng and others, which was at the end of May this year. At this time, there were still eight or nine thousand Japanese residents and prisoners on the island. The Prisoner of War Management Office and the Navy guarded it strictly, and the Executive Yuan staff lived in the Fuxing Building and could not run around, so we had no way of knowing whether there were materials in the tunnels or gold in the vats." Li Jingping, the tall and burly leader wearing a leather cap, talked about the vat question. He said, "Roughly between July 15th and 18th, after a rainstorm, workers reported that they had found a vat in the soil. The white porcelain edge of the basin was exposed outside the soil, and it was full of manure. On the same day, while repairing the water pipes, they discovered a second vat, which was also full of manure and had no gold bars."

Discovery of Buried Cement

At around ten o'clock, we began to inspect the site, led by Li Jingping and Li Yunpeng. We first went to the location where the first vat was buried. There was indeed a depression, but it was not very large, only three feet deep, with Chinese holly trees planted on both sides. Just as everyone was focusing on the depression, someone suddenly noticed something unusual a few steps in front of the depression because the soil here was soft and elastic. So it was decided to excavate. The soil was so loose, mixed with a lot of firewood and wooden boards, that it was obviously filled in not long ago. Strangely, after digging less than three feet, we suddenly found that the inside was full of hardened whole bags of cement, and the cement packaging paper had not even rotted. From the packaging paper, we identified it as "Japanese goods." There were blocks and blocks of cement, and we couldn't dig them all out. By this time, it was already one o'clock in the afternoon, and everyone was starving. The Executive Yuan Fisheries Management Office prepared lunch for us.

A Series of Questions

During the lunch break, we jointly studied the case. Because it was so complex and convoluted, we divided it into two parts for the sake of discussion. First, we talked about the part about the hidden gold and immediately thought of a series of questions: Gold is not afraid of rotting, so why hide it in a vat and bury it in the ground? Where did the vat come from? Why was it buried underground? If not for hiding gold, what else was it for? Where did the manure come from? Why did the vat contain manure? This pile of questions plunged the whole place into a somber atmosphere. After lunch, we inspected the location where the second vat was buried, but it was just a depression, and there were no new discoveries. Prosecutor Gu summoned Wang Kui, the plumbing worker who first discovered the vat. Wang Kui said, "This place was originally full of grass. Because the water pipe was broken, I came to repair it and found the white edge of the porcelain basin exposed on the outside. The two vats were discovered in the same way." According to his memory, it did not rain that day, but there was water everywhere because the water pipe was broken. Prosecutor Gu and others patrolled for a week and then returned to the Fuxing Fire Building's reception room to question the driver Li Jinbiao. Li came to the island around the same time as Section Chief Li Yunpeng. He denied ever transporting materials.

It was already four o'clock in the afternoon, and there were still no conclusions. The roads on the island were winding and confusing. We stopped and went, and it took us a full ten hours. Everyone was a little tired. We took the opportunity to visit the Executive Yuan fishing boats and then took a car back. The materials and gold bars of Fuxing Island are still a mystery. (The above picture shows the discovered vat)

### Letter from He Yingqin Abroad; Agrees with This Newspaper's Editorial Opinion; Racetrack to Be Developed as a Park

[Report from This Newspaper] General He Yingqin, head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee, recently sent a letter to this newspaper from New York, expressing his strong agreement with this newspaper's editorial on the issue of preserving the Shanghai Racecourse. He also sent a letter to Mayor Wu, stating that he had recently visited various places in the eastern United States and that every city and town he visited had large parks that were beautifully designed and provided great physical and mental benefits to the citizens who rested and played there. Shanghai is a major port in the Far East, and its future development is immeasurable. Therefore, there should be a large-scale park in the city center and no more buildings should be built.

### Labor-Management Disputes in the Grain, Dried Goods, and Noodle Industries; Social Affairs Bureau Mediates Yesterday

[Report from This Newspaper] Labor-management disputes in this city are emerging one after another, and the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau is very busy. The following three cases were mediated at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon:

Grain Industry and Miscellaneous Grains Industry: The labor side demanded improved treatment, mainly with the following conditions: (1) Worker treatment is divided into four grades: 45 yuan, 30 yuan, 55 yuan, and 60 yuan, all calculated according to the government's cost-of-living index. The delivery fee is set at one dime per stone, and it should also be calculated according to the index. (2) Profits should be split 40/60, with 60% for the capital side and 40% for labor. The annual salary should be 15 months, with three months as an annual bonus. (3) Employee benefits should be organized through consultation between labor and capital, and the expenses should be borne in accordance with the Labor Law. (4) When workers are sick, medical expenses should be borne by the capital side, and wages should be paid as usual. (5) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. (6) In the future, the capital side should only hire members of the labor union. Yesterday, when the labor and capital sides were negotiating at the Social Affairs Bureau, there were major disputes due to the vast differences in opinion. The representatives of both sides slammed the table while speaking to strengthen their momentum. The labor-management dispute in this industry occurred in October and has been repeatedly negotiated, but a solution has not yet been reached.

Dried Goods Industry: A labor-management dispute occurred in August, and after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, a settlement record was established on August 15th, stipulating that the salaries of employees should be increased by 20 yuan, 15 yuan, and 10 yuan for grades A, B, and C, respectively, and calculated according to the cost-of-living index. However, 66 dried goods stores have not yet implemented the record, and the capital side's reason is that their business is sluggish and they cannot afford it. The labor union has now requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate this matter. The labor side requests that the three months' salary from August 15th to November 15th be paid according to the new standards first, and then the union representatives and the Social Affairs Bureau representatives will jointly investigate the actual business conditions of the stores. If they are losing money, the workers are willing to discount their wages. Yesterday, when the representatives of both sides were negotiating, the capital side's representatives said that they had to consult with the chairman of the industry before making a decision.

Noodle Industry: The Noodle Industry Association set the standard labor cost for workers in the industry at 110,000 yuan in September of this year. All workers employed through the union were to be paid according to this amount. However, at that time, some noodle shop owners were eager to supply cold noodles and were willing to pay high wages to hire workers, which resulted in a "black market wage" of 150,000 yuan. Currently, the black market wage is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan higher than the amount stipulated by the union. In addition, most noodle shops are unwilling to hire workers through the union, which has caused great dissatisfaction among unionized workers, and a labor-management dispute has arisen. The labor side initially requested that the base salary be set at 30 yuan, 35 yuan, and 40 yuan for three grades, all calculated according to the cost-of-living index. After compromises, both sides agreed that for machine-cut noodle shops with a daily production capacity of seven bags of flour or less, the base salary of workers should be set at 27 yuan, and for those with a daily production capacity of more than seven bags of flour, the base salary of workers should be set at 30 yuan. The annual bonus issue was also resolved during yesterday's mediation. The capital side agreed that the minimum annual bonus for workers should be half a month's salary, and the capital side would still handle how to distribute it fairly. This negotiation proceeded in a peaceful atmosphere, which was an interesting contrast to the grain industry. Director of the Public Works Bureau Receives

### Shanghai-Beiping Flight Time Shortened; Giant New Aircraft Fast and Convenient; More Flights to Be Added on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

To expand its business, China National Aviation Corporation has ordered multiple DC-4 aircraft from the United States. These aircraft are manufactured by Douglas Aircraft Company of the United States and were produced before the war. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, they were converted into military aircraft and renamed C-54. They are four-engine low-wing aircraft, carrying 44 passengers, two pilots, one flight mechanic, one communicator, and two attendants. They are also equipped with a cooking room to provide guests with tea and refreshments, and they have heating in winter. The structure and performance of the aircraft guarantee maximum safety. It is reported that three of these aircraft have arrived in Shanghai, and the CNAC authorities have decided to use these DC-4 aircraft to operate in North China, opening a direct flight between Shanghai and Beiping. It is scheduled to begin on the 5th, with one flight per day, resting on Sundays. It will take off at 8:00 AM every day and return to Shanghai at 3:30 PM. The ticket price is 225,000 yuan per person. The DC-4 only takes three hours and twenty minutes to reach Beiping, while ordinary aircraft take more than six hours, which can be called fast and convenient. Three more DC-4 aircraft are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, and CNAC will use them on routes to Hong Kong and Manila.

Another report: Since adding a direct flight between Shanghai and Nanjing, China Central Air Transport Corporation's business has been thriving, with frequent passenger and cargo traffic. It is reported that the company has recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications stating that the Nanjing-Shanghai air route is extremely important and hopes to add flights to facilitate air transport. China Central Air Transport Corporation has drawn up a plan to add a flight three times a week on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, taking off from Shanghai to Nanjing at 8:00 AM and returning from Nanjing to Shanghai at 11:00 AM, and taking off from Shanghai to Nanjing at 3:30 PM and returning from Nanjing to Shanghai at 5:00 PM. The ticket price remains the same. There will still be a single flight on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The additional flights can begin as soon as they are approved by the Ministry of Communications.

### Another Lawsuit Involving Deposits: Request for Repayment in Silver Dollars, Chung Nan Bank Sued, Court to Hear Case on the 17th

[Report from our Newspaper] Disputes and lawsuits continue to arise regarding the repayment of pre-war deposits. Now, citizens Shen Haoming, Shen Cuiling, Shen Meiling, and Shen Rongling, who deposited silver dollars with Chung Nan Bank before the war, are demanding repayment in silver dollars or their equivalent in silver taels based on market price. They are suing Huang Yuyi, the legal representative of Chung Nan Bank, for breach of trust and ignoring the deposit agreement. The case stems from the fact that the plaintiffs deposited two hundred silver dollars each with Chung Nan Bank on May 26, 1930, and February 10, 1931, respectively, for a term of fifteen years. Upon maturity, they were to receive one thousand silver dollars in principal and interest, evidenced by deposit slips numbered 458, 459, 460, and 1138. The deposits matured on May 26, 1945, and February 10, 1946, respectively. Despite repeated requests, the plaintiffs have received no repayment. They wrote to the defendant, specifying payment in silver dollars or their equivalent in silver taels, calculated at seven fen three li of silver per dollar. The defendant replied that the bank was not refusing payment, but that repayment in silver dollars concerned the entire financial system and required consultation with the Bankers Association and submission to the government for approval. Until government approval was obtained, the bank would continue to pay the original principal and interest in legal tender at the original rate, without any changes.

The plaintiffs now make three demands: (1) The defendant should repay the plaintiffs one thousand silver dollars in principal and interest. If repaid in legal tender, it should be converted at the market price of silver taels on the date of repayment, at seven fen three li of silver per dollar. (2) The defendant should pay the first plaintiff interest at an annual rate of six percent from May 26, 1945, to the date of execution, and pay the second plaintiff interest at an annual rate of six percent from February 10, 1946, to the date of execution. (3) The defendant should pay the litigation costs.

It is reported that the court has scheduled a hearing for this case on December 17th at 9:10 AM in Courtroom 7.

### Trial of Shen Fenggang, a Special Agent of the Puppet Regime, Continues; Witness Chen Mo Questioned; Defendant Refers to Him as Superior

[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Shen Fenggang, a key figure in the special agent apparatus of the puppet regime, who once served as the Director of the Third Division of "76," has been repeatedly investigated by the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, the court held another hearing to continue examining evidence and questioning Chen Mo, who was indicted for concealing a fan belonging to Liang Hongzhi, as a witness. After questioning, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.

Chen Mo, dressed in a black serge jacket and black leather shoes, testified that he was 33 years old and from Fengxian. He was formerly the commander of the Vanguard Corps of the Loyal National Salvation Army. Before the victory, he ordered Shen Fenggang to carry out defection work. After the victory, he appointed Shen as a detachment leader, incorporating troops and providing more than 200 guns together with Xia Zhongming (also a division director of "76").

When questioned, Shen Fenggang said: "The military intelligence bureau recorded my confession, but they didn't write what I said, it was all their own writing. Chen Mo formerly appointed me as the head of the Shanghai suburban intelligence group, and after the victory, he also contacted Xia Zhongming to supply guns." He also said: "I have never been a traitor for a single day. The one month and twenty-three days that I served were under orders. During the eight years, I was arrested by the patrol police, arrested by the Japanese Kempeitai, and arrested by '76.' I risked my life to fight traitors with knives and guns, but now I am being treated as a traitor. This is really heartbreaking. There is absolutely no such thing as a traitor killing traitors. My superior (referring to Chen Mo) is here today, and he can testify to the truth of my actions. Even if the presiding judge finds me not guilty, I will not accept it, because I have already been imprisoned for more than a year." Zhou, dressed in a blue cloth robe, met with his family after the court session and was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs along with Chen Mo.

### Xu Lizhong and Xie Demao Face Preliminary Hearing for Purchasing Gunny Sacks and Hardware for the Enemy

[Report from our Newspaper] Xu Lizhong, a 40-year-old from Zhenhai, who runs the Yongxiang Gunny Sack Store at 448 Hefei Road, is accused of colluding with Zhu Taokun, a translator for the Tonghe Foreign Firm, during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. He allegedly came to know the 1629th Unit of the enemy army and purchased gunny sacks on their behalf for military use. He was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office, which indicted him on suspicion of being a traitor. Yesterday afternoon, the High Court held a hearing. Xu Lizhong firmly denied purchasing gunny sacks on behalf of the enemy. Since further investigation of the evidence is required, the court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date.

[Another Report] Xie Demao, the owner of the Jiuda Xieji Copper and Tin Shop, is accused of collaborating with the enemy. It is alleged that Xie received a pass from the Japanese Navy and Army to collect large quantities of copper coins, copper wire, aluminum, silver, and pig lead, which are military raw materials, to support the enemy. He is said to have colluded with the Dalu Copper Factory, Zhuangbao Foreign Firm, and Minghua Company. Yesterday, the High Court held a hearing to investigate the case. The defendant denied the charges, and the court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to a later date.

### Visiting Female Judges: Misses Jiang and Xia at the District Court; Still in Their Probation Period

[Report from our Newspaper] The Civil Records Department of the District Court recently gained two new female probationary judges. Yesterday, a reporter visited them and met Miss Jiang. She is a graduate of the Fudan Law Department in 1944. She joined the District Court as a clerk in mid-October of last year and was recently promoted to probationary judge after passing the higher civil service examination. She said modestly to the reporter: "There is nothing remarkable about it. A few days ago, a classmate casually mentioned it to a newspaper reporter, and they published it. Actually, there are many women in the legal profession. There are two female prosecutors in this court. Also, there seem to be female court presidents." She went on to say that she probably would not appear in court during her probation period. Her main job is to draft judgments based on case files. After the probation period, it will depend on the assignment from her superiors. She had many official documents on her desk, and a worker delivered a large stack of them. She looked very capable and efficient.

Miss Xia came to the court yesterday to complete the registration procedures and then left. It is said that she is a graduate of the Judicial Group of the Chaoyang Law School and was assigned to the District Court for probation without taking the higher civil service examination.

### The Dredging Bureau Has Dug Up Over One Million Tons of Silt

[Report from our Newspaper] According to Shi Konghuai, the Deputy Director of the Dredging Bureau, the bureau has removed over one million tons of silt since taking over at the end of September last year, averaging about 12,000 tons per day. Since the dredging ships and pump boats were actively repaired and put into use, the performance in July broke the highest record, with a total of 210,000 tons of silt removed. Currently, there are seven dredging ships and one pump boat in operation, and another is being repaired and will be put into use in the short term. The silt dredged from the Huangpu River is continuously transported to Yangshupu and Longhua, etc., for filling and raising the ground. According to Deputy Director Shi, the Dredging Bureau will establish close ties with the Public Works Bureau in the future to ensure that the dredging work can be carried out actively.

### Difficult Times and Poverty: Sluggish Pork Sales

[Report from our Newspaper] Recently, the market price of pork in this city has been relatively stable. The pig industry and fresh meat wholesalers negotiate the selling price daily based on supply and demand. Yesterday, for example, live pigs were priced at 3,400 yuan per kilogram, or 1,700 yuan per shi jin (catty). Fresh meat wholesale was priced at 2,650 yuan per shi jin, and retail meat stalls charged between 2,500 yuan and 3,000 yuan per shi jin, depending on the fat content.

The supply of pigs is relatively smooth, mainly Huai pigs from Bengbu and other places. In addition to a large portion being directly transported to Shanghai, some are also transported to Wuxi and Changzhou. When the Shanghai market price is profitable, they are slaughtered locally, and the fresh meat is transported to Shanghai for sale. This is more profitable and allows for cash payment. Ordinary pig traders who sell live pigs often have to wait three or four days to receive payment.

Due to difficult times and poverty, pork sales are very sluggish. It is reported that in the past, the daily slaughter of pigs in this city was often more than 2,000 head, but now it is only about 1,200 head.

### Shanghai's Population: 4,020,000, Including Foreign Residents from 38 Countries

### The Coldest Period of This Winter Will Be in January Next Year; Yesterday's Weather Remained Severe; Corpse Collection Busy Due to Continuous Street Deaths

[Report from our Newspaper] The weather in this city has been clear and stable since yesterday, but it is still cold in the morning and evening. The lowest temperature is still below 38 degrees, and it is warm at noon, with the highest temperature rising to 52 degrees.

According to the meteorological observatory's forecast, there will be no major changes in the next few days. As for this winter, there is no doubt that the general climate will be colder than last winter. Last winter, the lowest temperature was 26.8 degrees, and this winter will definitely break this record. The coldest period will be in mid-January of 1947.

In the past three days, the Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall in this city have collected a total of twelve adult corpses and one hundred and ninety-six child corpses from the streets. Although not all of them died from freezing, the cold weather is the main factor accelerating death.

Yesterday's weather report from the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory: The center of the Siberian anticyclone is located in Central China and covers the whole country, the East China Sea, the Ryukyu Islands, and the northern part of the South China Sea. The low pressure is moving northeast through northern Japan.

### Cold Weather Leads to Use of Electric Heaters, Affecting Yarn Mill Production; Power Company Appeals Again for Discontinuation of Use

[Report from our Newspaper] Due to the cold weather, most households in this city with electric heating meters are using electric heaters, which has made the city's power supply very difficult. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Electric Power Company cut off the power to all yarn mills in the city. This kind of panic situation has never happened this year. Due to households using electric heaters in violation of regulations, daily power consumption has suddenly increased by 12,000 to 15,000 kilowatts, which is equal to one-third of the daily power consumption of factories, meaning that daily production has decreased by one-third. The electric power company urgently appeals to the households in this city to cooperate and not use electric heaters.

The notices regarding the monthly usage limits for electric heating and lighting for households in this city have been issued by various electric power companies one after another. After receiving the notices, all households must use electricity according to the limits. Those who exceed the limits will be subjected to power cuts by the electric power companies in accordance with the regulations of the municipal government.

For those who used less than 20 degrees of electric heating per month in June, July, August, September and October of this year, the electric power company has cut off the electric meter, and 2,000 meters have been cut off so far. For those who exceed 20 degrees, the month with the highest usage in mid-April will be the new limit.

### Winter Relief May Be Implemented Ahead of Schedule

[Report from our Newspaper] Cai Dianrong, a member of the Winter Relief Committee of this city, told reporters yesterday that the central government has ordered that the winter relief in this city be implemented from the 15th of this month, but this city is considering the weather conditions and may implement it one week earlier. It is expected that the number of people receiving relief this winter will be around 3,000, and if necessary, it can accommodate up to 5,000 people. The funds have been decided to be 400 million yuan. In the face of the city treasury's deficit, it is not easy to allocate this amount. However, this relief work is very expensive. It is estimated that each person's cold-proof equipment will cost at least 80,000 yuan, and three months of meals will also need to be provided. Currently, 800 sets of clothing and bedding have been prepared, and the rest are being rushed to be made. During the winter shelter period, management is an important issue. Due to limited equipment, it is inconvenient to implement vocational training, but the actual situation will be considered, and appropriate work will be given to them every day, so as not to make them too idle. At the end of the lunar year, cold clothes will also be given away. In this winter's relief, the committee will try its best to cooperate with various charitable organizations in society to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

[Another Report] Mayor Wu, in order to expand the winter relief, appealed to all sectors of society for assistance and scheduled a radio speech at the Jiancheng Radio Station at 2:00 PM today.

In addition, the fundraising meeting of the Winter Relief Association decided to hold a radio fundraising campaign for two days starting today, at the Jiancheng, Guomin, and Yamei stations.

### Raw Cotton Supply Problem: President Song Sets Two-Day Deadline to Provide Five Statistical Items; Inaccurate Reports of Cotton Stock Will Be Confiscated; Draft Plan to Ban Black Market Cotton Yarn

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan presided over the 14th temporary meeting of the Textile Control Committee. Those present included concurrent Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Life Li Shengbo, and committee members Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Hai Wang Yangxian, Yang Xiren, Lin Fengbao, Rong Hongyuan, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the Textile Control Committee. Also present were the Governor of the Central Bank Bei Zuyi and Consultant Mike. The meeting lasted one hour before adjourning.

At the meeting yesterday, Premier Song gave two instructions: (A) Regarding the supply of raw cotton, he proposed collecting statistical data on five items: (1) the total amount of raw cotton produced nationwide; (2) the amount of raw cotton available to each yarn mill for spinning; (3) the current stock of raw cotton held by yarn mills, cotton firms, and foreign firms; (4) the total annual raw cotton requirement for all yarn spindles in our country; (5) the amount of raw cotton still needed beyond the domestically available cotton and the raw cotton stock held by yarn mills, cotton firms, and foreign firms. To expedite the collection of data, he also uniformly required each yarn mill, cotton firm, and foreign firm to submit a report to the Textile Control Committee by tomorrow (the 5th) detailing their own raw cotton stock as of the end of November this year, to facilitate centralized statistics. If inaccurate reporting is discovered, the unreported raw cotton stock will be subject to confiscation. (B) How to crack down on the black market for cotton yarn. Regarding this point, Premier Song asked the participating committee members to provide opinions. The committee members expressed their views in turn. It was then decided that experienced committee members of the Textile Control Committee should draft a concrete plan for managing yarn and cloth, submit it to the 15th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee to be held this Thursday, and then report the results to Premier Song for approval.

Yesterday, the Textile Control Committee sent a letter to Committee Member Wang Qiyu, stating briefly: Premier Song instructed that regarding how to regulate the yarn and cloth market and eliminate the black market, a concrete plan should first be provided for review and decision. Correspondingly, you are requested to be responsible for providing a written opinion, to be submitted for discussion at the 15th meeting of this committee on Thursday (December 5th).

This reporter then interviewed Mr. Wang Qiyu, who attended yesterday's Textile Control Committee meeting. He stated that Premier Song believes that past cotton yarn allocation policies have failed because the public has not benefited, and yarn mills have been constrained by price controls, but the black market for cotton yarn has not been eliminated as a result. Therefore, he instructed the participating committee members to draft measures to suppress yarn prices. He himself has not yet drafted any concrete measures, but he still believes that the price of raw cotton in this city is too high, and foreign exchange for American cotton has not been approved for many months. He hopes that the raw cotton reserves in this city can be increased in the future, and that raw cotton can be continuously transported to ensure that there is no shortage of raw materials for spinning. As for cotton yarn countermeasures, given the vastness of our country, full control is difficult. However, controlling cotton yarn in Shanghai alone has not had good results. Even temporarily restoring free trade is not something that can be achieved overnight. Therefore, he hopes to find a reasonable outlet for cotton yarn before restoring free trade. However, this is purely his personal opinion, and concrete opinions still need to be decided after consultation with all relevant parties, he said.

Premier Song then summoned the concurrent Chairman of the Textile Control Committee at around 4:00 PM. Guo, committee members Shu Yunzhang, Yang Xiren, Lin Fengbao, Wu Weijing, Central Bank Consultant Mike, and others for discussions, which lasted until around 7:00 PM before adjourning. It is reported that the content of the talks focused on: (1) how to strengthen the purchase of domestic cotton; (2) how to reduce the cost of packaging raw cotton and alleviate the difficulty of packaging; (3) how to streamline the transportation of raw cotton; (4) specific measures for the allocation of cotton yarn.

Premier Song also inquired in detail about the production cost of cotton yarn and sought the opinion of Governor Bei of the Central Bank on the issue of providing foreign exchange for purchasing American cotton. Governor Bei stated that there should be no problem in supplying foreign exchange for purchasing American cotton. However, he hopes that the export of our country's export goods such as tung oil, tea, and silk can be actively strengthened. At the same time, by revising the import and export trade regulations, the management of imported goods can be strengthened, which will be very optimistic for our country's foreign exchange prospects.

It is reported that the government will first initiate the ordering of a large amount of American cotton to replenish raw cotton reserves, so as to reduce raw material costs, and yarn prices can also be suppressed accordingly.

### Premier Song Calls a Temporary Meeting of the Control Committee to Review the Work of the Committee

Those present included Chairman Bei Zuyi, executive members Zhang Fuyun, Chen Changtong, Li, Lin Ying, and Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and others. Mr. Song reviewed the work of the committee since its establishment. He then began to discuss various issues, including: (1) the principles for classifying and approving the quantity of imported goods and the quantity of individual approvals; (2) how to complete the procedures for goods that have already been shipped to Shanghai; (3) the guidelines for registering and approving importers and exporters; (4) the issue of allocating exchange quotas after resuming applications for foreign exchange settlement.

### Public Bonds Continue to Fall

The opening price of the unified C bond in the morning was 1340 yuan, and the price fell from 1360 yuan to 1240 yuan. Near noon, the price rebounded to above 1300 yuan and fluctuated.

### Oil Prices are Falling, Rice Market Appraisal: Miscellaneous Grains are Stable

The rice market is sluggish in both sales and arrivals. Southern japonica rice has risen slightly by 300-500 yuan, and northern japonica rice is also active. White yuan and yin yuan are still rarely traded. Indica rice is stable. Although flour sales are slack, the factories are unwilling to sell at a low price due to the firm wheat prices and cost considerations. Bran is dull and flat. Soybean cakes are slightly active in Fujian, and the market also has little fluctuation. Raw peanuts from Nanyang are still slack, with high prices being firm and secondary prices being weak. Sesame from Guangdong is still active and remains stable. Mung beans are also quite popular. Red sorghum is scarce and actively digested. Soybeans are being selectively purchased in the local market, with a slight increase of 300-500 yuan. Cowpeas from Shantou are still being handled, and the situation is stable. Various oil products continue to arrive, but sales are sluggish and stagnant. Oil prices continue to fall, and various oils have fallen by another 6,000-7,000 yuan.

### The Tea Market is Not Optimistic

In the foreign tea market, high-grade aged Keemun tea is stable and firm. Other varieties are quiet. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, the local and out-of-town traders are still showing little activity. Affected by the sluggish tea market in Tianjin, people are also uneasy. Judging from this situation, the future of the tea market is difficult to be optimistic about.

### Yarn and Cloth Prices Both Decline

Yesterday, the yarn market turned downstream because the previous days' gains were too large, making prices higher than those in the inland areas. Tomorrow is also the opening day of the yarn market for textile mills, and yarn brokers are not well-funded and are eager to sell. Therefore, 20-count yarn fell slightly by 57,000 yuan, and 42-count yarn fell sharply by 200,000 yuan, with very narrow sales.

The rising trend in the cotton cloth market is gradually calming down. Sales of various brands are sluggish. Small retailers are selling at high prices.

The flour and bran industry will be renamed the Flour Commercial Trade Association. The Rice Milling Industry Trade Association will remain the same.

### Chinese Stock Chips are Exhausted, Market Price Decline is Limited

Chinese stocks traded even more sparsely yesterday, and market prices were erratic. The pressure from short sellers was very heavy, but because spot chips were extremely scarce, it was still easy to rebound after the low. The morning opened with low prices for various stocks due to tight money. After the opening, stocks 223, 89, and 224 were sold and continued to decline. After 10:00, stocks 92, 97, 152, 215, etc. came in to buy, and they once rebounded by more than 10 yuan. However, due to the appearance of Yong Yarn in stocks 102, 185, and 27, and the delivery of Yong Yarn in stocks 233, 180, and 177, spot trading once fell below 450 yuan. At this time, stocks 80, 38, 162, and 151 had purchases, and there was still room for rebound. However, stock 180 continued to put pressure around 460 yuan, and stocks 28, 35, and 229 were sold again. After struggling, the price fell back to a low price. At 11:30, short covering was relatively strong again. It was heard that there were too many short sellers outside the market, and there was no interest to collect. Long sellers also only posted interest of 4.5%. People were also in a good mood, and stocks 91, 36, 152, 44, etc. all bought in. Near noon, there was a slight upward trend. As a result, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng each fell slightly to less than 50%, and Maya and Jingfu each fell slightly more than 50%. Cold stocks Datong and Tongyi were flat, China Silk rebounded slightly more than 50%, and the rest fell slightly. In forward delivery, Yong Yarn, Maya, and Qinxing each fell around 50%, and the rest fell slightly. In the afternoon, buying continued to prevail, and people's hearts turned firm. There were purchases from the surface brokers. Although the buyers were scattered, they accumulated over time. Chips were exhausted, and it was easy to pull up. Although large investors such as 176, 223, and 215 sold, they could not stop the buying momentum. There was a lot of trading in the middle of the day. Near the close, there was still prosperity. After the close, bidding continued to rise. As a result, Yong Yarn, Maya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng fell slightly compared to the previous close, Xinhuo rose slightly, cold stocks China Silk rose slightly more than 50% compared to the morning's transaction price, Datong rose slightly, Tongyi was flat, and the rest fell slightly. In forward delivery, Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinguang, Dongxing, and Huafeng fell slightly, Xinhuo rose slightly, and stocks outside the market were generally sluggish and very slight.

### Autumn Silk Purchasing Will Begin Soon, but Price Standards Are Extremely Difficult to Determine; the Central Sericulture Authority is Studying It

In order to support the silk industry, the government has specially instructed the China Trust Bureau to purchase domestically produced raw silk. The price of spring silk was determined by the China Sericulture Company based on actual costs, plus legal profits, with Grade D as the standard, at 3.8 million yuan per dan. Since the start of purchasing, more than 80% of spring silk has been purchased, and it will soon come to an end. At present, the work of purchasing autumn silk will be launched again. However, the cost of autumn silk is very different from the cost of spring silk. According to the cost estimated by the Silk Reeling Industry Association of the Third District, the cost is more than 6.3 million yuan. The cost estimation method is based on three types of payments: cocoon cost, reeling labor, and interest. First, cocoon cost: 7 dan of cocoons are reeled into 1 dan of silk. The purchase price of dry cocoons is 615,000 yuan per dan, totaling 4.305 million yuan. Second, reeling labor: at least 1.44 million yuan. Third, interest: calculated at 5% monthly interest, 574,500 yuan should be paid. The total cost is as stated above, which is considered the lowest cost. Compared with the purchase price of spring silk, it is almost doubled. The chairman of the association, Chu Fucheng, has separately submitted reports to Chairman Chiang and Premier Song of the government for instructions. It is reported that the purchase price of autumn silk will still be determined by the China Sericulture Company. The company is investigating the actual cost and then setting a reasonable standard price to be reported for approval. According to Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Sericulture, the situation of autumn silk is different from that of spring silk, because the prices of spring and autumn cocoons are mutually exchanged, and the costs will be high and low. Moreover, rice prices and wages vary greatly in different places, and standards are extremely difficult to determine. The high price of autumn silk is also a fact. The company is studying it based on the actual costs in various places, with the principle of helping manufacturers, ensuring their production costs, and not causing losses. The determination of the price of autumn silk will strive to be reasonable.

### Central Bank Officially and Secretly Allocates Gold, and the Rising Trend of Gold Prices Slightly Stabilizes

Yesterday, the Shanghai Gold Market fluctuated due to the initial tightness and subsequent easing of funds. The Central Bank also frequently added pressure. After rising, there was a lot of selling. The morning opened at 2,752,000, and rose immediately after the opening. Bargaining was still fierce. Soon it rose to around 2,765,000. The Bank of China suppressed it at high prices, and it fell back. Funds were also tight. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 101 gold bars at a price of 2,730,000. Under the official and secret allocation, it fell to below 2,720,000 before it was maintained. Funds also gradually eased. At noon, it rebounded to around 2,735,000. In the afternoon, it continued to be prosperous and once rebounded to above 2,755,000. As a result, it fell slightly by 5,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The secret money market was slightly tight, and the secret interest rate was around 1.5 cents.

### The Seasoning Powder Industry Requests a Ban on the Import of Foreign Goods; the Import Management Committee Agrees to Consider It

The Shanghai Seasoning Powder Industry Trade Association believes that foreign seasoning powder is imported continuously and fills the market, which has a great impact on the domestic seasoning powder industry. It has specially requested the Temporary Import Management Committee to ban the import of foreign seasoning powder and stated various reasons, requesting approval for import. The Temporary Import Management Committee expressed sympathy for the points stated by the industry and replied to the association yesterday, agreeing to consider it and ordering a report on the import of foreign seasoning powder and its types of brands, tax rates, numbers, and other detailed investigations and statistics for review. The association is currently actively compiling various investigation forms, which can be submitted for review this week.

### A Piece of Good News for the Silk Industry: The United States Needs a Large Amount of Silk; the China Trust Bureau Agrees to Supply Raw Materials to Various Factories

Our troubled silk industry is currently looking for a way out. Due to high costs, the future is still very bleak. Even the raw silk purchased by the China Trust Bureau under orders is still in a state of depression. It is learned that the Sino-American Company organized by General Chennault has recently been entrusted by American importers to need a large amount of Chinese silk. In order to negotiate, Chennault sent people to contact our silk factories. The factories were worried about the problem of raw materials, so they discussed with the China Trust Bureau to supply raw materials. The China Trust Bureau is willing to supply as much as possible with the raw silk purchased. The factories have expressed their willingness to accept orders. Now they are waiting for the American side to list the detailed list and quantity of their required patterns before signing a contract with them and delivering the goods on time. The amount purchased by the American side is more than 200,000 pieces. Our dying silk industry can process and export raw silk, and the government and silk merchants will benefit from it. This is truly unprecedented good news, and all people in our silk industry are excited.

### Central Bank Stipulates the Conversion Rate of Legal Tender to Foreign Currencies

The conversion rate of legal tender to foreign currencies stipulated by the Central Bank is for the US dollar and the British pound. The official exchange rate for the US dollar is 3,350 yuan, and the legal tender for each British pound is 13,500 yuan. The Central Bank has not yet stipulated the conversion rates for other currencies, and it is only calculated based on the exchange rate of each currency to the US dollar or the British pound, which is converted into legal tender, which is quite different. It is now learned that the Central Bank, in view of this, in order to unify the exchange rate of various currencies, has notified the designated foreign exchange banks that the conversion rates for various currencies are as follows: (1) Hong Kong dollar: 1 shilling 1.9375 pence is equivalent to 1 pound sterling; (2) French franc: 500 French francs are equal to one pound sterling; (3) Swiss franc: 13 Swiss francs are equal to one pound sterling; (4) Belgian franc: 180 Belgian francs are equal to one pound sterling; (5) Rupee: 1 shilling 5.93175 pence is equal to one pound sterling; (6) Singapore dollar: 2 shillings 4 pence is equal to one pound sterling; (7) Dutch currency: 11 units are equivalent to one pound; (8) Thai currency: 80 units are equivalent to one pound; (9) Egypt: 25.5 units are equivalent to one pound. It is reported that the Central Bank will pay depositors for foreign currency deposits in domestic banks according to the above conversion rate.

### The Conversion Rate is Increased, There is More Coarse Yarn; It is Difficult to Allocate Yarn at the Re-Allocation Meeting; The Actual Allocation of Each Factory is About 40%; The Price Increase of 42-Count Yarn Has Not Been Implemented

The first yarn allocation of the fourth period started on the evening of the previous day (2nd) by the yarn allocation committee of the Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District. The allocation list was handed over to the yarn allocation committee of the Cotton Yarn Re-Products Industry Association. Yesterday (3rd), the Re-allocation Association transferred the allocation to the six associations of dyeing and weaving, knitting, underwear, towel blankets, handkerchiefs, and handmade cotton weaving. First, the number of yarns allocated to the factories that had stopped allocating yarns in other cities was determined and handed over to the three industries of camel hair, canvas, and webbing for separate allocation. According to the news from the Re-Products Association, the total number of yarns of various counts allocated this time was 5181 pieces. According to the revised conversion rate, it is equivalent to 6160.26 pieces of 20-count standard yarn. However, the conversion rate of fine counts has been greatly increased. If calculated according to the original conversion rate, it will be reduced by about 600 pieces compared to the previous one, and there are still more than 700 pieces of 10-count coarse yarn, so the allocation is more difficult. The actual yarn allocated to each factory is only about 40%. As for the price increase of 42-count double-strand yarn, the person in charge of the Re-allocation Association inquired about the person in charge of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee. It is said that it is still being processed, and this decision should still be handled at the original price. The Re-allocation Association has sent a letter to the cotton textile industry for verification. The price increase should be implemented from the next time. At 3:00 pm today (4th), the yarn allocation meeting of the Cotton Textile Industry Association will hold a meeting and has invited the re-product industry and the yarn number industry to attend. There will be discussions on the conversion rate of each count and the price increase of 42-count. According to an expert, based on the current negotiated price of 20-count, the 42-count double-strand has the possibility of increasing the price to 3.11 million yuan. The original negotiated price was 2.79 million yuan. This time, the cotton textile industry intends to increase it to 3.46 million yuan.

### The Black Market for Coal is Rampant; the Association Appeals for Cancellation

Recently, the black market for coal has become rampant again, and market prices are soaring. The industry association has appealed to the authorities to improve distribution, cancel control, and allow the coal industry to freely mine and transport coal. According to news from the Coal Joint Allocation Office, the main reason for the black market for coal prices is the control and allocation of coal by the Fuel Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Since August this year, the amount of coal allocated by the committee has gradually increased, from 10,000 tons in August, 23,000 tons in September, and 39,000 tons in October, but only 20,000 tons were allocated in November. Now that it is winter, the amount of coal consumed is greater, but the coal allocated has decreased, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand. Moreover, the freedom of coal industry peers to mine and transport coal is further hindered. Domestic production areas are not allowed to mine and transport, and foreign countries are restricted by foreign exchange settlement. Therefore, the source of coal is entirely dependent on the supply of the Fuel Control Committee. About 120,000 tons are shipped from Qinhuangdao every month, and 70,000-80,000 tons are shipped from Helwan. Therefore, the actual needs are greatly insufficient.

### A Large Batch of Flour Continues to Arrive

The Yilang, managed by the foreign department manager of Jardine Matheson, arrived at the port at about 1:00 pm yesterday, carrying more than 160,000 bags of flour and more than 2,000 tons of wood from Vancouver, and docked at No. 2 and No. 3 pontoons for unloading. In addition, the American President Lines' Vanter Victory returned to the United States, carrying more than 2,000 tons of goods, including 700 tons of tung oil.

### The Lumber Market is Sluggish

The price of foreign pine is expected to decline due to the continuous arrival of goods. The supply of Min wood is abundant, and prices are falling. The prices of fir wood, both large and small, are also very depressed. The market price of large timbers is 450 yuan per foot, but in reality, there are no buyers even at 430 yuan. The small timbers also have a price difference of 20 yuan from the market price, but the sales are larger. The price of quarter-sawn timber is slightly firmer. The price of Hang wood is still stable, and the goods arriving are few.

### Silk Fabric Transactions are Slack; Old Tianqiao Goods Rise by 100,000

Yesterday, the market price of factory silk was stable, and transactions were still slack. Although foreign merchants had a slight intention to buy, they stopped buying when the price was high. The price of No. 120 Tianqiao old artificial silk rose by 100,000. Other artificial silks, due to the large number of goods, declined instead. As a result, there were differences. The prices of silk fabrics and quilt covers were high and sales were sluggish. The prices of Dacheng and miscellaneous brands also fell by 10,000-20,000. The sales of other unpopular goods were lively, but the prices remained the same.

### Vermicelli Rebounds

Recently, the sales of vermicelli have increased slightly due to winter sales, and the market situation has turned firm. The price of Shangzhuang Longkou vermicelli is 300,000 yuan, and the price of secondary vermicelli is 260,000-270,000 yuan, which is 30,000-40,000 yuan higher than the previous market. The trend is firm.

### Director Wu Yanin Comes to Shanghai to Discuss the Supply of State-Approved Textbooks; the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office is Strengthening Printing and Transportation Organizations

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 3rd] Wu Yanin, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, and his secretary Wei Bingxin, took the Beijing-Shanghai military plane today to Hong Kong to discuss the supply of state-approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools, and will sell them to the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office to strictly crack down on piracy.

[Another Dispatch] The issue of opening up state-approved textbooks for primary and secondary schools, which was once promoted, has recently entered a state of silence. This reporter met with a person in the publishing industry yesterday. According to him: the Ministry of Education held a serious discussion at the ministerial meeting after inviting the persons in charge of the eleven companies of the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office, which is responsible for printing, to Beijing last month to exchange opinions on how to print and supply the state-approved textbooks for the spring semester of next year. It was decided that the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office would continue to print and supply as originally planned, and crack down on piracy to ensure specialization. It is heard that Wu Yanin, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, came directly to Shanghai yesterday to discuss specific measures for speeding up printing and transportation with various companies. It is learned that the reasons for this are complicated, because the textbooks printed by each of the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office each period exceed 20 billion yuan. If there is no copyright protection, each company will inevitably stop printing and supplying. At that time, can the general small printing and publishing companies bear this heavy responsibility? How many can be printed and supplied in total nationwide? How will the remote provinces and counties be supplied? All these are problems. The textbook shortage has been greatly reduced in recent years, which is far from comparable to the serious situations of housing shortages and food shortages. After the autumn sales this year, the stocks of books in various places in the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office have reached more than 20 million copies, and the debt interest is very heavy. If they are not affected by military and transportation issues, they will be profitable. There is no need to worry about a shortage of books in various places. State-approved textbooks must have a unified nature. For example, the new and old textbooks that are sold most widely in China every year, with more than 7 million copies, also have strict control mechanisms and methods for their versions, paper printing, and prices. It is definitely not open copyright and free printing and supply. Some of the state-approved textbooks directly adopt textbooks from various companies, which are revised by the Ministry of Education. Some of them partially adopt articles, texts, charts and graphs from various companies. The companies have not transferred the copyright. Therefore, if the method of opening up copyright is adopted in the future, the rights must also be studied in detail in terms of law and technology. The specific solution can be quickly negotiated after Director Wu Yanin arrives in Shanghai within days. It is heard that the Seven-Company Joint Supply Office had previously purchased and stored a huge amount of paper, but because the rumor of releasing copyright was very prevalent, they have been delayed in printing. Now that the Ministry of Education has not changed its original policy, various companies are trying their best to strengthen printing and transportation organizations and use rotary presses to speed up printing in order to complete the supply and transportation to various places as soon as possible.

Owning 800 microscopes

### Shenyang Medical College, Ready for Operation

With Eight Hundred Microscopes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] According to sources in educational circles: The National Shenyang Medical College, established after reorganizing the former Manchukuo Medical University, now has four departments: the University Department, the Specialized Training Course, the Preparatory Course, and the Pharmaceutical Science Specialized Department.

### Principal of Rehe-Mongolia Normal School Departed from Peiping to Chifeng Yesterday

[This newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The Rehe-Mongolia Normal School has been decided to be established in Chifeng. Ji Qiuhuan, the principal of the school who was awaiting orders in Peiping, set off for Chifeng this morning. The Rehe-Mongolia Normal School is one of the three normal schools established by the Ministry of Education this year in the northern border regions, specifically for Mongolian students. During the Manchukuo era, the Japanese established the "Shidao School" in Chifeng. After the victory, the Chinese Communists continued to establish the "Zizhi College" there, also specifically for Mongolian youth. After Chifeng was recovered last month, most of the students of the college were dismissed. The Rehe-Mongolia Normal School is now using the old site of the Shidao School as its campus. It plans to enroll one hundred students this year, sixty of whom will be recommended by various leagues and banners. Some students have already arrived in Chaoyang and will go to Chifeng with Mr. Ji in the near future. The funds for the Rehe-Mongolia Normal School this year are sufficient, but the teaching staff is not yet complete. Mr. Ji welcomes urban youth with aspirations to serve in the border regions. Enrollment begins today.

### Peiping Normal College Establishes Mandarin Specialization, Enrollment Begins Today

[This newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The National Peiping Normal College has established a Mandarin Specialization program this year, according to the order of the Ministry of Education. When the reporter visited President Yuan Dunli yesterday to inquire about this matter, he said: In the past, the Northwest Normal College had a Mandarin Specialization program, and the results were quite good. More than ten graduates of that program have now been employed by the Mandarin Promotion Association of Taiwan Province and have gone to Taiwan to work. Now, the Ministry is again promoting this education and has ordered our college to establish a Mandarin Specialization program. Our college has decided to start registration on the 4th and 5th, and hold the examination on the 9th. The Ministry has stipulated that the students' period of study is two years. After graduation, they will be assigned to areas where Mandarin is not yet widespread to serve as Mandarin teachers, because Peiping is a place where Mandarin is very widespread, and there is no need for this kind of talent.

### Adjustable Desks and Chairs

To Be Adopted by Shanghai Fifth Girls' High School

The principals of Shanghai, Zhongxi, Dongnan, Biven and other girls' high schools believe that the current school desks are bulky, expensive, and impractical. Therefore, at a symposium of girls' high schools held a month ago, it was decided to invite Dai Xiangxi, the inventor of adjustable furniture, to design adjustable desks and chairs. Mr. Dai has put great effort into the design. The style is to connect the chair back to the table top, but to fasten it with screws so that it can be disassembled when not in use. The drawers are made of canvas and can be used as schoolbags when school is over, and as travel bags when traveling. Except for the chair surface and the table top, which are made of wood, the rest is metal. The main features are: first, the height can be adjusted at will to suit the student's height and line of sight, which is very suitable for practicing calligraphy and watching plays; second, each part can be disassembled, moved and placed at will, making it very convenient to carry out various activities in one room; third, the area occupied is very small, so that more students can be accommodated in the current shortage of school buildings. As for being economical and durable, that is an added bonus. The principals of the schools are all satisfied with this and plan to add a portion of them to the halls of each school from the next semester.

### Features of the 1945-1946 American Basketball Rules: Basketball Committee Announces Key Points

The Basketball Committee announced the following about the basketball rules for this season: This year's basketball league has decided to adopt the 1945-1946 American rules, which have been reviewed and compiled by the original translator, Zhou Jiaqi, and are now in the process of being printed. The book is expected to be published in mid-this month. There are not many new rules in the book, but there are many rewritten sentences and supplementary meanings, which can provide a clearer basis for studying the rules and training basketball skills. The key points of the new rules are briefly summarized below. If you want to know the details of the method and intention, you must refer to the text of the rules. Please pay attention to it.

(1) If a player comes off the bench after a "official timeout" in the second half after sixteen minutes, he may not re-enter the game.

(2) If the ball touches the body of a player who jumps up from the backcourt, it will be considered as passing back to the backcourt.

(3) If a player violates the rules during a jump ball, the referee may first use a hand signal to indicate it and temporarily not blow the whistle, giving the opposing team's jump ball player the opportunity to shoot the ball into the basket or giving the opposing team's player the first chance to get the ball. If any of the above cases are found, the violation will not be counted.

(4) Supporting the ball high on a teammate is a technical foul.

(5) Players participating in the tie-breaking period are not subject to the restrictions of the first rule.

(6) There are more analyses of personal fouls, and the responsibilities of players to each other in the event of a foul are explained in detail. If the referee and players follow the rules to distinguish right from wrong, they can get clearer instructions.

(7) A player who excessively bends his body and pushes towards his opponent, resulting in physical contact, is a personal foul, "charging."

(8) Physical contact caused by a defending player from behind the body of a player holding the ball is a personal foul, "pushing."

(9) A foul contact caused by a player's body after releasing the ball is "bumping."

(10) Athletes must not bump into opponents, and must not dribble forward between two hands that do not provide sufficient ground for them to pass through. In such cases, if physical contact occurs, the dribbler bears greater responsibility.

(11) When a player does not focus on grabbing the ball, but on shielding (preventing the opponent from reaching his destination), the physical contact that occurs and the unavoidable physical contact of "pushing" or "bumping" due to the player being too close to the opponent, even if using proper defensive methods, or passing through the opponent's path with extremely fast movements, then the player should bear greater responsibility for the foul.

(12) The referee's hand signals are now officially regulated. During the game, officials, players, and spectators can identify the nature of the referee's judgments from the hand signals, such as what kind of foul or violation it belongs to, etc.

The Thirteenth District's Shanty Towns Request Installation of Tap Water

The Public Works Bureau Yesterday Dispatched Personnel to Survey. The Public Works Bureau dispatched technician Yang Xiuchun to the Yaoshui Lane and Xitan area in the Thirteenth District (Putuo) to install tap water. Yang met with the person in charge of the district office and the local Pao-Chang for an on-site survey. According to technician Yang after the survey: "Poor people gather in the Yaoshui Lane and Xitan areas in the middle section of An Yuan Road (east of Changshou Road, west of Jiaozhou Road), and the shanty towns are densely packed. There are about three to four thousand households, and there is no tap water equipment in the area. Most residents buy water at high prices, and the poor occasionally take water from the Suzhou Creek as drinking water. Fire protection is extremely difficult, and it greatly affects the health of the people. Therefore, the installation of tap water in these shanty towns cannot be delayed." However, it is heard that this project must wait until technician Yang submits a reply for verification before forwarding it to the water company for processing.

Fourteenth District Distributes Flour to Relief Victims on Huasheng Road

The Fourteenth District (Zhabei) has 33 households on Huasheng Road that were affected by a large fire a few days ago. Most of them are shanty towns. After suffering losses, their lives are difficult. Contact has been made with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has allocated 102 bags of flour. On the morning of the 2nd, Ma Jiaxuan from the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and Chen Zhiyan from the Fourteenth District Office distributed flour according to population size at the Zhabei Charity Hall to provide relief.

The Fifth District (Taishan) District Office followed the "Provisional Implementation Measures for Promoting the Clean District System" issued by the Shanghai Municipal Government and convened a meeting of various agencies, schools, and district representatives in the district a few days ago. Participants included He Peiji from the Taishan Police Sub-bureau, Yu Wei, director of the Health Office, Yin Yong from the District People's Representative Assembly, Shen Lisheng, Captain of the Third Brigade of the Cleaning Corps, and Shen Shiyuan, Principal of the Central National Primary School. It was decided to establish a Fifth District Health Committee, which will hold regular meetings once a week to supervise residents to effectively carry out indoor and outdoor cleaning campaigns.

### Inside Story of Corruption Case of Suzhou Chamber of Commerce Supervisor; Underground Bank Merchants Reveal Information; City Defense Forces Strictly Investigate the Truth

— Special Dispatch from Our Suzhou Correspondent Wu Shuren

Since this newspaper first exposed a major corruption case in Suzhou, all sectors of Suzhou society have been paying close attention, all eager to learn the inside details as soon as possible.

This case involves Suzhou gentry such as Fan Junbo and Lu Shaofen. On the 16th of last month, they were summoned for questioning by the Paratrooper Headquarters cum Suzhou City Defense Command stationed in Suzhou, for a period of four hours. At the same time, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang, who operate underground banks, were also summoned one after another along with their account books. The detailed account of the events is as follows:

A Complaint Arouses Intense Investigation

As early as the beginning of November, Staff Director Xu Yagu, a colonel in the City Defense Command, overheard a complaint. This complaint came from a merchant running an underground bank. The gist of it was: "The local military and political organs have all taken our bribes, but they still won't let us operate openly..." This complaint immediately aroused a sense of shame and indignation in the heart of the young and energetic Director Xu. He then meticulously investigated his subordinates, and the result was that no one in the City Defense Command had taken even a single copper from the underground banks. Although the innocent are innocent and the guilty are guilty, and cannot be confused by any external rumors, the advancing soldiers cherish their military reputation more than life itself. Therefore, Director Xu reported to Commander Ma and, with permission, launched an on-the-ground investigation in many directions. The information obtained was consistent, all saying that the underground banks had spent money twice between July and September of this year to bribe military and political organs. It is said that the first time was in mid-July, with an amount of over 50 million yuan, and the second time was in mid-September (around the Mid-Autumn Festival), with an amount of about 30 million yuan. The identities of those who handled the collection of the money were also clearly identified. At the time, the City Defense Command believed that the first time in mid-July, the paratroopers had not yet taken over defense, so it could be ignored, but the second time in mid-September was during the period when they had already assumed the City Defense duties, so they had to thoroughly investigate the matter to the end.

Using a False Name to Accept Bribes; Local Gentry Suspected

However, the names of the people who were said to have handled the collection of bribes in their intelligence were too unbelievable. Who could believe that a member of the gentry occupying a leading position in society would not lead society forward, but instead lead illegal underground banks in bribery? Moreover, the underground banks that spent the money said that this bribe (the second one) was specifically for the City Defense Command, but in fact, the City Defense Command had not received a single penny. It was clear that there was suspicion of someone using a false name to embezzle the money. In order to seek verification to avoid wrongly accusing anyone, Commander Ma used a trick and sent two staff members from the City Defense Command, pretending that the City Defense Command needed funds, to visit Fan Junbo. To their surprise, Mr. Fan readily agreed that he could raise 20 million yuan and pay it off the next day. This response undoubtedly confirmed the accuracy of the intelligence. Commander Ma, along with his Chief of Staff Major General Xu Yanwu, Staff Director Colonel Liu Nongjun, City Defense Command Chief of Staff Colonel Li Yinian, and Staff Director Colonel Xu Yayin, all the senior officers of the Paratrooper Headquarters, were inflamed with righteous indignation and could no longer have any reservations or tolerance. Thus, at around 10 a.m. on the 16th, Fan Junbo was brought into the Chief of Staff's office of the Paratrooper Headquarters under an unusual atmosphere.

6 Million Yuan From Underground Banks

The questioning was very polite, but in the politeness, a solemn emotion was fully revealed. However, the development of the situation was truly unexpected. Under the very kind questioning of the two Chiefs of Staff Xu and Li and the two Staff Directors Liu and Xu, Fan Junbo actually revealed a third instance of raising funds from underground banks. The reporter's humble pen may not be able to describe this complex case, so I have specially excerpted the questions and answers between them, in their original wording, as follows: (Question) It has been reported that officers and soldiers of this Headquarters have asked underground banks for money. Mr. Fan, are you aware of this? (Answer) I have not heard of it. Only because the lending of underground banks is prohibited, the Security Team and the Police Bureau borrowed 6 million yuan to make cotton uniforms. (Question) Is there anything else? (Answer) There was 6 million yuan, and nothing else. (Question) Who handled the raising of the 6 million yuan, and where is the money now? (Answer) It was personally raised and delivered to Lu Shaofen by the three underground bank merchants, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang. I can prove it. (Question) How was the funding for the Cotton Uniform Purchasing Committee raised? (Answer) It was borrowed from the underground banks. The 6 million yuan was delivered without taking a receipt, and we do not intend to repay it in the future, so no receipt was issued. (Question) Does the Purchasing Committee have letters of appointment? (Answer) Yes, there are letters of appointment, and we have held two meetings, discussing raising funds to make uniforms, and repaying it in the future with business tax revenue. (Question) Can you bring the letters of appointment and meeting minutes for us to see? (Answer) Yes, I can. (Question) Why borrow from underground banks instead of borrowing from banks? (Answer) The underground banks voluntarily provided the funds. It would be best if we could repay them, but if not, we would not need to.

Summoning Many People; Each Holds Their Own View

Based on Fan Junbo's answers, Commander Ma and Chief of Staff Xu and others decided to temporarily put aside the 30 million yuan from mid-September and first thoroughly investigate the so-called borrowed uniform fee of 6 million yuan. Because Fan Junbo said that he could prove that the 6 million yuan was personally raised and delivered to Lu Shaofen by Lu Tiesun and others, Lu Tiesun, Wang Yizhi, and Wu Bingzhang were immediately summoned for questioning. Summarizing their statements, the following points can be summarized: (1) The 6 million yuan for the uniform sewing fee was given to Fan Junbo and was a loan, put together by twenty or thirty underground banks, each contributing 250,000 yuan. (2) The money was handed over in late October. (3) Because Fan is the supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce, they trusted him and did not take a receipt, but it was not raised in the name of the Paratrooper Headquarters. (4) Not long after the 6 million yuan was raised and paid, Lu Shaofen deposited 2 million yuan in Wu Bingzhang's bank in his personal name. With the case developing to this extent, Lu Shaofen was bound to appear. Here, the reporter will also excerpt their questions and answers in their original wording as follows: (Question) Recently, in October, Fan Junbo demanded money from the underground banks. Was it distributed to you? (Answer) Fan is a member of the Uniform Manufacturing Committee. He borrowed 6 million yuan for sewing fees and wanted to give it to me for safekeeping, but I am not a member, so I did not accept it. (Question) Where is the money? (Answer) At that time, it was still with Fan Junbo. The next day, he wanted me to keep it, but I still refused. So Fan asked the original fundraisers to deposit it with them, stating that it would be paid when the sewing fees were due. (Question) They say the money is with you? (Answer) They are avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. We can confront each other face to face.

### The "Uniform Fee" Questioning Reaches Its Climax

The above excerpts of the three parties' statements each hold their own views, and it is not easy to judge who is right and who is wrong; as Lu Shaofen said, they can confront each other face to face. In fact, it had to be done this way, and the questioning work progressed to its climax. The reporter will briefly record their confrontation in question-and-answer format as follows: (Question) Lu Tiesun: Who did you give the raised funds to? (Answer) I gave it to Mr. Fan. I was not present. (Question) Fan Junbo: Did you hear that? (Answer) I asked Mr. Lu to keep it. (Question) Lu Shaofen: Where is the money? (Answer) I didn't take it. Later, it was divided and given to Lu Tiesun, Wang Yangzhi, and Wu Bingzhang, 2 million yuan each. (Question) Lu Tiesun: Do you have 2 million yuan with you? (Answer) Yes, I have 2 million yuan with me. It's just a deposit. I don't know what the money is for. They gave it to me because the risk is high. (Question) Fan Junbo: Have the uniforms been made? (Answer) They have just started to be made. (Question) Fan Junbo: Who did you solicit funds from? (Answer) Only from underground banks. They are donations. (Question) Lu Tiesun: Why didn't you follow formal procedures for receiving and paying the funds? (Answer) It was really due to personal relationships. (Question) Lu Shaofen: You didn't follow procedures for receiving and paying the funds, which shows it wasn't above board. (Answer) But the people are like that! (Question) Fan Junbo: How will you repay it? (Answer) Repay it with business tax revenue.

County Magistrate's Statement; The Truth About Purchasing Cotton Clothing

The questioning reached this stage, and almost everything was clear. However, because Fan Junbo repeatedly said that the raising of this fund had the meeting minutes of the Cotton Uniform Purchasing Committee as proof, and that he was prepared to repay it with business tax revenue, it seemed that the county government could not escape the matter. Therefore, on the 16th, Commander Ma decided to order all relevant persons to return, and ask Fan Junbo to provide the meeting minutes before discussing a solution. However, the meeting minutes had not been provided by the 19th, so Chief of Staff Xu invited County Magistrate Lu Jianhua to formally inquire about whether the Wu County Security Police Cotton Clothing Purchasing Committee had authorized Fan Junbo to raise sewing fees. Lu solemnly stated that the cotton clothing fee for the Security Police this year was a total of 108 million yuan, which had already been included in the county budget, but because the official documents were being submitted to the province for appropriation and the Security Police personnel needed cotton clothing to protect against the cold, it was already imperative, so he invited local leaders and gentry to form a Purchasing Committee, whose work was purely to handle bidding and opening bids in order to be fair and there was no fundraising component. Moreover, after the contract for the cotton uniforms was awarded to Li Zhenji Western Clothing Store, the contract stipulated that 60% would be paid in advance. The county government had already allocated 35 million yuan in cash and paid fabric at a discounted price of 20 million yuan, fulfilling the terms of the contract, and there was absolutely no need to raise additional sewing fees. Lu also firmly denied that he had prior knowledge of Fan Junbo's actions.

Protecting the Local Area; Not Expecting the Slightest Remuneration

County Magistrate Lu's statement is worthy of our attention. At least he has determined the nature of this case: is it embezzlement or corruption? The reporter inquired about the handling of this case with Major General Ma Shigong. According to Ma, he said with great emotion: "It takes a hundred years to cultivate a person. A person's reputation in society cannot be achieved overnight. Our original intention in thoroughly investigating this case is, on the one hand, because there are rumors outside that the City Defense Command has received bribes, and on the other hand, it is based on the intention of persuading people to do good. Therefore, as long as the reputation of our Headquarters is maintained and they know to be cautious in the future, we will not prepare to embarrass people too much. In short, we are ordered to be stationed in Suzhou to protect the local area. It is our duty, and we will never ask for the slightest remuneration, nor will we use a single penny of the local people's hard-earned money!"

However, according to news from relevant parties, the 6 million yuan in collected funds is really not the object that the stationed troops need to investigate. What they urgently seek to clarify is the incident in mid-September of raising 30 million yuan in bribes purely in the name of the stationed troops. Therefore, whether there will be any further developments in the future, up to the time this reporter stopped writing, it cannot be said that the investigation has stopped here. However, even if we do not continue to pursue the matter, it is enough to give a very serious warning to some people who do not know how to restrain themselves. The actions of the Paratrooper Headquarters are indeed an emergency injection for the deteriorating social atmosphere in Suzhou! We look forward to the vigorous growth of youthful vigor, and the unfolding of new contact with the decaying forces of darkness. How should we promote the unveiling of this bright atmosphere!

### Western Yunnan in Suffering

— Air Dispatch, November 23, Special Correspondent Xu Jilian from Kunming

Western Yunnan—this vast area of just over 761,000 people, but with an area of 42,120 square kilometers, would probably have been forgotten long ago if there were not occasional news reports of severe disasters.

Of course, such a remote area with towering mountains, rugged terrain, no rivers, and no railways has only 347 kilometers of highways that can be used for transportation. However, the length of the packhorse trails is more than 5,730 kilometers. If we calculate the average daily journey to be 30 kilometers, it would take 191 days to travel around the area. Furthermore, more than 58% of the area of Western Yunnan is in the malarial zone. Therefore, many people consider it a daunting task. It really takes the greatest determination and perseverance to develop this land.

Speaking of which, the two counties of Longling and Tengchong were the most severely ravaged by the enemy in Yunnan. Unfortunately, this has caused the greatest disaster to the entire Western Yunnan. The population is continuing to die, and the most serious thing is the difficulty of surviving in the disaster area. Therefore, various ethnic groups of the Sino-Tibetan and Tibeto-Burman families are flocking out of the national border, or accepting relief from outside the border. From a national defense point of view, if we do not quickly appease them, the consequences cannot be imagined.

Complex Ethnic Groups; Different Dialects

Speaking of the complexity of the ethnic groups in Western Yunnan, this is also a unique phenomenon. If we list them, according to the survey, there are: Han, Han Baiyi, Shui Baiyi, Big and Small Puman, Achang, Minjia, Nuzi, **, Kawa, Shantou, Tuli, Chashan, Han Lisu, Black Lisu, Lao Kang, Luohei, Langsu, **, Hua Lisu, and Luoluo, as many as 21 kinds. Moreover, they all have different dialects. People who come to this area will find it difficult to gain a relatively clear understanding of them unless they plan to stay for three or five years.

Here, we want to make outsiders understand a little about the disaster situation in Western Yunnan. First of all, the population loss after the war has decreased by more than 26% compared with before the war. The total amount of monetary losses is about 50 billion yuan. Even more unfortunately, the floods that occurred in July of this year have been rampant in the areas along the Longjiang, Yingjiang, Donghe, Shidianhe, and Dabahe rivers. Looking at the map, the area has reached 200,000 mu. Following the floods came the famine. The reason is that Western Yunnan usually has a shortage of food. Tengchong and Longling have been liberated from the enemy's clutches, and the image of poor harvests has become a reality. More and more fields are barren, coupled with the lack of strong laborers, insufficient manpower, the death of livestock, and insufficient animal power, and there is a sense of panic about seeds and fertilizers, so it is not difficult to imagine the severity of the disaster.

Alternative Grains Are Expensive; Diseases Are Connected

When there is a famine in other places, we often hear about using tree bark and grass roots as alternative grains to fill hunger. Think about it: tree bark and grass roots should be picked up everywhere. However, even "alternative grains" have become a problem in the disaster area of Western Yunnan. Do you not believe it? The price of tree roots and grass roots per catty has reached 2,000 yuan. How could this be imagined in the 20th century?

Speaking of the invasion of diseases, Western Yunnan has suffered even greater threats. More than 58% of the entire territory is in the malarial zone. The malaria mosquitoes in the Nujiang River Valley, Nanding River Valley, and the lower reaches of Yingjiang will surely make anyone who has been to Western Yunnan "turn pale at the mention of mosquitoes." The annual plague is also tormenting people. The latent power of this "local disease" is great. Furthermore, the epidemic area of relapsing fever is large, and the mortality rate is high. Residents in Baoshan, Tengchong, Longling, Lianghe, and **shui all call relapsing fever "chicken coop disease" because every death inevitably involves an entire family. Other diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and influenza often attack, which are also secondary reasons why the population of Western Yunnan cannot increase.

Too Much Rainfall; Difficulty in Clothing and Food

Speaking of climate, those who have been to it are full of fond memories. But what about Western Yunnan? "There are no cold or hot seasons, and one rain turns it into winter." The pressure of the rainy season is also very heavy. There is too much rainfall in Western Yunnan, and the distribution is extremely uneven. The rainy season can last for up to five months, making it impossible to grow cotton. This affects the panic about clothing. Long-term wind and rain erosion makes the problem of housing even more serious. Recovery has been achieved for two years, but the recovery of construction is still less than one-thousandth. Displaced people are wandering and have no support. But doesn't the problem always exist?

### Rather Let One Person Die Than Let One Cow Die

Mountain people are closest to livestock. Their clothing, food, housing, and transportation, almost their entire lives, cannot be separated from livestock. In Western Yunnan, this is even more pronounced. Without cows, they cannot plow. Without horses, they cannot travel. In the disaster area, there is a saying that is popular: "Rather let one person die than let one cow die." Because the disaster area now needs 50,000 head of plowing cattle. If we calculate very roughly, the death of one cow will leave an average of 15 mu of land uncultivated, and each mu of land produces an average of 450 catties of rice (15 mu of land produces a total of 6,750 catties of rice). Each person needs an average of 20 catties of rice per day. If we calculate it this way, the consequence of the death of one cow is that 4,500 people will live on the verge of starvation.

Relief Work Is Not Easy to Promote

The situation is very serious. The disastrous situation in the disaster area should have a rough idea based on the above description. However, what about relief work? Frankly speaking, it is extremely scarce. The Western Yunnan Office of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was established this spring, but it did not formally start work until April. The enthusiasm for work is certainly high, but the limitations of the environment and materials make it impossible for them to start smoothly. Director Xu Songjiu has stayed in Western Yunnan for a long time and is very familiar with the local situation. The reporter met him in Baoshan three months ago. He shook his head and said that Western Yunnan is more dilapidated than it was two years ago when it was recovered. Relief is already urgent. However, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. People in Western Yunnan say in unison: If it is not UNRRA materials, it cannot be considered relief. However, to obtain materials, even UNRRA finds it difficult, difficult! From a series of difficult words, we can also imagine the difficulties of those in charge! It is said that when relief work was launched in Longling, 42 people, including the speaker of the county council, jointly refused relief other than UNRRA materials and obstructed the investigation work. This made them a little discouraged. Director Xu Songjiu then flew to Beijing and Shanghai to ask for instructions. It is said that the situation is still quite satisfactory. Relief supplies can be airlifted to Yunnan. At the Yunnan Provincial Council in Kunming, some senators also suggested expanding the Western Yunnan Office into a Yunnan branch. There is no answer from the central government yet. The new director, Mr. Huo Baochu, has been in office for a long time, so perhaps there will be some new hope!

Problems cannot always be allowed to exist. In short, Western Yunnan is suffering. In this area that is 6,286 square kilometers larger than Taiwan, more than 700,000 people are living, fighting against diseases and struggling on the verge of starvation. What they expect and need is only the most practical relief!

### Kunming Fire Disaster! A Record of the Burning of Guangfu Building on Wuhua Mountain

— Special Correspondent Yu Jilian, Air Dispatch from Kunming, 25th

On the afternoon of November 24th, at two o'clock, a major fire, unseen in Kunming for several years, broke out. The place burned was Guangfu Building on Wuhua Mountain, the most notable landmark in Yunnan, the seat of the Yunnan provincial government since the Republic of China, and the palace of Wu Sangui, the Prince Who Pacified the West. More than twenty-eight years ago, a military government supporting the Republican army was established here. Governor Tang Jiyao issued orders from here, crushing Yuan Shikai's imperial dream. This residence on the mountaintop had a glorious historical significance in restoring the country, hence, it became the origin of the name "Guangfu Building."

Gasoline Used for Mopping the Floor, Fire Started Carelessly

The cause of the fire was very coincidental: On a Sunday afternoon, a section member of the provincial government led four workers to "wax" the floor of the chairman's office. To make the floor smooth and shiny, yellow wax was mixed with gasoline, heated, and warmed. Carelessly, the gasoline caught fire, and smoke billowed. The fire god Zhu Rong suddenly descended. The workers panicked, pulling the floor covering to try to extinguish the fire, but inadvertently made it worse, spilling a bucket of leftover gasoline in the corner. Instantly, the fire was "fueled," and with the help of the wind, this historically valuable and renowned building was engulfed by flames.

Anyone who has been to Yunnan has admired the mystery of this majestic building atop the mountain. Indeed, the people of Yunnan respect Wuhua Mountain no differently than the people of the former capital view the Ming Palace. It has become the most familiar "name" to the seventeen million people of Yunnan, a building that stands atop a jungle-covered mountain, both desirable and inaccessible, with two rows of two-story office buildings and a connected three-story building in the middle, with the large gilded characters of "Wang Zhao" inscribed on it. This is precisely the location where the Yunnan Provincial Governor's Office, the Military Governor's Mansion, the Provincial Government, the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, and the Pacification Commissioner's Office have been stationed throughout history.

Surrounded by Mountains, the Whole City Lights Up at Dusk

In the evening, one of Kunming's Eight Scenic Wonders, "Wuhua Encircling," was displayed on this mountaintop. From here, you can overlook the entire Kunming's lakes and mountains, like Kun Lake, Emerald Sea, and the famous Reclining Buddha Mountain and Sleeping Beauty Mountain, all within sight, evoking thoughts of Roman Emperor Caesar. Therefore, many older generations in Yunnan say: Wuhua Mountain has good geomantic power. Don't believe it? Look at "Surrounded by mountains, the whole city lights up at dusk."

Because Wuhua Mountain is the location of the highest authority in Yunnan Province, the source of the people's fortune and misfortune, access is heavily guarded. The general public has a sense of reverence and fear towards it. Some people have never "been up the mountain" in their entire lives. Thus, Guangfu Building has become an object woven of reverence, fear, mystery, and doubt. As a citizen, one can only look up from a distance, admiring the row of neat, red buildings. Old timers in Yunnan told me: The past martial arts school of Chenghua Garden, now the Fifth Branch of the Central Military Academy, its gate faces Guangfu Building. Some interpret it this way: The military academy students, upon exiting the gate, immediately see Wuhua Mountain, and involuntarily feel a sense of illusion, "I should go sit up there for a couple of days." This caused some concern, so the authorities later moved the gate of the military branch to Honghua Bridge, preventing it from directly facing Wuhua Mountain again.

Exquisitely Decorated Reception Hall, Various Ghost Stories

The interior of Guangfu Building was quite exquisite. The lower level was a magnificent reception hall, surrounded by high walls with white lacquered and gilded carvings, hanging with exquisite chandeliers gifted by Master Zhang Zuolin, velvet carpets, valuable oil paintings, elegant sandalwood chairs, and screen-like large mirrors… all becoming beautiful and delicate embellishments to this building. The offices seemed somewhat dark and spacious, as each room was also inlaid with Qing Dynasty stone tablets, with a long corridor and walkway outside. Thus, many ghost stories were talked about by the guards stationed on the mountain.

During the more than eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Yunnan suffered many major bombings, but Guangfu Building on Wuhua Mountain still stood tall, making people see it as a symbol of magic. In February of this year, the Yunnan Provincial Government was reorganized. Wuhua Mountain, under heavy guard, did not suffer the slightest damage. Although "the landlord changed," the glorious historical traces of Guangfu Building still radiated light. Who would have thought that a major fire would engulf this historically significant building?

Egyptian King's Golden Palace Borrowed by the God of Fire

The fire reflected red across half the sky, and even at four in the morning, smoke was still smoldering. Although the firefighters fought bravely, they ultimately could not overcome the power of heaven. On the morning of the 25th, the reporter rushed to the fire scene. The embers had not yet extinguished. The conference hall and reception hall, where provincial government meetings were held and hundreds of foreign guests were received in the past, were already a desolate wasteland, a pile of rubble. One could only offer a final lament and elegy to the wind.

Most of the documents and files were rescued, which was a blessing in disguise. The planned joint office, which had been planned for a long time, was now forcibly implemented. Several perpetrators were in custody, and the person in charge resigned to take responsibility. Guangfu Building would henceforth only be a historical term. I still remember British journalist John Gunther describing the reception hall of Guangfu Building in his "Inside Asia," saying, "This gilded reception hall is as rich and magnificent as the golden palace of an ancient Egyptian king." As I left the fire scene, I had a hallucination of a towering palace!

### Dictatorship in Yugoslavia

— Translated and excerpted by Zhang Yiren from Reader's Digest

The author, B.ita, is a senior official of the South Government, married to the famous Italian historian Bula. He is engaged in journalism in New York.

Communists around the world are seeking "democracy." Everywhere outside the Soviet Union, they are eager to join the "National Front," "People's Front," "Progressive People's Committee," and other similar organizations in order to promote "democracy." Having resided in this country for a long time, I have some experience and insight into this cunning "strategy," and now I might as well record one or two things for reference.

Dictatorial Politics

In 1945, the South Government appointed me as the director of the foreign intelligence group for Marshal Tito's propaganda. The Tito government claimed to be the "People's Front," and all ethnic groups in the country were equal, regardless of party affiliation or political views. Thus, the Communist Party also had a foothold in the government. The Communist Party always advocated "management" rather than "cooperation," so all the "powerful figures" in the country were absorbed, resulting in the opposite of "democracy"; there was no freedom of speech, publication, or thought, and the people's thoughts were dominated by the "political police." Arrests, imprisonments, death sentences, and massacres were possible at any time. The South Government was simply a terrifying dictatorship!

The Communist Party called ordinary believers in "democracy" "useful fools," and I was one of them. In 1943, I was the head of the South Government's intelligence group in New York. I had been employed by the Yugoslav government since 1928. The pre-war South Government lacked democratic ideals. Tito had convened the First National Liberation Conference, so I suspected that Tito's government might be the beginning of democratic politics.

Of course, I thought a democratic federal government would be better than Emperor Peter the Great's imperial government, so I supported Tito and often published articles in American newspapers. I had an article published in National Magazine saying, "New Naslav is growing, and I like the Tito government because the hopes of our new country are all pinned on this government."

Secret Police

Therefore, I returned to China by ship from New York in November 1940, and my whole family went to the pier to see me off. At that time, I dreamed that they would soon be able to live with me in the free territory of Yugoslavia. When I arrived in Barglade, flowers of freedom were everywhere—freedom given by the Soviets. The streets were full of Soviet soldiers, and looking into the shop windows, there were photos of Marshal Stalin, so I didn't mind the Soviet soldiers robbing my watch. "Give me this watch" was the common phrase used by the Soviet army to the citizens of South Korea. Watches clearly had a special interest for this group of "liberators." Indeed, they were "liberators," part of our Slavic nation.

The ruling class before the war has now become ragged vagrants. Since I took office in the propaganda department, I have been secretly monitored by secret communists, because I wrote a book in 1940 called "The Suffering of Europe," which they thought was too biased towards democratic ideas. The propaganda minister at that time was Save Kosa nvich, now the ambassador to Washington. Because he was not a communist, the department's affairs were controlled by his assistant, a communist, and Foreign Minister Ivan Subasich was also not a member of the party, so his power was in the hands of a communist.

At first, the Communist Party declared that the "White House" would be turned into dormitories for children and workers, but now the opposite is true—the White House is now Marshal Tito's residence, the most magnificent in the country.

Deathly Still

Tito likes to smile, is quite capable, dresses like Corin, and has a style like Mussolini. Like fascism, communism also needs a lively "symbol"; when he inspects the ranks of workers, civil servants, and school-age children, Tito smiles as a courtesy, listening to the cheers from the ranks: "Tito is ours; we are Tito's. Tito! Tito!" At that time, Tito seemed like God on earth. Each of Tito's speeches was entirely written by the Minister of Finance (a member of the Workers' Party) and a friend of Stalin.

In order to rule over the 14 million people of Yugoslavia, the South Government established a secret police structure called the "Ministry of Civil Defense," employing 100,000 "spies," and also had organizations similar to Hitler's Fifth Column, whose food, clothing, and housing were the richest in the country.

I made a three-mile domestic trip and found that everything was deathly still. In my hometown, an old woman asked me, "Why are you here? Only the dead are happy here." A farmer said to me: "The Communist Party has come, and we are free. They took our sixty children away, and now there is no news. We used to be able to dance together, but now no one comes to dance with us. Besides working, we just have to sit at home. This is what they call our freedom!"

It is obvious that the actions of the Tito government were entirely controlled by the Soviet government. The position of the South Country can be said to be a vassal state. The Soviet government's policy wants to bring South Korea and the United States into a state of opposition.

In short, the Soviet Union's policy intends to merge the six Yugoslav ethnic groups into Bulgaria and Albania to form a "Balkan Federation," and then merge this federation into the Soviet Federation to become a republic of the Soviet Union. In this way, Soviet Russia can directly cross the Black Sea to reach the Adriatic Sea, pass through Albania, and then enter the Mediterranean Sea. The Soviet Union's attempt is unprecedented since the Tsarist Russia, and it is really shocking to hear!

Current Affairs Commentary

### Poland on Success Lake

— Chu Yukun

From Investigating Foreign Troops to Disarmament

The world situation after the war has been in an uncertain stage; recently, it has fallen into a dormant state. Only Poland on Success Lake has repeatedly risen, and there have been verbal battles in the United Nations General Assembly. In the past week, the focus of the debate has shifted from investigating foreign troops to the issue of disarmament. Although both of these issues were raised by the Soviet representative, and Molotov also wanted to use them as tools to attack Britain and the United States, the result of the debate was that the Soviet Union suffered repeated setbacks, and the United Nations General Assembly passed amendments proposed by British and American representatives.

Domestic and Foreign Investigations Simultaneously

When the United Nations Security Council met on November 26 to discuss the issue of investigating foreign troops in various countries, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed a compromise plan advocating two points: (1) All member states of the United Nations should, in accordance with the amendments proposed by the representatives of various countries, provide accurate information on their military strength stationed in other member states of the United Nations or in the territory of former enemy countries before January 1, 1947; (2) postpone the discussion on the issue of troops held domestically by various countries of the United Nations until the issue of universal disarmament is discussed, and discuss it together.

However, British representative Elbeck and American representative Connally still expressed their dissent to the Soviet Union's compromise plan. At the end of the debate, the United Nations Political and Security Committee passed the British proposal by a majority of forty votes to ten. According to the British proposal, it is advocated that the troops stationed abroad by member states of the United Nations and all troops within their borders should be investigated simultaneously. However, the proposal submitted by the Soviet representative to investigate the armaments of various countries was rejected and not discussed.

Disarmament Issue Raised Again

The United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of disarmament again on the 28th. The original proposer, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, again expressed his views, strongly stating that "universal disarmament is of great benefit to all countries, whether they are large or small. The hope of mankind rests on this." Then, French representative Balodi took the floor and expressed his support for the Soviet proposal. As for the main points of the Soviet proposal, there are four: (1) For the sake of world peace, the United Nations General Assembly should recognize the principle of universal disarmament of all countries; (2) the use of atomic energy for military purposes should be prohibited; (3) the United Nations General Assembly should propose to the Security Council to ensure the implementation of these principles; (4) the United Nations General Assembly should appeal to all member states to provide all necessary assistance to the Security Council.

However, the Australian representative proposed an amendment, according to which the representative of the Communist Party, Meijin, stated: (1) the issue of disarmament should be resolved at the same time as the issue of security; (2) prevent future agreements from invalidating existing conventions; (3) the disarmament mechanism should take into account the work carried out by the United Nations Supreme Staff Council; (4) the principle of equality of all countries must be clearly stipulated and must be used as the basis for discussion. At the same time, American representative Connally also expressed his views, clarifying the United States' attitude towards the issue of disarmament. In fact, (1) disarmament and collective security should advance simultaneously, (2) the United Nations General Assembly should take definite measures to ensure that disarmament is universal and effective; (3) atomic energy must be controlled by United Nations agencies; (4) we must pay special attention to all active troops in various countries, and we should also take into account the troops that can be mobilized at any time.

China's Attitude Synthesizes Opinions

As for China's attitude towards this issue? Dr. Gu Weijun explained it: He said: "After carefully studying the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, Australia, and Canada, I believe that the Soviet Union's plan is the simplest, even too simple, and needs to be revised and supplemented. Therefore, the amendment proposed by Canada is the most useful, and the amendment of Australia is also the same. In summary, it can be summarized into four specific measures: (1) In accordance with the provisions of Article 43 of the United Nations Charter, organize international troops; (2) Although the Atomic Energy Commission must continue to work in accordance with the current rules and procedures, all atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction should be prohibited; (3) In accordance with the principles revealed in the amendments of Canada and Australia, establish an international control mechanism and monitoring system; (4) All countries should support the Security Council and the Atomic Energy Commission and provide assistance to ensure that their work can proceed smoothly.

The opinions of various countries on the issue of disarmament are too divergent, and no conclusion can be reached in the General Assembly, so it has to be shelved and temporarily not discussed.

### The Soviet Navy is Still Insignificant Compared to Britain and the United States

— [Translated by Daishan from Reuters data]

Although the Soviet Union has recently been building battleships with sixteen-inch caliber giant guns and is building or has built aircraft carriers of 22,000 tons, according to existing information, it is sufficient to prove that since the defeat of Germany, the Soviet Union has made very little progress in starting to build a strong Red Fleet.

The latest edition of Jane's Fighting Ships magazine says: Soviet naval engineers have been building battleships named Trille International, equipped with nine sixteen-inch guns. Its keel was laid in the Leningrad Port Dock in 1939. At the same time, another giant ship of the same class may be under construction in the same port in the Baltic Sea.

The aircraft carrier Krasnaya Znamya, equipped with twenty-two aircraft, may have been completed recently or launched last year. Jane's report did not mention the information about the Soviet Union's start of new shipbuilding last year, so it can be determined that the Soviet fleet is still an incomparably small number compared to the British and American navies. In 1946, after World War II, the British and American naval officers and staff numbered 492,800 and 550,000, respectively. Jane's report says that the Red Fleet has a total of 23,600 staff members.

According to Jane's report, the Soviet Union's current largest naval heavy gun is a twelve-inch caliber rifled bore with a 714-pound projectile. Currently, the United States has five types of heavy naval main guns, two of which are sixteen-inch caliber and can fire 2,100-pound projectiles. The United Kingdom has four types of heavy guns, including a sixteen-inch rifled bore that fires 2,461-pound projectiles. Jane's believes that the Soviet Union has only four old battleships and ten cruisers, including the German Nuremberg, which was decided to be taken over by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference. The Soviet Union obtained an American cruiser during the war, now renamed the Mooming, and other smaller British and American ships. The Soviet Union obtained seven German cruisers and seven smaller Nazi ships, as well as ten submarines and two icebreakers.

Jane's believes that the Soviet Union has already plundered one cruiser and several gunboats from the puppet Manchukuo. In addition, Jane's also believes that the Soviet Union already has more than 100 submarines.

Judging from the current state of the Soviet fleet, it is extremely small compared to Britain and the United States.

### One World, Cartoon Explanation

The New York Press Association (reporter Mao Shuqing of this newspaper is one of the members) held a banquet on November 11 at the 18th floor restaurant of the Waldorf Hotel in New York to welcome the chief representatives of various countries to the United Nations General Assembly and the representatives of various countries to the Security Council. On the menu, famous international painters and Ji Lun drew historically rich cartoons. All the giants were dressed in foreign costumes. For example, Barnes was dressed in Chinese costumes, Gu Weijun was dressed in French costumes, Bevin was dressed in Russian costumes, and Molotov was dressed in Scottish costumes, etc. At the same time, Barnes was holding a document with five languages written on it, indicating that the world is one family, without boundaries. Strange costumes were mixed together in a crowded hall, and everyone was happy. The picture is lively and vivid, using humor to the fullest.

### Connally: One of the Decision-Makers of American Foreign Policy

— Translated by Yu Qiang

Who decides American foreign policy? President Truman? No! Readers only need to recall the circumstances surrounding Wallace's pronouncements to understand that behind him, there is a hidden, enormous power manipulating things. Secretary of State Byrnes? Also no, he, like Truman, is merely an executor. Then who is issuing orders from behind the scenes? – The Foreign Relations Committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. To be more specific, it is the chairmen of these two committees: Connally and Vandenberg.

Let's talk about Connally here.

Tom Connally was born in McLennan County, Texas, in 1877. He was a country boy. From a young age, he had great eloquence, and the locals gave him the nickname "Talking Tom." Because his legs were very thin, he also got the nickname: "Double-Barreled Short Gun." His father often said to him: "If I had your education, I would have been in Congress long ago."

So Connally was determined to become a member of Congress when he was young. And he finally achieved his goal, entering the halls of Congress in 1916. When Connally was campaigning, his opponent pretended to be a simple man, riding around the district in a conspicuously dilapidated car, giving campaign speeches. Connally wanted to find an even more dilapidated car to compete, but couldn't find one. So, he had a stroke of inspiration and abandoned his original plan, buying a beautiful, big car with red wheels. He said to the voters: "If my opponent doesn't even have the ability to buy a decent car for himself, he doesn't have the ability to represent you in Congress." The voters agreed with him, and he was elected.

Since then, Connally has been living the life of a congressman in Washington. In 1928, he was elected as a senator, and has been re-elected ever since. Although Connally has been a "resident" in Washington for thirty years, he still speaks authentic Texas American English, full of ungrammatical slang. His family is also filled with a strong hometown flavor. He and his wife are popular for their Sunday breakfast of sausage, light red ham, peaches, and smoked ham – all of which are brought from Texas.

Connally is known as the "Peacemaker from Texas." After World War I ended, he vigorously supported the League of Nations and the World Court. When Senator Nye accused President Wilson of deceiving the country into entering the war, the first to challenge Nye was Connally. During this World War, in order to defeat fascism and obtain lasting peace, he led the passage of the repeal of the Neutrality Acts in the Senate, and passed the Lend-Lease Act – as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, it was his responsibility to lead the senators in passing treaties and agreements to strive for peace.

Because of these things, what Connally says carries weight. The hallway of his reception room is often filled with people, who have come to listen to his opinions. Connally is not only eloquent, but also good at imitating, with many gestures, showing no airs whatsoever. He is almost seventy years old this year, with white hair that hangs down behind his head almost to his collar, plus his stiff white shirt, deliberately careless black bow tie and a long black coat, make his appearance very much like an actor playing a role in a Shakespearean play from the old days.

Now, Connally is working for peace for the second time. The League of Nations failed, what about the United Nations? He enthusiastically participated in the San Francisco Conference, and the month before last, he went to the Paris Peace Conference despite the arduous journey. But the hope for world peace is becoming increasingly dim. Recently, at the United Nations Political Committee meeting, Connally and Molotov argued heatedly about the issue of reporting on military bases and military equipment. Will this veteran, who has experienced many setbacks, give up his faith in world peace because of this?

### Familiar Footsteps

— Zheng Muzhi

"Beside the ideal, there is also material life!" - Alexandre Dumas the Younger

One day, I went to a very ordinary banquet, but I drank a lot of wine. I was drunk, horribly drunk!

I groped along the street wall, staggering back. I fell on the bed, wanting to close my eyes and rest for a while, but my face was swollen and throbbing from the wine, and my throat was dry and uncomfortable. At that moment, I didn't hesitate, and called the servant to bring a basin of cold water to quench my thirst and wash my face. This healed most of the madness; I held a cigarette and sat silently on the sofa again.

At this time, I didn't want to sleep anymore. The mood of the night was like a beautiful and shy girl. Moonlight had leaked in through the window covered with air-raid paper, peeking at me, this young man suffering from hysteria, while I was still quietly blowing thick smoke rings... At this moment, a burst of tick-tock footsteps suddenly started outside the window. It was already around twelve o'clock; I tilted my head and listened quietly. The sound was very familiar. I gently opened the window. I lived upstairs, so I had to shrug my shoulders and explore downwards; a dark figure occupied the left side of a telephone pole less than a foot away from here, looking to the right, he had stopped his footsteps, guarding so melancholically.

I thought of my friend X, so I happily blew a sharp whistle. The whistle echoed through the entire street, but he still didn't show any emotion.

"Who is it?"

I didn't say it.

For a long, long time, he still didn't move, not even wanting to smoke a cigarette. I started to get a little scared.

"However, it can't be a ghost, can it?"

I thought, suddenly coerced by a kind of fear, quickly abandoned the window, ran to the bed, held my breath, my whole body was only trembling.

"Maybe it's a ghost!"

I thought certainly; but later, I eventually fell asleep in a daze.

When I woke up early the next morning, I remembered what happened last night. I leaned on the window to explore, but I was disappointed. There wasn't even anything left beside the telephone pole, standing upright very gracefully. I suspected it might be a dream, perhaps because I was drunk.

But around eleven o'clock that evening, I woke up from a dream, and heard the familiar footsteps again. He was wandering on the sidewalk. In the silent night, his anxious footsteps showed a great deal of fear.

I leaned on the window sill and watched.

He was never tired, and never said a word. Sometimes he wandered back and forth, sometimes he leaned against the telephone pole, like a ghost. I knew he wouldn't come to hurt me, I wasn't afraid, until I couldn't hold on any longer, I went back to bed to lie down, he was still pacing there without any fatigue. I had no way of knowing when he went home.

And after that, for a week, he came to wander every night.

I remember it was a Sunday evening. It was drizzling. It was already half past eleven. I thought he must be afraid of the rain tonight, or for some other reason, he wouldn't come again, but when I was leaning on the table writing a letter to a traveler, the familiar footsteps started again. It was him. It was a familiar dark figure who had been wandering for a week. He didn't wear a raincoat, only covering his head with an old Panama hat. Obviously, he was a little annoyed and upset, but still paced past my window again, indifferent.

The drizzle didn't stop until after twelve o'clock, and it was getting heavier and heavier. I was really anxious for him, but he stood under the eaves of a house for a while, as if to squeeze the water off his body and hat, and then walked away indifferently.

The rainy season in June, the air was humid and there was no hope of stopping.

When I reopened the window, he was unimaginably soaked.

"Hey!"

I shouted out with a lot of regret, assuming he was really a ghost.

But he looked up with very surprised eyes.

For a long, long time, I finally said again:

"The rain is very heavy, would you like to come in and sit for a while?"

"..." He hesitated for a while, "But... alright!"

I went downstairs to open the door, letting that dark figure soaked all over tiptoe in. We then sat down under a dim yellow electric light. At this time, I began to see his face clearly. It was a fair face, with a high nose bridge and deep-set eyes, shining brightly, his eyebrows long and dark, a beautiful-faced young man, but why did he keep wandering here? Wasn't he afraid of the severity of the curfew night?

My trembling fingers were a little scared.

However, I immediately covered it up by handing him a cigarette.

"Do you smoke?"

"Thank you."

He nodded slightly, accepting my cigarette.

At the same time, I also lit one. Thick smoke rings came out of his mouth, staying in front of my eyes. I touched the armrest of the sofa and my own hair. It probably wasn't a dream, right! Me doing this made him laugh, laughing very horribly! It was like a ghost mocking a dying patient, but I also put on a smile.

Again, a long, long silence, I only smoked bitterly. He calmly paid attention to the rain outside the window, but outside the window, there was nothing but the sound of rain, even the dogs had hidden.

"You come every night?"

I broke the terrible silence first.

"Every night?" He looked at me in surprise, "Coming every night."

"You probably love the moonlit nights here very much?"

"..." He reluctantly nodded.

"But it's raining heavily today!"

At this moment, it seemed that someone was walking outside the window. He quickly jumped up from the sofa, opened the window and leaned on the window sill to whistle. The whistle he blew was so pleasing to the ear, one section, two sections, three sections, the pedestrians on the street went far away, he repeatedly returned to the sofa, his pale face seemed to have been slapped, showing a little blush when he saw me.

"You went to the window, ... but why?"

"Why?"

He seemed unwilling to say it, lowered his head and sobbed sadly. I quickly took out a handkerchief and handed it to him. I knew I shouldn't have asked like that, it was a little too embarrassing.

"Have another cigarette!"

He shook his head, sobbing even harder.

I was also melted into his emotions at this time. I didn't know what I was doing at this time. I believed that human beings are animals of inspiration. If emotions are lost in a dull and melancholy rainy season, then he will always be melancholy, and will never arouse good feelings towards the world.

Therefore, his crying was a compelled expression.

"Will you come tomorrow?" I asked.

He shook his head.

"The day after tomorrow?"

He also shook his head.

"When will you come again?"

"Never come again."

"Really?"

"Really."

"Then tonight is the last day?"

"Yes, and it's also the last day with this city."

A feeling of nausea suddenly rose in my heart. I hurriedly looked for a spittoon. I was busy for a long time but still couldn't find it, so I wanted to open the window and spit outside, but he smiled and told me that the spittoon was beside him, but when I went over to spit, I knew he was deceiving me. There was no spittoon, he opened a very white handkerchief and told me to spit on it, but I finally broke free from his hand and spit out the window. And he also threw the cigarette butt out the window as if disappointed. I couldn't understand his heart at this time, why he needed something that humans hate.

"I'm sorry." I said, I sat on the table in front of him, "But why do you want this thing?"

"I like it."

"You like it?"

"Haha..." He laughed horribly again, "I have accepted many, many things that you hate..."

"However, I am just like you, there was a time when I was too absurd, I needed stimulation, turning day into night, and night into day, I almost sacrificed myself. When Alexandre Dumas the Younger wrote *La Dame aux Camélias*, he said that beside the ideal, there is also material life! Ideals and material things are ultimately two things that are too far apart. We cannot only be for ideals, and forget material things, but we cannot only be for material life."

"That's right!" He raised his head and agreed with my words, "Beside the ideal, there is also material life! So I am simply going to separate from this place."

"Where are you going?"

"The Great Rear Area! Why do you ask?"

"Oh!..."

We were silent again.

He listened to the rain outside the window, looked at his watch and said he was leaving, resolutely.

The rain was still heavy. He borrowed a raincoat from me, copied an address for me, and left.

It was already two fifteen when he left, and I fell asleep tiredly.

The next afternoon, when I came back from the office, the maid handed me a package. In addition to my raincoat, there were two letters attached. One was specifically for me. He thanked me for my sincere hospitality to him. He said that he left early this morning, and asked me to forward another letter.

Because I was too busy with work, I put the letter aside for more than twenty days. Later, I went to look for him at the address, but the person had gone to live in the countryside. I inquired again and again, but I was still confused. I have kept this letter until now, and it is still by my side. He wrote like this:

"X!

We are going to separate.

I used to tell you that life should be a little sloppy. Sloppiness may be pleasant, but now I have changed. I tell you; I have violated my philosophy, violated the philosophy needed by this society, I have become surprisingly serious beyond your expectations.

This place is too bad. I have decided to change the environment and go to a very far place to endure hardship. I am telling you this news. I waited for you, but you didn't come. Now I am gone. Is it strange to go? Maybe...

Don't you hate me? Okay, don't hate me, don't worry about this unconscious person, he only gave you a lot of troubles

I bless you

Health, X who is heartless"

This letter was written to his girlfriend, but the handwriting became more and more sloppy towards the end, making it impossible for me to read. However, what he said came true. Until now, it has been a year since the victory of the motherland, and people have returned from the rear, but his news is still silent. Will it really be as he said that he will never come back?

### Winter Days

— Yang Lida

I love to see plum blossoms in the snow, in the clear winter mornings.

I love to depict bamboo in the wind, under the winter sun.

I love to hear the roaring pine trees, in the deep winter nights.

### Statue of a Saint

— Vinci

Vinci (1452-1519) was not only a famous painter, but also an inventor, writer, astronomer, geographer, philosopher, mathematician, and even an architect, a true genius. The beauty and elegance of his sketch lines have been praised by critics as unprecedented. This work has all the strengths, and can be considered a representative work. (Lion)

### A Collection of Lyrics

— Hu Mu

1. Rainbow

I remember under the lamp on autumn nights, Mom loved to tell stories about rainbows.

I always love to look at the colorful rainbow in the sky after the rain.

The rainbow, in the light blue sky, crosses the quiet wilderness like a big bridge.

This bridge of friendship unites my thoughts with hers. I often think of her when I see a rainbow, thinking of a group of friends who are walking far away for work and faith.

So, I close the white paper windows tightly every night, silently remembering the distance, and the poems I send from afar are born under my pen.

So, I fantasize about the fairy tales Mom told; she said that peace appears after the storm, and the rainbow appears in the blue sky, and then nature faces spring. That rainbow is a real bridge, passing my voice, laughter, to the other side; I look at the rainbow weather, and go out to watch with a cane, I sadly think of that beautiful rainbow, I miss that woman far away who is thinking of the rainbow.

2. Water Village

I have lived in the mountains for a long time, and I rarely see that bay of sparkling turquoise pond water. In the valley, although there are wildflowers, sunshine, and goat smells, in the valley there are also mountain mists, clouds, fog, frost and snow...

I am a young shepherd, but when I came to Jiangnan, I was infatuated with the poetic water chestnut pond! When the crows circle the trees on the embankment, when the sunset is drunk and reddened half the sky, a young girl, wearing a lotus-root-colored short shirt, sky-blue pants, one smile a dimple, one smile like a bay of flowing water...

They smell the fragrance of the sun, the fragrance of wildflowers, the fragrance of aquatic plants, and the fragrance of drifting hair.

I love that clear pond. When the wind moves the green willows, the water buffalo washes its heavy body in the pond. Then I want to ride a donkey across, remembering the girls who live by the pond, and I miss even more the working friends on those flower fields.

3. River Love

In spring, I love the turbulent, rolling river! At dawn, I love to learn to sing the boatman's song "On the Jialing River" by the riverbank. I miss a beautiful season, on a blue river, there are our working comrades pulling the tow rope with a "Hang Yu, Hang Yu" sound! China is like a broken boat, stranded on a shoal! ...

In spring, the river flows continuously to the east. I stand by the riverbank, sending a deep blessing to the friends by the river.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 112

— Ye Jingfeng

At this time, the half-moon was already sinking in the west. Tsurumi got out of the car and looked around. He saw that this place seemed to be a suburb, otherwise it was an extremely deserted section of Tokyo. The building in front of him looked like a large villa. The facade was in the form of a mansion, but passing through the mansion, it was a very large garden. The one-eyed gentleman left the rest of his entourage in the mansion, and led Tsurumi along the path, through the garden, to a palace-like house. Although it was late at night, before dawn, between two and three o'clock, several places in this house were still brightly lit; there were guards in the main hall.

When the one-eyed man led Tsurumi past the guards, he only nodded. The guards didn't pay attention, and didn't interrogate, which showed that he often came and went here. He settled Tsurumi in a small room on the left of the hall, and told him to wait a moment, smiled at him, and went out on his own. Tsurumi was left alone in this small room. Seeing that the one-eyed guy had left, he must be reporting to his superiors. There was probably a few minutes of delay, the time was quite leisurely. He didn't need to rush to see the contents of the cigarette case, and first appreciated the contents of this small room. He looked at the four walls and knew that this was a simple reception room, precisely the waiting room for small people or Shu officials to visit the big shots. The arrangement in the room was quite Chinese-style, at least it was trying its best to imitate the arrangement of the reception room of a Chinese big shot; some screen strips and calligraphy and paintings adorned the four walls, and in the cabinets and on the tables, there were complete sets of thread-bound and western-style books. Although the room was not big, there were more than a dozen chairs, probably a "cold bench" arrangement.

After Tsurumi looked around the small room, he picked a chair facing the window and sat down. He listened to see if there were any sounds outside. He thought that although he hadn't revealed his whereabouts at all, and shouldn't be so closely monitored, he couldn't be careless. So he took out his exquisite cigarette case generously, with his back to the window, and opened it seemingly unintentionally, taking out a cigarette. At the moment of leaving the cigarette case, he had already seen a small folded piece of paper pressed under the several cigarettes inside. When taking the cigarette, he still used the technique of performing magic, cleanly and neatly, and also clipped the small piece of paper in his hand.

This kind of note-passing trick was still an old-fashioned way of transmitting secrets thirty years ago. Pingzi was still using it at this time, which showed that it was not very clever, right? However, it also depends on what the nature of the message being transmitted is, whether it is worth using a more precise and scientific method; at the same time, Pingzi is a special member of the Black Dragon Society, and has also worked as a spy in England. She must have received special training. Regardless of her qualifications, regarding the method of transmitting messages, it must not be so naive. Perhaps it fits an old novel cliché, she is "skilled and bold," she believes that in this situation, this method is secret enough and won't be noticed. But why did she repeatedly tell Tsurumi to be careful with this cigarette case?

At this time, after Tsurumi took the small piece of paper in his hand from the cigarette case, he suddenly changed his mind and didn't want to open it in this "danger zone," so he immediately used a technique to hide it in his personal secret place. Just after hiding it, he suddenly thought that Pingzi temporarily paid so much attention to this thing, maybe it was extremely related to me, and if I looked at it now, I could have more preparation to deal with it? At the same time, maybe some curiosity was at play, so he decided to take the piece of paper out of the personal secret bag, and look at it before speaking.

After deciding, he borrowed the technique of lighting a cigarette, took out the small piece of paper, and also took out his personal notebook and pencil, as if he wanted to record something, and spread the small piece of paper just right on top, preparing to examine it carefully. Who knew that the piece of paper was the same as the paper in the notebook, without a single word or stroke, it was actually a blank piece of paper. He flipped it over and over, but there was nothing on it. At this time, Tsurumi thought about it, and couldn't help but laugh at himself. He had been messing around for a long time, but it turned out to be like this. He thought that Pingzi, this girl, was very mischievous, maybe she was deliberately playing a prank again.

I met a friend on the tram, and in our casual conversation, he asked me about the newspaper's circulation, how it was before the war. I told him the total was far exceeding pre-war levels. His question made me think about the progress made during the eight years of war. Taking newspapers as an example, whether in Shanghai, Nanjing, or other cities within the country, each newspaper generally has a higher circulation than before the war. This proves that education and culture are more widespread than before, and the people's need to understand news and current events has increased. This phenomenon is naturally gratifying.

Unfortunately, the degree of gratification is ultimately limited, and within this limited degree of gratification, it is constantly subjected to blows and destruction. Looking ahead, one cannot help but feel a sudden sense of worry!

There are two examples to illustrate the seriousness of this blow:

First, considering the newspapers in Shanghai, almost all of their sales are within the city. Even the newspapers with nationwide reach and the best circulation numbers are no exception. Naturally, a newspaper should have more sales in its place of origin than in other areas, but if it becomes disproportionate, then there must be a problem. The problem lies in transportation and postage.

Second, looking at various periodicals and magazines, the total circulation has generally decreased compared to pre-war levels in the year since the victory. The reason is that the main distribution of various periodicals and magazines has always been in other areas. In other words, the number of readers in other areas has historically exceeded the number of readers in the city.

Traffic congestion is a blow, and skyrocketing postage is a form of destruction. How can we talk about cultural exchange? If a country does not use various methods to encourage cultural undertakings, it is already abandoning progress. If it turns around and destroys them, then the consequences are unimaginable.

"My Utopia" A Visit

Last night before going to sleep, I ate a little too much melted cheese. After wrestling with my pillow for four rounds, I had to give up on sleep, turned on the light, and reached for the evening paper. On the first page, I read a news item that said, "Women will cast sixty percent of the votes in the next election."

"How about that?" I muttered, "Every time those girls get together on a plan, they always manage to take over everything and run things to suit themselves."

Suddenly, the print in front of me blurred as if a camera had lost focus; and I felt myself walking into a strange road. It looked like New York, but it was strangely altered.

In front of a building that seemed familiar, I saw a policeman standing on a small gold pedestal. He was six feet three inches tall, and his uniform looked like the grand finale of a Ziegfeld Follies show.

"What is this incredible building?" I asked him.

"This is the Grand Central Powder Room," he replied, "Worth thirty million. Every city has one like this."

Women in Power

I began to understand a little, so I asked, "Is it that the women are now in power and managing the country?"

"Not exactly," he told me, "Do you think a woman would elect another woman? But they only elect the men they like. Now it's Pank's second term as president."

"Did they drive out all the politicians?" I asked.

"Only the ugly ones. The camera-ready types—James Forrestal, Paul McNutt, Bernard Baruch, Eisenhower—are more powerful than ever. Say, let me see your marriage certificate."

"What's that?"

Marriage Certificate

"Every man has to carry one. It states your age, income, and chest size. If a man reaches thirty and isn't married, the government forces him to carry a baby. A lot of things have changed. Payment checks are always sent to the housewives; that way, it eliminates the middleman. Every husband has to shave as soon as he gets home from the office, and men with large appetites can only have bran with water to eat. Also, women don't have to kiss their husbands unless they want to."

"If a woman reaches twenty-nine," he continued, "they can burn her birth certificate. That way, no one can know her age. Six months out of the year are called June."

"The money might confuse you. The denominations of the new banknotes are: $0.98, $4.98, and $9.98. Change is the same way. But the ticket collector on the bus must accept the first coin a lady pulls out of her handbag, even if a useless badge is legal tender on trams and buses.

Various Adaptations

"Schools are teaching writing, reading, and the Lambeth Walk. Chocolate ice cream is sold in halves, so girls don't have to bite into it to see what's inside. The pound is required to be ten pounds lighter. And the mirrors are made to make fat, bloated women look trim."

"Goodbye, slave. Watch out when you cross the road!" he said, as he turned back to the traffic: "Those ladies passed a law allowing them to drive on both sides."

As I walked away, lost in thought, a beautiful pink sedan suddenly came out of nowhere. There was a sharp screech of brakes, and then everything was silent. I woke up to find my wife putting a cold bandage on my head and gently comforting me.

"I had the craziest dream, darling," I said. "I dreamed that women were managing everything to suit themselves. Can you imagine how ridiculous?"

"Of course, it's ridiculous," she agreed, "By the way, dear, my sister and her children are coming to stay with us for a month tomorrow, and I've prepared a comfortable little bed for you in the attic." (The End) (Translated from the November issue of "Reader's Digest")

Shanghai Cross-section

### The Organization of Beggars

— Huang Jiamo

Zhang Fei on the Bridge

Pulling carts on the bridgeheads is a good gig for the little devils. There are quite a few bridges along the Suzhou Road in Shanghai. It is difficult for rickshaw pullers to drive across the curved bridges. In the past, there were only rickshaws, but now there are also tricycles. Tricycles often carry two passengers. At the beginning of climbing the bridge, the rickshaw pullers can no longer pedal the wheels, so they have to get off and push forward, but they still don't have enough strength. At this time, the veteran brothers, who are the beggar gangs or adult little devils, who are pre-arranged at the bridgehead, push from behind. Sometimes, these little devils obtain the consent of the passengers in advance before working hard at this obligatory task, but most of the time, they start working even when they don't quite have their consent. Once they push it to the bridgehead, the passengers have no choice but to fork over money. With a simple gesture, in two or three minutes, they can receive compensation. Before the war, it was a few copper coins, but now it takes a hundred-yuan bill to get anywhere. This type of cart-pushing profession is called "Zhang Fei pulling Zhuge Liang" by the gang members. It is abbreviated as "Zhang Fei on." This term seems a bit abrupt, but it is said to have a source. Zhuge Liang was accustomed to sitting in a Kongming cart, which needed people to push it. The reason for calling the passenger Zhuge Liang and calling themselves Zhang Fei is that the gang members admire the heroic Zhang Fei the most.

Each bridge is divided into two shifts, left and right, and each day and night is divided into three shifts in rotation. Each shift forms a small group of about three or four people. However, the bridge section belongs to the Uncle gangs. The Uncles who occupy the bridges do not need to do anything themselves. They only need to observe from the sidelines occasionally, while the little devils under their command do the work of "Zhang Fei." Each person in each shift must hand over all the money, and then distribute three or four tenths to the little devils. The Uncles can enjoy the salary and the profits are very considerable.

The bridge locations are divided into rich and poor, and the income varies greatly, but each Uncle who occupies a prime location on a bridge is absolutely unwilling to give it up easily. There were often disputes over bridges in the past, which was a terrible bloody battle, but the result could not be resolved, because even if the original owner failed, they often refused to give up. Soon after, they would still train new troops to come back for revenge. That slogan was similar to "recovering lost territory." Recently, this trend has become very popular. Each bridge has long been occupied by someone, and the invaders' conspiracy can never be realized.

If a down-on-their-luck, foreign-style beggar sees an opportunity and actually wants to automatically push a cart to earn money, it is impossible. At the very least, they will have to suffer a beating from the original gang of little devils. After all, where the profit lies, outsiders are not allowed to get involved.

### Let's Talk About "Misleading the Children"

— Fang Cheng

What the Teacher Says

A few days ago, I read Mr. Shengjie's article "Misleading the Children" in this journal, which couldn't help but remind me of fragments of my past life.

Having given up the life of a chalk-wielding teacher long ago, I sat on a cold bench in a private middle school in this city for half a semester again last semester for the sake of friendship - actually, I stood for more than four hundred hours - and taught Chinese to three classes of high and junior high students. Nowadays, middle school students in general do not seem to have much interest in the subject of Chinese, especially the teaching materials in the textbooks, eighty or ninety percent of which are boring classical Chinese. Every time I teach a class, even if I talk eloquently and exhaust my tongue, there are very few students who can concentrate and listen attentively. Sometimes, when I stride onto the podium and open the textbook to prepare to explain it, naughty students will even stand up and ask me to tell them a few stories, which will really make you not know whether to laugh or cry. The most headache-inducing thing is the two hundred or so papers, which are either off-topic, nonsensical, or full of typos and unreadable. Although there are also works that can be recited after a little polishing, they are rare. You want to mark these papers, but you simply can't start. Sometimes, when I return the original paper for rewriting, the second submission is still "I don't know what it's talking about," which makes it impossible for you to revise it. At first, I thought this situation was the result of my own poor teaching, so I changed many teaching methods, but I still didn't get significant results. Therefore, a month before the end of the semester, when the headmaster asked me to help out again next semester, I politely declined. Taking into account the headmaster's feelings, he repeatedly tried to persuade me to stay, so I told him a joke:

The Scholar's Crime

"Once upon a time, there was a scholar who died and was summoned by the King of Hell for questioning. The scholar stepped into the Hall of Yama and saw the King of Hell questioning a robber, so he had to stand under the steps and wait quietly. After a while, the robber retreated with a smile, and it was said that he was declared innocent. The scholar thought that even robbers were spared, so he must be fine, so he strode up to the hall. When the King of Hell saw the scholar, he asked bluntly: 'What did you do before you died?' The scholar said, 'I was a teacher.' When the King of Hell heard this, he became angry and ordered the ox-headed and horse-faced demons to押 the scholar to the 'tongue-pulling' hell. The scholar was completely confused and shouted for injustice, saying: 'Your Majesty is too unfair! Robbers kill and loot, which is a heinous crime, yet they are acquitted. Scholars study and understand reason, are law-abiding, and have never committed any crimes. Why should they be subjected to this heavy punishment? May I ask Your Majesty, what crime has the scholar committed?' The King of Hell sneered and said: 'Don't you know?' As he spoke, he picked up a pen and drew a few strokes on the paper and threw it in front of the scholar. The scholar took a closer look and it turned out to be the four big characters 'misleading the children', so he bowed his head in silence and entered prison with the ghostly official and his clanging chains."

The headmaster listened and laughed at me, saying: "Are you afraid that you will also go to the tongue-pulling hell in the future?" I also smiled and replied: "That's not necessarily true, it's just that I've been teaching for half a year and haven't been able to teach any results, and the condemnation on my conscience is really too deep!"

This semester, I finally resigned from this position.

### Wonderful Hands

— Yimin

Yesterday, after dinner, I took a walk in the alley and looked into the distance. I saw a man in short clothes and a felt hat running forward in a hurry. A small vendor at the alley entrance said that this was a pickpocket, so I quietly watched the development. I saw him walking next to a group of people, taking off his felt hat and putting it on his right arm, passing by the left side of the pedestrian, and his left hand stretched out from under the hat on his right arm into the pedestrian's pocket, and then stretched out again, and a wad of banknotes was already in his hand. His movements were agile and nimble, and the pedestrian was completely unaware. I was about to shout and wake the pedestrian, but the vendor next to me said, "Don't make a sound. They have a lot of power, a tight organization, and are connected. Outsiders who meddle in other people's business are sure to get into trouble." So I had to watch the pickpocket walk away. The vendor also said, "You should hurry up and chase the object of your attention because there is a territorial relationship. If he goes any further, he will not be able to infringe on the interests of his colleagues." I think the lower classes of Chinese society actually have such a tight organization and strictly abide by gang rules. The only pity is that they do not follow the right path. It is said that the last large-scale parade of pickpockets in the city not only failed to change their habits, but after they were released, they acted even more cautiously and intensified their efforts.

### American Workers' Working Hours - Only One Day Per Year

— Jianhua

Someone asked an American professor: "How many working hours do workers in your country have? Are they working overtime?" Unexpectedly, the American professor replied: "American workers' working hours are only one day per year." This is how he calculated it:

One year is a total of 365 days.

Sleeping time, 8 hours per day, totaling 122 days.

Rest time, 8 hours per day, totaling 122 days.

Sundays off work, totaling 52 days.

Commemorative holidays, totaling 18 days. (America)

Eating time, 2 hours per day, totaling 32 days.

Annual holidays, totaling 18 days. (America)

He calculated it as if it were a serious matter, saying: "According to this calculation, isn't working time only one day? Right or not?"

### Key Figure of the China Democratic League - Huang Yanpei

— Ganlai

Mr. Huang Yanpei, a standing committee member of the China Democratic League who attended the Political Consultative Conference, is a vocational education expert. The long-standing and successful China Vocational Education Society and School were founded by him.

Mr. Huang was a Juren in the Renyin year. This year, he is sixty-nine years old. From the outside, who would have guessed that this burly, large, square-faced scholar is a scholar and key figure in a political party?

There are many widely circulated anecdotes about Huang's private life. More than ten years ago, he wore glasses and grew a beard. When he was approaching the age of seventy, his first wife died of illness, and he remarried. Instead, he shaved his beard cleanly, showing a face full of spring breeze, becoming younger.

He advocates vegetarianism. When his first wife, Ms. Wang Jiusi, was alive, she personally took charge of the cooking. It is said that she secretly used lard to cook the green vegetables and tofu, and mixed the clear soup with the juice of young chickens, which tasted particularly delicious. Mr. Huang did not know the truth, so whenever friends held vegetarian banquets, Huang often shook his head and could not swallow.

When Xu Guoliang was the director of the Shanghai Police Department, Huang was founding the China Vocational School. He went to the school every day to work. One day, after finishing his work and leaving the school, he suddenly had an urgent need to urinate, so he relieved himself near the bamboo fence at the school gate. A reckless policeman nearby, without asking the reason, slapped Mr. Huang a few times and cursed incessantly. Huang was humiliated and unwilling to accept it, so he silently memorized the policeman's symbol and told Xu the whole story by telephone. Xu immediately dismissed the policeman.

In the year when Mr. Huang was sixty years old, he suddenly suffered from appendicitis. Fortunately, he recovered after treatment, so he wrote a "Broken Intestines Collection" to commemorate it.

Mr. Huang is optimistic about everything. When talking and giving speeches, he often inserts humorous tones. During speeches, he likes to use the words "brothers". Although he speaks Mandarin, you can tell from the accent that it is the Pudong dialect.

He likes to travel and has been to various parts of China and Japan, Korea, the United States, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and other places. St. John's University awarded him an honorary doctorate in philosophy.

Some people call Mr. Huang Yanpei an "old boy", which is naturally very apt.
