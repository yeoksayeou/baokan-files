According to well-informed sources, Special Envoy Marshall's proposal to first discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee to break the deadlock is no different than testing the waters for the future of peace negotiations.

[Our Guling Dispatch, 30th] Special Envoy Marshall climbed Lushan for the sixth time on the evening of the 30th. According to those close to the Special Envoy, he is very pleased that both sides have accepted his and Ambassador Stuart's joint proposal to organize a five-person meeting and reorganize the government to break the current deadlock.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The name of the Five-Person Group Meeting has now been finalized as the Informal Group Meeting, convened by Ambassador Stuart. Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng went to Guling at 9:00 AM on the 30th to meet with Chairman Jiang, requesting instructions on the content of the discussions at the small meeting. The capital is placing great hopes on this meeting. As for the Communist Party spokesman's claim that the meeting will still have no optimistic prospects if the government does not give a concrete answer to the unconditional ceasefire and the withdrawal of the five demands, it is learned that another sensational figure from the Communist Party, Wang Bingnan, said that he has extremely optimistic views on the meeting.

### Wu and Zhang Hold Talks in Guling; Five-Person Talks Scheduled to Begin Next Week; Hope for Harmonious Completion of Task by Both Sides

[Our Guling Dispatch, 30th] Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Hong Lanyou met with the press corps in Guling at the residence of Mr. Xiong Shihui, No. 117 Guling Middle Road, at 5:00 PM today. According to Wu and Zhang, (1) the purpose of their arrival in Guling this time is to request instructions from the Chairman on matters related to the reorganization of the National Government Committee. (2) The name of the Five-Person Meeting or Five-Person Group Meeting for discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee has not yet been determined. The organization and tasks of this meeting are clearly temporary and simple, and no other issues will be discussed. (3) The newspaper report that in addition to the 20 seats that the Kuomintang should occupy in the National Government Committee, the remaining parties and factions and non-partisan social figures each occupy four seats is not a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference. Because the various parties and factions could not obtain a reasonable distribution, non-partisan social figures requested the government to advocate on their behalf that the above-mentioned allocation should be made. (4) It is not yet known whether there will be any difficulties in future consultations, but they are determined to do their utmost with a frank and straightforward attitude and a sincere and trustworthy desire, and hope that both sides will conduct open and honest consultations and quickly complete the reorganization of the National Government Committee. (5) The expansion of the number of members of the National Government Committee in this reorganization is to broaden the foundation of the government. (6) The reorganized National Government Committee will replace the Supreme National Defense Council as the highest decision-making body for national defense. (7) They very much hope that this meeting can be successfully completed in an atmosphere of harmony and tranquility in order to eliminate domestic disputes and alleviate the suffering of the people.

[Central News Agency, Guling Dispatch, 30th] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng jointly met with reporters in Guling at Xiong Shihui's residence on the 30th, with an exceptionally peaceful attitude. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, was also present. Wu and Zhang announced that the five-person talks, which will begin next week, are a temporary and simple organization. The two also said: The two of us are appointed by the Chairman to participate as government representatives. The talks are composed of two representatives from the Chinese Communist Party and one representative from the United States. Whether the name is the Five-Person Meeting or the Five-Person Group Meeting, or whether there is another name, we cannot yet say for sure. The main task of the five-person talks is to seek the realization of one of the six principles in the "August 14" document, which is to expand the base of the government. The so-called expansion of the base of the government is to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, reorganize the National Government Committee to replace the current Supreme National Defense Council, and serve as the highest guiding and decision-making body for national administration. The two then looked back on the painful memories of the CCP's failure to recommend candidates for the National Government Committee on schedule after the Political Consultative Conference closed, which caused the expansion of the government base to be delayed again and again. A reporter asked: Will the current talks on the reorganization of the National Government Committee still be based on the 8.4.4.4 model? The two replied: In the past, because it was difficult to balance the number of candidates for the National Government Committee recommended by various parties, social figures came forward to mediate. If the social figures failed to mediate, there were proposals to ask the government to handle the matter fairly, and some people advocated using 8, 4, 4, 4 as the allocation standard. Whether the current negotiations will still repeat the old tune of "8, 4, 4, 4" should be subject to public discussion. The reporter also asked: Can this five-person talks achieve an agreement at the National Assembly? Answer: The government hopes so and hopes that both sides can seek the realization of expanding the government base in a friendly and harmonious manner, so that other problems can be easily solved. Asked: If someone submits issues beyond the scope of the reorganization of the National Government Committee to the five-person talks, how will it be handled? Answer: I believe everyone will consider the scope of the agenda. Question: Who will the CCP representatives be? Answer: It has not been formally announced yet, perhaps Mr. Zhou Enlai and Mr. Dong Biwu, it is not yet known. Question: Why is the reorganization of the National Government Committee only being discussed with the CCP? Answer: The expansion of the government base could not be realized in the past only because the CCP could not pass it. Now we are coming again to pass it. Zhang Lisheng also said: I am an honest and straightforward person, and I am not good at speaking techniques. It is really not suitable for me to serve as the government representative in negotiations with the CCP. I only have to follow the principle of resolving domestic disputes by political means shown by the Chairman and reluctantly do my best.

### Complete List of National Assembly Delegates to Be Announced One Month Before the Meeting

Hong Lanyou Arrives in Guling to Meet with the Chairman

[Our Guling Dispatch] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, said: The complete list of delegates to the National Assembly will be announced one month before the meeting (around Double Tenth Festival). The Preparatory Committee has now completed the preparation of 2,400 seats (including officials and reporters attending) in the upper and lower auditoriums of the National Assembly Hall. Delegates from various regions now hope that the government can restore domestic transportation before the National Assembly convenes so that they can conveniently visit the post-war situation along the way, but the Preparatory Committee still intends to overcome difficulties at any time to facilitate the transportation of delegates from various regions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Hong Lanyou went to Guling to request instructions from the Chairman on matters related to the preparation of the National Assembly.

### CCP Again Attacks American Policy Toward China

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today again vehemently attacked American policy toward China and relayed the message from Yan'an for broadcast. It is claimed that if the United States sells surplus materials from the Western Pacific to China, it will be enough to support the government in continuing the civil war for two years. If the transaction is successful, it will only demonstrate the cruelty, falsity, and imperialist nature of the American policy toward China. The CCP office in Nanjing believes that any assistance given to the government at this time, even if it is not military supplies, can "fuel" the aggressors.

### Many Hidden Reefs in the Future of Peace; Zhou Enlai Makes Radical Statements During Visit to Ambassador Stuart Yesterday; Says Two Prerequisites Must Be Clarified Before Group Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Wang Bingnan, visited the US Embassy at 7:30 PM on the 30th and had dinner with Ambassador Stuart, leaving at 9:30 PM. According to sources from the Communist Party delegation, Zhou's remarks to Stuart were based on the uncertain stance of Chief Secretary Wu and Minister Peng on the five demands as reported in the newspapers. He believes that two prerequisites must be clarified before this informal group meeting, that is, the Communist Party still insists that the government must guarantee an immediate ceasefire after the government is reorganized, and that the government must withdraw the five demands before negotiations can continue, and hopes that the government can give a formal reply on these two points. If a solution cannot be obtained, Zhou expressed that the future is still extremely pessimistic and emphasized that if these prerequisites cannot be met, then it is impossible to talk about reorganizing the government. At a time when the peace talks are showing a glimmer of hope, Zhou's radical statements are truly hidden reefs in the night voyage.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Ambassador Stuart had no major contacts with the outside world on the 30th. In addition to the British Ambassador's visit, he also returned the visit to President Long of our Military Advisory Council, accompanied by Advisor Fu, following diplomatic etiquette, and returned to the embassy after an hour of talks.

### National Army Enters Chengde; Continues to Advance and Recapture Longhua County Seat; Communist Army Retreats Toward Weichang Tianbaoshan

[Central News Agency, Jinzhou Urgent Telegram, 30th] The National Army entered Chengde on the morning of the 19th and has approached Chifeng.

[Central News Agency, Chaoyang Dispatch, 30th] The National Army recaptured Chengde and continued to advance northwest. Today, they entered Longhua County, more than 120 li from Chengde. The Communist army retreated toward Weichang Tianbaoshan area.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] News from the Northeast says that the National Army entered Chengde yesterday (29th) at 8:00 PM. The Commanding Officer of the Second District Pacification Office will enter the city today. Officials of the Executive Headquarters are keeping silent about this news. Committee Member Zheng Jiemin declined to answer reporters' questions, saying that "the Executive Headquarters is a peace organization and does not discuss warfare." When reporters asked if the Communist side had replied to the government's memorandum requesting them to stop attacking Datong, he replied, "No." Reporters pressed, asking if the National Army's entry into Chengde was the implementation of the warning in the memorandum that the National Army would attack Chengde and other places. Zheng replied, "I am not the commander." He only said that the Executive Headquarters is extremely concerned about the Chengde Executive Group. It is reported that the group has been abandoned by the Communist army in the mountains more than a hundred li north of Chengde. Its radio station has lost contact with the Executive Headquarters for more than three or four days. The Executive Headquarters plans to send a plane to search for them and replenish radio equipment, but it does not know the location of the group, and it is uncertain whether the plane can land. Ye Jianying has agreed to inquire about the Communist army there and reply to the Executive Headquarters within 24 hours this afternoon. The Communist Party did not criticize the news of the National Army's entry into Chengde today, only saying that they had not received a telegram.

[Central News Agency, Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Reporters made a special visit to military authorities. According to responsible officials, the Communist army has been besieging Datong for nearly a month. Although the government has repeatedly protested to the Communist side, the Communist army's attempt to capture Datong has not diminished. Since the National Army cannot reinforce Datong, it can only use the method of besieging Wei to rescue Zhao, and advance on Chengde.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] Changchun News: Commander Liao of the New Sixth Army and his headquarters left Changchun today for the defense area of southern Liaoning.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th] The Northeast military authorities have formed a committee to prepare winter clothing for hundreds of thousands of troops, ordering leather merchants in various places to report their inventory and prohibiting the export of leather goods, with severe penalties for violators.

[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A dispatch from North China stated: Communist General Lin Biao held a meeting of generals in Harbin to discuss new plans and new goals.

[United Press, Beiping Dispatch, 30th] It is reported that a dispatch from Shenyang stated: The headquarters of Lin Biao, Commander of the Northeast Communist Army, has moved from Harbin to Jiamusi, but this news has not yet been confirmed by other sources. It is rumored that there are 400,000 Communist troops in Jiamusi. It is also learned that the Northeast National Army has recovered Faku without a fight.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] In order to coordinate with the Rehe battle, the Communist army in the Far East launched an offensive in the Anshan-Haicheng area, with a force of 50,000 men, and brought more than 100 spies disguised and sneaked into Anshan, and the situation in the Far East suddenly became tense.

### Sino-American Civil Aviation Negotiations are Proceeding in Accordance with the Spirit of Equality and Mutual Benefit; Britain, France, the Philippines and Other Countries are Also in Negotiations with Us

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] An official of the Ministry of Communications said: The Sino-American civil aviation consultations currently underway here are proceeding entirely in accordance with the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, there are also countries such as Britain, France, and the Philippines that are currently conducting similar talks with us. Some countries are negotiating with us, even before the United States. Therefore, rumors that we will exchange aviation sovereignty with the United States for surplus materials are clearly inaccurate. According to those familiar with the transportation situation: In order to facilitate the landing of aircraft from various countries in our territory, our country will, in accordance with international practice, set up international airports in certain locations in the country. This should not be limited to the use of American aircraft landing. Moreover, according to the Unified Measures for Foreign Aircraft Flying Over National Borders, any country's aircraft flying into our territory must obtain our permission in advance. Sovereignty is still in our hands. Anyone with a little international common sense will not find it difficult to understand. As for the Sino-American civil aviation negotiations, they are still in the "exploratory stage" and are a routine matter. The two sides have talked about mutually allowing several airlines of the other side to land at certain designated locations. It is rumored that the aircraft of perhaps three American airlines will be allowed to land in our territory. As for whether General Chennault's organization is included, it is not known. According to the negotiations, the United States may help us build and improve some airport equipment. This matter is purely for the safety of American aircraft, because American long-haul passenger aircraft are often heavier than ordinary aircraft. However, after the airport is built, those who can use it are not limited to American aircraft. This point should also be particularly pointed out.

### Resident Committee of the Political Council Passes Resolution Calling for Peace; Urges Government to Speed Up Trial of He Dekui Case

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, State News Agency, 30th] The Resident Committee of the Political Council held its seventh meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Wang Yunwu, Chu Fucheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Fan Yuzui, Wu Chunwu, and Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen and others totaling twenty people attended. Thirteen proposals were passed. At today's meeting, the proposal submitted by Councilors Fan Yuzui, Luo Heng, Wu Chunwu, Xi Zhenduo, Yin Shuxian, and Wang Puquan calling on the government and the CCP to immediately stop military conflicts and resume consultations to achieve China's peaceful unification underwent nearly three hours of heated discussion before finally being passed. This proposal was raised at the group discussion meeting of the Council on the 23rd of this month and was referred to a subcommittee for review. At today's meeting, the review report submitted by the subcommittee was studied in detail. All Councilors believe that the military conflicts in various places are increasingly expanding and the situation is very serious, but the people are all praying for peace and unification. Therefore, standing in the position of the Council representing the people, they issued this sincere and painful call to the government and the Communist Party in the hope of immediately stopping the internal strife and restoring peace. The Councilors were extremely cautious in their speeches, but some Councilors believed that the content of the proposal was still too vague and advocated supplementing concrete opinions. After repeated discussions and careful revisions, it was finally resolved to pass the proposal and send it to the government and Councilor Bi Wu for transmittal to the Communist Party. In addition, the following proposals were all successfully passed. Finally, Councilor Wang Baohuan made a temporary motion stating that a month ago, this Council filed a report accusing He Dekui, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, of betraying the country, but the government has not yet replied, and He Dekui openly received reporters in Shanghai, defending his reasons for betraying the country. Wang continued: Ordinary people report traitors, and the judicial organs should still be involved, but this report filed by the Council has been more than a month, and there has been no follow-up, which is incomprehensible. It should be asked of the government for the reasons. The councilors resolved to urge the government to promptly hand over the case to the judicial organs for trial and give a reply.

[Central News Agency, Guling Dispatch, 30th] Shao Lizi ascended Guling at 9:15 PM on the 30th. It is said that this trip is specifically to request instructions from the Chairman on the date of the Political Council.

Main Points of the Resolution Calling for Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Resident Committee of the National Political Council, at its seventh meeting today, revised and passed the proposal submitted by Councilors Fan Yuzui and others urging the government and the CCP to immediately stop military conflicts and resume consultations to achieve China's peaceful unification. The main points are as follows: Although military conflicts have become increasingly fierce recently, the government is still determined to resolve political disputes by political means, and the Communist Party has also stated that it has no intention of overthrowing the National Government by force. Then, stopping armed conflicts, resuming peace talks, and seeking national unification have not yet reached the point of despair. We, as members of the Council, stand in the position of the people and firmly support the resolution of political disputes by political methods and should urgently make efforts for peace. The two major principles for resolving political problems, namely the nationalization of the army and political democratization, have been recognized by both the government and the Chinese Communist Party. Unless one or both parties have no sincerity to implement them, it seems that there is no reason why an agreement cannot be reached through consultations. Therefore, we call on the government and the Chinese Communist Party to immediately stop the conflict, resume consultations, and in the discussion of the reorganization and unified organization of the army, in addition to solving the problem according to the military reorganization plan, we hope that the Chinese Communist Party will respect national unity and eliminate future troubles. Regarding the reorganization of the government and the National Assembly and local political power issues, in addition to following the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, we also hope that the government will respect the opinions of the people and strive for political renewal. Regarding the restoration of national transportation and the cessation of comprehensive conflicts, they should be carried out simultaneously without regard to urgency. The reorganization of the government and the unified organization of the army should also be implemented simultaneously without regard to priority. We are humble representatives of the people and believe that China must not engage in internal strife again after the eight-year War of Resistance. If unfortunately the war is prolonged and expanded, in addition to leading the country and the nation to eternal disaster, no party will have any results or other significance. We feel in our hearts that it is dangerous and have no choice but to make this sincere and painful call to the government and the Chinese Communist Party, urging them to immediately stop the conflict and restore peace to comfort the people of the whole country.

### Statement by Yang Ge, Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, on China's Economic Construction

Military Expenditure Must Be Cut to Concentrate Resources; Peace and Work Are What the People Need Most

[Central News Agency, this city] The Secretariat of the Central Bank announced yesterday: Dr. Yang Ge, an American advisor to the Ministry of Finance, will return to the United States on the General Hughes in the coming days and issued the following statement:

I have served as a financial advisor to the Chinese government for over seventeen years. Now, due to physical exhaustion, I must leave and return home for a long period of rest. Looking back on the past, I am filled with attachment.

China's current severe difficulties are the result of eight years of bitter war, as everyone knows. To judge the situation of the past month, we must consider the impact of eight years of war and destruction on finance, economy, and morale. During these eight years, production has sharply declined, transportation has been destroyed, public and private institutions have been devastated, and shipping losses are over 90%. Railway transportation has been largely destroyed, and famines and floods have caused widespread damage.

However, since the victory of the War of Resistance, China has made considerable progress. Import trade has almost fully recovered, and export trade and overseas remittances are also increasing day by day. After a good harvest, the famine and disasters in the country can be largely alleviated. Industrial production is gradually increasing, shipping losses are being rapidly replenished, and land transportation is also gradually improving.

In the financial sector, prices have become more stable than before, and exchange rates and gold prices have remained stable, reaching a considerable level of effectiveness. The deficit in government revenue and expenditure has gradually decreased since the spring of this year, and revenue is also increasing. The rate of issuance of currency has decreased. Although inflation has not been completely stopped, its extent is much lighter than generally imagined. Compared to the inflation during and after the First and Second World Wars in various countries, China's inflation situation cannot be called severe.

However, serious problems still exist. The most important issue at present is that the long-suffering Chinese people need peace and work and the opportunity to live. Without peace, there is little opportunity to obtain rest and economic progress. Unfortunately, due to the failure of peace to arrive, China's international position, won in the heroic resistance against Japan, will not be able to be consolidated quickly.

The most fundamental economic and financial problem at present is the reduction of military expenditure. The millions of unproductive troops are consuming the majority of China's surplus production. Therefore, the key to China's economic progress lies in finding ways to reduce the military. Only in this way can resources be concentrated for economic construction, because China does not have sufficient surplus production to simultaneously maintain a large military and engage in economic construction.

To seek progress in China's economy and finance, the first step must be to strive for financial stability and reduce all postponable expenditures as much as possible. On the revenue side, it is still necessary to restore sources of revenue. During this transitional period, China is fortunate to have a large amount of foreign currency assets existing abroad and domestic enemy and puppet assets. In addition, there is UNRRA assistance and foreign loans. The imbalances accumulated over the past nine years cannot be corrected suddenly. However, during the period when these special resources can still be used at any time, efforts must be made to restore economic equilibrium.

I am very honored to have participated in the work of the Chinese government during the decade of China's economic progress before the war, and to have personally experienced China's arduous War of Resistance and the initial stage of post-war construction. I am especially grateful to President Chiang, President Song, Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Minister Yu, President Bei, and all the others for their relationship with me. I sincerely wish the Chinese people and their leaders to overcome difficulties and advance to complete the great task of national construction.

### Ding Chao-wu and Others Report on UNRRA's Work in Fujian

The Allegations of Corruption Against Lin Rongsen Were a Misunderstanding

[Central News Agency, this city] Ding Chao-wu, Speaker of the Fujian Provincial Assembly and Chairman of the Fujian Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Review Committee, and Zhu Daijie, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Construction, recently arrived in Shanghai from Fuzhou. Yesterday afternoon, they jointly hosted reporters to report on UNRRA's work in Fujian. The main points are three:

(1) The recent reports of corruption involving Lin Rongsen, Deputy Director of the UNRRA Fujian-Zhejiang Branch, have attracted attention from all sides. It was found that this case was actually due to a misunderstanding. Lin, as an engineer who entered politics, did not complete the final procedures properly, which led to criticism from outsiders. After detailed investigation and review, the misunderstanding was cleared up, and the relief work in the area can proceed smoothly in the future.

(2) Fujian Province suffered widespread destruction during the war. The Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway is a vital transportation artery. During the war, it was ordered to be completely destroyed. It is now planned to be repaired urgently. The road passes through ten counties and is 300 *li* long. It was built by overseas Chinese before the war. After the destruction, it became paddy fields. Now, UNRRA engineers are planning to rebuild it using mechanical road construction methods. In addition to the cost of machinery and equipment, it still requires 2.7 billion yuan. This time, they came to Shanghai to discuss it with Director-General Chiang, and it has been planned to start construction, which will take approximately four to six months to complete.

(3) The people of Fujian Province made great contributions during the war. The coastal areas suffered severe damage. There are now 12 million people in urgent need of relief, with medicine (due to the prevalence of plague) and agricultural water conservancy equipment being the most urgent. In addition to reporting to Director-General Chiang, this trip also discussed expanding the relief work in the Zhejiang-Fujian area. Ding and Zhu are scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow and will return to Fujian in the coming days.

### Ma Lianliang Granted Bail; Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office Interrogated Him Yesterday

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 30th] Ma Lianliang was interrogated by the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office at 10:00 AM on the 30th. Ma, dressed in a costume similar to Hong Yangdong, wearing a straw hat and holding a cane, was supported by his son Chongyi into the court. Because Wang Yitang was also scheduled for a public trial on the morning of the 30th, the audience was crowded, which startled him. He took a detour to enter the court. After entering the court, Prosecutor Sun Xianxi interrogated him in detail about his performance in the puppet regime. After the interrogation, Ma repeatedly requested bail on the grounds of heart disease and was granted bail with a written guarantee of 50 million yuan and three joint guarantors, who were required to be available upon call. It is confirmed that Ma Lianliang will be "treated leniently" because a certain important person is strongly pleading on his behalf.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 30th] The major traitor Wang Yitang was originally scheduled for a public trial on the 30th. However, the court suddenly announced a postponement, and those who went to observe the trial were disappointed.

### Death Sentence for Japanese War Criminal Sakai Takashi Submitted to the Chairman for Final Decision; Chief Judge Shi Said Execution Will Be Carried Out Upon Approval

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 30th] Japanese war criminal Sakai Takashi was sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on August 27. Our reporter stationed in Suzhou visited Chief Judge Shi Meiyu, Major General, at around 2:00 PM on the 30th. Shi showed the original copy of the judgment and informed that the legal articles on which the death sentence was based were the Paris Pact, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare, the Geneva Convention, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law. It has now been submitted to Chairman Chiang for final decision. Once approved, the execution will be carried out, and it is expected that the chief demon who invaded China will be brought to justice within ten days at most. Shi continued: The Military Tribunal will expand its organization, and the chief judge will be a lieutenant general. He himself has submitted his resignation due to the heavy workload of the Suzhou High Court, but the authorities have repeatedly asked him to stay, and he may continue to hold the position. Shi solemnly told the reporter: Before Sakai Takashi was tried, the British Embassy had repeatedly requested to hand him over to the British authorities to be tried under British law as a war criminal in Hong Kong. However, he believed that Sakai Takashi was one of the main culprits in the invasion of China, and his crimes were more serious than those in Hong Kong, so he did not agree to the transfer. As a result, the British authorities provided evidence, and our Military Tribunal handled the case jointly. Therefore, Sakai Takashi is truly an international war criminal.

### Full Text of the Judgment

The original text of the judgment is copied below:

Main text Sakai Takashi participated in the war of aggression, massacred prisoners, wounded soldiers, and non-combatants, and raped, robbed, exiled civilians, abused torture, and destroyed property. He is sentenced to death.

Facts Sakai Takashi graduated from the Japanese Army University and was promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant general, being a young and promising officer in the Japanese army. Since being ordered to come to China, he has successively served as the infantry captain and chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison, commander of the 28th Infantry Brigade, attached to the headquarters of the Mongolian Garrison, chief of the Liaison Department of the Xingya Yuan in Zhangjiakou, and commander of the 23rd Army stationed in Guangdong. He has been in China for over 20 years and is familiar with China's national conditions. He, Doihara Kenji, and Umezu Yoshijiro are the main figures who came to China to implement Japan's aggressive policy. After the September 18 Incident, he instigated traitors such as Li Jichun in North China to organize plainclothes teams to disrupt Tianjin and Beiping and incited party members in the Japanese concession in Tianjin to assassinate important party and government officials. Among those assassinated were Li Mingyue, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and Zhu Xiaofu, a reporter stationed in Tianjin for Shen Bao. In February of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he again conspired to assassinate General Ma Zhanshan and former Hebei Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong in the British concession in Tianjin. In May of the same year, on the pretext of the assassination of Han traitor reporters Bai and Hu Shi , he threatened Tianjin and Beiping with artillery and air force, forcing our military and political authorities to dismiss Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and Zhang Ting , Mayor of Tianjin, to withdraw the Hebei garrison, and advocated that the five provinces of North China should secede from the central government and exercise independent political power. Later, while serving as the commander of the 23rd Army of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in South China, he ordered his subordinates Yazaki to support the puppet regime, organize the Peace Preservation Army, and increase the power of the Nanjing puppet organization in order to achieve his conspiracy to subvert our country's government. Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, he has followed the Doihara Kenji Division, serving as the commander of the 28th Infantry Brigade, and led his troops to China, landing first in Tanggu and then fighting in Xuzhou, Guangdong, and other places. He repeatedly violated international laws of war, recklessly committed atrocities, and caused countless deaths and injuries wherever his iron hoofs went.

### Local News Exemption from Owed Taxes in Counties Infested by Enemy Bandits Approved by Zhejiang Provincial Grain Office

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou News] The Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Assembly previously requested the Grain Department to ask the Ministry of Food to exempt people in counties that had been occupied or infested by enemy bandits from paying the old land tax owed before the 33rd year of the Republic of China, and to request a one-year reduction or recovery of the old debts in the rear counties. After Director Chen Yi Jinjing repeatedly requested Minister Xu , the exemption from payment was approved for counties that had been occupied or infested by enemy bandits. The old debts in the rear counties should be fully collected, but if the people cannot pay in kind, they are allowed to pay in legal tender. In addition, regarding the reduction of the land tax levy rate, the central government, mindful of the people's hardships, has approved Zhejiang Province to reduce the borrowing levy from five dou per dou to one dou, and the county-level public grain levied with it from one dou to nine sheng, so the total levy rate can be reduced to six sheng per yuan.

The handover procedures can be carried out once approved by the provincial government.

Editorial

### Reorganization of the National Government and the Veto Power

In recent days, there seems to be a glimmer of hope for peace in the Chinese political situation. The five-person committee to discuss the reorganization of the National Government is about to be formed, and government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng and Marshal Ma flew to Lushan yesterday to discuss it. Whether this glimmer of hope can open up completely depends on the sincerity of the CCP.

Since President Chiang issued the historically significant proclamation in Lushan, it has shown that although the CCP's style remains unchanged, the government, out of love for the people, still advocates that political issues should be resolved by political means. Therefore, the path of negotiation has not been cut off, and the hope for peace remains strong. At this time, the two envoys Ma and Si disregarded their old age and the sweltering heat, shuttled between Nanjing and Guling, and mediated. After several discussions, we finally saw a decision on the selection of candidates for the small committee on the reorganization of the National Government. According to reports, the task of this five-person committee is limited to discussing the reorganization of the National Government Committee and does not involve military issues or the Executive Yuan and other issues. However, it can give the people a new excitement, because if the reorganization of the National Government Committee can be completed, then all other issues can be "discussed in conference" in this policy-making body and decided calmly, without having to be decided on the battlefield. This is a cause for celebration. It is a pity that the Communist Party again claims that this move may be a smokescreen, which shows that they still may not have any sincerity.

Originally, it was the consistent expectation of the current government to reorganize the National Government so that it could include people from various parties and factions other than the Kuomintang and become the highest decision-making body. Now that there is a decision on this five-person small committee, we the people hope that an agreement can be reached on the reorganization of the National Government and that it can be implemented as soon as possible. However, according to reports, the CCP stated that the agenda of the establishment of this five-person committee should be (1) the allocation of seats on the National Government Committee, and (2) the discussion on the one-third veto power. This inevitably makes us feel regret again. Because the so-called veto power is originally a procedural issue concerning the proceedings of the National Government Committee meeting, it should be a non-issue. As long as the National Government Committee is established, the committee itself can decide, and it does not need to be recorded as a serious issue and raised. However, if the discussion of "veto power" is indeed one of the main topics of the five-person committee established this time, we would like to briefly state our views when the committee is about to be established.

First, strictly speaking, the meaning of the term "veto power" is very ambiguous. In the US Constitution, due to the influence of the doctrine of the separation of powers and checks and balances, the president, the chief executive, can "veto" a bill passed by the legislative body, Congress. This shows the spirit of the separation of powers and balance and restraint. However, if a bill "vetoed" by the president is passed again by Congress during reconsideration, then the president cannot "veto" it again. Therefore, "veto" is originally an American system, the purpose of which is to adjust the legislative and executive branches of the government. As for the members of Congress themselves, in the proceedings, there is no so-called "veto," but only "vote." The "vote" on a bill cannot be passed into law if it does not obtain the legal quorum; but this is not a "veto." The National Government Committee is the highest decision-making body, where there is only the issue of "voting" and no so-called "veto." If we talk about "veto," only when a bill passed by the Legislative Yuan violates the supreme national policy can the National Government Committee decide by "voting" whether to "veto" or not. Strictly speaking, the National Government Committee itself should not have the issue of "veto power" in its proceedings.

Second, the proposal of "veto power" aims to control the majority with the minority, which is really against the spirit of democratic politics. The use of veto power proposed at the meeting is not the original meaning of "veto" power, but an act of deliberate sabotage, which is equivalent to the so-called sabotage. Why do we say this? The majority should respect the minority, and the minority must obey the majority, which is the essence of democratic politics. The use of this "veto power" allows the minority to control the majority, so that the majority cannot but accommodate the minority. If the members of a meeting are 30, and more than one-third object, they can "veto," which means that a minority of 11 people can "veto" a majority of 19 people. If this is said to be democracy, then we will see that in the future election competitions in various democratic countries, it is not necessary to strive for the status of the majority party!

Third, the United Nations Security Council and important international conferences, such as the Paris Peace Conference, originally also had the proposal and use of "veto power." At the Paris Peace Conference, the Soviet representative proposed a one-third veto power, and the UK also proposed a compromise plan to remedy it. In the United Nations organization, the Soviet representative was also concerned about the proposal and use of "veto power." But the United Nations organization and the Paris Peace Conference are ultimately international conferences. How can their nature be compared with that of the National Government Committee as the highest decision-making body of a country? If there is the use of veto power in the highest decision-making body of a country, then everything will be restricted. As long as one-third vetoes, nothing can be decided. Not only will the country's major plans be delayed, but in fact, if this one-third veto power is recognized, it is tantamount to being on the verge of death before the birth of the baby. If it is hoped that the reorganization of the National Government can strengthen the government's power, then the result of this system will be the opposite.

Our hope is that if the National Government is reorganized, the reorganized National Government Committee must be a powerful body. We should enrich the power of the National Government Committee from a positive perspective, and we should not only think from a negative perspective and use the "veto power" to restrict the power of the National Government Committee. If the CCP is sincerely willing to participate in the government on the one hand, but insists on the provision of one-third "veto power" on the other hand, we really do not know what tricks they are playing. For the sake of the nation, we once again urge the CCP to abandon its prejudices so that the power of the National Government Committee, which may be successfully reorganized, can be free from being frozen by the existence of one-third veto power.

Commentary

### The Yihetuan and Empty Talk

— Chen Yixian

In the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty (1900), the Yihetuan (Boxers) burned churches, killed missionaries, destroyed railways and telegraph lines, and assassinated the German minister Ketteler in the Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) area. Prince Duan Zaiyi and other powerful nobles exploited them to besiege embassies, leading to the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion. The Boxer Protocol resulted in huge reparations, severely damaging the nation's vitality, and triggered the Russian occupation of the three northeastern provinces. Subsequently, disputes over troop withdrawal led to the Russo-Japanese War, and eventually the September 18th Incident, culminating in the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo—all stemming from the Yihetuan incident.

Currently, the Communist army in Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and the nine northeastern provinces is dismantling railways, digging up sleepers, blowing up railway bridges, and destroying factories. Furthermore, they have breached dikes on the Jiangsu border and in Hebei, causing unprecedented floods. In the Anping Incident, several American soldiers were killed or injured. Recently, they have been expelling and oppressing missionaries in various parts of Shandong and Shanxi, and the list goes on. A few political factions are also echoing them. Ceasefire keeps being postponed, and problems regarding road repair, troop stationing, and reorganization have long remained unresolved. If this drags on, it will inevitably lead to a prolonged civil war, and may even trigger a third world war.

The Yihetuan's slogan was "Support the Qing, Destroy the Foreign," and their belief was in the White Lotus sect. The Communist Party's slogan is "New Democracy," and their belief is in Marxism. One sought to kill all foreigners, while the other obeys the orders of a certain foreign country and excludes other foreign countries, but the result is the same: suffering for the Chinese people. The old and weak perish in the ditches, and the strong scatter in all directions, as can be seen from the refugees from northern Jiangsu in the Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Beijing, and Shanghai areas.

During the Jin Dynasty, there was a group of scholar-officials who revered Lao-Zhuang philosophy and scorned ritual propriety, spending their days engaging in "empty talk," oblivious to the state of the nation. Today, there is KMT-CCP negotiation, and negotiation among various parties. From the issuance of the ceasefire order on January 10th of this year to the present, negotiation after negotiation, talks after talks, more than half a year has passed, yet no resolution has been reached. In the Jin Dynasty, "empty talk" was accompanied by whisk waving; today's negotiations are accompanied by airplanes. The result, as of today, is that the negotiations are no different from the "empty talk" of the Jin Dynasty—mere verbiage, of no benefit to the country. Historians say that the Jin Dynasty fell due to "empty talk." Future historians may say that the demise of the Republic of China was due to negotiation!

In reality, although the Yihetuan was a reckless and violent uprising, it was limited to a few powerful nobles and ignorant commoners. In the Qing court, there were attacks from figures such as Yuan Chang and Xu Jingcheng; in the localities, there was the mutual protection of the southeastern governors. Right and wrong were clearly defined. Therefore, the Yihetuan incident could have led to national destruction but did not. The situation today is different. Within its occupied areas, the CCP vigorously implements its so-called land policy, issues its own currency, and prints its own postage stamps, acting like an independent nation. Roads are destroyed, dikes are breached, people are killed, and factories are ruined, yet the government still negotiates with them, and society has not voiced a strong opinion. The "liberated areas" and the disaster areas, internal war and internal chaos, are forever indistinguishable. The nation has lost all sense of right and wrong. The severity of the situation today is even greater than during the Yihetuan era.

Although some have blamed the "empty talk" of the Jin Dynasty for national ruin, historical examination reveals that this "empty talk," limited to figures such as He Yan and Wang Bi, fostered a decadent atmosphere. While it did not benefit the country, it also did not harm it; while it did not benefit the people, it also did not harm them. Today's negotiations are different. With each passing day of delay, millions across the country are injured or killed, millions are displaced, countless factories and railways are destroyed, and countless properties and materials are lost. Therefore, today's insincere negotiations are even more harmful to the nation and the people than the "empty talk" of the Jin Dynasty.

Currently, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have issued a joint statement warning that mediation is on the verge of failure, while Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the compatriots on the 14th, still stating that the nation's future remains bright and promising, and that no obstacle can hinder our restoration. The people are bewildered and pessimistic, yet the government still believes that the disputes can be resolved through "political means." Of course, we ordinary people are happy to listen, but how long must we wait for a resolution? I believe that for the sake of the government, the most important thing is to clarify politics, improve efficiency, and resolutely and swiftly re-examine all cases of traitors and corruption, without any indulgence or leniency. If the government can truly achieve integrity and incorruptibility in politics, then the lost hearts of the people can gradually be won back. Then, with a spirit of impartiality, implement policies that save the people from fire and water, convene the National Assembly, and promulgate the Constitution. The effect will be as Mencius said, "The people will flock to them like water flowing downwards, irresistibly." Victory is nearly a year past, I respectfully offer this to the government.

### Serious Disturbances Throughout Greece on the Eve of the Referendum; Twenty-One People Killed by Communists in Twenty-Four Hours; 100,000 Royalists Hold a Massive Demonstration

[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] On the eve of the Greek referendum, disturbances in the Greek government are becoming increasingly serious. According to an Athens report from the United Press on the 30th, in the past 24 hours, 21 people have been killed by Communists, and another 32 have been kidnapped. In the most serious incident, 400 leftists, armed with automatic weapons, attacked a police station near Gravana, killing one policeman and kidnapping six. Acting Prime Minister Gonatas has banned the broadcasting of the referendum results over loudspeakers and prohibited political gatherings.

According to a San Francisco broadcast on the 29th, order continues to deteriorate within Greece. According to a government bulletin, one person was killed, eight were injured, and 19 were arrested. Disturbances have occurred throughout the country. Minister of Public Security Leodokis stated that the government is studying methods to restore law and order.

Another report from Paris on the 30th, quoting Athens, states that terrorists under the direction of Bulgaria have repeatedly attacked Greek gendarmes, causing many deaths and injuries. Near Chalcis, a gendarmerie vehicle was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of three gendarmes and the kidnapping of two. A similar ambush occurred in Larissa, where 11 soldiers were killed. In the Macedonia region, three terrorists were killed and three were wounded, with the rest fleeing into Bulgarian territory. In the suburbs of Athens, one royalist was killed and two were injured. According to a Greek newspaper, King George of Greece will thank King Farouk of Egypt for his hospitality before returning to Athens on a British warship.

According to a Reuters report from Athens, Greek authorities banned the left-wing EAM party from holding a meeting in a theater on the night of the 29th, but at the same time, 100,000 royalists held a demonstration in Constitution Square in Athens, supporting the return of the King, and reading a message from the royalist leader, Prime Minister Tsaldaris.

### Ups and Downs in the Security Council; Soviet Union Proposes That All Countries Report on the Deployment of Troops Abroad; Mongolia's Application for Membership Rejected

[Report from United Press International, Lake Success, New York, 29th] At today's Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union made a surprising proposal that all United Nations members submit a detailed report to the Security Council within two weeks regarding the number and location of their troops stationed abroad as of August 1, excluding those stationed in the territories of former enemy states. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, made this proposal immediately after the vote on the new membership issue, disregarding the General Assembly's rules of procedure by not submitting the proposal in writing for inclusion on the agenda. Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative, was greatly angered and vehemently opposed it. The chairman, Polish representative Lange, also believed that Gromyko's proposal did not comply with the rules of procedure and declared that it need not be discussed until it was formally included on the agenda.

Gromyko's proposal called for all United Nations members to submit reports to the Security Council within two weeks on the following two matters: (1) the number and distribution of their troops stationed abroad (excluding former enemy states), and (2) the situation of naval and air bases in each area, and the scope of the defense zones. Gromyko attacked the fact that "the war has been over for a long time, but Allied troops are still stationed in the territories of other countries, and not for operational needs." He claimed that world public opinion is paying "attention to the development of such troops with undisguised concern." It is understood that this Soviet proposal involves British troops in Greece and Egypt, as well as American troops in China and Iceland.

### Membership Applications; Final Voting Results; Only Three Countries Pass

[Report from Our Newspaper's Combined Sources] The Security Council continued its meeting on the 29th to discuss the membership applications of eight countries. Heated debates ensued, lasting for eight hours. Both the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union used their veto power. In the end, only Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden were approved, while the rest were rejected. According to United Nations regulations, a country's application for membership must be approved by seven votes in the Security Council (i.e., two-thirds), and all five permanent members of the Security Council (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France) must vote in favor. The results of today's votes are as follows:

"Albania": Votes in favor: Soviet Union, Brazil, France, Mexico, Poland. Votes against: United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands. Abstentions: Australia, China, Egypt. "Outer Mongolia": Votes in favor: Soviet Union, Brazil, Mexico, China, France, Poland. Votes against: United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands. "Afghanistan": All voted in favor except Australia, which did not vote. "Transjordan": Eight countries voted in favor, but the Soviet Union and Poland voted against. "Southern Ireland": Nine countries voted in favor, the Soviet Union exercised its veto power, and Australia did not vote. "Portugal": Eight countries voted in favor, the Soviet Union and Poland voted against, and Australia abstained. "Iceland": All voted in favor, except Australia, which abstained. "Sweden": All voted in favor, except Australia, which abstained.

Australia's representative did not vote this time, abstaining in all cases, because he argued that the application process should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly first, and then transferred to the Security Council for comments.

### Results of the Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting; Agreed on Procedures for Handling Treaties and Amendments; Unagreed Portions Can Be Voted on Freely

[Report from United Press International, Paris, 29th] At the first meeting of the four foreign ministers since the opening of the Paris Peace Conference, procedures were agreed upon on the 29th for handling draft treaties and approximately 300 amendments in the various committees of the conference. According to the French side, the four foreign ministers reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining the agreed-upon portions of the drafts, opposing amendments from the seventeen nations, but at the same time agreed to examine all amendments and support those that are mutually acceptable in the committees. Regarding amendments that the four powers cannot accept, the foreign ministers have the right to vote against their passage.

The foreign ministers' meeting also discussed Foreign Minister Molotov's request to postpone the United Nations General Assembly until the end of December or early January of next year, but no agreement was reached. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin opposed this proposal, saying that the United Nations General Assembly could convene as scheduled on September 23.

The foreign ministers' meeting drafted a joint statement regarding the resolution on handling amendments, which also stipulated that the four powers could freely vote on portions of the treaty on which they had not yet agreed. The foreign ministers' meeting instructed the representatives of the four countries to begin reviewing the amendments proposed by the other seventeen countries this Friday, in accordance with the joint statement. The meeting was then adjourned and is expected to reconvene next Monday.

### Soviet Military Exercises Demonstrate on the Periphery of the American Occupation Zone in Germany; American Planes Also Fly Patrols in the Soviet Defense Zone; Soviet Spy Network Cracked, Many Germans Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] London broadcast on the 30th: Today, the Red Army in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria held military exercises along the border between the American and Soviet occupation zones on the opposite bank of the Danube River in Linz.

[Report from Our Newspaper] London broadcast on the 30th: According to a senior American intelligence official tonight, a large-scale underground secret movement directed by the Soviet Union has now been discovered in Germany, and its area of activity seems to be in western Germany.

[Report from Reuters, London, 29th] Frankfurt Radio broadcast tonight: The headquarters of the U.S. Military Police Corps announced that a Soviet spy network has been cracked in Stuttgart, Germany, and fifteen Germans have been arrested. After nine months of investigation, American counterintelligence personnel discovered the entire operation of the German spies with the help of a tape recorder.

### Soviet Representative Speaks at the Peace Conference Plenary Session, Opposing the Continued Stationing of British Troops in Greece; Greek-Albanian Dispute to Be Discussed at the Next General Assembly; Iranian Representative Attended Yesterday to State His Views

[Report from Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The Peace Conference held a plenary session today, chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie. First, the proposal by the Iranian government to request to present its views to the conference was discussed and unanimously approved without objection. The Iranian representative then recounted the country's contributions to the country's claims. Then, the proposal by Greece to include the Greek-Albanian border dispute in the Peace Conference agenda was discussed. Soviet Representative Molotov took the lead in opposing it, strongly criticizing the current Greek regime as a regime of terror and arguing that the continued stationing of British troops in Greece would lead to permanent chaos in the Balkans. Molotov said that Greece wanted to restore the monarchy under the guise of a referendum and disrupt the security of the Balkans. Ukraine has filed a complaint with the Security Council, and now Greece wants to divert attention and create a smokescreen at the Peace Conference. The Soviet delegation refused to use the Peace Conference as a cover for the regime of terror and refused to allow British troops to remain in Greece, causing permanent chaos in the Balkans. He asked the conference to reject the Greek proposal and asked the Greek representatives to adopt ordinary diplomatic methods to resolve their dispute with Albania. Yugoslav Representative Bijat also opposed the Greek proposal, saying that the conference should not assist the Greek government in carrying out an election campaign. The Greek government is pursuing an imperialist policy, taking an inch and wanting a mile, and will eventually make territorial demands on Yugoslavia.

[Report from United Press International, Paris, 30th] After four hours of debate, the Peace Conference voted to include the Greek-Albanian border dispute on the agenda for the next meeting.

### Severe Grain Shortage: Special Dispatch from Our Tokyo Correspondent, 28th

How to solve the grain shortage is currently the central topic of Japan's economic problems. Production difficulties and increased crime are all caused by the food shortage. According to a survey by the House of Representatives' Food Countermeasures Committee, crimes related to food account for 76% of all cases investigated nationwide. Due to the food shortage, there has been a tendency for labor force reduction in some production sectors. According to a report in the Mainichi Shimbun on August 21, frequent labor disputes in various textile factories due to the deteriorating food situation have greatly reduced productivity. Japan's food supply has never been self-sufficient in normal times, relying heavily on imports from Taiwan and Korea. From Showa 8 to Showa 12 (1935), the annual imports from Taiwan and Korea were 12.83 million koku (6.6 koku equals one ton). After Showa 14, Korea experienced a drought, and the consumption of rice in Korea and Taiwan themselves greatly increased after the Sino-Japanese War. The amount exported to Japan sharply decreased to 6 million koku in Showa 18. Before the Pacific War, 8 to 10 million koku of foreign rice were imported from Vietnam, Siam, and Burma. However, after the Pacific War, the number of Japanese ships decreased, and the import of foreign rice was almost completely cut off. Therefore, Japan had to rely on the import of miscellaneous grains from Manchuria, but this also gradually decreased due to insufficient ships and the unfavorable war situation. Therefore, Japan had to make wheat and potatoes the main food source in addition to rice, the main staple, while also increasing the consumption of early rice. At the same time, the supply of eggs also decreased sharply. Therefore, from Showa 16 onwards, a quantitative distribution was implemented for general consumers, while restricting the use of rice for sake production. At the time of implementing grain distribution, only 2.3 go (合勺, a Japanese unit of volume) were allotted. After Showa 17, miscellaneous grains were mixed in, and in July Showa [unclear character, likely 19], the ration was reduced by another 10%. The current ration in Tokyo is only 2.1 go. The food problem was most serious in April, May, and June of this year, with almost no rations distributed. Fortunately, General MacArthur imported a large amount of flour and canned goods from the United States and distributed them to the Japanese people, which slightly alleviated the grain shortage. However, whether Japan will still be threatened by a grain shortage in 1947 is still the most concerning issue for the Japanese people. This year, due to the higher temperature, the expected rice production is higher than in previous years, but the artificial assistance is still insufficient. Furthermore, due to typhoons and floods, the rice production for this year (1947) is expected to be 55 million koku. This figure is still far from the actual needs, and miscellaneous grains must be used. Last April, the national population survey in Japan was 74 million. If the number of repatriated Japanese is added, the total population will reach 78.2 million. If the annual rice production is 68.2 million koku, then the per capita ration will be 0.91 koku per year, and the daily ration will be 0.0025 koku (2.5 go). This ration is still 20% less than the pre-war average consumption of 1.1 koku per person, and this ration also includes potatoes, which have a lower caloric value. Under these circumstances, the Japanese food supply will still be insufficient without foreign rice imports. Considering the current starvation-level rations, the general Japanese people cannot maintain a certain amount of calories. Urban residents must go to the countryside to buy food, creating a black market and promoting the rise in food prices. This not only affects the production of important products, but also causes wages to fluctuate with the rise in food prices, which only adds fuel to the fire of inflation. The currently distributed portion only accounts for 30% of the total food holdings. 70% of Japan's food sources depend on the black market. In cities, ordinary people sell furniture, clothing, and all daily necessities in exchange for food, creating an informal economic boom in rural areas, where agricultural product prices are higher than industrial products; in other words, higher than the prices of daily necessities. This is due to the poor current ration system and the unfairness of the farmers' rice delivery system. Of course, the only way to solve the grain shortage is to expand the cultivated area. Japan has a large amount of land suitable for cultivation that has not yet been reclaimed. However, according to the opinions of scholars' several inspections, it would take 65 years to convert all this land into cultivated land. Japan's agricultural production capacity has not reached the world's production level, and a large amount of fertilizer is needed. The amount of harvest obtained from one day's labor per person is only one to (斗, a Chinese unit of volume) of wheat (Japanese to), while American farmers can obtain this amount in a few minutes. Therefore, in addition to expanding the cultivated area, the method to solve Japan's grain shortage is to improve agricultural production capacity, but these methods are not easy tasks. At present, the only way is to rely on foreign imports. Even livestock feed cannot be self-sufficient and must rely on imports. The American side believes that the world grain shortage can be overcome, and Japan can import more food from abroad, advocating increasing silk production to export abroad in exchange for food. Lieutenant Colonel Bwal, head of the Production Group of the MacArthur Resources Department, made a speech at the Nagoya Silk Industry Association, advocating this view. In summary, although Japan's food problem has not been fundamentally solved, it has been eased compared to before due to American aid and the good harvest this year. The harvesting of early rice has already started. It is reported that the harvest in Yamagata Prefecture, a northern production area, has doubled compared to last year. Agriculture and Forestry Minister Wada stated at the House of Representatives' Food Measures Law Committee on the 21st that the current ration will be appropriately increased after the new rice comes on the market in November this year. The Food Management National Federation has requested that the current ration be increased to 2.8 go. The black market price has also gradually decreased recently. Therefore, the general conclusion is that the Japanese people can overcome the current food crisis.

### Feng Yuxiang and his Wife Deliver Speeches One After Another at the Women's Circle Farewell Party, Politeness Brings Laughter Throughout the Audience

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Women's Circle held a farewell party yesterday for Feng Yuxiang and his wife at the YMCA. Deng Yingchao, the chairwoman, introduced Feng, saying that the success of Yu the Great in controlling the floods was due to his ability to understand the nature of the water. He then used the method of water control to govern, achieving great success. Feng has always been able to understand the people's opinions, and if he uses this to investigate water conservancy, he will surely achieve the same success as Yu the Great. She then invited Feng to speak, but unexpectedly, Feng smiled and insisted that Mrs. Feng speak first. The two humbly yielded to each other for a long time, causing laughter throughout the audience. As a result, the chairwoman said, "Today is a gathering of women, so we respect men, so please Mr. Feng speak first." Feng then began by saying that he was very happy to come to Shanghai this time. Recalling the Battle of Shanghai, which began on August 13th, he was ordered in Nanjing on August 14th to be the commander of the Third War Zone, which was responsible for directing the fighting in Shanghai. On August 15th, he set up a headquarters on a mountain near Suzhou, and on August 16th, he went to the front to discuss strategy with senior generals. At that time, gentlemen such as Zhang Yili and Li Genyuan from Shanghai came to the front to comfort the troops. The generals gathered included Zhang Fakui, Zhang Zhizhong, Yang Hu, Chen Cheng, and Gu Zhutong. The war situation was extremely tragic. Often, three divisions would go up, and only two or three hundred people would come down, and they would be limping and missing arms. Although I dare not say "we fought well," when our army died two or thirty men, the Japanese army would also die two or three men. Millions of soldiers have exchanged for hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers. I am mentioning this battle now because I feel very sorry for the people of Shanghai, for the elders, brothers, and sisters of Shanghai, because our army ultimately had to retreat, abandoning the people of Shanghai behind us, resulting in them being subjected to the trampling of the Japanese. Thinking of this today, I still feel ashamed of my duty and deeply guilty. During the eight years, fortunately, with the assistance of the Allied countries, we achieved victory. Today, I have come back and first want to confess my sins to the people and ask for their forgiveness. This time, I was ordered to investigate water conservancy, which I find very pleasant, because if water conservancy is done well, everyone will have work to do, and everything will be solved. As for my position, it is very [unclear character] clear. On November 1st, I was invited by President Chiang to Nanjing. Old friends such as Zhan Liming came to greet me and told me that there was a major news story that day, which was that Wang Jingwei was shot three times at the [unclear characters] Central Committee meeting that afternoon. My position has always been to stand on the position of the Three Principles of the People during the War of Resistance, unite all parties and factions, support the government, support President Chiang, and resolutely resist the war. After the victory, I still hold the same position, uniting all parties and factions, supporting the government, supporting President Chiang, and working hard to build the country. I only wish for peace in the country and do not desire to be promoted or get rich. Then, Mrs. Feng spoke, briefly describing her experience of leaving Shanghai in August, going to Beiping, then to Xi'an, and then returning to Shanghai. She expressed great respect for the principal of Peiman Girls' High School for being loyal to the country and engaging in education during the enemy-puppet period, and was also very concerned about the establishment of nurseries in Nanjing and Shanghai.

### Puppet Nanjing Mayor Zhou Xuechang Conceals Assets, Exposed

His Estranged Wife Requests a Reward, Petitions Investigation Team to Conduct Investigation

[Our Newspaper] Zhou Xuechang, the puppet mayor of Nanjing, was arrested in Nanjing after the victory. His first wife, Yan Zhonglu, recently submitted a document to the investigation team, accusing Zhou of concealing assets under an assumed name. It roughly stated: On July 14th and August 5th of this year, she had successively petitioned the First Inspection Team of the Control Yuan to forward a request to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to seal off the hidden traitorous assets and legally apply for a reward. She also recounted that after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, she followed Zhou to Sichuan. In 1940, Zhou secretly went to the puppet capital, betraying the party and the country, which she deeply resented. She published a notice in the newspaper to sever their marital relationship. For six years, she supported herself through labor, raising three sons and two daughters, striving for an independent personality to redeem the shame of her family. This time, she came to Shanghai from Sichuan to complete the legal formalities. Zhou had attempted to bribe her with hidden assets, but she refused to accept and filed for divorce in court in mid-June in accordance with the law. She further claimed that Zhou, under an alias, concealed a large number of properties scattered in Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. After a clear investigation, she requested the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to legally seal and confiscate them, and requested a prompt reward to maintain her livelihood. It is now learned that the investigation team will request the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to review the files and conduct an investigation, and plans to summon Yan Zhonglu to the team for questioning. If the evidence is conclusive, it will be handled swiftly in accordance with the law.

It is heard that the authorities are considering this matter. However, at a time when the government is striving to suppress and stabilize prices, it may be difficult to implement in the short term.

#### Fundraising Nature

This performance is jointly organized by the Sports Institute and the Hunan Disaster Relief Committee, with the help of the Youth Swimming Team. It is entirely of a fundraising nature, so the free tickets issued by the Sports Institute are not valid. Admission is only allowed with a badge and a 10,000 yuan ticket. Even the athletes participating in the performance, or if they bring direct relatives, must purchase tickets. In addition to dispatching large trucks to transport athletes between the Sichuan Road Youth Association and the swimming pool at the specified times (a truck from the Sichuan Road Youth Association departs at 1:00 PM), there will be no splitting of ticket fees, nor any subsidies. Only an elegant commemorative badge will be given as a spiritual reward. This plan was unanimously passed and enthusiastically supported at the New Life Club the night before last. Therefore, the athletes not only have no personal gain, but also have to pay for their own transportation. In addition to donating manpower, water, electricity, and chemical supplies, the Sports Institute will donate all of its regular income for both days to the Hunan disaster relief.

#### Ticket Sales Situation

A total of 4,000 tickets were printed, 2,000 each day, more than double the original plan. Because many benevolent people who bought tickets may not all go to the pool to watch, as of yesterday, ticket sales have been very enthusiastic. Mrs. He is taking the bus every day to promote sales, which is the most effective. The remaining tickets that can be sold at the door are only a few hundred each day. If all 2,000 people come to the swimming pool, it will definitely feel crowded. If this happens, please understand.

### Discussion on Problems in Improving Shanghai Secondary Education (Part 1)

Xie En

Shanghai's secondary schools are progressing in terms of quantity, but compared to the speed of quantitative progress, the quality seems to be lagging behind. Secondary education has its special mission, and if it fails to fulfill its function and exert its effectiveness, even high-speed development will be in vain. If we don't talk about improving secondary education, that's fine, but if we do, I think we shouldn't only seek expansion in terms of quantity. Improving quality and promoting effectiveness should be given special attention.

According to the statistics of Shanghai secondary schools in the second semester of 1945, there were 19 public secondary schools and 207 private secondary schools (more in the previous semester). The number of public secondary schools accounts for less than 10% of the number of private secondary schools. In terms of grades, public secondary schools have a total of 208 senior and junior high school grades, while private secondary schools have a total of 1,355 senior and junior high school grades. The number of grades in public secondary schools accounts for only about 15% of the number of grades in private secondary schools. In terms of students, public secondary schools have a total of 7,845 senior and junior high school students, while private secondary schools have a total of 61,248 senior and junior high school students. The number of students in public secondary schools accounts for less than 13% of the number of students in private secondary schools. Judging from the history and performance of the schools, private secondary schools such as Biwen Girls' Middle School and Qingxin Middle School have been established for more than 90 years, and no public secondary school has surpassed them. As for performance, although there are no accurate figures for comparison between public and private secondary schools, the special and outstanding talents achieved by private secondary schools over the years are often above those of public secondary schools, which is also a common fact we see. Based on this, the center of gravity of Shanghai's secondary education is obviously on the private schools. Why private secondary schools have formed such a development in Shanghai, there are certainly more than one reason, but this issue is not within the scope of this article, so I will not discuss it for the time being. However, although private secondary schools occupy an important position, a detailed examination of their quality reveals that they are extremely uneven, and there seems to be much room for improvement. Now that we are talking about improving Shanghai's secondary education, it is not easy to achieve the goal if we only know how to focus our efforts on public secondary schools and do not provide real support and practical guidance to the absolutely majority of private secondary schools, adjust their steps, standardize their facilities, assist their material construction, and improve the level of their teachers. In other words, education has no public or private distinction. The difference between public and private schools is only the source of funding is slightly different. They are both responsible for training useful young people for the country and society. The country and society cannot treat young people differently, and the country and society should naturally not discriminate against the secondary education that young people receive. Education is holistic, and youth education is also indivisible. When the government does not have the power and it is not necessary to take over all private secondary schools, it seems that it should concentrate its efforts on supporting and enriching private secondary schools, which is the most urgent task to improve today's secondary education, allowing it in Shanghai where private secondary schools have reached an extreme degree of development. My meaning is that, unless there is a special need, it seems that it is not necessary to add a large number of public secondary schools for the time being. The already-run public secondary schools must first enrich their content, improve their quality, and make them models for secondary education, just like the central national schools in national education, and earnestly undertake the work of demonstrating, connecting, researching, and guiding private secondary schools. If there is an increase in secondary education funding in the future, since no new public secondary schools will be created, it can be transferred to subsidize the development of private secondary schools, so that all private secondary schools can reach the standard on the horizontal line in terms of material equipment or educational effectiveness. It is the most economical and most effective way to use the funds to run a public secondary school to improve the facilities of several private secondary schools.

More than 20 people attended, including Yao Mulian, Lu Yinggeng, Zhu Liangcai, Yao Baozhen, Yuan Rongbiao, and Fan Xipin. At that time, the fundraising methods and the problems of improving education in the district were discussed in detail. Lu Yinggeng and Yuan Rongbiao expressed their opinions extensively and strongly advocated that everyone should raise as much as possible according to their ability in order to develop education in the district. Finally, in order to ensure that the planned addition of one central school and five Bao people's schools in the current semester can be opened as scheduled, each attendee readily determined the amount of donations they were responsible for in the first phase and required that they all be handed over to the management committee by the end of this month so that they can be used in advance. As for the remaining donations, it was decided to raise the full amount in mid-September before taking action to disburse it.

### Shuangma 1.4 Million, Factories Ship Goods in Red-Hot Market, Approved Six Thousand Hundreds of Pieces, Spinning and Construction Listing Yesterday Still Maintained Original Price

[Our Newspaper] The centralized fair-price distribution of yarn from private cotton mills, which has been clamoring for a long time, started yesterday evening with a red-hot market of 1.4 million for Shuangma standard. Other brands were reduced according to grade. The factory numbers and customer groups applied to the yarn mills and were approved for distribution by the association, reaching a huge number of six thousand hundreds of pieces. The Guangbang consumption was still not weak. Before the market opened, the atmosphere in the yarn market was muddled all day. When it opened in the evening, there was no significant stimulation. Because Spinning and Construction also opened yarn yesterday, the listing did not move. And the former Shuangma factory price had already reached more than 1.3 million. Although the black market had reached as high as 1.67 million, many knowledgeable people in the industry predicted that this fair price would not exceed 1.4 million. The opening of the market was decided under the agreement of the committee jointly formed by the representatives of the private yarn mills at the Spinning and Construction Ministry of Economic Affairs Special Commissioner's Office. The measures were quite thorough. However, the goods are futures, and the packaging is new packaging of 400 pounds. The practical factories and actual sales customers ultimately feel unsatisfied. Yesterday, some yarn mills stopped collecting orders in advance, which shows that the yarn mills have sacrifices to make. Wu Weijing, the person in charge of Spinning and Construction, expressed his determination to arouse sympathy and hoped that the factory numbers and customer groups who received the distribution could cooperate. He also said that the amount of goods distributed would not be forced and limited, but the time of delivery would depend on the actual situation of each factory. The implication is that there is still "flexibility." According to observers, if there is no concrete method for the regular distribution of futures, the number of applicants will decrease when the second batch of goods is distributed, and those who open goods to Spinning and Construction will still be crowded. Other factories such as Chongxin's Dafa and Tongyi's Golden Rooster are said to be set at 1.4 million, the same as Shuangma. As for Shenxin No. 1 Factory's Red Bell, it is 1.36 million, No. 2 Factory's Heavenly Girl Scattering Flowers is 1.34 million, and No. 6 Factory's Double Happiness is 1.32 million. The factory numbers and customer groups are applying, and today they should be able to open and distribute according to this.

### Situation Suddenly Changed Before Closing, All Chinese Stocks Show High Prices

Chinese stocks were suppressed by hot money entering and cold money exiting, and the money market was not loose. From high to low, those who made profits at high prices settled. People's hearts are not easy to be optimistic. In the middle of the session, the stocks showed low prices. Yongsao saw 643 yuan, Meiya 3,650 yuan, Jingfu 225 yuan, Xinguang 255 yuan, and Qinxing 170 yuan. However, the cold stocks were unusually firm, so miscellaneous firms and floating funds absorbed small stocks and first added fuel. The popular large stocks showed a consolidation after falling. Near the close, there was a sudden buying trend within ten minutes. Large investors rushed to turn around, and high prices reappeared near noon. Yongsao reached 673 yuan, Meiya 4,050 yuan, Jingfu 253 yuan, Xinguang 285 yuan, and Qinxing 205 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsao rose slightly, and Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by more than half a percent, while Xinguang rose by 10%. The other less popular small and medium-sized stocks rose slightly by about half a percent. The veteran stocks also rose slightly.

In foreign stocks, except for Zeng Defeng, which was still being absorbed by wealthy large investors, and Xiangtai Lumber, which continued to be bought up, the rest were slightly suppressed by the tight money market and slightly blocked, and showed a slight pullback. Yisao retreated from 9,300 yuan to 8,700 yuan, and British Federation retreated from 10,000 yuan to 9,700 yuan, but the result still rose to 10,200 yuan. There was a major spin near the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisao, British Federation, and Steel Asia all fell slightly, while Yipi and Guangping were flat. Zeng Defeng Paper rose slightly, and Xiangtai Lumber was pushed up to 13,000 yuan.

### Gold and Currency Mediocre

### The Street Vendors' "Last Day": The Setting Sun is Infinitely Beautiful, But It's Only Near Dusk

[Our Special Report] Today is the last day for street vendors. From tomorrow onwards, the American goods street vendors, which were originally visible everywhere on the streets and roadsides, will no longer exist. The housewives of Shanghai have always been sensitive, and this time was no exception. As soon as they heard the mayor said he was determined to crack down on street vendors, they feared that they would no longer be able to buy cheap foreign goods in the future, and rushed to purchase in large quantities—on the contrary, making the street vendors' business show its final splendor.

Yesterday morning, at Zhu Bao San Road, one of the largest concentration points of American goods street vendors, people gradually became more numerous starting at nine o'clock. The short section of the road was like an open-air department store, and also like people from the countryside attending a temple fair. On the sidewalks on both sides of the road were densely packed with mobile glass display cases of various sizes, most of which were still equipped with large parasols providing shade. The road was even more crowded, with shoulder-to-shoulder buyers. The entire Zhu Bao San Road was jam-packed.

The goods here were also really plentiful, all radiating dazzling brilliance. Military canned foods were the most numerous. In the glass displays, if you wanted to buy something to eat, there were canned tomato soup, beef consommé, large cans of cheese, small cans of coffee extract, orange juice, and grape juice. If you wanted to buy some daily necessities, there were even more, from clothing, glass leather bags, glass wallets, glass cigarette cases, etc., to military blankets and leather shoes, truly deserving the description of "everything you need." Among them, there was even one stall selling woolen fabric, suggesting that he had a considerable amount of capital.

The most popular were probably canned goods and cosmetics. A young man once bought fifteen cans of tomato soup in one go. The stallholder replied, "There are no more, that's all there are here." Cosmetics also had the largest clientele, with most beauty-loving ladies buying a little bit. One woman was carrying a large travel bag, filled with Colgate toothpaste, Squibb toothpaste, face powder, etc. At the same time, she was still buying a dozen small white bottles of Pond's Cold Cream. The trade in glass leather bags was also not bad, and a certain red actress had also made a special trip to come here. Some students were buying Parker 51 fountain pens, which were still relatively cheap at a price of 70,000 yuan per piece.

The American goods street vendor market throughout the city was not limited to Zhu Bao San Road alone. Presumably, the areas around Liuhe Road, Tianzhutang Street, Henan Road, and Tianjin Road were also similarly crowded with hordes of buyers. However, after today, this last day, what will happen to them? Some vendors said, "We are changing careers, and will continue to sell these goods until they are all sold out." However, some still harbored a lucky illusion, saying, "They are still petitioning." But the vast majority have clearly understood this final helpless situation and are doing their best to "dispose of goods for cash." Just wait for tomorrow, when the mayor's determination to crack down on street vendors will be like a large broom, sweeping away these markets that dump American smuggled goods and obstruct traffic.
